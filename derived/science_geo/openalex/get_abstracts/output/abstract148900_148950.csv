https://openalex.org/W2019146941,"Osteoclast progenitors differentiate into mature osteoclasts in the presence of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand on stromal or osteoblastic cells and monocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The soluble RANK ligand induces the same differentiation in vitro without stromal cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a potent cytokine involved in the regulation of osteoclast activity, promotes bone resorption via a primary effect on osteoblasts; however, it remains unclear whether TNF-α can also directly induce the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors into mature osteoclasts. This study revealed that TNF-α directly induced the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs), which produced resorption pits on bone in vitro in the presence of M-CSF. The bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs was lower than that of soluble RANK ligand-induced MNCs; however, interleukin-1β stimulated this activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs without an increase in the number of MNCs. In this case, interleukin-1β did not induce TRAP-positive MNC formation. The osteoclast progenitors expressed TNF receptors, p55 and p75; and the induction of TRAP-positive MNCs by TNF-α was inhibited completely by an anti-p55 antibody and partially by an anti-p75 antibody. Our findings presented here are the first to indicate that TNF-α is a crucial differentiation factor for osteoclasts. Our results suggest that TNF-α and M-CSF play an important role in local osteolysis in chronic inflammatory diseases.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 175Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),1 which is a member of the TNF ligand superfamily and a multifunctional cytokine, regulates various cellular reactions such as proliferation, differentiation, maintenance of a differentiated phenotype, and apoptosis in various types of cells (6.Old L.J.

Sabatini M. Immunol. Ser. 1992; 56: 483-498PubMed Google Scholar);e.g. TNF-α inhibits DNA and collagen synthesis and osteocalcin gene expression in osteoblasts, but then it stimulates the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes such as plasminogen activators and matrix metalloproteinases and of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and monocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in these cells (9.Nanes M.S.

TNF-α is also a potent inducer of bone resorption (18.Bertolini D.R. Nedwin G.E. Bringman T.S. Smith D.D. Mundy G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), which is a major action of activated macrophages (1.Scheven B.A. Visser J.W. Nijweide P.J. Nature. 1986; 321: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been reported that TNF-α promotes bone resorption in vitro and in vivo by activating mature osteoclasts (19.Kitazawa R.

Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, aseptic loosening, and periodontal diseases have been associated with the accumulation of TNF-α and/or other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6, which likely mediate local bone destruction by stimulating osteoclast activity (24.Saxne T.

Most factors known to stimulate osteoclast formation (such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and prostaglandins) bind to receptors on stromal cells/osteoblastic cells rather than binding to receptors on osteoclast progenitors to induce the release of osteoclast-stimulating factors (28.Boyce B.F. Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Xing L. Dai A. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 83-94PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that two essential factors supplied by stromal cells/osteoblastic cells for the differentiation and maturation of osteoclast progenitors are M-CSF and RANK ligand (RANKL) (29.Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In the presence of M-CSF, a genetically engineered soluble form of RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation of progenitors derived from mouse bone marrow cells, spleen cells, or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of stromal cells/osteoblastic cells (30.Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggesting that RANKL and M-CSF induce osteoclast formation by direct activation of osteoclast progenitors. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) ligand (RANKL)-deficient mice exhibit typical osteopetrosis with total occupation of the bone marrow space within endosteal bone (32.Kong Y.-Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.-L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Van G. Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar), demonstrating that RANKL is essential for osteoclast development. However, recently it has been shown that several inflammatory cytokines induce multinucleation of preosteoclasts and/or commitment to the osteoclast lineage in the absence of stromal cells/osteoblastic cells. IL-1 induced multinucleation of mononuclear prefusion osteoclasts and bone resorption activity in the absence of stromal cells/osteoblastic cells (33.Jimi E. Nakamura I. Duong L.T. Ikebe T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). IL-15 increased the number of mononuclear preosteoclast-like cells (34.Ogata Y. Kukita A. Kukita T. Komine M. Miyahara A. Miyazaki S. Kohashi O. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2754-2760PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide induced c-src mRNA expression in purified bone marrow macrophages, which is a specific marker of commitment to the osteoclast lineage (35.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the direct actions of several cytokines on osteoclast progenitors contribute to osteoclast formation. Especially in some pathological conditions involving articular subchondral bones and/or synovial tissues as in rheumatoid arthritis patients and in the tissue surrounding failed implants in patients who received total joint replacement, several cytokines reacting to osteoclast progenitors may be involved in local osteolysis (24.Saxne T.

Here we show a novel activity for TNF-α, i.e. induction of osteoclastogenesis by a direct action on osteoclast progenitors, which action is mediated mainly by the p55 TNF receptor. We thus report for the first time that TNF-α is a crucial differentiation factor for osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF. Male ddY mice, 6–9 weeks of age, were used (Sankyo Laboratories Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant products of mouse TNF-α, mouse IL-1β, human soluble RANKL (sRANKL), and human M-CSF were purchased from Pepro-Tech EC Ltd. (London, U. K.). Recombinant mouse OPG-Fc chimera was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Monoclonal hamster antibodies against mouse TNF receptors p55 and p75 and a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse IL-1 receptor type I were purchased from Genzyme Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin and anti-rat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and Cappel (Durham, NC), respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan) unless otherwise stated. The femurs and tibias of adult ddY mice were aseptically removed, and adherent soft tissues were dissected away. The bone ends were cut off with scissors, and the marrow cavity was flushed with α-MEM (ICN Biochemical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The marrow cells were collected, washed with α-MEM, and cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 100 IU/ml penicillin G (Meiji Chemical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Meiji Chemical Co. Ltd.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The mouse M-CSF was supplied from the culture supernatant of a selected high M-CSF-producing cell line, CMG14-12, 2S. Takeshita, K. Kaji, and A. Kudo, submitted for publication. or recombinant human M-CSF was used as a source of M-CSF. Osteoclastogenic cultures were obtained by use of two different protocols. Whole bone marrow cells were plated in a 48-well plate at a density of 1.5 × 105cells/cm2 and were maintained for 5 days in the presence of a 0.10 volume of CMG14-12 culture supernatant (final concentration, approximately 35,000 units/ml M-CSF). Whole bone marrow cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and a 0.10 volume of CMG14-12 culture supernatant at 5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm suspension culture dish (Corning Costar Inc., Corning, NY). After 3 days in culture, the cells were washed, harvested with 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, and seeded at 3 × 105cells into another 10-cm suspension culture dish. After a further 3 days in culture, the cells were harvested, plated at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2, and maintained for 5 days in the presence of a 0.10 volume of CMG14-12 culture supernatant or recombinant human M-CSF (100 ng/ml). We evaluated the expression of surface molecules on MDBM cells by flow cytometry. MDBM cells expressed CD9, FcγRII/III, c-Fms, Mac-1, Mac-2, F4/80, β1-integrin, β2-integrin, β3-integrin, and CD98. Because all positive signals were uniform, MDBM cells are likely to be a homogeneous population in contrast to bone marrow cells. 2S. Takeshita, K. Kaji, and A. Kudo, submitted for publication. Cultured cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 5 min. After that they were re-fixed with ethanol:cetone (50:50 v/v) for 1 min and incubated in acetate buffer (pH 4.8) containing naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), fast red violet LB salt (Sigma), and 50 mm sodium tartrate at room temperature (36.Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). F-actin fibers were detected by staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin solution (Wako Pure Chemicals, Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). After incubation with the staining solution, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then mounted with Permaflor (Lipshaw Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) as described by Kanehisa et al. (37.Kanehisa J. Yamanaka T. Doi S. Turksen K. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E. Takeuchi H. Bone. 1990; 11: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were characterized further by assessing their ability to form resorption pits on dentin slices, as described previously (38.Tamura T. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the slices were cleaned by ultrasonication in 70% ethanol, and each slice was then placed into 48-well or 96-well plates (Corning Costar). MDBM cells (1 × 104 cells/well) in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum were added into each well and incubated for different periods at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2in air. The slices were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (39.Kitamura K. Katoh M. Komiyama O. Kitagawa H. Matsubara F. Kumegawa M. Bone. 1993; 14: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The number of resorption lacunae (pits) on each slice was counted under a light microscope. To estimate the efficiency of bone resorption activity further, we performed a calcium resorption assay using calcium phosphate-coated osteologic discs (Millenium Biologix, Ontario, Canada) (40.Davis J.E. Shapiro G. Lowenberg B.F. Cells Materials. 1993; 3: 245-256Google Scholar). MDBM cells (2.5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded onto the discs in 16-well plates (each well size was equivalent to that of typical 96-well plates). Each well was filled with 0.15 ml of α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The MDBM cells were incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, after which the discs were examined by phase-contrast microscopy. These discs were washed in a solution of 6% NaClO and 5.2% NaCl for removal of the cells to observe the resorption pits more clearly. The number or area of resorption lacunae (pits) on each slice was measured under a light microscope. Cells were harvested and stained with biotin-labeled anti-TNF receptor monoclonal antibodies or anti-IL-1 receptor type I antibody. The stained cells were incubated further with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin or goat anti-rat IgG and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur instruments and software, Becton Deckinson Inc., San Jose, CA). To search for the dominant cytokines involved in local bone destruction, we examined the effects of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α on osteoclast differentiation using the newly established osteoclast progenitors (MDBM cells) described under “Experimental Procedures” as well as bone marrow cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, TNF-α strongly induced differentiation of MDBM cells into mature osteoclasts, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) in the presence of M-CSF. The number of MNCs formed was 473 ± 75 in the presence of TNF-α and M-CSF, whereas it was 842 ± 64 in the presence of sRANKL and M-CSF. However, no TRAP-positive MNCs were formed in the MDBM cell cultures treated with 50 ng/ml of IL-1β even in the presence of M-CSF. Additionally, IL-1β had no synergistic effect on MNC formation induced by TNF-α and M-CSF. The results demonstrate that TNF-α can induce the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs, though not to the extent found with sRANKL. Furthermore, TRAP-positive MNCs were also formed from bone marrow cells treated with TNF-α or sRANKL, but not when treated with IL-1β, in the presence of M-CSF (Fig. 1 B). The efficiency of induction of TRAP-positive MNCs by TNF-α was significantly lower in the bone marrow cell cultures than in the MDBM cell cultures even though the cell density in the former was 10-fold higher than that in the latter, although the efficiency of that by sRANKL was almost the same in both types of cultures. To examine the reason for the difference in efficiency of induction of TRAP-positive MNCs by TNF-α between the two culture systems, we investigated the effects of pretreatment with M-CSF. Pretreatment with M-CSF for 24 h markedly increased the number of TRAP-positive MNCs in the bone marrow cell cultures (TableI). In contrast, the efficiency of sRANKL-induced TRAP-positive MNC formation in the bone marrow cell cultures was not affected by this pretreatment (Table I). These results demonstrate that M-CSF has an important role in osteoclastogenesis induced by TNF-α.Table IEffects of M-CSF pretreatment on the TNF-α-induced TRAP-positive MNC formation in the bone marrow cell culturesTRAP-positive MNCs (>10 nuclei)No treatmentaTNF-α (50 or 250 ng/ml), sRANKL (50 ng/ml), and/or IL-1β (50 ng/ml) was added to the culture immediately after cell seeding in the presence of M-CSF (35,000 units/ml).PretreatmentbCells were pretreated with M-CSF (35,000 units/ml) for 24 h and then cultured under the same conditions as in footnotea.Ratio (pre-/no)TNF-α (50 ng/ml)8 ± 281 ± 1410.1TNF-α (250 ng/ml)31 ± 6130 ± 404.2TNF-α (50 ng/ml) + IL-1β (50 ng/ml)28 ± 874 ± 152.6sRANKL (50 ng/ml)811 ± 81712 ± 410.9Bone marrow cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured for 5 days.

Open table in a new tab Bone marrow cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured for 5 days. TRAP-positive MNCs with more than 10 nuclei were counted. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. To test the effect of the TNF-α concentration in the culture, we treated MDBM cells with 0.4–250 ng/ml TNF-α. As shown in Fig.2, TNF-α induced the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs from MDBM cells in a dose-dependent manner at TNF-α concentrations of 10 ng/ml and above. The number of TRAP-positive MNCs in TNF-α-treated groups was about 50% of that in sRANKL-treated groups (Fig. 2). We used the pit formation assay on dentin slices and the calcium resorption assay on calcium phosphate-coated discs to examine the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs. MDBM cells were cultured in the presence of TNF-α and M-CSF on dentin slices or calcium-coated discs for 5–7 days. Resorption pits were observed on both dentin slices (Fig. 3 A) and calcium phosphate-coated discs (Fig. 3 B) in the cultures treated with TNF-α. But the area of resorption was approximately 10 times smaller than that in cultures treated with sRANKL (Fig. 3,panel A, a and c; panel B, b and c; and panel C), even though the number of TNF-α-induced TRAP-positive cells on dentin slices was about half of that of the sRANKL-induced cells (Fig. 3 A, d–f). Interestingly, IL-1 remarkably increased only the resorption activity but not the number of TRAP-positive MNCs in the cultures cotreated with TNF-α and M-CSF (Fig. 3, Ab and Bd). The level of bone resorption activity in the treatment with TNF-α plus IL-1β was close to that in the sRANKL-treated cultures, indicating that IL-1β stimulated the bone resorption activity of the TNF-α-induced MNCs (Fig. 3,panel A, a, b, d, ande; panel B, c and d; andpanel C). An anti-IL-1 receptor type I antibody markedly inhibited the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs which was stimulated by IL-1β (Fig. 3 C). OPG-Fc inhibited the bone resorption activity of sRANKL-induced MNCs but not of TNF-α-induced MNCs (data not shown). The morphological features of TNF-α-induced MNCs in the MDBM cell cultures and in the bone marrow cell cultures showed a smooth contour with a large number of nuclei, whose features were equivalent to those of the sRANKL-induced MNCs (Figs.4 A, d–f). The formation of ringed F-actin structures (actin rings) in osteoclasts is closely related to osteoclast function (41.Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A.

Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The band of F-actin-containing podosomes was recognized at the periphery of numerous TNF-α-induced TRAP-positive MNCs (Fig. 4 Aa). However, no large actin ring was clearly visible in these cells, despite the presence of actin deep inside of them (Fig.4 Aa). Although there was no difference in the number of MNCs with an actin ring between the TNF-α-treated cultures (Fig.4 Aa) and those cotreated with TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig.4 Ab), bone resorption activity was increased by the addition of IL-1β (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that IL-1β stimulates a specific signal required for bone resorption rather than the rearrangement of cytoskeletal organization in TNF-α-induced MNCs, although IL-1β alone cannot induce the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs. The mean number of nuclei in the typical TNF-α-induced TRAP-positive MNCs (n = 200) was 22.0 ± 4.9 (Fig.4 B). There was no significant difference for the mean number between TNF-α-induced MNCs and sRANKL-induced MNCs (25.0 ± 8.49 in Fig. 4 Ac and B). It is well known that many cells, including macrophages, express two TNF receptors, p55 and p75 (44.Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). IL-1 recognizes cell surface receptors type I and type II but may elicit biological responses only through the type I receptor (45.Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry indicated that MDBM cells expressed both of the TNF receptors and the type I receptor of IL-1 (Fig.5). To determine which TNF receptor mediates osteoclastogenesis of MDBM cells, we added an antagonistic antibody against mouse p55 or p75 to the MDBM cell cultures in the presence of TNF-α. The formation of TRAP-positive MNCs by TNF-α was inhibited completely by the anti-p55 antibody but only partially by anti-p75, using an optimal dosage (10 μg/ml) of both antibodies for inhibition after testing multiple concentration (Fig. 6). These results demonstrate that TNF-α induces osteoclastogenesis of MDBM cells mainly via the p55 TNF receptor. 50 ng/ml OPG-Fc partially blocked MNC induction by sRANKL but not that by TNF-α (Fig. 6), and then 100 ng/ml OPG-Fc completely blocked it (data not shown). IL-1β may stimulate the bone resorption activity of MNCs rather than multinucleation in TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis. Because IL-1β stimulated the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs (Fig.4 C) but did not increase the number of TNF-α-induced MNCs (Fig. 1 A), such IL-1β may transduce biological signals through the type I receptor (45.Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in osteoclasts. Although an anti-IL-1 receptor type I antibody did not affect the formation of TRAP-positive MNCs in the presence of TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig. 6), it markedly inhibited the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs (Fig.3 C). The cause of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, aseptic loosening, and periodontal diseases has been associated with the accumulation of TNF-α and/or other proinflammatory cytokines, which likely mediate local bone destruction. For example, the concentrations of M-CSF, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 in synovial fluid and/or in serum of rheumatoid arthritis patients are extremely high (24.Saxne T. Palladino Jr., M.A. Heinegard D.

Br. 1998; 80: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It was also reported that TNF-α promoted bone resorption by activating mature osteoclasts or by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts indirectly via a primary effect on osteoblasts (20.Thomson B.M. Mundy G.R. Chambers T.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lerner U.H. Ohlin A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22.van der Pluijm G. Most W. van der Wee-Pals L. de Groot H. Papapoulos S. Lowik C.

Res. 1989; 4: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this effect is via a direct action on osteoclast progenitors because of the small population of these progenitors in bone marrow and the absence of a suitable established cell line of progenitors. Recently we established an osteoclast progenitor (MDBM cell) culture system, which was obtained by treating mouse bone marrow cells with a high dose of M-CSF. The primary question addressed in this study was whether TNF-α could directly induce the differentiation from osteoclast progenitors into mature osteoclasts. The results demonstrated that TNF-α induced TRAP-positive MNCs in the presence of M-CSF in the MDBM cell cultures. TNF-α-induced MNCs showed the phenotypical and functional characteristics of osteoclasts including the expression of TRAP, a band formation of F-actin-containing podosomes, and the ability to produce resorption pits in bone. These results indicate that TNF-α can induce osteoclastogenesis by the direct action on osteoclast progenitors in the presence of M-CSF. It is possible to consider that TNF-α reacts on contaminating stromal cells in the MDBM cell cultures, thus we examined the level of contamination of stromal cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses for type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase genes. The level of contaminating stromal cells in the preparation of MDBM cells was lower than 1 in 1,000 cells (data not shown). Moreover, OPG-Fc could not block the formation of TNF-α-induced MNCs, indicating that RANKL was not produced from stromal cells, if any, to which TNF-α may react. The results demonstrate that no effective stromal cells were present in MDBM cells. TNF-α also induced TRAP-positive MNCs in the presence of M-CSF from bone marrow cells, but the efficiency of MNC formation was markedly lower than that in the MDBM cell cultures. However, M-CSF pretreatment for 24 h increased the efficiency of TNF-α-induced MNC formation, but not that of sRANKL-induced MNC formation, suggesting that M-CSF induces the TNF-α sensitivity to osteoclast progenitors to become reactive to TNF-α. M-CSF is a key regulator in osteoclastogenesis, mediating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoclast progenitors and the survival of mature osteoclasts (51.Jimi E. Shuto T. Koga T. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 808-811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Kodama H. Nose M. Niida S. Yamasaki A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 53.Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tamura T. Akatsu T. Stanley E.R. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 54.Hofstetter W. Wetterwald A.

Fleisch H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because a high dose of M-CSF strongly stimulated proliferation of Colony-forming unit macrophage cells in the bone marrow (data not shown), the stimulation of MNC formation might be the result of the increase in the number of Colony-forming unit macrophage cells and/or up-regulation of the sensitivity toward TNF-α in the bone marrow. In contrast, M-CSF pretreatment did not affect sRANKL-induced MNC formation. Fahlman et al. (56.Fahlman C. Jacobsen F.W. Veiby O.P. McNiece I.K. Blomhoff H.K. Jacobsen S.E. Blood. 1994; 84: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TNF-α potently enhanced in vitro the differentiation of macrophages from primitive murine hematopoietic progenitor cells in combination with stem cell factor and IL-7. These reports also suggested the possibility that TNF-α but not sRANKL interferes with the M-CSF signal, which is required for commitment to the osteoclast lineage from early hematopoietic progenitor cells because of the multifunction of TNF-α toward bone marrow cells. The bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs was approximately 10-fold lower than that of sRANKL-induced MNCs, although the number of MNCs was about half in the former. However, IL-1β stimulated the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced MNCs without an increase in the number of MNCs. Because IL-1β did not induce the TRAP-positive MNC formation itself in the presence of M-CSF, IL-1β compensated for the insufficient ability of TNF-α in bone resorption. It was reported that IL-1 stimulated the bone resorption activity of isolated rat osteoclasts (45.Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or multinucleation and pit-forming activity of mouse preosteoclasts (33.Jimi E. Nakamura I. Duong L.T. Ikebe T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Jimi and co-workers reported that IL-1 prolonged the survival of purified mouse osteoclasts, enhancing their bone resorption activity (33.Jimi E. Nakamura I. Duong L.T. Ikebe T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 57.Thomson B.M. Saklatvala J. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In the present study, IL-1β coupled with TNF-α also stimulated bone resorption activity. An anti-IL-1 type I receptor antibody blocked the stimulation of bone resorption activity by IL-1β but not the induction of MNCs by cotreatment with TNF-α and IL-1β. Moreover, IL-1β treatment did not affect the number of MNCs which had actin ring, demonstrating that IL-1β stimulates a specific signal required for bone resorption rather than causes the rearrangement of the cytoskeletal organization in TNF-α-induced MNCs. The type I p55 TNF receptor has been thought to be the major biologically active form (58.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), but recent evidence indicates the type II p75 TNF receptor is also functional. Whereas the p75 TNF receptor mediates differentiation of early hematopoietic precursors, the p55 TNF receptor is active in later stages of the process (56.Fahlman C. Jacobsen F.W. Veiby O.P. McNiece I.K. Blomhoff H.K. Jacobsen S.E. Blood. 1994; 84: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble TNF targets primarily the p55 receptor, but the membrane-associated TNF activates both receptors (59.Heehan K.C.F. Pinckard J.K. Arthur C.D. Dehner L.P. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In our blocking experiment using the specific antibody to TNF receptors, the induction of TRAP-positive MNCs by TNF-α was completely inhibited by anti-p55 antibody and partially blocked by anti-p75 antibody. Using bone marrow macrophages from TNF receptor-disrupted mice (p55 −/−, p75 −/−, and both), Abu-Ameret al. (35.Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) also showed that lipopolysaccharide-induced osteoclastogenesis was mediated by TNF and was transmitted through the p55 TNF receptor but not through the p75 one. These results suggest that at least the receptor signaling via the p55 TNF receptor is required for TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis of MDBM cells. The role of the signal via p75 in the TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis of MDBM cells should be investigated further. OPG-Fc blocked MNC induction by sRANKL but not that by TNF-α in the MDBM cell cultures, and TNF-α and sRANKL synergistically induced MNCs in the presence of M-CSF in the MDBM cell cultures (data not shown). These results suggest that the intracellular signal through TNF-α which is involved in osteoclastogenesis of MDBM cells is independent of that of RANKL. Because several stimulators of osteoclast formation, including 1α,25-(OH)2D3, parathyroid hormone, prostaglandin E2, and IL-11, up-regulated expression of RANKL mRNA in mouse calvarial osteoblasts (30.Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar), TNF-α might also stimulate the RANKL gene expression in osteoblastic cells. The RANK-RANKL signals may be involved in TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis in the bone marrow cell cultures. Osteoclasts play a crucial role in physiological bone remodeling (4.Kahn A.J. Partridge N.C. Hall B.K. Bone. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 119Google Scholar) and also function in the local bone destruction that occurs in association with chronic inflammatory diseases (5.Mills B.G. Hall B.K. Bone. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 175Google Scholar). RANKL is essential for osteoclast development and plays a critical role in physiological bone remodeling (32.Kong Y.-Y. Yoshida H. Sarosi I. Tan H.-L. Timms E. Capparelli C. Morony S. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Van G. Itie A. Khoo W. Wakeham A. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Mak T.W. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 397: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). The RANK-RANKL signal is involved in local osteolysis in chronic inflammatory diseases; however, it remains unclear whether it is the absolute pathway. Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, aseptic loosening, and periodontal diseases have been associated with accumulation of inflammatory cytokines, which likely mediate local bone destruction by stimulating osteoclast activity (24.Saxne T. Palladino Jr., M.A. Heinegard D. Talal N. Wollheim F.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 25.Xu J.W. Konttinen Y.T. Lassus J. Natah S. Ceponis A.

Immun. 1996; 64: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed here for the first time that, first, TNF-α induces osteoclastogenesis by a direct action on osteoclast progenitors in the presence of M-CSF; second, the receptor signal mediated by the p55 TNF receptor is mainly involved in its effect; and third, IL-1 stimulates the bone resorption activity of TNF-α-induced osteoclasts. Our results suggest that the direct action of TNF-α and M-CSF on osteoclast progenitors contributes to osteoclast formation and local osteolysis in some pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and aseptic loosening. In conclusion, TNF-α is a crucial differentiation factor for osteoclasts. The present results strongly suggest that TNF-α and M-CSF play an important role in local osteolysis in chronic inflammatory diseases. We acknowledge gratefully the help of Dr. T. Ohta and Dr. K.

To exert their function during such diverse cellular processes, Hsp70s cooperate with a multitude of chaperone cofactors. The cofactors either modulate the ATPase and peptide binding cycle of the chaperones or mediate their targeting to specific proteins and subcellular compartments (3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

The BAG-1 protein is a recently identified cofactor of the constitutively expressed Hsc70 and the heat-inducible Hsp70 in the mammalian cytosol and nucleus (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S.

In human HeLa cells at least three BAG-1 isoforms can be distinguished by the lengths of their amino termini: BAG-1 (termed BAG-1S throughout this study), BAG-1M (previously also termed Rap46/Hap46), and BAG-1L (11.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3116-3131PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig.1). The isoforms associate with Hsc70 and Hsp70 through binding to the ATPase domain of the chaperone proteins (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8.Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C.

Moreover, BAG-1M has been shown to stimulate the ATP hydrolytic activity of Hsc70 by accelerating ADP/ATP exchange (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 12.Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). BAG-1M thus fulfills a regulatory function opposite to that of another ATPase domain-binding protein, Hip, which stabilizes the ADP-bound state of Hsc70 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13.Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U.

The antagonistic regulatory functions of BAG-1M and Hip severely affect the chaperone activity of Hsc70. While BAG-1M and also BAG-1S were shown to inhibit Hsc70-mediated protein folding in vitro, Hip promotes the folding capacity of the chaperone protein (8.Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S.

It thus appears that balancing the intracellular levels of Hip and the BAG-1 isoforms might provide a central mechanism to influence the functional specificity of Hsc70/Hsp70. In this context it is important to note that overexpression of BAG-1 isoforms was frequently observed in tumor cells (11.Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D.

Furthermore, gene transfer-mediated elevations of the level of BAG-1 isoforms cause a variety of cellular phenotypes, possibly through a modulation of Hsc70/Hsp70 activity. This includes increased resistance to apoptosis, enhanced cell proliferation, and altered transcriptional activity of steroid hormone receptors (18.Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S.

Conjugation of a multiubiquitin chain plays a well established role in targeting substrates to a high molecular mass proteolytic complex, the proteasome, for their degradation. Notably, the ubiquitin-like domain of BAG-1 is not required for Hsc70 binding and regulation but is essential for BAG-1 to fulfill its anti-apoptotic function (8.Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The presence of the ubiquitin-like domain within the chaperone cofactor suggests that BAG-1 may function as a link between Hsc70/Hsp70 and the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Here we provide evidence for this notion. We show that BAG-1 associates with the proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner and promotes binding of Hsc70 and Hsp70 to the proteolytic complex. BAG-1 can apparently act as a coupling factor between the Hsp70 chaperone system and the protein degradation machinery. Human BAG-1M and BAG-C were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses and were purified as described previously (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-Hsc70/Hsp70 and monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibodies were obtained from Stressgen; polyclonal anti-BAG-1/C-16 (recognizing the carboxyl-terminal 16 residues of human and mouse BAG-1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against Hip was raised in chicken using a recombinant deletion fragment of rat Hip (amino acids 1–257) as the source of antigene. For gene transfer-mediated expression of human BAG-1S, the corresponding cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pVL1392-bag-1M (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as the template, and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). As a control plasmid, pcDNA3.1B-myc/his-lacZ (Invitrogen) was used. Transfection of human HeLa cells was performed using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (CLONTECH). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection of a vector expressing green fluorescent protein using 1/10 of the amount of the bag-1carrying constructs. Efficiency was usually between 50% and 70%. For the preparation of mammalian cell extracts, HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. At about 90% confluence, attached cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected in PBS. HeLa cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A), containing 0.5% Tween 20. When indicated buffer A contained 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP, or 5 mm EDTA. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 30,000 × g, and the obtained supernatants were used as soluble cell extracts. To the cell extracts, antibodies were added as indicated. Rabbit anti-chicken IgGs were used as unrelated control antibody. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing, followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose and further incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The immobilized immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with buffer A containing 0.5% Tween 20, and washed once with buffer A lacking detergent. The immunocomplexes were subsequently incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 500 μl of buffer A containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and protease inhibitors. The protein G-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, and ATP-eluted proteins were precipitated from the supernatant fraction by addition of trichloroacetic acid. The Sepharose beads were washed again using buffer A, followed by elution of immunocomplexes through boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. To analyze the effect of BAG-1M on the association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome, HeLa cell extracts were prepared in buffer A containing 0.5% Tween 20, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. When indicated, purified BAG-1M (3 μg of purified protein/1 mg of cell extract) or an equimolar amount of BAG-C were added and samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and immunoprecipitations were performed as outlined above. HeLa cells were grown to about 80% confluence, and attached cells were washed with PBS and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free MEM containing 20 μCi/ml35S-Redivue Pro-Mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Following labeling for 24 h under standard growth conditions, cells were collected and lysed as described above. In chase experiments, attached cells were washed once with prewarmed complete MEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm methionine, followed by growth in the same medium for the indicated times. The BAG-1 isoforms expressed in human HeLa cells share a common ubiquitin-like domain within their amino-terminal portions (Fig. 1). Conceivably, the ubiquitin-like domain might serve as a signal to induce the rapid degradation of the BAG-1 isoforms by the proteasome. Therefore, the half-life of BAG-1 isoforms in HeLa cells was investigated. For this purpose, we first established immunoprecipitation conditions. HeLa cells were radiolabeled for 24 h to detect significant amounts of BAG-1L and BAG-1M in anti-BAG-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 A). The radiolabeled isoforms were not precipitated when the antibody was blocked with purified BAG-1M (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). In this situation, an increased amount of Hsc70 and Hsp70 was coprecipitated due to an association of the chaperones with purified BAG-1M (arrowhead). Moreover, proteins of high molecular mass (>90 kDa) were coprecipitated, which we could identify as multiubiquitinated proteins that associate with the BAG-1 isoforms. 2J. Höhfeld, unpublished observations. The BAG-1S protein (apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa) was not detectable after immunoprecipitation. Possibly, BAG-1S resides in a distinct protein complex or displays an altered conformation in which the carboxyl terminus of the protein is not accessible to the anti-BAG-1 antibody. In pulse-chase experiments, we therefore focused on the readily detected BAG-1L and BAG-1M isoforms. During a 3-h chase, the amount of both isoforms decreased by about 20%, revealing a half-life of the two isoforms of about 7.5 h (Fig. 2 B). Apparently, BAG-1L and BAG-1M are rather stable proteins despite the presence of a ubiquitin-like domain. The data suggest that the domain may fulfill degradation-independent targeting functions. The BAG-1 isoforms resemble the Rad23 protein, which possesses a similar ubiquitin-like domain at its amino terminus, and utilizes this domain to bind to the proteasome in a stable manner (28.Watkins J.J. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 30.Russel S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether BAG-1 forms stable complexes with the proteasome. Following immunoprecipitation of BAG-1 isoforms from HeLa cells, the C-8 subunit, a component of the 20 S catalytic core of the proteolytic complex, and the S-1 subunit of the regulatory particle of the proteasome were found in association with the chaperone cofactor (Fig.3). This reveals the existence of BAG-1/proteasome complexes in HeLa cells. The association of BAG-1 with the proteasome was destabilized in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, Hsc70 and Hsp70 were also released form immunoprecipitated BAG-1. This raised the possibility that the cofactor's association with the proteolytic complex is mediated by the chaperone proteins. Alternatively, binding of BAG-1 to Hsc70/Hsp70 and to the proteasome, respectively, may represent independent events that are both regulated by ATP. To distinguish between these possibilities, we investigated the nucleotide requirements for the formation of the BAG-1/proteasome complex. For this purpose the antibody used for immunoprecipitations was saturated with purified BAG-1M protein. In this situation, endogenous BAG-1/proteasome complexes were no longer efficiently precipitated and binding of the proteasome to the purified, antibody-bound BAG-1M could be analyzed. In the presence of EDTA, proteasomes were not detectable in association with purified BAG-1M (Fig.4, lane 3), whereas endogenous BAG-1/proteasome complexes were stabilized (Fig. 4,lane 2). In contrast, when lysates were prepared and incubations were done in the presence of ATP and MgCl2the proteasome associated with purified BAG-1M (Fig. 4, lane 6). Thus, complex formation apparently requires ATP hydrolysis. Since ATP was also found to destabilize isolated BAG-1/proteasome complexes (see above), an equilibrium between free and complexed forms appears to exist in the presence of the nucleotide. Complexes that form transiently in this situation can be stabilized during isolation by washing immunopellets with nucleotide-free buffer and can finally be dissociated by ATP treatment. The requirement for ATP hydrolysis distinguishes the interaction of BAG-1 with the proteasome from the interaction of BAG-1 with Hsc70/Hsp70. While binding of the proteasome to added BAG-1M was blocked in the presence of EDTA, the chaperones efficiently associated with the cofactor in this situation (Fig. 4). The different nucleotide requirements for Hsc70 and proteasome binding to BAG-1 thus indicate two distinct binding events. Since BAG-1 associates with Hsc70/Hsp70 and the proteasome, the chaperone cofactor may act as a coupling factor between the chaperone machinery and the degradation system. To verify this notion the effect of BAG-1 on the association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome was analyzed. Immunoprecipitation experiments from HeLa cell extracts were performed in the presence and absence of purified BAG-1M, respectively, using a monoclonal anti-Hsc70/Hsp70 antibody. To allow for ATP-dependent interactions of endogenous proteins,i.e. the proteasome, with added BAG-1M the extracts were prepared and initially incubated in the presence of ATP and MgCl2, followed by addition of an excess of EDTA to stabilize the formed complexes prior to immunoprecipitation. Association of BAG-1M with Hsc70/Hsp70 severely reduced the amount of the cofactor Hip bound to the chaperone proteins (Fig.5 A). This is in agreement with previous findings identifying Hip and BAG-1 as antagonistic regulators that compete with each other for an interaction with Hsc70 and Hsp70 (7.Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31.Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome was significantly increased in the presence of BAG-1M, while a similar effect was not observed for binding of the chaperone proteins to Hsp90 (Fig. 5 A). Apparently, BAG-1 specifically promotes an interaction of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome. Notably, an induced association was observed using antibodies against the C-8 catalytic subunit as well as against the S-1 regulatory subunit of the proteasome (Fig. 5 B). We conclude that BAG-1 provides a link between Hsc70/Hsp70 and the apparently intact 26 S proteasome. Consistent with the in vitro observations, gene-transfer mediated elevation of the level of BAG-1S in HeLa cells resulted in an increased amount of proteasomes associated with Hsc70/Hsp70 (Fig.6 A). Similar findings were made when BAG-1M was overexpressed (data not shown). Apparently, the intracellular levels of BAG-1 isoforms significantly affect the amount of Hsc70/Hsp70 tethered to the proteasome. An induced association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome was not observed in in vitro experiments using the carboxyl-terminal fragment BAG-C (Fig. 5 B). Although BAG-C is sufficient for Hsc70 binding and regulation, the fragment does not support targeting of Hsc70 to the proteasome. Apparently, the amino terminus of BAG-1, which includes the ubiquitin-like domain, is required for the targeting function of BAG-1. In this study an interaction of the chaperone cofactor BAG-1 with the proteasome is demonstrated. BAG-1 thus resembles Rad23, a protein involved in nucleotide excision repair in yeast and man that associates with the proteasome in a rather stable manner (28.Watkins J.J. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K.

Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both BAG-1 and Rad23 possess non-cleavable and non-transferable ubiquitin-like domains at their amino termini. The ubiquitin-like domain of Rad23 is in fact required for its association with the proteasome (29.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed that the amino terminus of BAG-1, which includes the ubiquitin-like domain, is necessary for targeting of the chaperone cofactor to the proteasome (Fig. 5 B). We cannot exclude, however, that a hexapeptide repeat region preceding the ubiquitin-like domain (see Fig. 1, TRSEEX repeats) contributes to the interaction of BAG-1 with the proteasome. Deletion of the repeat region rendered the remaining fragment highly unstable and thus abolished attempts to demonstrate an exclusive role of the ubiquitin-like domain in targeting of BAG-1 to the proteasome. 3J. Demand, and J. Höhfeld, unpublished observations. The fact that the BAG-1S isoform contains only an incomplete repeat region (see Fig.1), but is still able to trigger proteasome association (Fig.6 A), points to the targeting function of the ubiquitin-like domain. Interaction of BAG-1 with the proteasome apparently includes the regulatory particle of the proteolytic complex. This particle comprises several ATPases of the AAA type that have been implicated in the recognition and unfolding of ubiquitinated substrates prior to their degradation (32.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 33.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for substrate unfolding has been postulated since the catalytically active sites of the proteasome are buried in the central cavity of the cylindrical core particle (32.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar,35.Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R.

It is remarkable in this context that BAG-1 stimulates an association of the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 with the proteasome. The chaperones have well established roles in stabilizing non-native polypeptides (1.Craig E.A. Baxter B.K. Becker J. Halladay J. Ziegelhoffer T. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

Moreover, Hsp70 family members were shown to participate in protein degradation (38.Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the mammalian cytosol, the BAG-1-induced association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome may provide for an efficient transfer of non-native polypeptides from the molecular chaperones to the proteolytic complex. Notably, the BAG-1M isoform is able to trigger the release of substrates from Hsc70 by accelerating nucleotide exchange (16.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This substrate-release function of the cofactor may support a possible transfer reaction. However, BAG-1 does not appear to act as a general accelerator of protein degradation, and known target proteins of BAG-1 and Hsc70/Hsp70 are differently affected by the regulatory function of the chaperone cofactor. BAG-1 isoforms were shown to enhance the functions of Bcl-2, the Raf-1 protein kinase, androgen receptor, and the hepatocyte growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, while inhibiting retinoic acid receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and Siah-1 (18.Takayama S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The interaction of BAG-1 with the proteasome may thus affect only a certain subset of substrates, whereas in other cases an Hsc70-regulating activity independent of the proteasome may be prevalent. Alternatively, BAG-1-mediated association of Hsc70 and Hsp70 with the proteasome may not result in the degradation of all substrates. The association of Rad23 with the regulatory particle of the proteasome may in fact have functions independent of protein degradation during nucleotide excision repair (30.Russel S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and a chaperone function of the regulatory particle of the proteasome was recently demonstrated (43.Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.-M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Further experimental approaches will be necessary to distinguish between these alternative functional concepts. BAG-1 might conceivably stimulate an association of Hsc70 and Hsp70 with the proteasome by inducing an association-competent state of the molecular chaperones. However, several lines of evidence argue against this notion. BAG-1 does not generally induce an association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with partner proteins, but specifically promotes a chaperone/proteasome interaction (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, the carboxyl-terminal domain of BAG-1, which is sufficient for Hsc70 binding and regulation (16.Lüders J. Demand J. Schönfelder S. Frien M. Zimmermann R. Höhfeld J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), does not support the association of Hsc70/Hsp70 with the proteasome (Fig. 5 B). Finally, different nucleotide requirements were observed for the interaction of Hsc70/Hsp70 and of the proteasome with BAG-1, indicating two distinct binding events (Fig. 4). The data presented here are consistent with a function of BAG-1 as a physical link between Hsc70/Hsp70 and the proteolytic complex (Fig. 6 B). While BAG-1 associates with the molecular chaperones through its carboxyl-terminal domain, the amino terminus including the ubiquitin-like domain apparently mediates an interaction of BAG-1 with the proteasome. Coupling of the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 to other proteins and protein complexes is not without precedent. The chaperone cofactor Hop for example mediates a physical link between Hsc70 and the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (44.Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Lassle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this way, Hop facilitates the cooperation of Hsc70 and Hsp90 during the regulation of signal transduction pathways (46.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 47.Caplan A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Coupling factors apparently help to organize chaperone networks in the cellular environment. The BAG-1 isoforms seem to act as coupling factors at the interface between protein folding and protein degradation. We thank Stefan Jentsch for generous support and helpful discussions.

We now show that one of the human MAN antigens termed MAN1 is a 82.3-kDa protein with an amino-terminal domain followed by two hydrophobic segments and a carboxyl-terminal tail. The MAN1 gene contains seven protein-coding exons and is assigned to human chromosome 12q14. Its mRNA is approximately 5.5 kilobases and is detected in several different cell types that were examined. Cell extraction experiments show that MAN1 is an integral membrane protein. When expressed in transfected cells, MAN1 is exclusively targeted to the nuclear envelope, consistent with an inner nuclear membrane localization. Protein sequence analysis reveals that MAN1 shares a conserved globular domain of approximately 40 amino acids, which we term the LEM module, with inner nuclear membrane proteins lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin. The LEM module is also present in two proteins ofCaenorhabditis elegans.

J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). LBR has a nucleoplasmic, amino-terminal domain of approximately 200 amino acids that binds to B-type lamins and chromatin proteins and confers inner nuclear membrane retention (2.Worman H.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14983-14989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of LBR is followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight putative transmembrane segments that is similar in sequence to sterol reductases, including two human proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, one of which is a 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (13.Holmer L. Pezhman A. Worman H.J. Genomics. 1998; 54: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two other integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane have been termed lamina-associated polypeptides (LAPs). Three related isoforms of rat LAP1 (LAP1A, LAP1B, and LAP1C) were identified by reaction with a single monoclonal antibody and shown to be integral membrane proteins associated with the nuclear lamina (14.Senior A. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). LAP1C has a nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain followed by one transmembrane segment, and the other LAP1 isoforms are probably of similar overall structure, arising from the same gene by alternative RNA splicing (15.Martin L. Crimaudo C. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8822-8828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). LAP2 was also first identified by reaction with a monoclonal antibody and shown to be an integral membrane protein that binds to nuclear lamins and chromatin (16.Foisner R. Gerace L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of LAP2, which have also been called thymopoietins because they were thought to possibly be thymocyte growth factors, are generated by alternative RNA splicing (17.Harris C.A. Andryuk P.J. Cline S. Chan H.K. Natarajan A. Siekierka J.J. Goldstein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6283-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18.Harris C.A. Andryuk P.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Some of the LAP2 isoforms are integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane, with nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domains and single transmembrane segments, while others are nonmembrane nuclear polypeptides. In 1994, positional cloning of the gene responsible for X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy led to the identification of emerin that has limited sequence similarity to LAP2 (22.Bione S. Maestrini E. Rivella S. Mancini M. Regis S. Romeo G. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). After its discovery, emerin was shown to be localized to the inner nuclear membrane and lacking from this location in most patients with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (23.Manilal S. Nguyen T.M. Sewry C.A. Morris G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 24.Nagano A. Koga R. Ogawa M. Kurano Y. Kawada J. Okada R. Hayashi Y.K. Tsukahara T. Arahata K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Emerin contains a nucleoplasmic, amino-terminal domain followed by a single transmembrane segment and a short tail in the perinuclear space/endoplasmic reticulum lumen. The nucleoplasmic domain of emerin mediates its inner nuclear membrane targeting (25.Östlund C. Ellenberg J. Hallberg E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Worman H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a multispanning membrane protein without a large hydrophilic domain called nurim was shown to be localized to the nuclear envelope (26.Rolls M.M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Nurim is present exclusively in the nuclear envelope and highly immobilized in this location, strongly suggesting that it too is an inner nuclear membrane protein. It appears that multiple regions of nurim, including its transmembrane domains, contain determinants for its targeting (26.Rolls M.M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Otefin is a protein that has been localized to the inner nuclear membrane in Drosophila (27.Harel A. Zlotkin E. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Feinstein N. Fisher P.A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced primary structure of otefin derived from cDNA cloning and sequencing demonstrates that it is a mostly hydrophilic protein with a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids near its carboxyl terminus (28.Padan R. Nainudel-Epszteyn S. Goitein R. Fainsod A. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7808-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although sequence analysis suggests that otefin may be an integral membrane protein, biochemical evidence indicates that it is a peripheral one and that its hydrophobic tail plays a role in its membrane association (29.Ashery-Padan R. Weiss A.M. Feinstein N. Gruenbaum Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2493-2499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional proteins of the inner nuclear membrane probably exist but remain to be characterized. Some patients with rheumatic and autoimmune liver diseases have autoantibodies that recognize nuclear envelope antigens, and these antibodies can potentially be useful tools in the identification of novel nuclear membrane proteins (30.Worman H.J. Courvalin J.-C. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31.Courvalin J.-C. Worman H.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1997; 17: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, autoantibodies were described in a patient with an ill-defined collagen vascular disease that recognize three polypeptides called “MAN antigens” that are localized exclusively to the nuclear envelope and co-fractionate biochemically with nuclear lamins (32.Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The three MAN antigens have apparent molecular masses of approximately 80, 58, and 40 kDa. The MAN antigen of approximately 58 kDa appears to be LAP2-β, but the other two proteins have not been characterized at the molecular level (33.Lang C. Paulin-Levasseur M. Gajewski A. Alsheimer M. Benevente R. Krohne G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 749-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report on the molecular characterization of one of the human MAN antigens, which we call MAN1. An expression library was constructed of cDNA from mouse P19 cells as described (34.Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). P19 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). RNA was isolated by LiCl extraction 6 days after treatment of cells with dimethyl sulfoxide, and poly(A)+RNA was selected by standard methods (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) NotI primer-adapter and the Superscript Lambda System Kit (Life Technologies). SalI adapters were ligated to the ends, and the cDNA was subsequently subjected to restriction endonuclease digestion with NotI and size-fractionated by column chromatography. The size-fractionated cDNA was ligated into bacteriophage λ gt22, which was digested with NotI and SalI, and packaged using the Life Technologies, Inc. Lambda Packaging System (Life Technologies). Standard methods (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for screening the expression library with human serum (1:20,000 dilution) that contained the MAN autoantibodies (32.Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This screening led to the isolation of one clone. A β-galactosidase fusion protein encoded by this λ gt22 clone was expressed by standard methods (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of the mouse λ gt22 clone was 32P-labeled using either the Multiprime Labeling Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Quebec, Canada) or Random Priming System Kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for hybridization screening of the same library and an undifferentiated P19 cell library in λ Uni-Zap XR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The32P-labeled mouse cDNA was also used to screen a human HeLa cell (S3) cDNA library (Stratagene). To isolate overlapping cDNA clones, various cDNA fragments were similarly32P-labeled and used to screen a human leukocyte 5′-stretch plus cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and a human whole blood λ DASH II genomic library (Stratagene). All hybridization screening was performed using standard methods (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 42 °C in 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA with probe-specific activities between 4 × 105 and 1 × 106 Bq/ml. Nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) were washed at 68 °C in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS and exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 12–16 h. Hybridizing clones were isolated from libraries by repeated screenings, and cDNA inserts or fragments were isolated and subcloned for sequencing using standard methods (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction mapping of genomic clones in bacteriophage λ was performed according to Rackwitz et al. (36.Rackwitz H.-R. Zehetner G. Fischauf A.-M. Lehrach H. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 30: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed on a 373A Automated Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Division, Foster City, CA) at the Columbia University Cancer Center Core Facility. Some sequencing was also performed using the T7 Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequences were analyzed using the Wisconsin Package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), various applications available on the Internet at the National Center for Biotechnology Information site on the World Wide Web, and version 1.0 of DNA Strider (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, France). The Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid mapping panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was used to assign the MAN1 gene to its chromosomal location. Polymerase chain reactions (37.Sakai R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H. Science. 1987; 239: 487-491Crossref Google Scholar) were performed on a RoboCycler Gradient 96 thermocycler (Stratagene) with forward primer of sequence 5′-CTTTTCTCTCAGCTCCGCCGTT-3′ and reverse primer of sequence 5′-CGTAAGTAGGAGAGGTCGCCCG-3′. Reaction parameters were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Chromosomal assignment was performed through the Whitehead Institute/MIT World Wide Web server at with LOD score linkage set at a value of 15. Complementary DNA probes were32P-labeled using the Random Priming System Kit, and Northern blotting was performed as described (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using human tissue and cancer cell line blots (CLONTECH). A plasmid to express a MAN1 glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was constructed using the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To amplify cDNA encoding MAN1 from amino acid 1 to 360, polymerase chain reaction (37.Sakai R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H. Science. 1987; 239: 487-491Crossref Google Scholar) was performed using the Gene Amp Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche) and a PCR System 2400 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer) with MAN1 cDNA as template. Oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites for cloning into pGEX-4T-1. Amplified polymerase chain reaction products were purified using the PCR Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and ligated into pGEX-4T-1 that had been digested with the same restriction endonucleases. Ligation reaction mixtures were used to transform competent Escherichia coli strain DH5-α (Life Technologies), and the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were produced and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography as described elsewhere (38.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Methods used for immunoblotting were those that have been described previously (3.Courvalin J.-C. Lassoued K. Worman H.J. Blobel G. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32.Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity-purified from serum against fusion proteins according to the method of Smith and Fisher (40.Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To construct a plasmid encoding full-length MAN1 with a FLAG epitope tag at its amino terminus, polymerase chain reaction was performed with primers containing engineered EcoRI andSalI restriction endonuclease sites with a λ cDNA clone of MAN1 as template. The amplified product was digested withEcoRI and SalI and ligated in-frame into pBFT4, a pBluescript II KS (Stratagene)-based plasmid containing a Kozak consensus sequence, ATG, and the FLAG epitope coding sequence 5′ to the multiple cloning site. The resulting recombinant construct in pBFT4, which contained a SpeI site 5′ to the Kozak consensus sequence and XhoI site 3′ to the multiple cloning site, was digested with SpeI and XhoI to isolate a DNA that was then ligated into pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was digested with XhoI and XbaI (an isoschizomer ofSpeI). COS-7 cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies), were transfected with the recombinant pSVK3 construct, which encoded MAN1 with a FLAG epitope tag at its amino terminus under the control of an SV40 early promoter, as described previously (8.Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9.Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected as described above and harvested by low speed centrifugation. For NaOH extraction, cells were resuspended in a solution of 0.1 m NaOH, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min in a TL-100 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) to obtain supernatant and pellet fractions. For urea extraction, cells were resuspended in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 25 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 18 °C for 60 min. Proteins in the supernatant fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Pellets were solubilized directly in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. For analysis, 10 μl of each sample were loaded on polyacrylamide slab gels for electrophoresis under reducing conditions (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins in slab gels were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with either mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) or rabbit antibodies against LBR (7.Collas P., J.-C. Courvalin J.-C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-7 cells were cultured, fixed, and prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (8.Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9.Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and used to detect mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning system attached to Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were processed using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) on a Macintosh G3 computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of MAN1 were compared with protein sequences in the GenBankTM data base and the nonredundant data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information World Wide Web site using the BLAST2 and PSI-BLAST programs (41.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis was performed using the method of Kyte and Doolittle (42.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar). The MAN1 amino acid sequence was further analyzed using Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA), a detailed description of which can be found elsewhere (43.Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.-P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Protein secondary structure predictions were also made using the PHD program (44.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment figures were generated using ESPript software (45.Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, routine chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs or Fisher.32P-nucleotides were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The MAN antigens are three proteins with molecular masses of approximately 80, 58, and 40 kDa that are localized to the nuclear envelope and recognized by autoantibodies in serum (MAN antiserum) from a patient with a collagen vascular disease (32.Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy have demonstrated that the MAN antigens are exclusively localized to the nuclear envelope, most likely the inner nuclear membrane (32.Paulin-Levasseur M. Blake D.L. Julien M. Rouleau L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We used unfractionated MAN antiserum to screen approximately 500,000 recombinant clones of a mouse P19 cell expression library, which led to the isolation of only one cDNA clone (deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AF112300) of 997 nucleotides with an open reading frame that encoded a novel polypeptide of 331 amino acids. The isolated cDNA did not contain an in-frame stop codon and was presumably a partial cDNA for a novel protein. Antibodies affinity-purified from the MAN antiserum against a β-galactosidase fusion protein containing the polypeptide expressed from this cDNA recognized proteins in HeLa and P19 cell extracts that corresponded to the proteins recognized by unpurified antiserum and exclusively labeled the nuclear envelope when examined by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). The isolated cDNA clone therefore very likely encoded a portion of one of the mouse MAN antigens or a highly related protein. Repeated screenings of mouse P19 cDNA libraries with the32P-labeled partial mouse cDNA did not lead to the isolation of additional cDNA clones with overlapping sequences. We therefore screened human DNA libraries to obtain overlapping clones that contained the complete coding sequence of human MAN1. The complete protein coding sequence was contained in one cDNA clone, and additional 5′ sequence was determined from one genomic DNA clone (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence of human MAN1 is shown in Fig.2 A. From the initiation ATG to the stop codon, the protein contains 754 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of MAN1 is 82,312 Da, and the theoretical pI is 6.18. The initiation ATG was assigned based on the fact that the deduced molecular mass of the encoded protein is virtually the same as the apparent molecular mass of the largest MAN antigen determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The next ATG in the 3′ direction is 264 nucleotides away in the cDNA sequence, which would result in a protein approximately 10 kDa smaller. There was an in-frame stop codon 135 nucleotides 5′ to the assigned initiation ATG. Over its entire length, MAN1 shows no significant sequence similarity to other proteins of known function in the translated GenBankTM data base. However, there are domains within MAN1 common to other proteins (see below). There are over 40 human EST sequences identical to portions of MAN1 and numerous expressed sequence tags with similar sequences from other organisms. From nucleotide 829 to 1077 (A of translation initiation codon designated as nucleotide 1), the nucleotide sequence of MAN1 is 100% identical to the sequence of a previously reported CpG island (46.Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). CpG islands are short stretches of DNA containing a high density of nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides, predominantly associated with coding regions. Hydropathy analysis shows that MAN1 contains two hydrophobic amino acid stretches (Fig. 2 B). These sequences meet the criteria for transmembrane segments. There is no hydrophobic amino-terminal signal sequence, strongly suggesting that if the first hydrophobic stretch in MAN1 is a transmembrane segment, the domain of approximately 470 amino acids that precedes it would be synthesized facing the cytoplasm and face the nucleoplasm when the protein is in the inner nuclear membrane (47.Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis further predicts that MAN1 has a carboxyl-terminal domain of approximately 100 amino acids following the second hydrophobic segment. The MAN1 protein coding sequence was contained within two isolated genomic DNA clones (Fig.3 A). Restriction mapping and partial sequencing of the two genomic DNA clones showed that they did not overlap and that the gap between them corresponded to a portion of intron 2 of the MAN1 gene. Further analysis showed that theMAN1 gene contains 10 exons and that the protein coding exons are 1–7 (Fig. 3 A). Part of exon 7 and exons 8–10 coded for sequences that are only present in the 3′-untranslated region. Radiation hybrid mapping using the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel assigned the MAN1 gene to chromosome 12q14. With a LOD score of 15 for linkage, the analysis placed it into the reference interval between the microsatellite anchor markers D12S83 (76.5 centimorgans) and D12S350 (87.6 centimorgans). The analysis showed the closest linkage (p > 3.00) of the MAN1 gene to marker WI-15930 and placed it 2.84 centiRays from marker AFMA066XB9 (Fig. 3 B). Northern blotting of poly(A)+-enriched RNA from human tissues and cell lines showed that MAN1 cDNA recognized a s"
https://openalex.org/W2001256354,"Type I interleukin-1 receptor is the prototype for a family of proteins, which play a central role in early responses to injury and infection. The similarity of function across the family is reflected in similarity in signaling: all members tested couple to activation of NFκB and stress kinases. The coupling to these pathways is mediated by a 200-residue intracellular domain (the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain), in which sequence conservation is primarily confined to three short motifs (boxes 1, 2, and 3) located at amino acid residue positions 10 (box 1), 60 (box 2), and 170 (box 3). We have analyzed the contribution of these motifs to function by alanine scanning mutagenesis of the human interleukin-1 receptor type I. Mutant receptors were tested for expression, ligand binding, activation of receptor-associated kinase(s), NFκB, stress kinases, and transcription. Mutations in all three motifs led to low cell surface expression. Mutants in box 3 were, however, wild type for signaling, whereas mutants in boxes 1 and 2 were defective. We conclude that the conserved motifs box 1 and box 2 mediate the coupling of molecules in the family to inflammation signaling pathways. Type I interleukin-1 receptor is the prototype for a family of proteins, which play a central role in early responses to injury and infection. The similarity of function across the family is reflected in similarity in signaling: all members tested couple to activation of NFκB and stress kinases. The coupling to these pathways is mediated by a 200-residue intracellular domain (the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain), in which sequence conservation is primarily confined to three short motifs (boxes 1, 2, and 3) located at amino acid residue positions 10 (box 1), 60 (box 2), and 170 (box 3). We have analyzed the contribution of these motifs to function by alanine scanning mutagenesis of the human interleukin-1 receptor type I. Mutant receptors were tested for expression, ligand binding, activation of receptor-associated kinase(s), NFκB, stress kinases, and transcription. Mutations in all three motifs led to low cell surface expression. Mutants in box 3 were, however, wild type for signaling, whereas mutants in boxes 1 and 2 were defective. We conclude that the conserved motifs box 1 and box 2 mediate the coupling of molecules in the family to inflammation signaling pathways. interleukin Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain IL-1 receptor associated kinase Interleukin-1α and interleukin-1β (IL-1α and IL-1β)1 are two polypeptide cytokines, which play a central role in coordinating immune and inflammatory responses (1.Dinarello C.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 216: 133-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These cytokines and a structurally related antagonist (IL-1ra) bind to a common receptor composed of two type I integral membrane proteins (IL1RI and IL1RAcP) (2.Sims J.E. March C.J. Cosman D.

These receptors couple to two major inflammatory signaling systems, NFκB and stress kinases. The family also contains a second subgroup of receptor molecules, type I membrane proteins with a TIR domain and an extracellular region composed of a series of leucine rich repeats, and the prototypic member is the insect protein Toll (4.Mitcham J.L.

Preliminary evidence suggests that these play a role in innate immunity, most compellingly that the lpsd mutation maps to the tlr4 locus (14.Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. VanHuffel C.

The family also contains several intracellular proteins, in particular a number of plant proteins, which are implicated in host defense (15.Whitman S. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Choi D. Hehl R. Corr C.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). It appears therefore that this family of molecules and the signal pathways they couple to represents an ancient host defense system present throughout the biological world (21.Rosetto M. Engstrom Y. Baldari C.T. Telford J.L. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). There are also several viral genes, which show significant homology to this family (8 and Fig. 1), and it has been suggested that like the B15R gene of vaccinia (22.Spriggs M.K. Hruby D.E.

IL-1R family receptors couple to downstream signaling pathways via a number of intermediates. Three pelle homologues have been found in mammals (IRAK-1, IRAK-2, and IRAK-M (19.Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 24.Grosshans J. Bergmann A. Haffter P. Nusslein-Volhard C.

Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The receptor complex also associates with TRAF-6 (28.Cao Z.D. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), myD88 (17.Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.D.

Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEB Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays have shown that IL-1 activates a receptor-associated kinase (33.Martin M. Bol G.F. Eriksson A. Resch K. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34.Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that the kinase activity of IRAKs is not necessary for IL-1 signaling (27.Wesche H. Gao X. Li X.X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). TRAF-6 is the upstream regulator of TAK-1 (35.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z.D. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and NFκB-inducing kinase (36.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) coupling IL-1R to activation of NFκB. To dissect the structure-function relationships in signal activation for the TIR family we have analyzed the effects of cytoplasmic domain point mutations on IL-1RI activity. The mutations we have generated have been placed into regions of the domain most conserved across the family. In addition we have mutated several other charged residues predicted to be at the protein surface. Several previous reports have described the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies of the IL-1R domain (34.Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37.Heguy A. Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Telford J.L. Melli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2605-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Kuno K. Okamoto S. Hirose K. Murakami S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13510-13518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general these have focused on the C-terminal conserved region (RFWXN, where X is a basic residue); the region first noted as suggesting a relationship between Drosophila Toll and IL-1RI (7.Gay N.J. Keith F.J. Nature. 1991; 351: 355-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this region is mainly involved in controlling receptor trafficking and that signaling interactions are mediated through two other conserved regions. Thus the receptor may interact with intracellular proteins through at least three sites, providing a rationale for the pattern of sequence conservation across this family of signaling proteins. All receptor constructs were cloned into pDC304, a variant of pDC302 (39.Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D. VandenBos T. Friend D. Alpert A. Anderson D. Jackson J. Wignall J.M. Smith C. Gallis B. Sims J.E. Urdal D. Widmer M.B. Cosman D. Park L.S. Cell. 1989; 59: 335-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To construct the wild type chimeric receptor, we first introduced a BglII site into the murine IL-1RI 3′ of the transmembrane domain. This caused a conservative amino acid sequence change from KVF to KIF (KIF is also the human IL-1RI sequence at this position). The cytoplasmic region of the human IL-1RI was then cloned into the expression construct afterBglII digestion of both receptor cDNAs. The result of an alignment of 29 members of the IL-1 receptor family using amino acid sequence fragments spanning the IL-1R homology domain is shown in Fig. 1. The degree of sequence conservation is plotted as the profile score (40.Gribskov M. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4355-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). The analysis reveals three short motifs in the human IL-1 receptor that are most conserved among the family members, YDAYILY (box 1), IYGRDDY (box 2), and TRFWKNV (box 3). In addition there is a region between box 2 and box 3 that shows a low but significant level of sequence homology across the family. We performed alanine substitution, selecting charged residues that, by hydrophobicity analysis, are predicted to lie in regions of the protein that are (a) predicted to be on the surface and (b) are conserved across the family. There were five exceptions K428A, R431A/S, E474A, K492A, and W514A, the first two in a predicted protein kinase C site (KKSRR) the third and fourth in poorly conserved regions, and the fifth a bulky hydrophobic residue, because mutants at these sites have been described previously. In addition we mutated Tyr-374 the C-terminal residue in box 1 to F, because this is more conservative than Y → A. In addition to the point mutants we also generated two triple substitution mutants, in box 1 and box 2 (368AAA: TYDAYILY→ AAAAILY and 411AAA: IYGRDDY → IYAAADY). We reasoned that this set of mutants would alter potential cytoplasmic binding sites with minimal perturbation of overall protein structure. All mutations were made using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and the appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides in the type I receptor construct HinMext (see above). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. We have shown previously that HinMext with a wild type cytoplasmic domain is functionally indistinguishable from human IL-1RI. Transfections were done with the DEAE/dextran method, followed by chloroquine treatment, as described, in 293-EBNA cells (human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the EBNA-1 nuclear antigen (41.McMahan C.J. Slack J.L. Mosley B. Cosman D. Lupton S.D. Brunton L.L. Grubin C.E. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cannizzano L.A. Benjamin D. Dower S.K. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2821-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). 72-h post-transfection, cells were bound with a125I-labeled rat monoclonal antibody (M5) to the murine IL-1RI or with 125I-labeled human IL-1α. Wells were washed, stripped with sodium hydroxide, and counted, and data were presented as total counts averaged over 2 wells. Controls were done in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled antibody or IL-1, and these values were subtracted from the data prior to analysis or presentation. Binding dose-response curves for 125I-labeled human IL-1a were done over a 1000-fold range in IL-1 concentration, and values for affinity constants and site numbers were determined by curve fitting with a simple one site binding model using MLAB for the Macintosh (Civilised Software, Silver Spring, MD). Analysis of total receptor expression was done by extracting transfected cells with 1% Triton X-100, spotting 1-ml aliquots onto nitrocellulose filters, blocking with binding medium containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, and incubating with 125I-labeled rat monoclonal antibody (M5) to the murine IL-1RI or with125I-labeled human IL-1α, as described previously (42.Urdal D.L. Call S.M. Jackson J.J. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2870-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the labeled probes to the receptor blots was analyzed either by γ-counting or by a PhosphorImager. IL-1a and muIL1RM5 were radiolabeled by the chloramine-T method as described elsewhere (42.Urdal D.L. Call S.M. Jackson J.J. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2870-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1α was recombinant human protein prepared as described previously from crude material expressed in Escherichia coli(43.Dower S.K. Kronheim S. Hopp T.P. Cantrell M. Deeley M. Henney C.S. Gillis S. Urdal D.L. Nature. 1986; 324: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). 2 days post-transfection, confluent transfected cells were stimulated with 1.0 ng/ml huIL-1α for 30 min for the NF-κB assay. For the Thr-669 kinase assay (44.Bird T.A. Sleath P.R. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22661-22670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation was with 10.0 ng/ml huIL-1 for 15 min. For the IL-8 promoter activation assay, cells were stimulated 1 day post-transfection with 1 ng/ml huIL-1 for 12–16 h. P3 antibody (a polyclonal sheep serum raised against human IL-1R type I) was added 5 min prior to stimulation at a 1:100 dilution to all assays. The antibody does not recognize the mouse extracellular domain of Hin-Mext. For the NFκB gel shift assays, nuclear extracts were prepared as described (4.Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5777-5783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) from transfected cell samples, 2 days post-transfection, after appropriate blocking (P3) and IL-1 stimulation. A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide probe (5′-TGACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGA-3′) containing the kB enhancer element from the immunoglobulin k light chain was 5′-end-labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (10 mg of total protein) were incubated with radiolabeled probe for 20 min at room temperature, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in 0.5 × Tris-borate EDTA, 10% polyacrylamide gels (Novex). The gels were dried and imaged on a PhosphorImager. Quantitative analysis of the images was done using the ImageQuant package (Molecular Dynamics). For the Thr-669 kinase assays (44.Bird T.A. Sleath P.R. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22661-22670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from transfected cell samples 2 days post-transfection after appropriate blocking and stimulation. 10 ml of extract was added to 20 ml of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm ATP (kinase buffer), 75 μmCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 750 mm substrate peptide (residues 663–673 of EGFR). Blanks were incubated with distilled H20 in place of the peptide. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of formic acid and cleared by centrifugation, and 30 ml of supernatant were spotted on phosphocellulose paper discs. After washing (three times with 75 mm orthophosphoric acid) and drying, peptide-incorporated counts were determined by Cerenkov counting. Results are expressed as the ratio of Thr-669 kinase activity in cells treated with P3 alone to cells treated with P3 plus IL-1. For IL-1 receptor-associated kinase assays, cells (1 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well tissue culture plate) were transfected with 1000 ng of chimeric wild type or mutant receptors. 2 days post-transfection cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1 or left unstimulated, extracted, and immunoprecipitated with the nonblocking rat monoclonal antibody (M5) to the murine IL-1RI. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1, in kinase buffer (see above), washed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (33.Martin M. Bol G.F. Eriksson A. Resch K. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the IL-8 promoter activation assay cells (1 × 105cells/well in a 12-well tissue culture plate) were cotransfected with 500 ng of chimeric wild type or mutant receptor and 1500 ng of the pIL8p reporter plasmid. 1 day post-transfection, the medium was changed, and the cells were blocked with the P3 polyclonal antibody at a 1:100 dilution and either stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1 or left unstimulated. 12–16 h post-stimulation, cells were washed twice with binding medium (RPMI 1640, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide) containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and blocked with 2 ml of the same medium at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 60–90 min with 1.5 ml/well of the same medium containing 1 μg/ml of the mouse anti-human IL-2R a antibody 2A3 (45.Dower S.K. Hefeneider S.H. Alpert A.R. Urdal D.L. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with gentle rocking. Cells were washed once with the same medium and incubated with 1 ml/well of the same medium containing 1:100 dilution of 125I-goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with the same medium and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, stripped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH, and total counts were determined. Results are expressed as total cpm averaged over two wells. 293 EBNA cells (1 × 105 cells/well) cultured in 8-well Lab-Tek Chambered coverglasses were transfected with 1000 ng of plasmid DNA by the DEAE dextran method, cultured for a further 72 h, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (nonpermeabilized) or with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (permeabilized). Autofluorescence was quenched by treatment with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. For the permeabilized cell analysis, cells were then incubated for 1 h in blocking/permeabilization buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were then incubated with rat monoclonal antibody (M5) to the murine IL-1RI (1 μg/ml in blocking or blocking/permeabilization buffer) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with blocking/permeabilization buffer and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin (Molecular Probes, 2 μg/ml in blocking/permeabilization buffer) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with buffer and incubated with a streptavidin Texas Red conjugate (Molecular Probes) at 0.2 μg/ml in buffer for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in 100 mg/ml DABCO (1,4 diaxabicyclo [2.2.2] octane) in 50% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline. Data were acquired with a Multiprobe 2001 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Molecular Dynamics) interfaced to a Silicon Graphics workstation, using the 568 nm line of a krypton/argon mixed gas laser, a 50-μm pinhole, and a 60x Plan Apo oil immersion objective. After acquisition, data files were exported to a Macintosh, converted to 8 bit TIFF images, and imported into Photoshop for compositing for presentation. All mutants were tested for cell surface expression after transient expression in 293-EBNA cells. Mutations in all three conserved motifs generated a low expression phenotype (Fig. 2). It is not clear from this experiment whether the apparent depression in expression results from a decrease in affinity for ligand or a decrease in receptor expression. However we show below that the affinity of all mutants for ligand is indistinguishable from the chimera with a wild type cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 6). The effect appears to be clear cut, mutants either fall into a group that are wild type for expression or into a low expression group. Because all three conserved motifs appeared to be involved, subsequent transfection experiments were modified to compensate, for wild type expressers, 50 ng of expression plasmid were used, and for low expressers, 1000 ng, because this is saturating for expression in the system. The expected cell surface expression is indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 2.Figure 6Quantitative analysis of mutant IL-1 receptor function. Upper panel, lack of effect of cytoplasmic domain mutations on IL-1α binding activity of the receptor. 293-EBNA cells were transfected and cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequently cells were incubated with125I-IL-1α spanning a 1000-fold range in concentration (10 points). Unlabeled IL-1 was added to determine nonspecific binding (2 points) as described previously, and data were corrected by subtraction. Counts were determined by γ-counting. Data were converted to molecules ligand bound/cell and free ligand concentration (M) and analyzed by nonlinear least square fitting of a simple one site binding model using MLAB. The affinity constants are shown with the S.E. derived from the curve fit as the error bar. Middle panel, quantitative analysis of the effect of cytoplasmic domain mutations on the capacity of IL-1 receptor to activate NFκB DNA binding activity in response to ligand binding. Data from electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments were obtained using a PhosphorImager, and the 16 bit digital images were analyzed using ImageQuant software. The NFκB activity in 293-EBNA cells is detected as two bands, a faster moving band, which is constitutive, and a slower band, which is IL-1-inducible; only the slower band was used in the analysis. Data are expressed as the ratio of band intensity after 30 min of IL-1α treatment with that observed in an untreated cultured transfected with the same receptor construct and cultured in parallel. Lower panel, quantitative analysis of the effect of cytoplasmic domain mutations on the capacity of IL-1 receptor to activate stress kinases in response to ligand binding. Transfected cultures were extracted and analyzed for the capacity to phosphorylate the stress kinase substrate peptide (residues 663–673 of EGFR) as described elsewhere (44.Bird T.A. Sleath P.R. deRoos P.C. Dower S.K. Virca G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22661-22670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the ratio of activity after 15 min of IL-1α treatment (10 ng/ml; 6 × 10−10m with that observed in an untreated cultured transfected with the same receptor construct and cultured in parallel. Error bars are from triplicate assays (S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze this further, the binding of the rat anti-mouse type I IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibody (M5) was compared with that of IL-1. All transfected cells bound both antibody and IL-1 with 50% as many antibody binding sites as IL-1 binding sites (Fig.3 A), irrespective of the level of IL-1 binding sites present. This is consistent with bivalent binding of the antibody, as shown previously. M5 is a nonblocking antibody and recognizes an epitope outside the IL-1 binding site, thus the constant ratio of ligand to antibody bound suggests that none of the mutant receptors have any gross perturbation of ligand binding. Further the data show that at the doses established from Fig. 2, the low expresser group express at the cell surface in the same range as the wild type group. The total level of expression (cell surface and intracellular) of all mutants was determined by M5 and by IL-1 binding in a dot blot assay as described previ"
https://openalex.org/W2000460384,"Oxidizing conditions must be maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to allow the formation of disulfide bonds in secretory proteins. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a mammalian gene (ERO1-L) that shares extensive homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERO1 gene, required in yeast for oxidative protein folding. When expressed in mammalian cells, the product of the human ERO1-L gene co-localizes with ER markers and displays Endo-H-sensitive glycans. In isolated microsomes, ERO1-L behaves as a type II integral membrane protein. ERO1-L is able to complement several phenotypic traits of the yeast thermosensitive mutant ero1-1, including temperature and dithiothreitol sensitivity, and intrachain disulfide bond formation in carboxypeptidase Y. ERO1-L is no longer functional when either one of the highly conserved Cys-394 or Cys-397 is mutated. These results strongly suggest that ERO1-L is involved in oxidative ER protein folding in mammalian cells."

The enoyl-ACP1 reductase (FabI) catalyzes the last step in each cycle and plays a regulatory role in determining the rate of fatty acid synthesis (3.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

The FabI enzymes are receiving increased attention not only because of their regulatory significance, but also because of the recent discovery that inhibitors of this step in the pathway are effective antibacterials. The diazoborines inactivate FabI through the formation of a covalent bond with NADH in the active site of the enzyme (5.Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R.

Triclosan is a slow-binding inhibitor that inactivates the enzyme via the formation of a stable, non-covalent, FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E.

Triclosan is used as an antibacterial additive in a wide range of consumer goods, including cutting boards, mattress pads, facial cleansers, and hand soaps (15.Bhargava H.N. Leonard P.A. Am. J. Infect. Control. 1996; 24: 209-218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Triclosan has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and is effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Prior to the identification of FabI as the intracellular target of triclosan, it was widely believed that its antimicrobial action resulted from nonspecific disruption of cellular membranes (16.Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica. 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17.Vischer W.A. Regös J. Zentbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt Orig.

Hexachlorophene is another antimicrobial compound used in disinfectants and surgical scrubs (19.Jungermann E. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1968; 45: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20.Molnar N.M. J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 1969; 20: 103-108Google Scholar). Hexachlorophene has a more limited spectrum of biological activity than triclosan, being most active against Gram-positive bacteria, especially strains ofStaphylococcus, but less effective against Gram-negative organisms (21.Gump W.S. Walter G.R. Lawrence C.A. Block S.S. The bis-Phenols. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1968: 257-277Google Scholar). Hexachlorophene is thought to act by disrupting bacterial membranes, although it is unclear as to whether this is the primary mode of action (22.Corner T.R. Joswick H.L. Silvernale J.N. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 501-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Joswick H.L. Corner T.R. Silvernale J.N. Gerhardt P. J.

Hexachlorophene and triclosan are strikingly similar compounds (Fig. 1). In particular, hexachlorophene contains the hydroxyphenyl moiety that is essential for the activity of triclosan and related hydroxydiphenylethers (10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The similarities in their structures and their proposed mechanisms of action prompted us to determine whether hexachlorophene was also a FabI inhibitor. Since hexachlorophene is selectively effective against Gram-positive organisms and FabI enzymes have not been characterized from this group of bacteria, we cloned and expressed the FabI protein ofStaphylococcus aureus to investigate whether a unique FabI protein may account for the differential sensitivity ofEscherichia coli and S. aureus to hexachlorophene, or whether hexachlorophene interacts with a different target in Gram-positive bacteria. Both S. aureus FabI (saFabI) and E. coli FabI (ecFabI), are inhibited by hexachlorophene and triclosan; however, FabI is unlikely to be a biologically relevant target for the antibacterial activity of hexachlorophene due to the inability of this drug to form a ternary complex with FabI and the nucleotide cofactor. His-tag FabI and FabI(G93V) from E. coli were purified as described previously (3.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Thetrans-2-octenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine,trans-2-butenoyl-n-acetylcysteamine, and 2,2′-dihyroxydiphenylether were the generous gifts from Rocco Gogglioti and John Domagala at Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals. KIC (Aromonk, NJ) supplied the triclosan while hexachlorophene, 2,2′-dihydroxydiphenylmethane, and 2,2′-dihydroxy-4,4′-dichlorodiphenylmethane were purchased from TCI America. Sigma provided NADH and NADPH. American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. supplied the [2,8-3H-adenine]NAD+ (specific activity: 25 Ci/mmol). All other reagents were of the highest available grade. The fabI gene fromS. aureus was identified in the unfinished microbial genomic database by comparison with ecFabI. The fabI gene was cloned from the genome of S. aureus strain RN4220 using the primers RJH101 (bp 1–32) (5′-CATATGTTAAATCTTGAAAACAAAACGTATGTCAT) and RJH102 (bp 771–745) (5′-GGATCCTTATTTAATTGCGTGGAATCCGCTATC) and ligated into the TA vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The gene was sequenced and then excised with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pET15b digested with the same enzymes. This construct, pETsaI, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for expression following isopropylthiogalactoside induction. The NH2-terminal His-tagged protein was purified by Ni2+ chelation chromatography. Following purification, the protein was exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm EDTA by dialysis overnight. Omission of the EDTA led to precipitation of saFabI in the dialysis tubing. The protein was homogeneous as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The yields and purity were similar to those reported previously for ecFabI (3.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Plasmid pETsaI was digested with XbaI and EcoRV, and the 0.8-kilobase pair fragment was ligated into similarly digested pBluescript KSII(+) to create pAN2 to express saFabI in E. coli. pAN2 was transformed into strain RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) and plated at 30 °C. Individual colonies were then tested for growth at 42 °C by spotting onto LB agar plates. Controls were RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) transformed with either pFabI (10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E.

Reduction oftrans-2-enoyl-N-acetylcysteamine substrates was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, a standard reaction contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 μm trans-2-octenoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, 200 μm NADH or NADPH, and 6 μg of FabI in a final volume of 300 μl. Decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 25 °C for the linear period of the assay (usually the first 1–2 min). Modifications to this assay are noted in the text and figure legends where applicable. The rate of substrate-independent hydrolysis of NAD(P)H was monitored and subtracted from each point from at least two independent experiments. Kinetic parameters were obtained by varying the concentration of cofactor or substrate as indicated. Drugs were added as serial dilutions from a stock in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the final volume of carrier was kept constant (1.7%) through the entire assay. In one series of experiments, the enzyme and drug were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to addition to the assay, and the change in absorbance was followed with time. Assays were performed as described (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, containing 4 μm NAD+ (specific activity, 4 Ci/mmol), 1 μg/ml triclosan, and 8 μg of protein in a total volume of 50 μl and were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, then placed into an Ultrafree-Probind centrifugal filtration unit containing a 0.2-cm2, 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). These units were then centrifuged, and the filter was washed with 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer and then counted in 5 ml of ScintSafe scintillation fluid. The MIC values were determined by the microbroth dilution assay according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods for antimicrobial susceptibility tests for aerobically growing bacteria (Approved Standard M7-A2, NCCLS, Villanova, PA, 1990). All of the determinations were performed twice with comparable results. Approximately 6.5 × 108 cells of strain RN4220 (25.Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of Staphylococci. VCH Publishers, New York1990Google Scholar) were plated on to brain-heart infusion agar medium (Becton-Dickinson) containing 0.5 μg/ml triclosan. The plates were incubated at 37 °C with periodic monitoring. After 48 h, resistant clones were picked and their phenotype confirmed by regrowth on the original selective concentration of triclosan. The S. aureus fabI gene from triclosan-resistant mutants was characterized by double-strand nucleotide sequencing of PCR products amplified from chromosomal DNA (26.Pitcher D.G. Saunder N.A. Owen R.J. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1989; 8: 151-156Crossref Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). All PCR reactions utilized PCR SuperMix (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). The reactions contained 100 μm of the primer GER68 (5′-ATGTTAAATCTTGAAAACAAAAC; complementary to bp 1–23) and primer GER71 (5′-TTATTTAATTGCGTGGAATCCGC; complementary to bp 771–749). Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencing system using a PRISM Sequenase® dye terminator sequencing kit using GER68, GER71, and two additional internal fabI primers (5′-GCGGGACGCTTTTCTGAAACTTCACG and 5′-CGCCACCTAAATATGTTGTTGCAACAATGC) to ensure complete coverage. A chromosomal DNA plasmid library derived from strain RN4220 was constructed by ligating sucrose gradient-purified Sau3A1 fragments (3–7 kilobase pairs) into BamHI-restricted plasmid pSK265 (27.Jones C.L. Kahn S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 29-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation into strain RN4220, approximately 2,000 clones were pooled and frozen at −70 °C. A 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of an overnight culture of this library incubated in tryptic soy broth plus chloramphenicol (7 μg/ml) at 37 °C was plated onto brain-heart infusion medium containing 7 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 0.5 μg/ml triclosan. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, resistant clones were confirmed by regrowth on the same media. To confirm the presence of safabI on the plasmid of the all the resistant clones, two PCR reactions were performed per isolate. Each reaction contained safabI-specific primer GER71 and either primer GER23 (5′-GTTTTATGCCTAAAAACCTACAG) or GER24 (5′-GAATTAGAATATATTTATTTGGCTC), which flank the multiple cloning site of plasmid pSK265. In all cases, the isolated plasmids harbored the safabI gene. The gene for thetrans-2-enoyl-ACP reductase from S. aureus was identified by a BLAST search of the preliminary sequence data of unfinished microbial genomes obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research web site. The predicted protein sequence was 48% identical to ecFabI (Fig. 2) and included the YX 6K sequence motif containing the key tyrosine and lysine active site residues. 2R. J. Heath and C. O. Rock, unpublished observations. The gene was amplified by PCR from the chromosome of S. aureus strain RN4220 and cloned into the expression vector pET15b. Homogeneous protein was obtained by Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). We utilized the spectrophotometric assay described under “Experimental Procedures” to analyze the nucleotide dependence of ecFabI and saFabI (Fig. 3). The ecFabI exhibited a marked preference for NADH over NADPH (Fig.3 A). The apparent K m of ecFabI for NADH was 25 ± 4 μm (Fig. 3 A,inset). We were not able to get a reliable estimate for the NADPH K m for ecFabI due to the low reaction rates, even at high enzyme concentrations. However, it was clear that the apparent K m was >2 mm. Whereas saFabI utilized NADH as a cofactor, the specific activity was very low; however, when NADPH was employed, a robust rate was observed (Fig.3 B). The saFabI displayed non-linear kinetics with NADPH, and a distinct upward curvature of the double-reciprocal plot indicated positive cooperative NADPH binding (Fig. 3 B,inset). The data fitted almost perfectly to a second order polynomial equation (r 2 = 0.9997), and analysis by a Hill plot revealed that NADPH binding to saFabI was highly cooperative with a Hill coefficient, n H, of 2.2 (Fig. 3 C). The cofactor concentration that yielded 50% of the maximal rate was 65 μm. The very low rate of reaction with NADH precluded a detailed analysis of NADH binding to saFabI, but the apparent K m was >1 mm. Analysis of the ecFabI and saFabI with crotonyl-N-acetylcysteamine and NADH or NADPH, respectively, revealed that both enzymes also had similar affinities for this substrate analog (ecFabI,K m = 5 ± 0.3 mm andV max = 2 ± 0.5 nmol/min/μg; saFabI,K m = 8 ± 0.3 mm andV max = 0.3 ± 0.1 nmol/min/μg). The gene for saFabI was expressed in E. coli using plasmid pAN2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The introduction of plasmid pAN2 into strain RJH13 (fabI(Ts)) (3.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) complemented the temperature-sensitive growth defect of this strain at 42 °C. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of the transformed strains by gas-liquid chromatography show a normal E. coliprofile that was the same as the parent strain (data not shown). Additionally, saFabI was able to substitute for ecFabI in the type II fatty acid synthase system reconstituted in vitro with purified enzymes of E. coli (data not shown). These experiments illustrated that saFabI was functionally equivalent to ecFabI and was capable of catalyzing all of the reactions required for the synthesis of straight chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The efficacy of hexachlorophene as a FabI inhibitor was compared with triclosan in a series of kinetic experiments where the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and initial rates were measured over the first 90 s of the reaction (Fig. 4). ecFabI was inhibited by triclosan with an IC50 of 2 μm in this assay (Fig. 4 A), which was essentially identical to the result obtained previously (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The saFabI was also inhibited by triclosan with an IC50 of 3 μm (Fig.4 A), demonstrating that saFabI was also a target for triclosan. As expected, the ecFabI(G93V) active site mutant was more resistant to triclosan inhibition (Fig. 4 A and Ref.12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Hexachlorophene also inhibited ecFabI and saFabI in this in vitro assay (Fig. 4 B). Both enzymes exhibited an IC50 of approximately 4 μm, making hexachlorophene almost as potent a FabI inhibitor in this kinetic assay as triclosan. The ecFabI(G93V) protein was resistant to hexachlorophene inhibition (Fig. 4 B), indicating that hexachlorophene, like triclosan, functioned by interacting with the FabI active site. Triclosan is a particularly effective FabI inhibitor due to the slow formation of a stable, ternary FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex, and this property of triclosan is responsible for its antibacterial activity (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Two methods were used to determine if hexachlorophene also formed a similar ternary complex with FabI. First, a binding assay with [3H]NAD+ and ecFabI was performed (Fig. 5). ecFabI forms a stable ternary complex with NAD+ and triclosan, resulting in the isolation of radiolabeled ecFabI in the presence of triclosan. In contrast, hexachlorophene did not trigger an increase in [3H]NAD+ binding, indicating that a ternary ecFabI-NAD+-hexachlorophene complex did not form. ecFabI did not bind detectable amounts of [3H]NAD+in the absence of triclosan. We were unable to demonstrate ternary complex formation with saFabI using this assay. However, since saFabI has a low affinity for NADH (Fig. 3), this negative result was likely due to the poor interaction of the radiolabeled ligand with the enzyme. Labeled NADP+ was not available, precluding similar experiments with this cofactor. The second method used to detect ternary complex formation was to examine the effect of preincubation of the enzymes with drug on the kinetics of the reaction (Fig. 6). Slow-binding inhibitors form time-dependent, stable complexes during the preincubation period, resulting in little to no reaction rate following initiation of the reaction by the addition of substrate. In contrast, inhibitors that do not form tight binding complexes exhibit kinetic behavior in reactions initiated with substrate that is indistinguishable from initiating the reaction with the addition of enzyme (28.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Triclosan exhibits the hallmarks of a slow-binding inhibitor. The FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex takes several minutes to form and eventually results in complete inhibition (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This experiment clearly showed that triclosan was a slow-binding, dead end inhibitor with either ecFabI (Fig.6 A) or saFabI (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, triclosan inactivated saFabI with essentially the same time course as we observed previously with ecFabI (data not shown) (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In contrast, hexachlorophene did not irreversibly inhibit either of the FabI enzymes (Fig. 6), but rather the inhibition pattern was similar to that observed when enzyme was used to initiate the reaction (Fig. 5). Thus, triclosan formed a stable inhibitory complex with ecFabI and saFabI; however, hexachlorophene did not form a slowly dissociating ternary complex with either FabI enzyme. Triclosan and hexachlorophene have two structural differences that could account for the different behavior of the compounds as FabI inhibitors. A carbon bond in hexachlorophene replaces the ether bond in triclosan, and the oxygen bridge may be critical to the formation of a ternary complex. Alternately, hexachlorophene has two hydroxyl groups and three additional bulky chlorine atoms that may interfere with the proper positioning of the molecule within the FabI active site. Molecular modeling of the energy-minimized hexachlorophene structure overlaid on the FabI-NAD+-triclosan structure indicated that neither the extra hydroxyl group nor the chlorine substituents would interfere with drug binding. We further investigated the structural basis for the differences in activity by testing three additional compounds as FabI inhibitors. Dihydroxydiphenylether was a potent ecFabI inhibitor; however, dihydroxydiphenylmethane was not (Fig. 7). The only difference in these two compounds is the substitution of a carbon for the oxygen bridging the two phenyl rings. We also examined a dihydroxydichlorodiphenylmethane (Fig. 7). This compound was not a very potent ecFabI inhibitor, although it was more effective than the compound without the chlorine substituents. The chlorine on the 4-position of triclosan promotes tight binding of the drug to the FabI active site by forming a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone amide of Ala-95 (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Increased opportunities for hydrogen bond formation between the chlorines and the protein is one possible explanation for understanding the potency of hexachlorophene as a FabI inhibitor compared with analogs that lack chlorine substitutions. These data indicated that the ether linkage was an essential feature for ternary complex formation, and that the presence of the chlorine atoms on hexachlorophene promoted, rather than attenuated, its interaction with FabI. The MIC for triclosan and hexachlorophene were determined on a panel of S. aureusand E. coli strains (Table I). As expected from previously published work (21.Gump W.S. Walter G.R. Lawrence C.A. Block S.S. The bis-Phenols. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1968: 257-277Google Scholar), E. coli was resistant to hexachlorophene, whereas S. aureus was sensitive to the compound. E. coli and S. aureuswere both sensitive to triclosan (16.Regös J. Zak O. Solf R. Vischer W.A. Weirich E.G. Dermatologica. 1979; 158: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21.Gump W.S. Walter G.R. Lawrence C.A. Block S.S. The bis-Phenols. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1968: 257-277Google Scholar). Both the presence of multiple plasmid-borne copies of the fabI gene and missense mutations confer triclosan resistance to E. coli (10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and neither of these had any effect on the already high level of resistance of this organism to hexachlorophene (Table I). However, FabI could be the hexachlorophene target in S. aureus if resistance to this compound in E. coli was due to the inability of the drug to penetrate the cell or to the presence of an active mechanism to efflux hexachlorophene. Therefore, we generated triclosan-resistantS. aureus mutants and tested them for cross-resistance to hexachlorophene. First, we selected triclosan-resistant S. aureus on 0.5 μg/ml triclosan and then sequenced thesafabI gene to determine if it was altered. A single missense mutation in the safabI gene that converted saFabI to saFabI(G23S) increased the resistance of S. aureus to triclosan by an order of magnitude (Table I). Second, we introduced thesafabI gene on plasmid pTri-1 into S. aureus and observed increased resistance to triclosan. However, neither of these manipulations affected the sensitivity of the cells to hexachlorophene. These data are consistent with triclosan targeting the FabI in S. aureus, and suggest that FabI inhibition is not a component of the biocidal activity of hexachlorophene against this organism.Table ITriclosan-resistant bacteria were not cross-resistant to hexachloropheneBacterial strainsMICaMICs of drugs were determined according to the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards as described under “Experimental Procedures.”TriclosanHexachloropheneμg/mlS. aureus RN4220 (wild-type)0.251 RN4220/pTri-1bThe wild-type FabI proteins from either S. aureusor E. coli were expressed using plasmids pTri-1 or pFabI, respectively, to determine if resistance was conferred by the presence of multiple copies of the fabI genes.21 GR664 (fabIG23S)21E. coli W3110 (wild-type)cStrain genotypes and derivations are described in Ref. 10.0.5>64 W3110/pFabI2>64 RJH108 (fabIG93V)32>64a MICs of drugs were determined according to the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b The wild-type FabI proteins from either S. aureusor E. coli were expressed using plasmids pTri-1 or pFabI, respectively, to determine if resistance was conferred by the presence of multiple copies of the fabI genes.c Strain genotypes and derivations are described in Ref. 10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T.

Open table in a new tab The Gram-negative (ecFabI) and Gram-positive (saFabI) enoyl-ACP reductases have many properties in common, but are distinguished by their cofactor selectivities. The cofactor specificity of ecFabI has been the subject of some debate. The initial report of enoyl-ACP reductase activity in cell extracts suggested that two enzymes were present in E. coli, one requiring NADH and the other utilizing NADPH (29.Weeks G. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1180-1189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH optima of the two enzymes were slightly different, with the NADH activity being maximal at pH 7.5 and the NADPH activity preferring pH 6.5. Subsequent genetic and biochemical experiments lead to the conclusion that there is only a single NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase gene in E. coli (3.Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26538-26542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 30.Bergler H. Wallner P. Ebeling A. Leitinger B. Fuchsbichler S. Aschauer H. Kollenz G. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5493-5496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Bergler et al. (31.Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) recently reported that ecFabI has both NADH- and NADPH-dependent activities. The NADPH-dependent activity was only revealed when ecFabI was purified at acidic pH, and this activity was irreversibly lost when the pH was raised to 7.0 or above (31.Bergler H. Fuchsbichler S. Högenauer G. Turnowsky F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have attempted to exactly repeat these experiments without success, and conclude from our present study that ecFabI is highly selective for NADH. In contrast, saFabI is clearly a NADPH-dependent reductase that exhibits a high degree of positive cooperativity. This property cannot be considered characteristic of Gram-positive FabI enzymes because the enoyl-ACP reductase from Bacillus subtilis is a NADH-dependent enzyme.2Otherwise, saFabI has specific activities that are very similar to ecFabI for synthetic substrates and is able to complement E. coli strains that are defective in ecFabI. S. aureusproduces branched-chain fatty acids (32.White D.C. Frerman F.E. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 2198-2209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its ability to substitute for ecFabI in an organism that produces straight-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids illustrates the broad substrate specificity of enoyl-ACP reductases. The structural similarities between triclosan and hexachlorophene suggest that they have a common target, and both drugs inhibit enoyl-ACP reductases in vitro. The resistance of FabI(G93V) to both triclosan and hexachlorophene support the concept that both drugs interact with FabI in the vicinity of the substrate binding site. However, the resistance of E. coli to hexachlorophene and the genetic analysis of S. aureus argues that FabI is not a biologically relevant target for the cellular action of hexachlorophene. The ability of FabI inhibitors to form stable ternary complexes with the enzyme is the critical feature required for antibacterial activity (Fig. 8). This class of agents are called slow-binding inhibitors because inhibitor complexes with the enzyme take a long time (seconds to minutes) to form relative to the catalytic rate (28.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to a slow conformational isomerization of the enzyme-drug complex from a state where the enzyme and drug are in rapid equilibrium to a state where the enzyme-drug complex undergoes very slow dissociation (Fig. 8). Triclosan exhibits all the hallmarks of a classic slow-binding inhibitor. The inhibition of FabI by triclosan becomes progressively stronger with time and is essentially irreversible after several minutes (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This irreversible inhibition correlates with the formation of a stable FabI-NAD+-triclosan ternary complex (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13.Levy C.W. Roujeinikova A. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. Nature. 1999; 398: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) that is accompanied by a conformational change in a flexible loop in FabI including residues 194 to 210 (14.Stewart M.J. Parikh S. Xiao G. Tonge P.J. Kisker C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The diazaborines are another class of potent FabI inhibitors that act via the formation of a tight binding bisubstrate complex (6.Baldock C. de Boer G.-J. Rafferty J.B. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The formation of the FabI-NAD+-diazaborine inhibitory complex is also accompanied by an analogous conformational change in this flexible loop (5.Baldock C. Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Hawkes T.R. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 2107-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, hexachlorophene neither exhibits the kinetic properties of a slow-binding inhibitor nor forms a ternary complex. Our results point to the ether linkage in triclosan as a structural feature that is essential to the formation of the inhibitory ternary complex. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that dihydroxydiphenylether is a FabI inhibitor, whereas dihydroxydiphenylmethane is not. Triclosan is sandwiched between the protein and the cofactor and a hydrogen bond network and stacking interactions form the bridge that connects the drug, protein and NAD+ (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13.Levy C.W. Roujeinikova A. Sedelnikova S.

Biol. 1999; 290: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Clearly, the substitution of a carbon bridge in hexachlorophene for the ether oxygen in triclosan results in a compound that cannot orient itself to optimally participate in this network. This is most likely attributed to the different angle of the carbon bridge compared with the ether bridge, preventing hexachlorophene from forming hydrogen bond connections and the stacking interactions with NAD+. Stewart et al. (14.Stewart M.J. Parikh S. Xiao G. Tonge P.J. Kisker C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) propose that the ether oxygen of triclosan is part of a hydrogen bond network that also includes the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-156, triclosan, and the NAD+ ribose (14.Stewart M.J. Parikh S. Xiao G. Tonge P.J. Kisker C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, the distance between these atoms is about 4 Å in the various published structures (12.Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 13.Levy C.W. Roujeinikova A. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rice D.W.

Biol. 1999; 290: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and it seems unlikely that this weak hydrogen bond acceptor will significantly contribute to the binding affinity at that distance. The substitution of a thioether for the ether in hydroxydiphenyl compounds also significantly reduces antibacterial activity (10.Heath R.J., Yu, Y.-T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), indicating that the bulkier sulfur atom also prevents the proper alignment of the aromatic rings and hydroxyl group in the FabI active site. Thus, the presence of the ether oxygen is clearly important in promoting tight drug binding and the ensuing conformational change that leads to essentially irreversible FabI inhibition and potent antibacterial activity.

https://openalex.org/W2080165775,"Based on homology with GLUT1-5, we have isolated a cDNA for a novel glucose transporter, GLUTX1. This cDNA encodes a protein of 478 amino acids that shows between 29 and 32% identity with rat GLUT1-5 and 32-36% identity with plant and bacterial hexose transporters. Unlike GLUT1-5, GLUTX1 has a short extracellular loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 1 and TM2 and a long extracellular loop between TM9 and TM10 that contains the only N-glycosylation site. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, GLUTX1 showed strong transport activity only after suppression of a dileucine internalization motif present in the amino-terminal region. Transport activity was inhibited by cytochalasin B and partly competed by D-fructose and D-galactose. The Michaelis-Menten constant for glucose was approximately 2 mM. When translated in reticulocytes lysates, GLUTX1 migrates as a 35-kDa protein that becomes glycosylated in the presence of microsomal membranes. Western blot analysis of GLUTX1 transiently expressed in HEK293T cells revealed a diffuse band with a molecular mass of 37-50 kDa that could be converted to a approximately 35-kDa polypeptide following enzymatic deglycosylation. Immunofluorescence microscopy detection of GLUTX1 transfected into HEK293T cells showed an intracellular staining. Mutation of the dileucine internalization motif induced expression of GLUTX1 at the cell surface. GLUTX1 mRNA was detected in testis, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and adrenal gland. We hypothesize that, in a similar fashion to GLUT4, in vivo cell surface expression of GLUTX1 may be inducible by a hormonal or other stimulus."

The class I PI3Ks are the best characterized and most intensely studied.Class I PI3Ks use PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrates leading to the formation of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns (3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively, which all could act as potential secondary messengers (11.Toker A.

Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The p85 adapters contain Src homology 2 domains, thereby linking class IA catalytic subunits to protein-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. In contrast, the class IB PI3K p110γ catalytic subunit is directly activated by βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (14.Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Tight association with the p101 regulatory adapter allows translocation of p110γ to the nucleus (15.Metjian A. Roll R.L. Ma A.D. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27943-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, through activation of p110γ, stimulation of a variety of G protein-coupled receptors can increase the level of 3′-phosphorylated PtdIns, which in turn act as potent signaling molecules (7.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The pleckstrin homology domain containing protein PKB/v-Akt, is of interest because of its role in activation of cell survival signals (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence has linked PI3K to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), making it a potential intermediate enzyme in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.To date little is known about PI3K signaling in heart. Given the importance of phosphoinositides in cellular function and the link between PI3K, heterotrimeric G proteins, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, we sought to determine whether PI3K is activated during in vivo cardiac pressure overload. We further wanted to determine the mechanism for PI3K activation in cardiac hypertrophy.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have implicated PI3K in a wide array of cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking (24.Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), actin cytoskeleton regulation (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Considering its widening role as an important signaling molecule, we sought to determine whether activity of PI3K was altered in in vivo cardiac hypertrophy. The data presented in this study provide evidence for isoform specific regulation of PI3K during the cardiac hypertrophic process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K is Gβγ-dependent and, moreover, the specific Gβγ subunits responsible are derived from the Gq class of heterotrimeric G proteins.Regulation of hypertrophic growth is by the induction of a number of key signaling cascades involving G protein-coupled receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, receptor tyrosine kinase, and janus kinase/signal tranducers and activators of transcription pathways (26.Force T.

In this study we show an increase in the PI3K activity duringin vivo pressure overload hypertrophy. Importantly, recent studies have identified PI3K as an active intermediate regulatory signal molecule involved in regulation of downstream SAPKs through both the G protein-coupled receptors (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 6.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol.

Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, involvement of PI3K in anti-apoptotic signaling (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) makes the activation of this signaling pathway in hypertrophy quite interesting, especially when considering that chronic pressure overload can lead to a transition from compensatory hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure.Our study was directed to address the mechanism of PI3K activation during in vivo cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, we show a significant activation of PI3Kγ but not PI3Kα. The activation of the γ isoform implicates G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of PI3K during this hypertrophic process with little induction from phospho-tyrosine/growth factor receptors. A recent study was unable to demonstrate activation of PI3K during right ventricular hypertrophy due to in vivo pressure overload when antibodies against the p85 regulatory subunit were used (30.Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G., IV Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since p85 antibodies would immunoprecipitate the PI3Kα isoform, these data are consistent with our findings that PI3K p110γ is the most prominent isoform activated during induction of cardiac hypertrophy.Studies were also carried out to determine whether the level of phosphorylation of p85 was altered in response to pressure overload. Phosphorylation of the p85 adaptor subunit is thought to regulate activity of the PI3Kα isoform (31.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a change in the phosphorylation state of p85 in TAC hearts based on a gel mobility shift of the p85 subunit (data not shown). In addition, we were unable to demonstrate a difference in protein kinase activity of PI3K p110γ with respect to phosphorylation of the in vitro substrate histone 2B or its autophosphorylation (data not shown).In vitro studies have shown Gβγ-dependent PI3Kγ activation (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) by direct interaction of the Gβγ subunits with the catalytic domain of PI3Kγ isoform (21.Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We sought to establish this observation in the in vivo context of pressure overload hypertrophy. Using transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the Gβγ binding domain of βARK1, Gβγ subunits would be sequestered blocking Gβγ-dependent signaling (18.Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Despite the marked induction of cardiac hypertrophy in hearts from TAC transgenic βARKct mice, no increase in lipid kinase activity was found demonstrating that the induction of PI3K activity is Gβγ-mediated involving the p110γ isoform.Having documented that activation of PI3K in vivo is Gβγ-dependent, we sought to determine the specific class of heterotrimeric G proteins that contributes the Gβγ subunits. In vitro studies have shown the activation of PI3K to be mediated through Gi class of G proteins (32.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). To address this issue in the in vivo context, we used transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a peptide that blocks dissociation of the heterotrimeric Gq class of G proteins. If the signal was mediated through the Gi class of G proteins, then TAC in GqI transgenic animals would show significant activation of PI3K since Gi-mediated signaling is intact in these animals (3.Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we show that the increase in PI3K activity in hypertrophied hearts was abolished in the transgenic GqI mice, suggesting that the Gβγ subunits needed to activate PI3K are derived from Gq. To address this issue using a different strategy, we administered PTX after TAC to abolish Gi-mediated signaling. Our data show that activation of PI3K was unaffected by PTX treatment indicating the signaling pathway to be independent of the Gi-coupled receptor stimulation during in vivo pressure overload. Considering the complex pathophysiological state of the heart during pressure overload hypertrophy, it is remarkable that induction of PI3K appears to be mediated by activation of Gq-coupled G proteins. Further studies will be needed to determine whether PI3K is an upstream molecule in regulation of SAPKs during the hypertrophic process.Since PKB is a known downstream target of PI3K, we wanted to test whether the activation of PKB in vivo is regulated by PI3K. Our data from wild type TAC hearts show a significant increase in PKB activity that is abolished in pressure overloaded transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of either the βARKct or GqI peptides. These data show that, in the pressure overloaded heart, PKB is regulated by similar signals that regulate PI3K. Although activation of PI3K does not appear to be required for the induction of cardiac hypertrophy, we can only speculate as to what role PI3K activation may play during this process. It is interesting to note that induction of PI3K activates anti-apoptotic signaling (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and activation of PI3K could serve to counterbalance pro-apoptotic pathways during compensatory hypertrophy. In this regard, recent studies have documented the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in pathological cardiac hypertrophy (33.Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar,34.Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar).Taken together, these data show that in in vivo cardiac hypertrophy there is a significant increase in activity of PI3K and its downstream target PKB. PI3Kγ is the prominent isoform to be activated during this process and contributes in majority to the total activity during in vivo pressure overload. Our studies further show that, in the in vivo pressure overloaded heart, activation of PI3K is totally dependent on released Gβγ subunits and these Gβγ subunits are derived from dissociation of the Gqclass of heterotrimeric G proteins. This is important because we have previously shown that Gq signaling is a common trigger initiating the hypertrophic response during cardiac pressure overload (3.Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Myocardial hypertrophy is an adaptive response to both mechanical and hormonal stimuli. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that activation of Gq-coupled receptors can trigger a hypertrophic program (1.Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 2.D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The intracellular cascades carrying the signal from Gq-coupled receptors are not fully understood; however, several intermediate molecules such as protein kinase C, diacylglycerol, and Ras have been identified (4.Dorn 2nd, G.W. Brown J.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Of recent interest has been the enzyme phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K),1 which has been implicated in G protein-coupled signaling to stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 6.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are a conserved family of lipid kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation in the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) (7.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). It is well established that PI3Ks (8.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) and their products (7.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) play a pivotal role in cell signaling and in regulation of cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, and apoptosis (7.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 8.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Three different classes of PI3Ks have been identified, each sharing sequence homology for the catalytic lipid kinase and PI3K protein kinase domain but show considerable diversity in activity and cellular function (8.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Class III PI3K has substrate specificity restricted to PtdIns and appears to participate mainly in regulation of constitutive membrane trafficking and vesicle morphogenesis pathway (9.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Class II PI3K has substrate specificity for PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P); however, the role of this kinase with respect to in vivo signaling pathways is not well understood (10.Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14529-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The class I PI3Ks are the best characterized and most intensely studied. Class I PI3Ks use PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 as substrates leading to the formation of PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns (3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively, which all could act as potential secondary messengers (11.Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Class I P13Ks are all heterodimers containing a regulatory subunit (p85, p55/50, p101) and the 110-kDa catalytic subunit (7.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 12.Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To date four isoforms of the p110 catalytic subunit have been characterized (α, β, γ, and δ), and all contain a carboxyl-terminal lipid kinase domain in addition to a Ras-binding site and PI3K protein kinase activity. Catalytic subunits of the class I PI3Ks are further subdivided into two subclasses (A and B) depending on the type of regulatory unit with which they associate. Class IA PI3K catalytic subunits include p110α, -β, and -δ and interact with the p85 adapter regulatory unit to form heterodimers (13.Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R.

Since p85 antibodies would immunoprecipitate the PI3Kα isoform, these data are consistent with our findings that PI3K p110γ is the most prominent isoform activated during induction of cardiac hypertrophy.Studies were also carried out to determine whether the level of phosphorylation of p85 was altered in response to pressure overload. Phosphorylation of the p85 adaptor subunit is thought to regulate activity of the PI3Kα isoform (31.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a change in the phosphorylation state of p85 in TAC hearts based on a gel mobility shift of the p85 subunit (data not shown). In addition, we were unable to demonstrate a difference in protein kinase activity of PI3K p110γ with respect to phosphorylation of the in vitro substrate histone 2B or its autophosphorylation (data not shown).In vitro studies have shown Gβγ-dependent PI3Kγ activation (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) by direct interaction of the Gβγ subunits with the catalytic domain of PI3Kγ isoform (21.Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nurnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We sought to establish this observation in the in vivo context of pressure overload hypertrophy. Using transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the Gβγ binding domain of βARK1, Gβγ subunits would be sequestered blocking Gβγ-dependent signaling (18.Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Despite the marked induction of cardiac hypertrophy in hearts from TAC transgenic βARKct mice, no increase in lipid kinase activity was found demonstrating that the induction of PI3K activity is Gβγ-mediated involving the p110γ isoform.Having documented that activation of PI3K in vivo is Gβγ-dependent, we sought to determine the specific class of heterotrimeric G proteins that contributes the Gβγ subunits. In vitro studies have shown the activation of PI3K to be mediated through Gi class of G proteins (32.Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). To address this issue in the in vivo context, we used transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a peptide that blocks dissociation of the heterotrimeric Gq class of G proteins. If the signal was mediated through the Gi class of G proteins, then TAC in GqI transgenic animals would show significant activation of PI3K since Gi-mediated signaling is intact in these animals (3.Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we show that the increase in PI3K activity in hypertrophied hearts was abolished in the transgenic GqI mice, suggesting that the Gβγ subunits needed to activate PI3K are derived from Gq. To address this issue using a different strategy, we administered PTX after TAC to abolish Gi-mediated signaling. Our data show that activation of PI3K was unaffected by PTX treatment indicating the signaling pathway to be independent of the Gi-coupled receptor stimulation during in vivo pressure overload. Considering the complex pathophysiological state of the heart during pressure overload hypertrophy, it is remarkable that induction of PI3K appears to be mediated by activation of Gq-coupled G proteins. Further studies will be needed to determine whether PI3K is an upstream molecule in regulation of SAPKs during the hypertrophic process.Since PKB is a known downstream target of PI3K, we wanted to test whether the activation of PKB in vivo is regulated by PI3K. Our data from wild type TAC hearts show a significant increase in PKB activity that is abolished in pressure overloaded transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of either the βARKct or GqI peptides. These data show that, in the pressure overloaded heart, PKB is regulated by similar signals that regulate PI3K. Although activation of PI3K does not appear to be required for the induction of cardiac hypertrophy, we can only speculate as to what role PI3K activation may play during this process. It is interesting to note that induction of PI3K activates anti-apoptotic signaling (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and activation of PI3K could serve to counterbalance pro-apoptotic pathways during compensatory hypertrophy. In this regard, recent studies have documented the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways in pathological cardiac hypertrophy (33.Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar,34.Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar).Taken together, these data show that in in vivo cardiac hypertrophy there is a significant increase in activity of PI3K and its downstream target PKB. PI3Kγ is the prominent isoform to be activated during this process and contributes in majority to the total activity during in vivo pressure overload. Our studies further show that, in the in vivo pressure overloaded heart, activation of PI3K is totally dependent on released Gβγ subunits and these Gβγ subunits are derived from dissociation of the Gqclass of heterotrimeric G proteins. This is important because we have previously shown that Gq signaling is a common trigger initiating the hypertrophic response during cardiac pressure overload (3.Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated PI3K in a wide array of cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking (24.Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), actin cytoskeleton regulation (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), insulin signaling (25.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar), and inhibition of apoptotic signals (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Considering its widening role as an important signaling molecule, we sought to determine whether activity of PI3K was altered in in vivo cardiac hypertrophy. The data presented in this study provide evidence for isoform specific regulation of PI3K during the cardiac hypertrophic process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of PI3K is Gβγ-dependent and, moreover, the specific Gβγ subunits responsible are derived from the Gq class of heterotrimeric G proteins. Regulation of hypertrophic growth is by the induction of a number of key signaling cascades involving G protein-coupled receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, receptor tyrosine kinase, and janus kinase/signal tranducers and activators of transcription pathways (26.Force T.

In this study we show an increase in the PI3K activity duringin vivo pressure overload hypertrophy. Importantly, recent studies have identified PI3K as an active intermediate regulatory signal molecule involved in regulation of downstream SAPKs through both the G protein-coupled receptors (5.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 6.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2505-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and phosphotyrosine/growth factor receptors (29.Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Furthermore, involvement of PI3K in anti-apoptotic signaling (17.Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) makes the activation of this signaling pathway in hypertrophy quite interesting, especially when considering that chronic pressure overload can lead to a transition from compensatory hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure. Our study was directed to address the mechanism of PI3K activation during in vivo cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, we show a significant activation of PI3Kγ but not PI3Kα. The activation of the γ isoform implicates G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of PI3K during this hypertrophic process with little induction from phospho-tyrosine/growth factor receptors. A recent study was unable to demonstrate activation of PI3K during right ventricular hypertrophy due to in vivo pressure overload when antibodies against the p85 regulatory subunit were used (30.Laser M.

Despite strong similarities in their activation mechanisms (e.g. they both undergo rapid hypoxia-induced protein stabilization, bind identical target DNA sequences, and induce synthetic reporter genes to similar degrees), they are both essential for embryo survival via distinct functions during vascularization (HIF-1α) or catecholamine production (HLF). It is currently unknown how such specificity of action is achieved. We report here that DNA binding by HLF, but not by HIF-1α, is dependent upon reducing redox conditions. In vitro DNA binding and mammalian two-hybrid assays showed that a unique cysteine in the DNA-binding basic region of HLF is a target for the reducing activity of redox factor Ref-1. Although the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of HIF-1α can function in the absence of Ref-1, we found that the C-terminal region containing the transactivation domain requires Ref-1 for full activity. Our data reveal that the hypoxia-inducible factors are subject to complex redox control mechanisms that can target discrete regions of the proteins and are the first to establish a discriminating control mechanism for differential regulation of HIF-1α and HLF activity.

Although several signal transduction and gene regulatory mechanisms have been established to operate in response to oxidative stresses induced by intracellular oxygen radical production or cell penetration by oxidants, mammalian gene regulatory pathways that respond to hypoxia (low oxygen) have only recently begun to be understood. Analysis of hypoxia-induced activation of the erythropoietin gene led to the cloning of HIF-1α 1 (1.Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), a transcription factor that exhibits marked increases in stability and transcription potency at low intracellular oxygen levels (for a recent review, see Ref. 2.Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is a member of a bHLH protein subfamily that contains PAS dimerization domains juxtaposed with the bHLH. A number of bHLH/PAS factors have now been cloned and found to have crucial roles in physiological functions as diverse as xenobiotic metabolism (the dioxin or Ah receptor), maintenance of circadian rhythms (Clock and Period), and neurogenesis (Single-minded) (for a recent review, see Ref. 3.Crews S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Like the dioxin receptor, HIF-1α responds to environmental cues to form a functional heterodimer with a general bHLH/PAS partner protein, Arnt (Ah receptornuclear translocator). A closely related factor, the HIF-like factor (HLF (4.Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite strong sequence and mechanistic similarities and prevalent coexpression of HIF-1α and HLF, targeted disruption of their genes in mice results in embryonic lethalities with startling differences of phenotype. HIF-1α null mice (9.Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 10.Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) die at embryonic day 10 with defects in vascularization, whereas HLF null mice (11.Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) die mid-gestation (days 12.5–16), suffering bradycardia and reduced catecholamine levels. These results establish that, at the very least, HIF-1α and HLF perform critically distinct functions during embryogenesis and indicate that they stimulate different target genes and/or undergo undiscovered differences in their in vivomechanisms of activation. To address the issue of how specificity of function between HIF-1α and HLF may be achieved, we have analyzed their DNA binding capacities under varying experimental conditions. The N-terminal DNA-binding basic regions of HIF-1α and HLF differ by a single amino acid, serine 28 in HIF-1α being replaced by cysteine 25 in HLF (see Fig. 3). Notably, single cysteines in the basic regions of Fos and Jun subunits of the AP-1 transcription factor complex render DNA binding subject to redox control. A protein with reducing activity, Ref-1 (redoxfactor 1), has been characterized as a factor that imparts strong DNA binding activity to the AP-1 complex by maintaining the cysteines as reduced sulfhydryl groups (12.Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a number of proteins containing cysteines in their DNA-binding domains have been found to have their DNA binding activities controlled by reducing factors such as Ref-1 (e.g. CREB, NF-κB, and Myb (12.Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar); p53 (13.Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C.

Commun. 1998; 252: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15.Tell G. Scaloni A. Pellizzari L. Formisano S. Pucillo C. Damante G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25062-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) or thioredoxin (e.g. the glucocorticoid receptor (16.Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (17.Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). We report here that Ref-1 imparts DNA binding to the cysteine-containing HLF bHLH/PAS A region, but does not influence the DNA binding activity of the serine-containing HIF-1α bHLH/PAS A region. Mammalian two-hybrid assays indicated that Ref-1 can interact with the HLF N-terminal sequence, but not the HIF-1α N terminus. As expected, expression of antisense Ref-1 RNA reduces the ability of HLF to function as a transcription factor, but surprisingly also compromises the transcription potency of HIF-1α. Through analysis of chimeric proteins, we have obtained evidence that Ref-1 is important for HIF-1α activity in a region C-terminal to the bHLH domain. Thus, the activities of both HIF-1α and HLF are under complex modes of redox control, with some distinction between domains subject to redox regulation, providing the first instance of differential control for activation of these two proteins. These results suggest a novel mechanism whereby specificity of hypoxia-induced gene regulation may be achieved. The generation of the GST-tagged expression plasmids pDR-(1–287)/GEX4T3 and pArnt/GEX4T3 has been described previously (18.Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). pHIF-1α-(1–245)/GEX4T3 was generated by inserting anNcoI/SalI fragment from pHIF-1α/BS (19.Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), thereby replacing Arnt coding sequence with codons 1–245 of human HIF-1α. pHLF-(1–265)/GEX4T3 was generated by insertion of aBamHI/EcoRI-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment spanning codons 1–265 of murine HLF cDNA (4.Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX4T3. HIF-1α-(1–245) S28C was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. The fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction-assisted cloning and generation of the mutant form of HIF-1α-(1–245) was verified by dideoxy sequencing. pGEX4T3 plasmids in Escherichia coli strain BL21(Lys) were grown in LB broth supplemented with 2% glucose and induced with 1 mm IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed once with Buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20 and once without Tween 20. GST-tagged fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mmreduced glutathione. The purity of the isolated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). E. colistrain M15 with the pRef-(1–190)/QE30 plasmid (a kind gift from S. Xanthoudakis and T. Curran, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) (20.Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) was grown in LB broth and induced with 1.0 mm IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended in Buffer B (8.0 m urea, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and lysed by two cycles of freeze (−80 °C)/thawing. The lysate was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc.) and washed with Buffer B. The bound His-tagged protein was then eluted by lowering the pH using Buffer C (8.0 murea, 20 mm Tris (pH 5.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The purified protein was renatured by dialysis against Ref-1 storage buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol) with a 6.0 to 0.0 m urea stepwise reducing gradient. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-filled with32P-labeled dNTPs using Klenow enzyme and used as probes for gel shift assays. The W18 probe contains the hypoxia response motif from the erythropoietin enhancer (21.Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). The XRE is a probe containing a dioxin receptor response motif from the cytochrome P4501A1 gene (18.Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were carried out in a 20-μl volume with the bacterially expressed and purified protein HIF-1α-(1–245), HLF-(1–265), or DR-(1–287) with the partner factor Arnt as specified in a two-step process. Briefly, protein samples (100–400 ng/reaction) in the presence or absence of the reducing agent Ref-(1–190) or DTT were allowed to dimerize and interact at room temperature for 30 min. Binding buffer (final concentrations: 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 ng/μl poly(dI·dC), and 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) and the radiolabeled probe W18 or XRE (>10,000 cpm) were then added, and the reactions were transferred to 4 °C and incubated for an additional 30 min. Protein-bound DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in 25 mm Tris/glycine (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The luciferase reporter plasmids pHRE-Luc (4.Ema M.

Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and the expression plasmid pArnt/CMV4 (23.Whitelaw M. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have been described previously. The pHLF/EF-bos expression plasmid was constructed by initially shuttling anXbaI/KpnI fragment from pHLF/Bluescript (4.Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) intoNheI/KpnI-digested pSL301 vector (Invitrogen) to generate pHLF/SL301. A BglII/NotI fragment from pHLF/SL301 was then subcloned intoBamHI/NotI-digested pEF-bos-cs eukaryotic expression plasmid (24.Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The pHIF-1α/EF-bos expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning an SmaI/XbaI fragment from pHIF-1α/CMV4 (19.Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) into EcoRV/XbaI-digested pEF-bos-cs. The DR bHLH/HIF-1α chimeric cDNA was generated by joining polymerase chain reaction fragments containing the mouse dioxin receptor bHLH coding region (codons 1–83) to the coding region 3′ of the human HIF-1α bHLH (codons 74–826) via an XhoI linker and subcloning into pCMV4. HeLa Tet-on cells (CLONTECH) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfections HeLa Tet-on cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 5.0 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, transfections were carried out using the liposomal transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 100 ng/well reporter plasmid, 25 ng/wellRenilla internal luciferase control (Promega), 2.0 μg/well pTetSplice/α-Ref-1, and 100 ng/well each expression plasmid or empty expression vector as specified and was performed in duplicate. At the time of transfection, one duplicate was treated with a 1 μg/ml concentration of the tetracycline analog doxycycline (Sigma). After treatment (48 h), all cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with dual luciferase lysis buffer, and extracts were analyzed by the dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). pCMX/Ref-1/VP16 was generated by inserting a BamHI/NheI-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment of Ref-1 into aBamHI/NheI-digested pCMX/VP16 vector. COS-1 cells were seeded onto six-well plates (3 cm) and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 ng of a Gal4-luciferase reporter (18.Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was cotransfected together with 10 ng of the corresponding Gal4 chimeric expression plasmid and 1 ng of the Ref-1/VP16 fusion construct. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was determined using the Gene Glow assay system (BioThema). We have previously noted that the PAS A region of the dioxin receptor is important for the DNA binding activity of the DR/Arnt heterodimer (18.Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As an extension of these studies, we sought to analyze the influence of the PAS A domain on the DNA binding activity of two other bHLH/PAS proteins, the closely related hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α and HLF. N-terminal regions of HIF-1α and HLF containing the bHLH domains, the PAS A domains, and the intervening amino acids between PAS A and PAS B (termed HIF-1α-(1–245) and HLF-(1–265) respectively) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria. A GST fusion protein of the full-length partner protein Arnt was also expressed in bacteria, and all proteins were purified to near homogeneity by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Fig.1). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have previously shown that in vitro translated HIF-1α and HLF, when combined with Arnt, recognize the same DNA sequences from hypoxia-responsive regions in the EPO and vascular endothelial growth factor genes (4.Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 5.Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). As expected, when tested in isolation, bacterially expressed HIF-1α, HLF, and Arnt had no affinity for the hypoxia response element from the EPO gene (Fig.2, lanes 2–4). Surprisingly, however, we found that a mixture of purified HLF and Arnt showed barely detectable DNA binding activity on the EPO hypoxia response element (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7), whereas equivalent quantities of HIF-1α and Arnt exhibited clear DNA binding (lanes 8–10). This striking difference in activity was unexpected as sequence analysis of HLF and HIF-1α revealed a strong homology between the two DNA-binding and dimerization regions, with 83% identity between the bHLH domains and just under 70% identity over the PAS domains. These results stimulated us to investigate whether other factors might invoke differential control over DNA binding activity between HIF-1α and HLF.Figure 2Contrasting the DNA binding activities of HIF-1α and HLF on the erythropoietin hypoxia response element. Varying amounts of bacterially expressed HLF-(1–265) (50, 100, and 200 ng (lanes 5–7, respectively)) or HIF-1α-(1–245) (50, 100, and 200 ng (lanes 8–10, respectively)) were assayed for DNA binding activity in gel mobility shift assays in the presence of 2 μl of bacterially expressed Arnt eluant using the 32P-labeled W18 probe.Lane 1, probe alone; lane 2, 2 μl of Arnt eluant; lane 3, 200 ng of HLF-(1–265); lane 4, 200 ng of HIF-1α-(1–245).

This single amino acid difference is conserved for both human and mouse proteins. (Despite the original published sequence of HLF describing amino acid 25 as a serine, resequencing has confirmed a cysteine at this position, consistent with EPAS1 (5.Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), HIF-related factor (6.Flamme I. Frohlich T. von Reutern M. Kappel A. Damert A. Risau W. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and MOP2 (7.Hogenesch J.B. Chan W.K. Jackiw V.H. Brown R.C. Gu Y.Z. Pray-Grant M. Perdew G.H. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8581-8593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) sequences.) The position of this difference was intriguing, as cysteines in the DNA-binding basic regions of the oncoproteins Fos and Jun were found to mediate susceptibility for redox control of DNA binding activity (25.Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Strikingly, these cysteines are in a highly similar immediate environment, flanked by basic amino acids (Fig. 3). In the case of Fos and Jun, mutation of the conserved cysteines to serines provided a higher affinity DNA-binding complex that was resistant to redox control and displayed increased cell transforming ability (26.Okuno H. Akahori A. Sato H. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. Iba H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 695-701PubMed Google Scholar). Xanthoudakis and Curran (12.Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) isolated a protein from cell extracts (Ref-1) that was necessary for strong DNA binding activity of Fos and Jun. Ref-1 was found to be identical to the DNA repair enzyme APE/HAP-1 and to harbor two distinct activities, an N-terminal reducing function capable of interacting with cysteines and a C-terminal DNA repair function (20.Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To test whether the redox factor Ref-1 could influence DNA binding of HIF-1α and HLF, we expressed a histidine-tagged N-terminal redox domain of Ref-1 in bacteria and purified the protein by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 4 A). Upon addition of this purified Ref-(1–190) polypeptide to the EMSA reaction containing HLF and Arnt with the EPO hypoxia response element, a single DNA-binding entity was clearly observed (Fig. 4 B,lanes 7–9), whereas none was evident without Ref-(1–190) (lane 5), with the Ref-(1–190) polypeptide alone (lane 4), or with Ref-1 storage buffer (lane 10). Consistent with a model in which Ref-(1–190) supplies a reducing function critical for HLF DNA binding, the addition of dithiothreitol to the protein/DNA incubation also allowed conversion of the HLF/Arnt heterodimer to a DNA-binding form (Fig. 4 B,lane 6). In total contrast, the addition of either Ref-(1–190) or dithiothreitol to the HIF-1α/Arnt EMSA incubation did not influence the strength of DNA binding (Fig. 4 C, comparelanes 6 and 7–9 with lane 5). These results ascertain that a reducing activity needs to be present to invoke DNA binding of the HLF/Arnt heterodimer, but not the HIF-1α/Arnt heterodimer, and imply that a cysteine in the basic region of HLF may be a target of the Ref-1 reducing protein that also acts to provide strong DNA binding activity for the Fos-Jun complex. To determine whether the effect of Ref-1 was specific for HLF and was not a general effect on bHLH/PAS factors, an N-terminal region of the dioxin receptor encompassing the bHLH/PAS A domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and purified (Fig.5 A). When combined with bacterially expressed Arnt, a complex was formed that bound the XRE, the known target sequence of the DR/Arnt heterodimer (Fig.5 B). The intensity of this EMSA complex was not influenced by the addition of Ref-(1–190), showing that Ref-1 does not nonspecifically enhance the DNA binding activity of bHLH/PAS proteins.Figure 5DNA binding activity of the DR -(1–287)/Arnt heterodimer is not stimulated by Ref-(1–190). A, bacterial expression and purification of the truncated DR-(1–287)/GST fusion protein. The DR-(1–287) fusion protein was affinity-purified from IPTG-induced culture (lane 2) on glutathione-Sepharose, and 400 ng (lane 3) was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The solid bars represent molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons), and thearrow indicates the position of the DR-(1–287) fusion protein. B, the effects of Ref-(1–190) on the DNA binding activity of DR-(1–287). One-hundred nanograms of DR-(1–287) and 2 μl of Arnt eluant (lanes 5–9) were assayed for DNA binding activity following no treatment (lane 5) and after incubations with 10 mm DTT (lane 6) or increasing amounts of Ref-(1–190) (100, 200, and 400 ng (lanes 7–9, respectively)). DNA binding activities were measured using gel mobility shift assays with the 32P-labeled XRE probe. Lane 1, probe alone; lanes 2–4, isolated samples of Arnt eluant (2 μl), 100 ng of DR-(1–287), and 400 ng of Ref-(1–190), respectively. The arrow indicates the position of XRE retarded complexes, and the asterisk denotes free probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The similarities of redox control for DNA binding activities in the Fos/Jun heterodimer and the HLF/Arnt heterodimer suggest that the cysteine in the basic region of HLF is a likely target for redox control. However, other cysteines in the HLF region being analyzed might also be affected by the redox conditions of the experiment. We therefore sought to obtain direct evidence that the basic region Cys25 is the target for redox control of HLF DNA binding. To this end, we created a point mutant in the HIF-1α-(1–245) N-terminal sequence that resulted in a switch from Ser28 to Cys28. This point mutant polypeptide was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and purified to provide HIF-1α-(1–245) S28C (Fig.6 A). When incubated with the radiolabeled probe from the EPO hypoxia response element, neither HIF-1α-(1–245) nor HIF-1α-(1–245) S28C alone showed any DNA binding activity (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and4). When combined with bacterially expressed and purified Arnt, HIF-1α-(1–245), but not HIF-1α-(1–245) S28C, exhibit"

In each case, a ubiquitous co-regulatory factor that binds to a neighboring recognition site is also required for efficient promoter activation. It is likely that gene- and pathway-specific regulation by the separate SREBP isoforms is dependent on subtle differences in how the individual proteins function with specific co-regulators to activate gene expression. In the studies reported here we extend these observations significantly by demonstrating that SREBPs are involved in both sterol regulation and carbohydrate activation of the FAS promoter. We also demonstrate that the previously implicated Sp1 site is largely dispensable for sterol regulation in established cultured cells, whereas a CCAAT-binding factor/nuclear factor Y is critically important. In contrast, carbohydrate activation of the FAS promoter in primary hepatocytes is dependent upon SREBP and both the Sp1 and CCAAT-binding factor/nuclear factor Y sites. Because 1c is the predominant SREBP isoform expressed in hepatocytes and 1a is more abundant in sterol depleted established cell lines, this suggests that the different SREBP isoforms utilize distinct co-regulatory factors to activate target gene expression.

Additionally, fatty acids have also been shown to affect the regulated processing of the SREBPs from their membrane bound precursor state (9.Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F.

In the promoter for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor this co-regulator is Sp1 (11.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We also noted the presence of an Sp1-binding site in the sterol regulatory region of the FAS promoter, and we showed that Sp1 functioned together with SREBP to synergistically activate the FAS promoter. These earlier studies were performed using a Drosophila SL2 transfection assay system where both SREBP and Sp1 were expressed from exogenously supplied plasmid templates (3.Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M.

However, the synergistic effect of SREBP and Sp1 on the FAS promoter was about an order of magnitude lower than observed for either the LDL receptor or acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase promoters. Thus, we reasoned there may be another transcription factor that could work together with SREBPs to activate the FAS promoter to high levels.In the region of the rat FAS promoter that is required for sterol regulation (3.Bennett M.K.

Thus, it was important to further evaluate the roles of Sp1 and CBF/NF-Y as potential co-regulators for SREBP-mediated activation of the FAS promoter. In the present report we show that the CBF/NF-Y site is critical for sterol regulation and for activation by ectopically expressed SREBP-1a and -2 in mammalian cells, whereas the Sp1 site is dispensable.The promoter for FAS, like those of other key lipogenic genes, is also activated by a nutritional and hormonal process that is dependent on both insulin action and carbohydrate metabolism (19.Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In previous studies, mutations that disrupt the E-Box element that lies within and overlaps the tandem SREBP sites mentioned above were shown to be defective for insulin-dependent activation of FAS (20.Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21.Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that mutations that disrupt the tandem SREBP sites but leave the E-box intact are defective for stimulation by glucose and insulin treatment in primary hepatocytes where SREBP-1c is the major isoform. Additionally, both NF-Y and Sp1 sites are absolutely required as well. Thus, the two SREBP-1 isoforms appear to have distinct co-regulator requirements to efficiently stimulate the FAS promoter in response to different nutritional challenge.RESULTSThe cis-acting elements necessary for sterol regulation of the rat FAS promoter were previously shown to reside between −150 to −43 relative to the transcription initiation site (+1) (3.Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In a follow up study we showed that two adjacent binding sites for SREBPs located between −72 and −53 are crucial for this effect (15.Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a GC-rich sequence at −80 bound the ubiquitous Sp1 factor and that ectopic expression of both SREBP and Sp1 would synergistically activate the FAS promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells.However, the degree of synergistic activation of the FAS promoter by SREBP and Sp1 was an order of magnitude lower than for SREBP-Sp1 synergistic activation of the LDL receptor and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase promoters (3.Bennett M.K.

In addition to the Sp1-binding site at −80 there is a recognition site for CBF/NF-Y within the region of the FAS promoter that is required for sterol regulation (Fig.1, bottom panel, and Refs. 15.Magaña M.M.

Multi-base substitution mutations were introduced into the Sp1 or CBF/NF-Y sites, and the resultant mutant promoters were analyzed in transient transfection assays for sterol regulation in CV-1 cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The Sp1 mutant was regulated by sterols in a similar fashion as the wild type promoter, whereas the CBF/NF-Y mutant was totally defective for sterol regulation. These data demonstrate that the CCAAT element is required for sterol regulation of the FAS promoter, whereas the Sp1 site is not.We also compared these mutants with the wild type promoter in transient transfection assays where the mature form of either SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 was supplied exogenously from an expression plasmid (Fig.2). The results extend the sterol regulation experiments and specifically demonstrate that the CBF/NF-Y site is important for activation by both SREBPs (Fig. 2, Aand B, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9). However, the mutant with an altered Sp1 site was efficiently activated by both SREBPs (Fig. 2, A andB, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6).Figure 2The inverted CCAAT motif at −100 is required for both SREBP-1a and 2 activation of the rat FAS promoter in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with the wild type (WT) or mutant FAS constructs along with the CMV2 β-galactosidase construct as a control as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, dishes received 0, 10, or 30 ng/60-mm dish of a CMV-driven expression vector encoding amino acids 1–490 of SREBP-1a. B, dishes received 0, 10, or 30 ng/60-mm dish of a CMV-driven expression vector encoding amino acids 1–481 of SREBP-2. Fold activation corresponds to the ratio of normalized luciferase activity obtained from dishes where SREBP-1a or-2 was co-transfected divided by the activity obtained from dishes transfected in the absence of the SREBP expression vector. The mean fold activation value for each plasmid and the standard error for three independent experiments performed in duplicate are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that Sp1 binding was actually disrupted by the base changes that were introduced, we evaluated Sp1 binding to the wild type and mutant DNAs by an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay. The results demonstrated that the wild type and NF-Y mutant DNA fragments bound Sp1 efficiently, whereas the mutant probe designed to disrupt the Sp1 site did not (Fig. 3).Figure 3Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay analysis of Sp1 binding to FAS promoter. 34-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide probes corresponding to −105 to −76 of either the wild type (WT) FAS sequence, the mutated CCAAT box motif sequence (NF-Y mut.), or the mutated Sp1-binding site sequence (Sp1 mut.) were 32P-end-labeled and used in a gel mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The probes were incubated in the absence (denoted by−) or in the presence of 1 footprint unit of human Sp1 protein (indicated by +). The position of the shifted Sp1 complex is shown by the arrow at the right. The apparent difference in size of the two shifted complexes is due to an anomaly in the gel dye front.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The experiments presented thus far demonstrate that the CBF/NF-Y consensus DNA site is important for sterol regulation of the FAS promoter. To evaluate the role of the heterotrimeric CBF/NF-Y protein directly, we performed transient DNA transfection assays in the presence of increasing amounts of a plasmid that expresses a mutant form of the A subunit of NF-Y. The mutant A subunit protein can associate with the other two subunits normally; however, the resultant complex is unable to bind specifically to DNA (23.Mantovani R. Li X.-Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huisjduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when overexpressed it functions in a dominant negative fashion over endogenously expressed CBF/NF-Y and it has been used by several investigators including us to evaluate the role of CBF/NF-Y in the activation of other specific promoters (15.Magaña M.M.

When the wild type FAS promoter was transfected into CV-1 cells along with increasing amounts of the NF-YA29 mutant plasmid, the level of expression of the FAS promoter under sterol depleted conditions was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). Similar results were obtained for the FAS reporter plasmid with the mutations in the Sp1 recognition site (Fig. 4 B). That this effect is really specific for NF-Y is indicated by the fact that the NF-YA29 plasmid had no effect on SREBP-dependent activation of the LDL receptor promoter where only SREBP and Sp1 are involved (28.Jackson S.M.

Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). However, activation of mammalian promoters can be reconstituted when expression constructs encoding the missing regulatory proteins are co-introduced by DNA transfection. Therefore, it is a useful cell based assay system for the analysis of transcription factor requirements for promoter activation because it provides a negative background for such studies (29.Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). For example, this assay system was used to directly show that SREBP and Sp1 function as co-activators of the LDL receptor promoter (11.Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Based on our previous experiments and the data presented thus far, we hypothesized that SL2 cells may lack functional CBF/NF-Y and that a more efficient activation of the FAS promoter might be achieved by introducing expression constructs for CBF/NF-Y along with those for SREBP and Sp1.To directly test this hypothesis we developed a co-stimulation assay for SREBP and CBF/NF-Y in Drosophila SL2 cells. We preparedDrosophila -based expression constructs for all three CBF/NF-Y subunits and first added them individually or in different combinations to determine which if any were functionally missing (Fig.5). The results demonstrated that significant activation of the FAS promoter was achieved only when all three CBF/NF-Y expression constructs were added along with SREBP whereas the combination of SREBP and Sp1 was much less active (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 12). The inclusion of Sp1, SREBP, and all three NF-Y subunits resulted in an even higher level of activation (lane 11).Figure 5Activation of the wild type FAS promoter inDrosophila SL2 cells. SL2 cells were transfected with the wild type FAS reporter construct along with the pPAC β-galactosidase construct discussed under “Materials and Methods” as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Where indicated, cells were transfected with 25 ng of a pPAC construct expressing the coding region of Sp1 and/or 25 ng of a pPAC construct expressing amino acids 1–490 of SREBP-1a. Cells were transfected in every combination with 50 ng of each pPAC construct encoding one, two, or all the three NF-Y/CBF subunits: A, B, or C as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The requirement for CBF/NF-Y in activation of the FAS promoter was evaluated more precisely by performing a concentration curve with the CBF/NF-Y expression plasmids in the presence or absence of a fixed amount of the SREBP-1a and Sp1 expressing constructs (Fig.6). From this series of experiments it is clear that CBF/NF-Y alone (triangles) or in combination with Sp1 (diamonds) is not very effective, whereas SREBP-1a addition on top of NF-Y resulted in a significant stimulation of FAS promoter activity at all concentrations of CBF/NF-Y plasmids (squares). When Sp1 was included in addition to SREBP-1a, there was a higher level of activation observed at every concentration of CBF/NF-Y (circles).Figure 6Activation of the wild type FAS by SREBP-1a, Sp1, and increasing amounts of CBF/NF-Y in DrosophilaSL2 cells. SL2 cells were transfected with the wild type FAS reporter construct along with increasing amounts of the three pPAC-CBF/NF-Y subunit expressing plasmids (triangles). Additional expression plasmids were added as indicated; 25 ng of a pPAC construct expressing the coding region of Sp1 (diamonds), 25 ng of a pPAC construct expressing amino acids 1–490 of SREBP-1a (squares), or both Sp1 and SREBP-1a expressing plasmids (circles).

Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A region encompassing the E-box and tandem SREBP sites discussed here is required for activation of the FAS promoter by insulin and carbohydrate signaling (20.Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To explore the potential roles of the SREBP, NF-Y, and Sp1 sites in activation of the FAS promoter by insulin and glucose, we evaluated the effects of the Sp1 and NF-Y site mutations described in Fig. 1 and the SREBP-binding site mutants we analyzed previously (15.Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) on activation of the FAS promoter in primary rat hepatocytes in response to insulin and glucose (Fig. 7). The wild type promoter was activated over 6-fold by the addition of insulin and a high concentration of glucose, whereas the mutations in either the NF-Y or Sp1 sites resulted in a loss in activation. Additionally, we analyzed three other mutations that we made for our previous study that helped us determine that the tandem SREBP sites (and not the E-box element) are the critical cis-acting sites for sterol regulation. One of the mutations alters the E-box sequence and downstream SREBP site simultaneously (mutant B); another mutation alters the upstream SREBP site without affecting the E-box sequence (mutant D), and one mutant alters both SREBP sites simultaneously (mutant A/B/C). All three of these additional mutations disrupted SREBP binding to one (mutants B and D) or both (mutants A/B/C) SREBP sites and were defective for sterol regulation (15.Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 7 demonstrate that all three mutants are also defective for activation by insulin/glucose. Taken together these experiments document that the two tandem SREBP sites as well as both the Sp1 and NF-Y site are important for insulin/glucose activation of the FAS promoter.Figure 7Activation of the FAS promoter in primary hepatocytes by glucose and insulin. FAS promoter constructs containing sequences of either wild type (WT) or various mutations from −151 to −42 were linked to a basal promoter in the pGL2 construct as described above and in an earlier report (15.Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The sequence of the wild type FAS promoter is shown at thebottom, and the bases that were mutated in each construct are underlined and labeled similar to the labeling in Fig.1. Each construct was tested for a response to glucose and insulin in primary hepatocytes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were cultured in 5.5 mm glucose in the absence of insulin (hatched bars) or 27.5 mm glucose in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml insulin (dotted bars) for 48 h. Luciferase activity is shown as relative activity with the value of the wild type FAS construct at 27.5 mm glucose with insulin as 100%.

Horton J.D. Shimomura L. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), the experiments presented so far suggest that SREBP-1c may require both Sp1 and NF-Y for efficient activation of the FAS promoter, whereas activation by SREBP-1a would be largely dependent only on NF-Y. To test this possibility we analyzed the co-regulatory factor requirements for each of SREBP-1a and -1c inDrosophila SL2 cells where we can specifically manipulate the functional levels of SREBPs, NF-Y, and Sp1 directly by co-transfection (Fig. 8). We evaluated the activation of the FAS promoter by increasing concentrations of NF-Y in the presence of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c expressing constructs in the presence or absence of co-transfected Sp1 plasmid. Consistent with the mammalian cell studies and our other SL2 studies, efficient activation by SREBP-1a occurred when SREBP-1a and NF-Y were co-transfected (Fig.8, open squares); however, high level of activation by SREBP-1c required that both NF-Y- and Sp1-expressing plasmids were included (Fig. 8, compare open and closed circles).Figure 8Activation of the FAS promoter in SL2 cells by SREBP-1a versus SREBP-1c.

Elevated neuronal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β is an additional feature of neurodegeneration, and in this study we demonstrate that interleukin-1β modulates the effects of β-amyloid on Ca2+ homeostasis in the rat cortex. β-Amyloid-(1–40) (1 μm) caused a significant increase in45Ca2+ influx into rat cortical synaptosomes via activation of L- and N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and also increased the amplitude of N- and P-type Ca2+ channel currents recorded from cultured cortical neurons. In contrast, interleukin-1β (5 ng/ml) reduced the45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes and inhibited Ca2+ channel activity in cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of β-amyloid protein on Ca2+ influx were blocked following exposure to interleukin-1β, suggesting that interleukin-1β may govern neuronal responses to β-amyloid by regulating Ca2+homeostasis. β-Amyloid protein is thought to underlie the neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer's disease by inducing Ca2+-dependent apoptosis.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 504-508Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which accumulates as an insoluble extracellular deposit around neurons, giving rise to the senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar). Increased neuronal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is an additional neuropathological hallmark of AD (3.Cacabelos R. Alvarez X.A. Fernandez-Nova L. Franco A. Mangues R. Pellicer A. Nishimura T. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1994; 16: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar), and inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β have been proposed to contribute to the development of amyloid plaques (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Several reports describe an interaction between IL-1β and Aβ at the processing level; IL-1-immunoreactive microglia are prominent components of amyloid plaques in AD (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and β-amyloid promotes release of IL-1β by the glial cells that surround senile plaques (5.Araujo D.M. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1992; 569 (114): 140Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In turn, IL-1β increases βAPP mRNA expression (6.Patterson P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and promotes processing of βAPP to liberate Aβ peptide fragments (7.Vasilakos J.P. Carroll R.T. Emmerling M.R. Doyle P.D. Davis R.E. Kim K.S. Shivers B.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus a chain of events involving IL-1β and Aβ is involved in plaque formation; however, the nature of the interaction between IL-1β and Aβ at a physiological level is poorly understood. Neuronal apoptosis is the suspected causative factor of neurodegeneration in AD, and Aβ fragments have been shown to promote apoptosis in vitro in human-derived neurotypic cells (8.Li Y.P. Bushnell A.F. Lee C.M. Perlmutter L.S. Wong S.K. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 196-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and cultured neurons (9.Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying Aβ-induced apoptosis is thought to involve disregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis (10.Mattson M.P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the C6 glial cell line, expression of the Ca2+-binding protein calbindin was found to suppress Aβ-induced apoptosis (11.Wernyj R.P. Mattson M.P. Christakos S. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), providing evidence for the involvement of Ca2+ fluxes in Aβ-induced apoptosis. In this study we report that Aβ-(1–40) (i) promotes a stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes via activation of L- and N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and (ii) increases the amplitude of N- and P-type VDCC current in cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, the Aβ-(1–40)-induced increase in Ca2+ influx is blocked by the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β in both cortical synaptosome preparations and cultured cortical neuron preparations, providing evidence for a physiological interaction between IL-1β and Aβ-(1–40) with respect to the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of Aβ-(1–40) and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β on Ca2+homeostasis in cortical synaptosomes and cultured cortical neurons. The results demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) stimulates45Ca2+ influx into the synaptosomal preparation with a parallel rise in [Ca2+]i. The electrophysiological data demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) also increases voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity in cultured cortical neurons. Since the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes were blocked by nifedipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA we conclude that L- and N-type VDCCs are involved in the Aβ-induced elevation in 45Ca2+ influx in this preparation. In the cultured cortical neurons the Aβ-induced elevation in Ca2+ channel current neurons was found to be sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA and ω-agatoxin IVA, indicating the involvement of N- and P-type VDCCs. The data also demonstrate that the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β attenuates 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes and reduces Ca2+ channel current density in cultured cortical neurons by approximately 50%, providing evidence that cortical voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are substrates for modulation by IL-1β. Furthermore, exposure to IL-1β was found to prevent the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on Ca2+ influx, and this result is indicative of an interaction between Aβ-(1–40) and IL-1β with respect to the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis.Our finding that Aβ-(1–40) stimulated 45Ca2+influx and elevated [Ca2+]i at the level of the nerve terminal means that Aβ-(1–40) is likely to have a significant impact on Ca2+-dependent neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. In support of this hypothesis, β-amyloid peptides have been shown to potentiate Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate and aspartate from hippocampal slices (15.Arias C. Arrieta I. Tapia R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), impair long term potentiation in the hippocampus (16.Cullen W.K. Suh Y.H. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J.

Mem. 1997; 68: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that elevations in [Ca2+]i have been shown to precede apoptotic events in several cell systems (18.Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx and enhancement of VDCC activity by Aβ-(1–40) may act as a trigger for the neuronal apoptosis associated with neurodegenerative disease. In support of this suggestion, Aβ-induced increases in Ca2+ influx are reported to be involved in mediating the apoptotic effects of Aβ in PC12 cells (19.Fukuyama R. Wadhwani K.C. Galdzicki Z. Rapport S.I. Ehrenstein G. Brain Res. 1994; 667: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20.Yallampalli S. Micci M.A. Tagliatela G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and L-type VDCCs have been demonstrated to mediate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons (21.Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawaskai K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores via formation of reactive oxygen species has been suggested to underlie the detrimental effects of Aβ-(25–35) on synaptosomal membrane lipid structure and composition (22.Koppal T. Subramaniam R. Drake J. Prasad M. Dhillon H. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. 1998; 786: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although elevation in [Ca2+]i has been demonstrated to underlie Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis, Aβ also stimulates glia to produce growth factors that contribute to plaque development (5.Araujo D.M. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1992; 569 (114): 140Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and may influence neuronal viability (23.Bono F. Lamarche I. Bornia J. Savi P. Della Valle G. Herbert J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of Aβ to induce expression of adhesion molecules (24.Suo Z. Tan J. Placzek A. Crawford F. Fang C. Mullan M. Brain Res. 1998; 807: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) may also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.The subtype of VDCC modulated by Aβ-(1–40) in the cortical synaptosomes and cultured neurons was investigated using selective Ca2+ channel blockers. The L-type VDCC blocker nifedipine and the N-type VDCC inhibitor ω-conotoxin GVIA were both found to attenuate the K+-stimulated 45Ca2+influx in control cortical synaptosomes, indicating that L- and N-type VDCCs become activated following K+ depolarization. The finding that ω-conotoxin GVIA blocked K+-stimulated45Ca2+ influx in the synaptosomal preparation is consistent with a presynaptic role for the N-type VDCC because N-type VDCCs have been localized to nerve terminals, where they play a critical role in presynaptic events such as neurotransmitter release (25.Sabria J. Pastor C. Clos M.V. Garcia A. Badia A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, a presynaptic role for L-type VDCCs has been described in cerebellar granule neurons (26.Huston E. Cullen G.P. Burley J.R. Dolphin A.C. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 457-465Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and our finding that nifedipine attenuated the K+-induced increase in45Ca2+ influx in the synaptosomal preparation is consistent with previous studies that demonstrate the presence of L-type VDCCs in cortical synaptosomes (27.Boess F.G. Balasubramanian M.K. Brammer M.J. Campbell I.C. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The finding that nifedipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA also blocked the Aβ-mediated potentiation of the K+-induced increase in 45Ca2+influx in cortical synaptosomes suggests that N- and L-type VDCCs are targets for presynaptic modulation by Aβ-(1–40). In contrast, in the cultured cortical neurons a 20-ms, 110-mV depolarization from a holding potential of −90 mV resulted in activation of N- and P-type VDCCs, with little contribution from L-type VDCCs, demonstrating that N- and P-type VDCCs are prevalent in cultured cortical neurons. The Aβ-(1–40)-induced increase in Ca2+ channel current density was significantly reduced by ω-conotoxin GVIA and the P-type VDCC blocker ω-agatoxin IVA but was unaffected by the L-type VDCC blocker nimodipine, indicating that N- and P-type VDCCs are modulated by Aβ-(1–40) in these cells. In cerebellar granule neurons Aβ has been shown to act via exclusive up-regulation of N-type channels (28.Price S.A. Held B. Pearson H.A. Neurorepor t. 1998; 9: 539-545PubMed Google Scholar) and L-type VDCCs in microglia (29.Silei V. Fabrizi C. Venturini G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Lauro G.M. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); thus the nature of the VDCC regulated by Aβ may be dependent upon the cell type and subcellular fraction under investigation.We found that IL-1β attenuated 45Ca2+ influx in cortical synaptosomes in a similar manner to that previously reported in synaptosomes prepared from the hippocampus (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). IL-1β functions as a neuromodulator to reduce neurotransmitter release (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and impair long term potentiation in the hippocampus (31.Cunningham A.J. Murray C.A. O'Neill L.A.J. Lynch M.A. O'Connor J.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 203: 1-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) possibly as a consequence of its inhibitory effect on Ca2+ influx (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The finding that IL-1β reduces Ca2+ channel current in cultured cortical neurons is also similar to the modulatory effects reported for IL-1β on hippocampal Ca2+ channel currents, where the IL-1β effects were found to proceed via activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (32.Plata-Salaman C.R. ffrench-Mullen J.M.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Modulatory effects of IL-1β on Ca2+ homeostasis in cortical neurons and cortical nerve terminals are likely to have a significant impact on cortical function and may underlie the modulatory effects of IL-1β on synaptic transmission in the neocortex (33.D'Arcangelo G. Dodt H.U. Zieglansberger W. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2079-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The finding that IL-1β blocked the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on 45Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ channel currents is of particular interest. Elevations in neuronal expression of both Aβ (2.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar) and IL-1β (3.Cacabelos R. Alvarez X.A. Fernandez-Nova L. Franco A. Mangues R. Pellicer A. Nishimura T. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1994; 16: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar) are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, and several lines of evidence demonstrate an interaction between Aβ and IL-β. β-Amyloid induces release of IL-1β from activated microglia (34.Lorton D. Kocsis J.M. King L. Maden K. Brunden K.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1996; 67: 21-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monocytes (35.Lorton D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 94: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in a Ca2+-dependent manner and also promotes transcription of IL-1 mRNA (36.Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Aside from the association of IL-1 with amyloid plaques (37.Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7611-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), where it is thought to contribute to gliosis, IL-1 is also believed to be influential at an earlier phase of AD pathology because this cytokine has been found to enhance βAPP mRNA expression in neurons (6.Patterson P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and promote processing of βAPP to generate β-amyloid fragments (7.Vasilakos J.P. Carroll R.T. Emmerling M.R. Doyle P.D. Davis R.E. Kim K.S. Shivers B.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). IL-1β and Aβ therefore participate in a cycle of events contributing to the formation of the neuritic plaques and tangles associated with AD. Although those studies reveal an interaction between Aβ and IL-1β at a processing level, little information is currently available concerning a physiological interaction between Aβ and IL-1β. The results presented in this study demonstrate that IL-1β modulates the Aβ-(1–40)-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx in the cortex, and such neuromodulatory properties of IL-1β may participate in governing neuronal responses to Aβ at certain stages of the neurodegenerative disease process. Thus, whereas IL-1β is considered to have a significant influence on the pathophysiology of AD by increasing βAPP expression resulting in the formation of neuritic plaques (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the proclivity of IL-1β to attenuate Aβ-induced Ca2+ influxes at the level of the nerve terminal may impact on presynaptic function, such as the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, to limit cell damage caused by glutamate excitotoxicity, and as such this may reflect a neuroprotective role for IL-1β. Furthermore, because Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis is dependent upon the activation of Ca2+-sensitive proteases (38.Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Miller R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinases (39.Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our observation that IL-1β occludes the stimulatory effects of Aβ on Ca2+ influx suggests that IL-1β may serve to restrain these intracellular cascades associated with Aβ-induced neurodegeneration.In summary, the increase in Ca2+ influx mediated by Aβ-(1–40) in cortical synaptosomes and cultured cortical neurons is attenuated by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. This finding indicates an interaction between Aβ and IL-1β that serves to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis, and this interaction may have implications in the manifestation of AD. β-Amyloid (Aβ-(1–40))1is a peptide fragment derived from proteolytic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (1.Selkoe D.J. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 504-508Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which accumulates as an insoluble extracellular deposit around neurons, giving rise to the senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar). Increased neuronal expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is an additional neuropathological hallmark of AD (3.Cacabelos R. Alvarez X.A. Fernandez-Nova L. Franco A. Mangues R. Pellicer A. Nishimura T. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1994; 16: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar), and inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β have been proposed to contribute to the development of amyloid plaques (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Several reports describe an interaction between IL-1β and Aβ at the processing level; IL-1-immunoreactive microglia are prominent components of amyloid plaques in AD (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and β-amyloid promotes release of IL-1β by the glial cells that surround senile plaques (5.Araujo D.M. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1992; 569 (114): 140Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In turn, IL-1β increases βAPP mRNA expression (6.Patterson P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and promotes processing of βAPP to liberate Aβ peptide fragments (7.Vasilakos J.P. Carroll R.T. Emmerling M.R. Doyle P.D. Davis R.E. Kim K.S. Shivers B.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus a chain of events involving IL-1β and Aβ is involved in plaque formation; however, the nature of the interaction between IL-1β and Aβ at a physiological level is poorly understood. Neuronal apoptosis is the suspected causative factor of neurodegeneration in AD, and Aβ fragments have been shown to promote apoptosis in vitro in human-derived neurotypic cells (8.Li Y.P. Bushnell A.F. Lee C.M. Perlmutter L.S. Wong S.K. Brain Res. 1996; 738: 196-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and cultured neurons (9.Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying Aβ-induced apoptosis is thought to involve disregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis (10.Mattson M.P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the C6 glial cell line, expression of the Ca2+-binding protein calbindin was found to suppress Aβ-induced apoptosis (11.Wernyj R.P. Mattson M.P. Christakos S. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 64: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), providing evidence for the involvement of Ca2+ fluxes in Aβ-induced apoptosis. In this study we report that Aβ-(1–40) (i) promotes a stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes via activation of L- and N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and (ii) increases the amplitude of N- and P-type VDCC current in cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, the Aβ-(1–40)-induced increase in Ca2+ influx is blocked by the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β in both cortical synaptosome preparations and cultured cortical neuron preparations, providing evidence for a physiological interaction between IL-1β and Aβ-(1–40) with respect to the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of Aβ-(1–40) and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β on Ca2+homeostasis in cortical synaptosomes and cultured cortical neurons. The results demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) stimulates45Ca2+ influx into the synaptosomal preparation with a parallel rise in [Ca2+]i. The electrophysiological data demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) also increases voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity in cultured cortical neurons. Since the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes were blocked by nifedipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA we conclude that L- and N-type VDCCs are involved in the Aβ-induced elevation in 45Ca2+ influx in this preparation. In the cultured cortical neurons the Aβ-induced elevation in Ca2+ channel current neurons was found to be sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA and ω-agatoxin IVA, indicating the involvement of N- and P-type VDCCs. The data also demonstrate that the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β attenuates 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes and reduces Ca2+ channel current density in cultured cortical neurons by approximately 50%, providing evidence that cortical voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are substrates for modulation by IL-1β. Furthermore, exposure to IL-1β was found to prevent the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on Ca2+ influx, and this result is indicative of an interaction between Aβ-(1–40) and IL-1β with respect to the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis.Our finding that Aβ-(1–40) stimulated 45Ca2+influx and elevated [Ca2+]i at the level of the nerve terminal means that Aβ-(1–40) is likely to have a significant impact on Ca2+-dependent neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. In support of this hypothesis, β-amyloid peptides have been shown to potentiate Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate and aspartate from hippocampal slices (15.Arias C. Arrieta I. Tapia R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), impair long term potentiation in the hippocampus (16.Cullen W.K. Suh Y.H. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and alter spatial memory performance tests (17.Sweeney W.A. Luedtke J. McDonald M.P. Overmier J.B. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1997; 68: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that elevations in [Ca2+]i have been shown to precede apoptotic events in several cell systems (18.Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx and enhancement of VDCC activity by Aβ-(1–40) may act as a trigger for the neuronal apoptosis associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawaskai K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores via formation of reactive oxygen species has been suggested to underlie the detrimental effects of Aβ-(25–35) on synaptosomal membrane lipid structure and composition (22.Koppal T. Subramaniam R. Drake J. Prasad M. Dhillon H. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. 1998; 786: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).

In addition, a presynaptic role for L-type VDCCs has been described in cerebellar granule neurons (26.Huston E. Cullen G.P. Burley J.R. Dolphin A.C. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 457-465Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and our finding that nifedipine attenuated the K+-induced increase in45Ca2+ influx in the synaptosomal preparation is consistent with previous studies that demonstrate the presence of L-type VDCCs in cortical synaptosomes (27.Boess F.G.

IL-1β and Aβ therefore participate in a cycle of events contributing to the formation of the neuritic plaques and tangles associated with AD. Although those studies reveal an interaction between Aβ and IL-1β at a processing level, little information is currently available concerning a physiological interaction between Aβ and IL-1β. The results presented in this study demonstrate that IL-1β modulates the Aβ-(1–40)-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx in the cortex, and such neuromodulatory properties of IL-1β may participate in governing neuronal responses to Aβ at certain stages of the neurodegenerative disease process. Thus, whereas IL-1β is considered to have a significant influence on the pathophysiology of AD by increasing βAPP expression resulting in the formation of neuritic plaques (4.Sheng J.G. Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1995; 21: 290-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the proclivity of IL-1β to attenuate Aβ-induced Ca2+ influxes at the level of the nerve terminal may impact on presynaptic function, such as the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, to limit cell damage caused by glutamate excitotoxicity, and as such this may reflect a neuroprotective role for IL-1β. Furthermore, because Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis is dependent upon the activation of Ca2+-sensitive proteases (38.Jordan J. Galindo M.F. Miller R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinases (39.Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our observation that IL-1β occludes the stimulatory effects of Aβ on Ca2+ influx suggests that IL-1β may serve to restrain these intracellular cascades associated with Aβ-induced neurodegeneration.In summary, the increase in Ca2+ influx mediated by Aβ-(1–40) in cortical synaptosomes and cultured cortical neurons is attenuated by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. This finding indicates an interaction between Aβ and IL-1β that serves to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis, and this interaction may have implications in the manifestation of AD. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Aβ-(1–40) and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β on Ca2+homeostasis in cortical synaptosomes and cultured cortical neurons. The results demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) stimulates45Ca2+ influx into the synaptosomal preparation with a parallel rise in [Ca2+]i. The electrophysiological data demonstrate that Aβ-(1–40) also increases voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity in cultured cortical neurons. Since the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes were blocked by nifedipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA we conclude that L- and N-type VDCCs are involved in the Aβ-induced elevation in 45Ca2+ influx in this preparation. In the cultured cortical neurons the Aβ-induced elevation in Ca2+ channel current neurons was found to be sensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA and ω-agatoxin IVA, indicating the involvement of N- and P-type VDCCs. The data also demonstrate that the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β attenuates 45Ca2+ influx into cortical synaptosomes and reduces Ca2+ channel current density in cultured cortical neurons by approximately 50%, providing evidence that cortical voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels are substrates for modulation by IL-1β. Furthermore, exposure to IL-1β was found to prevent the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on Ca2+ influx, and this result is indicative of an interaction between Aβ-(1–40) and IL-1β with respect to the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. Our finding that Aβ-(1–40) stimulated 45Ca2+influx and elevated [Ca2+]i at the level of the nerve terminal means that Aβ-(1–40) is likely to have a significant impact on Ca2+-dependent neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. In support of this hypothesis, β-amyloid peptides have been shown to potentiate Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate and aspartate from hippocampal slices (15.Arias C. Arrieta I. Tapia R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), impair long term potentiation in the hippocampus (16.Cullen W.K. Suh Y.H. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and alter spatial memory performance tests (17.Sweeney W.A. Luedtke J. McDonald M.P. Overmier J.B. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1997; 68: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Given that elevations in [Ca2+]i have been shown to precede apoptotic events in several cell systems (18.Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx and enhancement of VDCC activity by Aβ-(1–40) may act as a trigger for the neuronal apoptosis associated with neurodegenerative disease. In support of this suggestion, Aβ-induced increases in Ca2+ influx are reported to be involved in mediating the apoptotic effects of Aβ in PC12 cells (19.Fukuyama R. Wadhwani K.C. Galdzicki Z. Rapport S.I. Ehrenstein G. Brain Res. 1994; 667: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20.Yallampalli S. Micci M.A. Tagliatela G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and L-type VDCCs have been demonstrated to mediate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons (21.Ueda K. Shinohara S. Yagami T. Asakura K. Kawaskai K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores via formation of reactive oxygen species has been suggested to underlie the detrimental effects of Aβ-(25–35) on synaptosomal membrane lipid structure and composition (22.Koppal T. Subramaniam R. Drake J. Prasad M. Dhillon H. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. 1998; 786: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although elevation in [Ca2+]i has been demonstrated to underlie Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis, Aβ also stimulates glia to produce growth factors that contribute to plaque development (5.Araujo D.M. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1992; 569 (114): 140Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and may influence neuronal viability (23.Bono F. Lamarche I. Bornia J. Savi P. Della Valle G. Herbert J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of Aβ to induce expression of adhesion molecules (24.Suo Z. Tan J. Placzek A. Crawford F. Fang C. Mullan M. Brain Res. 1998; 807: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) may also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD. The subtype of VDCC modulated by Aβ-(1–40) in the cortical synaptosomes and cultured neurons was investigated using selective Ca2+ channel blockers. The L-type VDCC blocker nifedipine and the N-type VDCC inhibitor ω-conotoxin GVIA were both found to attenuate the K+-stimulated 45Ca2+influx in control cortical synaptosomes, indicating that L- and N-type VDCCs become activated following K+ depolarization. The finding that ω-conotoxin GVIA blocked K+-stimulated45Ca2+ influx in the synaptosomal preparation is consistent with a presynaptic role for the N-type VDCC because N-type VDCCs have been localized to nerve terminals, where they play a critical role in presynaptic events such as neurotransmitter release (25.Sabria J. Pastor C. Clos M.V. Garcia A. Badia A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2567-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, a presynaptic role for L-type VDCCs has been described in cerebellar granule neurons (26.Huston E. Cullen G.P. Burley J.R. Dolphin A.C. Neuroscience. 1995; 68: 457-465Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and our finding that nifedipine attenuated the K+-induced increase in45Ca2+ influx in the synaptosomal preparation is consistent with previous studies that demonstrate the presence of L-type VDCCs in cortical synaptosomes (27.Boess F.G. Balasubramanian M.K. Brammer M.J. Campbell I.C. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The finding that nifedipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA also blocked the Aβ-mediated potentiation of the K+-induced increase in 45Ca2+influx in cortical synaptosomes suggests that N- and L-type VDCCs are targets for presynaptic modulation by Aβ-(1–40). In contrast, in the cultured cortical neurons a 20-ms, 110-mV depolarization from a holding potential of −90 mV resulted in activation of N- and P-type VDCCs, with little contribution from L-type VDCCs, demonstrating that N- and P-type VDCCs are prevalent in cultured cortical neurons. The Aβ-(1–40)-induced increase in Ca2+ channel current density was significantly reduced by ω-conotoxin GVIA and the P-type VDCC blocker ω-agatoxin IVA but was unaffected by the L-type VDCC blocker nimodipine, indicating that N- and P-type VDCCs are modulated by Aβ-(1–40) in these cells. In cerebellar granule neurons Aβ has been shown to act via exclusive up-regulation of N-type channels (28.Price S.A. Held B. Pearson H.A. Neurorepor t. 1998; 9: 539-545PubMed Google Scholar) and L-type VDCCs in microglia (29.Silei V. Fabrizi C. Venturini G. Salmona M. Bugiani O. Tagliavini F. Lauro G.M. Brain Res. 1999; 818: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); thus the nature of the VDCC regulated by Aβ may be dependent upon the cell type and subcellular fraction under investigation. We found that IL-1β attenuated 45Ca2+ influx in cortical synaptosomes in a similar manner to that previously reported in synaptosomes prepared from the hippocampus (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). IL-1β functions as a neuromodulator to reduce neurotransmitter release (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and impair long term potentiation in the hippocampus (31.Cunningham A.J. Murray C.A. O'Neill L.A.J. Lynch M.A. O'Connor J.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 203: 1-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) possibly as a consequence of its inhibitory effect on Ca2+ influx (30.Murray C.A. McGahon B. McBennett S. Lynch M.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The finding that IL-1β reduces Ca2+ channel current in cultured cortical neurons is also similar to the modulatory effects reported for IL-1β on hippocampal Ca2+ channel currents, where the IL-1β effects were found to proceed via activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (32.Plata-Salaman C.R. ffrench-Mullen J.M.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 266: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Modulatory effects of IL-1β on Ca2+ homeostasis in cortical neurons and cortical nerve terminals are likely to have a significant impact on cortical function and may underlie the modulatory effects of IL-1β on synaptic transmission in the neocortex (33.D'Arcangelo G. Dodt H.U. Zieglansberger W. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2079-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The finding that IL-1β blocked the stimulatory effects of Aβ-(1–40) on 45Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ channel currents is of particular interest. Elevations in neuronal expression of both Aβ (2.Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar) and IL-1β (3.Cacabelos R. Alvarez X.A. Fernandez-Nova L. Franco A. Mangues R. Pellicer A. Nishimura T. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1994; 16: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar) are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, and several lines of evidence demonstrate an interaction between Aβ and IL-β. β-Amyloid induces release of IL-1β from activated microglia (34.Lorton D.

Ageing Dev. 1997; 94: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in a Ca2+-dependent manner and also promotes transcription of IL-1 mRNA (36.Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Aside from the association of IL-1 with amyloid plaques (37.Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7611-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), where it is thought to contribute to gliosis, IL-1 is also believed to be influential at an earlier phase of AD pathology because this cytokine has been found to enhance βAPP mRNA expression in neurons (6.Patterson P.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and promote processing of βAPP to generate β-amyloid fragments (7.Vasilakos J.P. Carroll R.T. Emmerling M.R.

Although PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 appears a plausible and attractive candidate for the messenger that couples K ATPchannels to leptin receptor activation, direct measurement of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 demonstrated that insulin, but not leptin, increased global cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

Lancet. 1998; 351: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although the hypothalamus is considered the main target for leptin, particularly with respect to body weight regulation, it is clear that this hormone has distinct actions on other peripheral, target organs. There have been several reports that leptin reduces insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (3.Emilsson V. Liu Y-L. Cawthorne M.A. Morton N.M. Davenport M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4.Fehmann H.C. Berghofer P. Brandhorst D. Brandhorst H. Bretzel R.G. Goke B.

Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One mechanism proposed to explain the leptin-induced reduction in insulin secretion is via activation of ATP-sensitive K+(K ATP) channels (8.Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 9.Harvey J. McKenna F. Herson P.S. Spanswick D. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 527-535Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This increase in potassium current results in beta cell hyperpolarization, reduced calcium entry, and hence decreased insulin secretion. In addition, there are features common to both insulin-secreting cells and leptin-sensitive hypothalamic neurones (10.Spanswick D. Smith M.A. Groppi V.E. Logan S.D. Ashford M.L.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11.Lee K. Dixon A.K. Richardson P.J. Pinnock R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 439-452Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), most notably glucose responsiveness and the presence of K ATPchannels, which are activated by exposure of the cells to leptin. The apparent involvement of both leptin receptors andK ATP channel activation in key systems involved in metabolic homeostasis has led us to examine the likely signal transduction pathways underlying this effect.The leptin receptor belongs to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (1.Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar, 2.Auwerx J. Staels B. Lancet. 1998; 351: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), members of which are thought to signal via janus-tyrosine kinases. Activated janus-tyrosine kinases can mediate signaling via insulin receptor substrate proteins (12.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 13.Myers M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 33: 471-490Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar), which following tyrosine phosphorylation become docking sites for Src homology 2-containing enzymes like phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).1 Indeed, leptin is reported to stimulate glucose transport in C2C12 myotubules via a PI 3- kinase-dependent process (15.Berti L. Kellerer M. Capp E. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and leptin signaling in these cells employs janus-tyrosine kinase 2 and insulin receptor substrate 2 in this process (16.Kellerer M. Koch M. Metzinger E. Mushack J. Capp E. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There is also growing evidence that PI 3-kinase plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathways linking insulin receptor activation and various cellular responses (14.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 33: 471-490Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Wortmannin and LY 294002 are inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (17.Powis G. Bonjouklion R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A.

Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (20.Khan C.R.

We have shown recently that leptin activation of K ATP channels in CRI-G1 cells is sensitive to both wortmannin and LY 294002, suggesting the possible involvement of a PI 3-kinase and that insulin occludes leptin activation of K ATP channels (23.Harvey J. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 695-706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating cross-talk between insulin and leptin-stimulated signaling pathways. Thus, the cell-signaling pathways initiated by leptin action in CRI-G1 cells may overlap with those of insulin. In support of this possibility, recent reports indicate that leptin-induced proliferation involves activation of MAPK in C3H10T1/2 cells (24.Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Iida K. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Abe H. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12897-12900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and the insulin-secreting MIN6 cell line (25.Tanabe K. Okuya S. Tanizawa Y. Matsutani A. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated (26.Yamashita T. Murakami T. Otani S. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing leptin receptor isoforms, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK is enhanced. Most of the cellular roles of PI 3-kinase have been attributed to the lipid products of these enzymes, which bind to target molecules via specific lipid binding domains. There is mounting evidence that phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)P3) levels increase in cells following stimulation by a variety of agonists and that the increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels precede activation of downstream signaling molecules (27.Alessi D.R. Downes C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).The possibility that phosphoinositides are involved in signaling to potassium channels is indicated by numerous reports suggesting that phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) can directly activate cloned inward rectifier K+ channels (28.Huang C-L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) and native (29.Hilgemann D.W. Ball R.

Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32.Baukrowitz T. Schultz U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Falker B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In this report we compare the effect of leptin action on K ATPchannel activity in CRI-G1 cells with that induced by PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 using whole-cell and inside-out current recordings.DISCUSSIONInositol phospholipids, applied directly to the cytoplasmic aspect of membrane patches, have been shown to activate native and clonedK ATP channels (29.Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 30.Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31.Shyng S. Nichols C.G.

Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Specifically, PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been proposed as a physiological activator of K ATP channels that functions by disconnecting the channel from the constant inhibition produced by the high cytoplasmic concentration of ATP (31.Shyng S. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32.Baukrowitz T. Schultz U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Falker B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A suggested mechanism to explain this phenomenon is that PtdIns(4,5)P2 binds directly to the C terminus of Kir6.2 and, by charge neutralization, stabilizes the open state of the channel by reducing the inhibitory effect of ATP (31.Shyng S. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The present study also demonstrates that PtdIns(4,5)P2 can activate K ATPchannels of the CRI-G1 cell line when presented directly to the cytoplasmic aspect in the presence of ATP. Surprisingly, however, this effect, like that of leptin, was blocked by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and was mimicked by the direct application of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a key product of type I PI 3-kinases. By contrast, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-specific PLCs did not prevent the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 onK ATP channel activation. Taken together these results suggest that channel activation results not from a direct action of PtdIns(4,5)P2 but via a product of its metabolism by a PI 3-kinase, most likely PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.Recently, it has been shown that the ob gene product leptin activates K ATP channels in pancreatic beta cells (8.Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and CRI-G1 insulin-secreting cells (9.Harvey J. McKenna F. Herson P.S. Spanswick D. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 527-535Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), an effect consistent with suppression of insulin secretion. This action of leptin was shown to be blocked by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (23.Harvey J. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 695-706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the present results, suggested that leptin may exert its effects on K ATP channels by stimulating a type I PI 3-kinase to synthesize PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. If correct it would be expected that leptin should produce a detectable increase in the level of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 present in CRI-G1 cells. Whereas insulin stimulated the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, leptin was without apparent effect using our assay system. One possible explanation for this paradox is that leptin does activate PI 3-kinase to a limited degree, but the resulting increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 may be too small to detect reliably using a measure of the total cell PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content. Recent studies have shown the existence of a considerable receptor reserve for the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB by insulin such that substantial activation of PKB occurs at concentrations of insulin that cause barely detectable changes in the total cell PtdIns(3,4,5)P3content. 2I. H. Batty and C. P. Downes, unpublished data. Thus the activity state of PKB, and perhaps other downstream targets of PI 3-kinase signaling pathways, may provide a more sensitive indicator of small changes in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content. CRI-G1 cells were shown to contain the α and γ isoforms of PKB both of which could be rapidly and potently activated by insulin. Leptin, however, had no detectable effect on PKB activity in these cells. Furthermore, the lack of sensitivity of K ATP channel activation to rapamycin establishes that p70S6k, another protein/serine kinase that is frequently activated downstream of PI 3-kinase, is not required for this leptin-mediated response.There is clear evidence of cross-talk between insulin and leptin receptor-signaling pathways. For example, leptin attenuates some insulin-induced signals, including gluconeogenesis in human hepatocytes, even though both insulin and leptin stimulate PI 3-kinase in these cells (49.Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure of CRI-G1 cells to insulin prevents leptin activation of K ATP channels (23.Harvey J. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 695-706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that leptin also activates an inhibitory pathway that attenuates some aspects of insulin signaling.The sensitivity of K ATP channel activation by leptin to low concentrations of wortmannin and LY294002, however, strongly suggests that a PI 3-kinase is involved in this response. PI 3-kinases have long been known to exhibit both lipid and protein kinase activities that are functions of the same, wortmannin-sensitive active site. A recent study, which made use of a p110 mutant that retained protein kinase activity in the absence of detectable lipid kinase activity, suggested that the protein kinase activity of PI 3-kinase γ mediates the activation of MAPK (41.Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, leptin activates MAPK in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing leptin receptor isoforms (26.Yamashita T. Murakami T. Otani S. Kuwajima M. Shima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), a mouse embryonic cell line (24.Takahashi Y. Okimura Y. Mizuno I. Iida K. Takahashi T. Kaji H. Abe H. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12897-12900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the pancreatic beta cell line MIN6 (25.Tanabe K. Okuya S. Tanizawa Y. Matsutani A. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Well characterized inhibitors of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and pathways involving the related MAPK isoforms, p38 and stress-activated protein kinase, however, all failed to prevent the activation ofK ATP channels by leptin. This suggests that the protein kinase activity of PI 3-kinase does not account for the activation of K ATP channels by leptin via any of these pathways.Another possible explanation of our results is that leptin receptor activation may regulate a dedicated pool of PI 3-kinase leading to a localized increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that has little effect on the total PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content of the cells. In this scenario, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could bind directly toK ATP channel subunits as proposed originally for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (31.Shyng S. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 32.Baukrowitz T. Schultz U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Falker B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), subsequently lowering ATP sensitivity and causing channel activation. Alternatively, a localized pool of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could act indirectly via its binding to protein targets other than those addressed in this report. Whatever the identity of the putative effector in the pathway forK ATP channel activation it must display a high degree of selectivity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 over other phosphoinositides, because PtdIns(4,5)P2 was ineffective in this system when PI 3-kinase was blocked. The majority of known targets for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have a common structural theme, because they all possess one or more pleckstrin homology domains with a high degree of selectivity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 over PtdIns(4,5)P2 (14.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 33: 471-490Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 50.Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).An important feature of lipid signals is that they are likely to remain for some time in the membrane in which they are synthesized. The possibility that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 might be generated in different subcellular compartments or membrane microdomains in response to different stimuli may help to explain why signaling by both insulin and leptin can be blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors yet these hormones accomplish quite different signaling outcomes. Insulin receptors are not thought to recruit PI 3-kinase directly but instead phosphorylate cytosolic insulin receptor substrate-proteins which in turn bind and activate PI 3-kinases via phosphotyrosine/Src homology 2 domain interactions. Although the leptin receptor, like many other cytokine receptors, is generally considered to signal via janus-tyrosine kinase 2 to various signal transducers and activators of transcription (2.Auwerx J. Staels B. Lancet. 1998; 351: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), there is evidence that some cytokine receptors (e.g. p55 tumor necrosis factor and epidermal growth factor receptors) can associate directly with phosphoinositide kinases (52.Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Perhaps leptin receptors can also recruit PI 3-kinases directly leading to a spatially limited production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the selective activation of K ATP channels.One final possibility to be considered is that the putative PI 3-kinase product elicited by leptin action that is responsible forK ATP channel activation is not PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 itself but some other 3-phosphoinositide. Although this will ultimately require direct measurement of these lipids in radiolabeled cells, it is unlikely that phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate accounts for these effects, because it is an effective activator of PKB (51.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 52.Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which was not significantly stimulated by leptin in CRI-G1 cells. Other possibilities include PtdIns3P, a product of type II and type III PI 3-kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3,5,-bisphosphate, which is produced by the consecutive phosphorylation of PtdIns by a 3-kinase and the resulting phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate by a 5-kinase (53.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). These latter lipids are implicated in vesicle trafficking events and their production is sensitive to nm concentrations of wortmannin.In conclusion, our results show that activation ofK ATP channels by leptin likely requires PI 3-kinase activity. In support of such a mechanism, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 mimicked the effect of leptin by increasingK ATP channel activity in whole-cell and inside-out current recordings, whereas the effects of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in these systems were blocked by inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. Surprisingly, however, leptin did not increase the total PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content nor did it activate any of several components of established PI 3-kinase signaling pathways. It is possible that either a localized pool of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or some other 3-phosphoinositide might account for these observations. Cell labeling studies, which might allow the detection of alternative lipid mediators, and the use of intracellular probes to monitor the subcellular distribution of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 should help to resolve these issues in our future work. The hormone leptin, secreted by adipocytes, has a major influence on body weight homeostasis (1.Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar, 2.Auwerx J. Staels B. Lancet. 1998; 351: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although the hypothalamus is considered the main target for leptin, particularly with respect to body weight regulation, it is clear that this hormone has distinct actions on other peripheral, target organs. There have been several reports that leptin reduces insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (3.Emilsson V. Liu Y-L. Cawthorne M.A. Morton N.M. Davenport M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4.Fehmann H.C. Berghofer P. Brandhorst D. Brandhorst H. Bretzel R.G. Goke B.

Metab. 1999; 84: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), although this view is not shared by all investigators (7.Leclercq-Meyer V. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One mechanism proposed to explain the leptin-induced reduction in insulin secretion is via activation of ATP-sensitive K+(K ATP) channels (8.Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 9.Harvey J. McKenna F. Herson P.S. Spanswick D. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 527-535Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This increase in potassium current results in beta cell hyperpolarization, reduced calcium entry, and hence decreased insulin secretion. In addition, there are features common to both insulin-secreting cells and leptin-sensitive hypothalamic neurones (10.Spanswick D. Smith M.A. Groppi V.E. Logan S.D. Ashford M.L.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11.Lee K. Dixon A.K. Richardson P.J. Pinnock R.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 439-452Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), most notably glucose responsiveness and the presence of K ATPchannels, which are activated by exposure of the cells to leptin. The apparent involvement of both leptin receptors andK ATP channel activation in key systems involved in metabolic homeostasis has led us to examine the likely signal transduction pathways underlying this effect. The leptin receptor belongs to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily (1.Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar, 2.Auwerx J. Staels B. Lancet. 1998; 351: 737-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), members of which are thought to signal via janus-tyrosine kinases. Activated janus-tyrosine kinases can mediate signaling via insulin receptor substrate proteins (12.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 13.Myers M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 33: 471-490Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar), which following tyrosine phosphorylation become docking sites for Src homology 2-containing enzymes like phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).1 Indeed, leptin is reported to stimulate glucose transport in C2C12 myotubules via a PI 3- kinase-dependent process (15.Berti L. Kellerer M. Capp E. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and leptin signaling in these cells employs janus-tyrosine kinase 2 and insulin receptor substrate 2 in this process (16.Kellerer M. Koch M. Metzinger E. Mushack J. Capp E. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There is also growing evidence that PI 3-kinase plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction pathways linking insulin receptor activation and various cellular responses (14.Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 33: 471-490Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Wortmannin and LY 294002 are inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (17.Powis G. Bonjouklion R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are reported to inhibit insulin-induced activation of protein kinase B (PKB) (19.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (20.Khan C.R.

We have shown recently that leptin activation of K ATP channels in CRI-G1 cells is sensitive to both wortmannin and LY 294002, suggesting the possible involvement of a PI 3-kinase and that insulin occludes leptin activation of K ATP channels (23.Harvey J. Ashford M.L.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 695-706Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating cross-talk between insulin and leptin-stimulated signaling pathways. Thus, the cell-signaling pathways initiated by leptin action in CRI-G1"
https://openalex.org/W2031778076,"N α-Acetylation, catalyzed co-translationally with N α-acetyltransferase (NAT), is the most common modifications of eukaryotic proteins. In yeast, there are at least three NATs: NAT1, MAK3, and NAT3. The 20 S proteasome subunits were purified from the normal strain and each of the deletion mutants,nat1, mak3, and nat3. The electrophoretic mobility of these subunits was compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Shifts toward the alkaline side of the gel and unblocking of the N terminus of certain of the subunits in one or another of the mutants indicated that the α1, α2, α3, α4, α7, and β3 subunits were acetylated with NAT1, the α5 and α6 subunits were acetylated with MAK3, and the β4 subunit was acetylated with NAT3. Furthermore, the Ac-Met-Phe-Leu and Ac-Met-Phe-Arg termini of the α5 and α6 subunits, respectively, extended the known types of MAK3 substrates. Thus, nine subunits were N α-acetylated, whereas the remaining five were processed, resulting in the loss of the N-terminal region. The 20 S proteasomes derived from either the nat1 mutant or the normal strain were similar in respect to chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activitiesin vitro, suggesting thatN α-acetylation does not play a major functional role in these activities. However, the chymotrypsin-like activity in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was slightly higher in the nat1 mutant than in the normal strain.

N α-acetyltransferase(s) two-dimensional peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride N α-Acetylation that occurs co-translationally is one of the most common protein modifications, occurring on 50–90% of all eukaryotic proteins (1.Driessen H.P.C. de Jong W.W.

Chem. 1979; 254: 1447-1449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein synthesis is initiated with Met. The initiator Met is co-translationally removed from proteins by methionine aminopeptidase if proteins have the penultimate residue with short radii of gyration (3.Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the removal of Met, the N-terminal residues such as Ser, Ala, Gly, or Thr, in the context of special sequences, are acetylated with an N α-acetyltransferase (NAT),1 called NAT1 (or Ard1p/Nat1p), which is composed of two subunits, Nat1p and Ard1p (4.Lee F.J.

When proteins have the penultimate residue, such as charged amino acids and amino acids with large side chains, the initiator Met is not removed. In this case, the N-terminal Met of proteins with the penultimate residue of Asp or Glu is acetylated with the second NAT, NAT3 (also called Nat3p) (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas certain other proteins with Met at the N termini are acetylated with the third NAT, MAK3 (also called Mak3p) (6.Polevoda B.

The pleiotropic phenotypes of nat1 indicate that NAT1 may be required for the function of protein(s) involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the repression of HML. Furthermore,mak3 mutants exhibited nearly complete lack of growth on YPG medium at 37 °C (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7.Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the growth of nat3 strains were severally retarded on both YPD and YPG media at both temperatures, but especially on YPG medium at 37 °C and on NaCl-containing media (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Also, the mating efficiency of MATα nat3cells, but not MAT a nat3 cells, was reduced by nearly three orders of magnitude. The viability of the NAT mutants allows the determination of which proteins are acetylated by each of the NATs. In eukaryotic cells, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis underlies the bulk of non-lysosomal protein degradation (10.Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a major mediator of post-translational control, which functions in the control of cell proliferation, cell cycle, and other processes (11.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Naturally short-lived as well as damaged or otherwise abnormal proteins are recognized by the ubiquitin system and marked for degradation by the attachment of multi-ubiquitin chains. The ubiquitinated proteins are destined to be degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner. The 26 S proteasome consists of a pair of 19 S regulatory complexes and a single 20 S proteasome (12.Peters J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 377-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 13.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome has no protease activity in a latent form that can be activated in vitro by mild chaotropic agents such as SDS and heat treatment without the 19 S regulatory complexes (13.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is a barrel-like particle appearing as a stack of four rings made up of two outer α-rings and two inner β-rings, being associated in the order of αββα (14.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The α- and β-rings are each made up of seven structurally related subunits. Because the entrance of the latent 20 S proteasome cavity is closed, proteins to be degraded cannot penetrate into the cavity. The activation of the 20 S proteasome by SDS and heat is suggested to be due to the opening of the entrance of the cavity (15.Lupas A. Baumeister W. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 127-146Crossref Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome, among seven distinct β subunits, only three, β1, β2, and β5, contain the conserved N-terminal Thr, which acts as a nucleophile in catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds of polypeptide substrates. The β5, β2, and β1 subunits have chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (PGPH) activities, respectively. The N-terminal Thr is located on the surface of cavity formed by two rings of the β subunits (14.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 16.Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). These subunits are synthesized as an inactive precursor containing a propeptide that is considered to be autocatalytically cleaved, yielding the mature β subunits with the N-terminal Thr (14.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 15.Lupas A. Baumeister W. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D.

However, it is unknown whether the other subunits of the yeast 20 S proteasome are N-terminally modified. In this study, the yeast 20 S proteasome subunits were purified from the nat1, mak3, and nat3 mutants, and the normal strain and N-terminal modifications of these subunits were investigated. The concomitant chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH activities of the 20 S proteasome were compared between thenat1 mutant and the normal strain to investigate the effect of N α-acetylation on functions of the 20 S proteasome. The following strains of yeast were used in this study: the normal strain, B-8032 (MATαura3–52 CYC1–963 cyc7–67 lys5–10); the nat1mutant, B-8360 (MATα nat1::URA3 ura3–52 CYC1–963 cyc7–67 lys5–10); the mak3 mutant, B-9074 (MATα mak3::URA3 CYC1–963 cyc7–67 lys5–10); and the nat3 mutant, B-11974 (MATα nat3::kanMX2 CYC1–963 cyc7–67 lys5–10). Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (1% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose) at 30 °C for two days. Yeast cells were disrupted by homogenization in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol with the Bead-Beater (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The 20 S proteasome from yeast extracts was purified by sequential chromatographs on octyl-Sepharose CL-4B, Bio-Gel A-1.5 m, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, PD-10, and FPLC Mono-Q columns. The purification was performed according to the method reported previously (23.Achstetter T. Ehmann C. Osaki A. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13344-13348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration was used instead of dialysis (24.Smith M.W. Ito M. Miyawaki M. Sato S. Yoshikawa Y. Wada S. Maki H. Nakagawa H. Komamine A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and FPLC with a Mono-Q column was used as the final purification step (25.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, based on the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptidase activity was assayed according to the method of Tanaka et al. (27.Tanaka K. Ii K. Ichihara A. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15197-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. The proteasome (2 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of SDS in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm fluorogenic synthetic peptide substrates such as succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Suc-LLVY-MCA),t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA (Boc-LRR-MCA), or carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-Glu-MCA (Z-LLE-MCA) (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) to detect chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, or PGPH activities, respectively. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The hydrolytic activities on various fluorogenic substrates were determined by measuring the fluorescence of groups liberated from these peptides and values were calibrated to standard curves of free 7-amino-4 methyl-coumarin (AMC). Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed by the method as described previously (28.Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified 20 S proteasome was subjected to two-dimensional (2D) PAGE. Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE as described by Hirano (29.Hirano H. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the cathodic and anodic electrode solutions used for isoelectric focusing were 0.02 mH3PO4 and 2%N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, respectively. After electrophoresis, proteins in the gels were detected by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The proteins separated by 2D-PAGE were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Fluorotrans, Pall, NY) as described previously (30.Hirano H. Watanabe T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The proteasome subunits were cut from the PVDF membranes and sequenced by automated Edman degradation on a gas phase sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems 491). After 2d-PAGE, Coomassie Blue-stained spots of the proteasome subunits were cut out of the gel and digested in the gel with 0.1 μg of lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) in 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The digests were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography using a microbore reverse-phase C18 column (Wakopack, 100Å, 100 mm in length, 1 mm in internal diameter). Partial amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined with the gas phase sequencer. The final preparation of purified proteasome from the nat1, mak3, andnat3 mutants and the normal strain gave a single band in 4.5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. The 20 S proteasome, isolated in a latent form, is known to have proteolytic activity in the presence of mild chaotropic agents such as SDS (13.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The band detected on the 4.5% gel showed chymotrypsin-like acticvity (Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolytic activity) in the presence of 0.02% SDS (data not shown). When the purified proteasome was subjected to SDS-PAGE under dissociated condition, 14 protein bands having molecular weights ranging from 21,000 to 32,000 were observed by Coomassie Blue staining, revealing a typical electrophoretic pattern for the 20 S proteasome subunits. The electrophoretic pattern indicated the purified protein complex to be more than 90% pure (data not shown). The proteasome subunits of the normal strain of yeast were separated by 2D-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membranes, and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1). The stained subunits on PVDF membranes were subjected to automated Edman degradation with the gas-phase sequencer. N-terminal sequences of β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7 were obtained (Table I), but sequence information could not be obtained for the other nine subunits, suggesting that these proteins were N-terminally blocked. The subunits, detected by Coomassie Blue staining after 2D-PAGE, were digested in gels with lysylendopeptidase, and the peptides were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Representative peptides corresponding to internal regions were sequenced. The amount of β2 subunit purified by 2D-PAGE was insufficient for analyzing the internal sequence. On the basis of the N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences determined, all 14 subunits of the 20 S proteasome could be identified on 2D-PAGE gels (Fig. 1, Table I).Table IN-terminal acetylation of the yeast 20 S proteasome subunitsSubunitInternal sequenceN-terminal sequence of proproteinResults of Edman degradationNormal N-terminal sequenceNormalnat1mak3nat3α1 (Sclp1, C7)TDPAGYEV GYKMSGAAAASAAGYDRHITIFSPEGRLYQVE YAFKATNQTNI …BlockedSGAAAASBlockedBlockedAc-SGAAAASα2 (Pre8p, Y7)VSLLTPDIG AVYSMTDRYSFSLTTFSPSGKLGQIDYALTAVKQ GVTSLGIKAT …BlockedTDRYSFSLTTBlockedBlockedAc-TDRYSFα3 (Pre9p, Y13)AISVGAN TSAMGSRRYDSRTTIFSPEGRLYQVEYALESIS HAGTAIGIMA …BlockedGSRRYDSRTBlockedBlockedAc-GSRRYDα4 (Pre6p)SLLEVVQT GAKMSGYDRALSIFSPDGHIFQVEYALEAVKRG TCAVGVKGKN …BlockedSGYDRALSIFBlockedBlockedAc-SGYDRAα5 (Pup2p)EAELLVLKMFLTRSEYDRGVSTFSPEGRLFQVEYSLEA IKLGSTAIGI …BlockedBlockedMFLTRSEYDRBlockedAc-MFLTRSα6 (Pre5p)DTPFTIYD GEAVAKMFRNNYDGDTVTFSPTGRLFQVEYALEAIKQ GSVTVGLRS …BlockedBlockedMFRNNYDGDTBlockedAc-MFRNNYα7 (Pre10p, C1)IIYLAHEDMTSIGTGYDLSNSVFSPDGRNFQVEYAVKAV ENGTTSIGI …BlockedTSIGTGYDLBlockedBlockedAc-TSIGTGYβ1aCleaved.,bActive Thr N terminus.(Pre3p)LTSQEIND RLEALMNGIQVDINRLKKGEVSLG/TSIMAVTFKDG VILGADSRT …TSIMAVTFTSIMAVTFTSIMAVTFTSIMAVTFTSIMAVTFβ2aCleaved.,bActive Thr N terminus.(Pup1p)NDcNot determined.MAGLSFDNYQRNNFLAENSHTQPKATSTG/TTIVGVKFNN …TTIVGVKFTTIVGVKFTTIVGVKFTTIVGVKFTTIVGVKFβ3 (Pup3p)EERAIEPE TFMSDPSSINGGIVVAMTGKDCVAIACDLRLGSQ SLGVSNKF …BlockedSDPSSINGGIBlockedBlockedAc-SDPSSINβ4 (Pre1p, C11)VELPYGA HGYMDIILGIRVQDSVILASSKAVTRGISVLKDSD DKTRQLSP …BlockedBlockedBlockedMDIILGIRVQDAc-MDIILGIβ5aCleaved.,bActive Thr N terminus.(Pre2p)EGPTIYY VDSDGTRLMQAIADSFSVPNRLVKELQYDNEQNLESDFVT GASQFQRLAPSTTTLAFRFTTTLAFRFTTTLAFRFTTTLAFRFTTTLAFRFLTVPPIASPQQFLRAHTDDSRNPDCKIKIAHG/TTTLAFRFQ …β6aCleaved.

The slash (/) in the N-terminal sequence of pro-proteins indicates the site of cleavage in the processed β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7 subunits. Purified proteasome subunits from the normal strain and each of the three mutants were separated by 2D-PAGE. It was found that six subunits in the nat1 mutant, α1, α2, α3, α4, α7, and β3, differed in electrophoretic mobility from those in the normal strain (Fig. 1). These subunits of the nat1 mutant shifted toward the alkaline side of the gels in comparison with those of the normal strain. This shift corresponds to the pI change by acetylation of the α-amino group. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of these subunits could be obtained with Edman degradation in the nat1 mutant but not in the normal strain (Table I). In addition, two subunits, α5 and α6, of the mak3 mutant and the β4 subuit of thenat3 mutant sifted toward the alkaline side of the gels (Fig. 1), and these subunits could be sequenced by Edman degradation. These results suggest that the α1, α2, α3, α4, α7, and β3 subunits are acetylated with NAT1, the α5 and α6 subunits with MAK3, and the β4 subunit with NAT3. The 20 S proteasome has three latent proteolytic activities, chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and PGPH activities. These latent proteolytic activities are known to be activated by SDS and heat (13.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of SDS on protease activities of the latent 20 S proteasome with three types of substrates, Suc-LLVY-MCA for chymotrypsin-like activity, Boc-LRR-MCA for trypsin-like activity, and Z-LLE-MCA for PGPH activity in the nat1 mutant and the normal strain. The optimal concentration of SDS was determined to be 0.02% for stimulation of both chymotrypsin-like and PGPH activities, whereas SDS did not stimulate the trypsin-like activity, confirming the results of others (13.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). The difference of protease activities between the nat1mutant and the normal strain was investigated in the presence or absence of 0.02% SDS (Fig. 2). In the presence of SDS, chymotrypsin-like activity was highly induced in both strains, compared with trypsin-like and PGPH activities. In the absence of SDS, the activities of all three proteases were low in 20 S proteasomes derived from both strains, although the chymotrypsin-like activity of the nat1 mutant was significantly higher (Fig. 2). The effect of pH on the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome derived from thenat1 mutant and the normal strain is shown in Fig.3. In the presence of 0.02% SDS, the optimal pH value for chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome was between 7.5 and 9.0, and the activities of both the normal and nat1 20 S proteasome were essentially identical (Fig. 3 a). In the absence of SDS, the activity levels were extremely low, and no pronounced optimum pH was observed. However, as observed with the experiment shown in Fig. 2, which was carried out at pH 7.5, chymotrypsin-like activity of the nat1 20 S proteasome was significantly higher than the normal 20 S proteasome at all pH levels (Fig. 3). The yeast 20 S proteasome contains 14 different but structurally related subunits, encoded by seven α-type and seven β-type subunit genes. The present study revealed that 9 of 14 subunits are modified at the N terminus, but 6 subunits have free N-terminal amino group in thenat1 mutant, lacking NAT1. In the rat liver proteasome, the α2, α6, and α7 subunits have been shown to be N-terminally blocked with an acetyl group (31.Tokunaga F. Aruga R. Iwanaga S. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Among them, α2 and α7 contain Ala and Ser, respectively, at the N termini, as deduced from the nucleotide sequences, and these N termini are considered to be acetylated by NAT1 after removal of the N-terminal Met. In yeast, the N-terminal amino acid residues of the α1, α2, α3, α4, α7, and β3 subunits of the yeast 20 S proteasome from the nat1mutant were Ser, Thr, Gly, Ser, Thr, and Ser with a free N-terminal amino group, respectively. Thus, it is concluded that these subunits of 20 S proteasome in the normal strain are N-terminally blocked with an acetyl group by NAT1. As emphasized by Polevoda et al. (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), subsets, but not all proteins, with N termini of Ser, Thr, Gly, or Ala are substrates for NAT1. The yeast β4 subunit contains the N-terminal Met and the penultimate Asp and thus is expected to have the N-terminal Met acetylated with NAT3, according to the modification rule in which Met-Glu-, Met-Asp-, and a subset of Met-Asn- proteins serve as substrates (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present study, the β4 subunit was confirmed to beN α-acetylated with NAT3. On the other hand, the α6 subunit of the rat liver proteasome contains Met and the penultimate residue Phe in the N-terminal region and is blocked by an acetyl group (30.Hirano H. Watanabe T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The yeast 20 S proteasome α5 and α6 subunits also contain the N-terminal Met and the penultimate residue Phe. The Met of these subunits was found to beN α-acetylated with MAK3 in the present study. Subsets of proteins with Met-Ile-, Met-Leu-, and Met-Trp- termini were previously reported to be substrates for MAK3 (6.Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32.Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results in this study have extended the known substrates to at least some proteins with Met-Phe-Leu- and Met-Phe-Arg- termini. The remaining subunits, β1, β2, β5, β6, and β7, are processed, resulting in the loss of the N-terminal region (TableI). The yeast proteasome quaternary structure resembles that ofThermoplasma, except that the N-terminal residues of the α subunits, which are disordered in the structure of theThermoplasma proteasome, form tightly closed α-ring constrictions with several layers of interdigitating subunits (20.Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). Namely, within the α rings, intimate α-cis contacts are made by the intertwined N-terminal segments of α1, α2, α3, α6, and α7 subunits in the center of the heptameric rings in yeast. This suggests that the eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes, but not theThermoplasma proteasome, are purified in a latent state and can be activated by mild chaotropic agents such as SDS and heat. Presumably, these agents selectively denature the N-terminal region, resulting in an opening of the channel of the 20 S proteasome cavity (15.Lupas A. Baumeister W. Peters J.M. Harris J.R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 127-146Crossref Google Scholar). The present report shows that in the absence of SDS, chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome in thenat1 mutant, lacking N-terminal acetylation of the subunit, was slightly higher than that from the normal strain. Therefore, it is considered that the 20 S proteasome in the nat1 mutant results in a change of the higher order structure of the 20 S proteasome, possibly opening the channel without activation by mild chaotropic agents. Our results on the lack of a substantial effect of acetylating the α1, α2, α3, α4, α7, and β3 subunits differs from the results of Arendt and Hochstrasser (33.Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Jäger et al. (34.Jäger S.M. Groll R. Huber D.H. Wolf Heinemeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 997-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the abnormalN-acetylation of N-terminal threonine residues in specially engineered β1, β2, or β5 subunits led to diminished function. These β1, β2, and β5 subunits are normally synthesized with an N-terminal propeptide that is autocatalytically cleaved during particle assembly, resulting in termini with threonine residues (Table I). As described above, the free α-amino group of the N-terminal threonine residue serves as a nucleophile in substrate hydolysis. Thus, as discussed by Sherman et al. (35.Sherman F. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Sternglanz R. Imahori K. Sakiyama F. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Plenum Publishing Corporation, New York1993: 173-181Crossref Google Scholar), the lack of N α-acetylation, or even abnormalN α-acetylation, can lead to a wide range of consequences depending on the protein in question, from innocuous or undetectable changes to complete lack of function. We thank S. Tsunasawa and H. Takakura for providing samples and R. M. Kamp for suggestions made during proteasome purification."

Both lesions are repaired by human 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) in human andEscherichia coli cells, respectively. In the present study, the repair activities of hOGG1 and Fpg were compared using defined oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG and a methylated analog of Fapy (me-Fapy) at the same site. Thek cat/K m values of hOGG1 for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy were comparable, and this was also the case for Fpg. However, the k cat/K m values of hOGG1 for both lesions were approximately 80-fold lower than those of Fpg. Analysis of the Schiff base intermediate by NaBH4trapping implied that lower substrate affinity and slower hydrolysis of the intermediate for hOGG1 than Fpg accounted for the difference. hOGG1 and Fpg showed distinct preferences of the base opposite 8-oxoG, with the activity differences being 19.8- (hOGG1) and 12-fold (Fpg) between the most and least preferred bases. Surprisingly, such preferences were almost abolished and less than 2-fold for both enzymes when me-Fapy was a substrate, suggesting that, unlike 8-oxoG, me-Fapy is not subjected to paired base-dependent repair. The repair efficiency of me-Fapy randomly incorporated in M13 DNA varied at the sequence level, but orders of preferred and unpreferred repair sites were quite different for hOGG1 and Fpg. The distinctive activities of hOGG1 and Fpg including enzymatic parameters (k cat/K m), paired base, and sequence context effects may originate from the differences in the inherent architecture of the DNA binding domain and catalytic mechanism of the enzymes. 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxyformamidopyrimidine (Fapy) are major DNA lesions formed by reactive oxygen species and are involved in mutagenic and/or lethal events in cells. Both lesions are repaired by human 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) in human andEscherichia coli cells, respectively. In the present study, the repair activities of hOGG1 and Fpg were compared using defined oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG and a methylated analog of Fapy (me-Fapy) at the same site. Thek cat/K m values of hOGG1 for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy were comparable, and this was also the case for Fpg.

Murphy J.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). 8-oxoG is mutagenic and forms an 8-oxoG(syn-form):A mispair during DNA replication, hence leading to G:C → T:A transversions in bacterial and mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 2.Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 1. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 229-262Google Scholar). The deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphate of 8-oxoG resulting from oxidation of dGTP in the nucleotide pool is also incorporated opposite template A and induces A:T → C:G transversions via the 8-oxoG:A mispair (3.Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 4.Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

To avoid such genotoxic effects of 8-oxoG, cells have a unique repair mechanism, namely the GO system (6.Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 7.Cunningham R.P. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1230-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The GO system ofEscherichia coli is comprised of three enzymes as follows: Fpg/MutM, a glycosylase/lyase removing 8-oxoG from 8-oxoG:C pairs; MutY, a monofunctional glycosylase excising A from 8-oxoG:A mispairs; and MutT, a triphosphatase degrading the triphosphate of 8-oxoG to the innocuous monophosphate. Recently, human homologs of Fpg, MutY, and MutT have been cloned and designated as hOGG1/hMMH (reviewed in Ref.8.David S.S. Williams S.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1221-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), MYH (9.Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Luther W.M. Chiang J. Wei Y. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3885-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and MTH1 (10.Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakumura T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, the genotoxic effects and repair enzymes of 8-oxoG have been characterized fairly well, whereas those of Fapy have been less clarified (11.Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 12.Karahalil B. Girard P.-M. Boiteux S. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The major reason is a lack of the method that enables specific incorporation of the Fapy lesion into DNA or oligonucleotides. For introduction of Fapy as a unique lesion, the use of ionizing radiation, oxidizing chemical reagents, or photooxidation is impractical since these agents are known to produce not only Fapy but also other damage (1.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Until now, most studies on the genotoxicity/cytotoxicity (13.O'Connor T.R. Boiteux S. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5878-5894Google Scholar, 14.Tudek B. Boiteux S. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3079-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and repair (15.Chetsanga C.J. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 5: 3673-3684Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16.Chetsanga C.J. Lozon M. Makaroff C. Savage L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17.van der Kemp P.A. Thomas D. Barbey R. De Oliveira R. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5197-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) of Fapy have been conducted using 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (me-Fapy), an N-methylated analog of Fapy, since me-Fapy can be introduced into DNA as a major damage (15.Chetsanga C.J. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 5: 3673-3684Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To introduce me-Fapy, DNA was first treated with methylating agents followed by base to open the imidazole ring. Although me-Fapy is a major product formed in this treatment, complete conversion of the target guanine to me-Fapy is practically impossible without introducing other unintended damage. The primary reason is that methylation of DNA generates not only 7-methylguanine (m7G, a precursor of me-Fapy) but alsoO- and N-alkylated bases and methyl phosphates simultaneously (18.Pegg A.E. Cancer Invest. 1984; 2: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, certain methylated purines such as 3-methyladenine (m3A) and 3-methylguanine (m3G) readily undergo depurination, thereby generating abasic sites. Therefore, certain precaution is necessary to interpret the results obtained with DNA substrates prepared by the conventional method. Repair enzymes that recognize 8-oxoG also act on Fapy and me-Fapy and excise them from DNA. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ntg1/yOGG2 protein was originally reported to recognize me-Fapy but not 8-oxoG (19.Eide L. Bjoras M. Pirovano M. Alseth I. Berdal K.G. Seeberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10735-10740Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20.You H.J. Swanson R.L. Doetsch P.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6033-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the recent studies on Ntg1/yOGG2 have suggested that both lesions are substrates, and the activity for 8-oxoG varies depending on the paired base (21.Bruner S.D. Nash H.M. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Senturker S. Auffret van der Kemp P. You H.J. Doetsch P.W. Dizdaroglu M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, 8-oxoG DNA glycosylases from bacteria (Fpg), yeast (yOGG1 and Ntg1/yOGG2), and human (hOGG1/hMMH) so far identified recognize me-Fapy as well. Among these enzymes, OGG1 and Fpg are functionally similar enzymes, and cellular repair activity for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy primarily relies on these enzymes. Despite such a functional similarity, their primary amino acid sequences are quite different. Moreover, OGG1, but not Fpg, is a member of endonuclease III superfamily that contains a hairpin-helix-hairpin (HhH)-GPD motif (reviewed in Ref. 8.David S.S. Williams S.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1221-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). For hOGG1, Lys-249 and Asp-268 in the HhH-GPD motif are likely to be involved in the glycosylase/AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic)-lyase activity (23.Nash H.M. Lu R. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas for Fpg, a proline residue in the N-terminal region is responsible for it (24.Tchou J. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11671-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still equivocal how these structurally unrelated proteins can recognize and catalyze excision of both 8-oxoG and me-Fapy. Such a mechanistic question can be best addressed by comparing the intrinsic activities of OGG1 and Fpg for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy using common substrates. In the present work, we have prepared oligonucleotide and DNA substrates containing me-Fapy as unique lesions. The oligonucleotide substrate was tested for hOGG1 and Fpg, and the enzymatic parameters, influences of the paired base, and reaction mechanisms were compared with those for 8-oxoG embedded in the same site. Furthermore, the effects of surrounding sequence contexts on the recognition of me-Fapy by the two enzymes were compared using M13 DNA containing randomly distributed me-Fapy lesions. E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Pol I Kf) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and New England Biolabs, respectively. Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg) and endonuclease IV (Endo IV) were overexpressed in E. coli cells harboring plasmids containing the fpg or nfo gene (gifts from S. S. Wallace and Z. Hatahet, University of Vermont) and purified as described (25.Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1)/MutM homolog (hMMH) was purified as described (26.Roldan-Arjona T. Wei Y.-F.

Carter K.C. Klungland A. Anselmino C. Wang R.-P. Augustus M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8016-8020Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or Aburatani et al.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2151-2156PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented in this paper were obtained with hOGG1/hMMH (type 1a isoform) prepared by the method of Monden et al. (28.Monden Y. Arai T. Asano M. Ohtsuka E. Aburatani H. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The purified hOGG1/hMMH contained 5 additional N-terminal amino acid residues (GPLGS) derived from glutathione S-transferase. The repair enzymes used in this study (Fpg, Endo IV, and hOGG1) were apparently homogenous in SDS-PAGE analysis. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed that the purity of hOGG1/hMMH was over 99%. Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. Oligonucleotides 15PRM, 20PRM, 25COM-N (N = A, G, C, T), 30COM-C, 25G, and 25OX containing 8-oxoG were synthesized by the phosphoramidite method and purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The duplex substrate 25MG/25COM-C containing a single 7-methylguanine (m7G) lesion at the specific position was prepared by the DNA polymerase reaction using 7-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate (m7dGTP) as a substrate. m7dGTP was previously shown to serve as a substrate for Sequanase (T7 DNA polymerase deficient in 3′-5′ exonuclease activity) (29.Hayashibara K.C. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5104-5106Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 15PRM was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (110 Tbq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified as described (30.Ide H. Okagami M. Murayama H. Kimura Y. Makino K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). 15PRM annealed to the template 25COM-C (25 pmol as template/primer) in buffer A (200 μl) was extended by Pol I Kf (25 units) in the presence of dCTP, dTTP (both 20 μm), and m7dGTP (200 μm, Sigma) at 25 °C for 40 min. The composition of buffer A was 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mmmercaptoethanol, and 6.6 mm MgCl2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 50 mm). The control duplex substrate 25G/25COM-G containing G at the same position of m7G was also prepared by a similar DNA polymerase reaction, except that dGTP (20 μm) was used instead of m7dGTP. The reaction mixture was extracted by phenol, and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in water, purified by a Sephadex G-25 column, and finally recovered by ethanol precipitation. The duplex substrate 25FP/25COM-C containing a me-Fapy lesion was prepared by the alkali treatment of 25MG/25COM-C. 25MG/25COM-C in a microdialysis cup was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 11.4) containing 2 mm EDTA at room temperature for 10 h, and then against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA at room temperature for 12 h, and finally against the same buffer at 4 °C for 12 h.Table IList of oligonucleotides used in this studyAbbreviationSequenceaM, 7-methylguanine (m7G); F, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (me-Fapy); O, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG).15PRM5′-CATCGATAGCATCCT25COM-A3′-GTAGCTATCGTAGGAAGGAAGAGAG25COM-G3′-GTAGCTATCGTAGGAGGGAAGAGAG25COM-C3′-GTAGCTATCGTAGGACGGAAGAGAG25COM-T3′-GTAGCTATCGTAGGATGGAAGAGAG30COM-C3′-AAGTCGTAGCTATCGTAGGACGGAAGAGAG25G5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTGCCTTCTCTC25MG5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTMCCTTCTCTC25FP5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTFCCTTCTCTC25OX5′-CATCGATAGCATCCTOCCTTCTCTC20PRM5′-CGTACCAACTTTGAAAGAGGa M, 7-methylguanine (m7G); F, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (me-Fapy); O, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Open table in a new tab Duplex substrates containing me-Fapy paired with four different bases (A, G, C, and T) were prepared as follows. 25MG/30COM-C was prepared by the DNA polymerase reaction using 32P-labeled 15PRM (primer) and 30COM-C (template) as described for 25MG/25COM-C and converted to 25FP/30COM-C by the alkali treatment. Complete conversion of m7G to me-Fapy in 25MG was essential, otherwise remaining m7G underwent depurination during the subsequent purification step. 25FP/30COM-C was heat-denatured at 50 °C in gel loading buffer and separated by 16% PAGE. The use of 30COM-C in place of 25COM-C as a template facilitated separation of 25FP and the template. The band corresponding to 25FP was detected by autoradiography and excised from the gel. 25FP in the crashed gel was extracted by 500 mm ammonium acetate and 10 mmmagnesium acetate, purified by a Sep-Pak cartridge, and finally annealed to appropriate complementary strands (25COM-A, -G, -C, -T). These substrates were resistant to Endo IV, indicating that contamination of oligonucleotides containing abasic sites was negligible (data not shown). The substrates containing 8-oxoG paired with four different bases were prepared by annealing 25OX to 25COM-A, -G, -C, -T. Duplex M13 DNA containing randomly distributed m7G was prepared using the method similar to oligonucleotides with slight modifications. Single-stranded M13mp18 DNA (5 μg, ∼2 pmol) was primed with 20PRM (5′-end-labeled, 4 pmol) and replicated by Pol I Kf (5 units) in buffer A (400 μl, MgCl2 was replaced by 0.5 mm MnCl2) in the presence of dATP, dCTP, dTTP (all 50 μm), dGTP (10 μm), and m7dGTP (50 μm). m7dGTP was incorporated into DNA more uniformly in the presence of Mn2+ than Mg2+. 2K. Asagoshi, H. Terato, Y. Ohyama, and H. Ide, unpublished results. The reaction was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Purification of DNA and the alkali treatment to convert m7G to me-Fapy was performed as described for 25FP. To follow the conversion of m7G to me-Fapy, untreated and alkali-treated 25MG/25COM-C (5 nm) were incubated with Fpg (100 ng) in buffer B (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. The composition of buffer B was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. To reveal abasic sites potentially formed during substrate preparation, untreated and alkali-treated 25MG/25COM were also treated with Endo IV. Untreated and alkali-treated 25MG/25COM-C (5 nm) in buffer C (10 μl) was incubated with Endo IV (8 ng) at 37 °C for 30 min. The composition of buffer C was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. Enzymatic parameters of Fpg and hOGG1 for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy were determined as follows. 25OX/25COM-C and 25FP/25COM-C were incubated with Fpg (0.5 ng) in buffer B (10 μl) at 37 °C for 3 min. For hOGG1, the substrates were incubated with hOGG1 (6 ng) in buffer D (10 μl) at 37 °C for 15 min. The composition of buffer D was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The concentration ranges of the substrate used in the experiments were indicated in the figures. Parameters (V max and K m) were evaluated by a hyperbolic curve-fitting program. The activity of Fpg and hOGG1 to me-Fapy and 8-oxoG paired with four different bases was determined by an essentially similar manner. The substrates (25FP/25COM-N or 25OX/25COM-N (N = A, G, C, T), 5 nm)were incubated with Fpg (2 ng) for 5 min or hOGG1 (6 ng) for 15 min at 37 °C. M13 DNA containing me-Fapy (0.25 μg, ∼0.1 pmol) was incubated with Fpg (5–20 ng) in buffer B (10 μl) or hOGG1 (50–500 ng) in buffer D (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min (Fpg) or 60 min (hOGG1). Reaction products were analyzed by PAGE as described below. For chemical characterization of m7G introduced into substrates, 25MG/25COM-C was heated in water at 90 °C for 1 h to induce depurination of m7G and strand scission. Alternatively, substrates containing m7G or me-Fapy were treated with 10% piperidine at 90 °C for 1 h. Piperidine was removed by repeated evaporation with water, and the sample was resuspended in gel loading buffer. After enzymatic or chemical reactions, the samples were mixed with gel loading buffer (0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide), heated at 50 °C for 5 min, and separated by 8% (M13 DNA) or 16% (oligonucleotides) denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Harsh heat denaturation at high temperatures (i.e. boiling) was avoided to prevent break down of DNA containing the heat-labile lesions. The gel was autoradiographed at −80 °C overnight. Alternatively, the radioactivity of the separated bands was analyzed by Fuji BAS 2000. Cross-link reactions between repair enzymes (Fpg or hOGG1) and substrates (25G/25COM-C, 25OX/25COM-C, 25FP/25COM-C) were performed as follows. An aqueous solution of NaBH4 (500 mm, 1 μl) was added to 8 μl of buffer B (Fpg) or D (hOGG1) containing the substrate (final concentration 2–40 nm). In NaBH4reactions, the salts (NaCl and KCl) and BSA were omitted in buffer B and D. Immediately after, the solution was mixed with Fpg (1.5 ng, 1 μl) or hOGG1 (19.5 ng, 1 μl), and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction solution was mixed with an equal volume of SDS-loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 24% (v/v) glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% SERVA Blue G) and heat-denatured. The sample was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Autoradiography and quantitation of the radioactivity were performed as described above. To analyze Schiff base intermediates without NaBH4 reduction, 25OX/25COM-C (5 nm) was incubated with Fpg and hOGG1 (both 4, 15, 45 ng) in buffer B (Fpg) or D (hOGG1) at 37 °C for 5 min. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. The presence of m7G in 25MG prepared by the DNA polymerase reaction was confirmed by the heat or piperidine treatment. In the heat treatment, 25MG/25COM-C and control 25G/25COM-C (prepared by the similar polymerase reaction) was heated at 90 °C for 1 h, and products were analyzed by PAGE (Fig. 1). The m7G with a heat-labile N-glycosidic bond underwent depurination, and the resulting abasic site was totally cleaved (lane 6). By comparison with the gel mobility of 15PRM (lane 1), the products were identified as β- (minor bands) and δ-elimination (major band) products. In the hot piperidine treatment, 25MG was totally converted to the δ-elimination product migrating slightly faster than 15PRM (lane 7). The complete conversion of 25MG to the β- and δ-elimination products indicated that m7G was quantitatively incorporated in the designed position of 25MG. 25G similarly prepared by Pol I Kf was stable under these conditions (lanes 3 and 4). 25FP/25COM-C containing me-Fapy was prepared by alkali treatment (pH 11.4) of 25MG/25COM-C. To follow the alkali-catalyzed ring opening reaction of m7G, oligonucleotides before and after the alkali treatment were analyzed with Fpg that specifically recognizes me-Fapy. Before the treatment, 25MG (paired with 25COM-C) was not cleaved by Fpg (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) but was almost quantitatively converted to the δ-elimination product after the alkali treatment for 10 h (lane 6). These results indicate quantitative conversion of m7G to me-Fapy by the alkali treatment. Partial depurination of m7G (yielding abasic sites) or fission of the imidazole ring (yielding me-Fapy) in untreated 25MG was ruled out by the resistance to Endo IV (lane 4) and Fpg (lane 3). 25MG treated by alkali for 10 h was also resistant to Endo IV (lane 7), showing the absence of abasic sites in this substrate. Fig. 2 B shows the time course of the conversion of m7G in 25MG to me-Fapy during the alkali treatment. The percent of me-Fapy in the oligonucleotide was determined by quantifying the nicked and unnicked products by Fpg. The proportion of me-Fapy increased with the incubation time with alkali and reached a plateau (∼96%) around 10 h. Thus, me-Fapy lesion was specifically introduced into DNA by the present method. The activities of Fpg and hOGG1 for 8-oxoG and me-Fapy were compared using 25OX/25COM-C and 25FP/25COM-C. The substrates were treated with Fpg or hOGG1, and products were analyzed by PAGE (Fig.3). The treatment of 8-oxoG and me-Fapy with Fpg exclusively resulted in δ-elimination products (Fig. 3,lanes 6 and 9) migrating slightly faster than the 15-mer marker (Fig. 3, 15PRM, lane 1). The treatment with hOGG1 resulted in putative β-elimination products with their gel mobilities slower than the marker (Fig. 3, lanes 7and 10). However, the β-elimination products migrated as several separated bands. The β-elimination products generated by AP lyases, e.g. endonuclease III, sometimes give rise to multiple bands in PAGE analysis, presumably due to Tris-adduct formation (31.Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Absalon M.J. Stubbe J. Cunningham R.P. Withka J. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and/or isomerization of the 3′-hydroxypentenal terminus (32.Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Connor T.R. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33.Doetsch P.W. Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 173-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To clarify the nature of the putative β-elimination products, hOGG1-treated samples were further treated with Endo IV having 3′-phosphodiesterase activity. By this treatment, the β-elimination products were converted to 3′-OH products (Fig. 3,lanes 12 and 14) co-migrating with the standard maker 15PRM (Fig. 3, lane 1). The same treatment of the δ-elimination products formed by Fpg also resulted in the 3′-OH products (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 13). Therefore, the products generated by hOGG1 are likely to be a mixture of β-elimination products bearing different 3′-terminal deoxyribose modifications. To obtain kinetic parameters, the initial velocities of the reaction (V) were determined at varying substrate concentrations (S). The S-V plots for Fpg and hOGG1 are shown in Fig.4. The enzymatic parameters are summarized in Table II.Table IIKinetic parameters of Fpg and hOGG1 for me-Fapy and 8-oxoGEnzyme/substrateK maAverage of three independent experiments with standard deviations.V maxaAverage of three independent experiments with standard deviations.k catk cat/K mbNumbers in parentheses are relative values.nmnm/minmin −1FpgcConcentrations of Fpg and hOGG1 were 1.5 and 15 nm, respectively. 8-OxoG13 ± 42.7 ± 0.71.80.14 (82) Me-Fapy38 ± 97.7 ± 1.25.10.13 (76)hOGG1cConcentrations of Fpg and hOGG1 were 1.5 and 15 nm, respectively. 8-OxoG23 ± 80.51 ± 0.170.0340.0015 (0.9) Me-Fapy15 ± 40.38 ± 0.130.0250.0017 (1)a Average of three independent experiments with standard deviations.b Numbers in parentheses are relative values.c Concentrations of Fpg and hOGG1 were 1.5 and 15 nm, respectively. Open table in a new tab hOGG1 and Fpg are known to form transient imine intermediates (Schiff base) in the reaction with substrates containing 8-oxoG (reviewed in Ref. 8.David S.S. Williams S.D. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1221-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Reduction of the imine bond by NaBH4 leads to formation of irreversibly cross-linked complexes between the enzyme and substrate. To verify the proposed mechanism further, NaBH4-trapping experiments were performed using the substrate containing me-Fapy. 25FP/25COM-C and 25OX/25COM-C were incubated with Fpg or hOGG1 in the presence of NaBH4, and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.5). The upper shifted bands clearly indicated formation of the cross-linked complexes between 25FP and Fpg (Fig. 5, lane 9) or hOGG1 (Fig. 5, lane 10). The complex for Fpg (molecular mass = 30 kDa) migrated faster than that for hOGG1 (39 kDa) due to the molecular mass difference of the cross-linked enzymes. Similar upper shifted bands were also observed for 25OX containing 8-oxoG (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7) but not for intact 25G (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the Schiff base formation was specific to the lesioned substrates (25FP and 25OX). The amount of cross-linked products was determined at varying substrate concentrations to obtain parameters for the Schiff base formation. The correlation between the concentrations of substrate ([S]) and trapped Schiff base ([SB]) is shown in Fig. 6. For both 8-oxoG and me-Fapy, the amount of cross-linked products increased with the substrate concentration and reached plateaus. By applying simple Michaelis-Menten analysis to the data, approximate dissociation constants (K ES) were evaluated (Table III).

https://openalex.org/W2053143976,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) present in tobacco smoke and tar, have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis as well as cancer. Increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been detected both in atherosclerotic lesions and in epithelial cancers. To determine whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons might directly affect COX expression in vascular cells, we investigated the effects of B[a]P on COX-2 expression in human and rat arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC). Treatment with B[a]P increased levels of COX-2 protein and mRNA and enhanced prostaglandin synthesis. Nuclear runoff assays and transient transfections revealed increased COX-2gene transcription after treatment with B[a]P. Experiments were done to define the signaling mechanism by which B[a]P induced COX-2. B[a]P caused a rapid increase in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK); pharmacologic inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase blocked B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2. Depletion of the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione, with buthionine sulfoximine significantly increased B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2 while exposure to N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, suppressed the induction of COX-2 by B[a]P. Several lines of evidence suggest that the induction of COX-2 by B[a]P is mediated, at least in part, by NF-κB. Treatment with B[a]P increased binding of NF-κB to DNA. Moreover, B[a]P-mediated stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity was blocked when a construct containing a mutagenized NF-κB site was used. Pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB blocked the induction of COX-2 protein and the stimulation of COX-2 promoter activity by B[a]P. Taken together, these data are likely to be important for understanding the atherogenic effects of tobacco smoke.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxides which are converted enzymatically into prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane A2 that play both physiologic and pathologic roles in vascular function. COX is capable of cooxidizing B[a]P; the peroxyl radicals formed during arachidonate metabolism catalyze the epoxidation of B[a]P to its mutagenic products (15.Guthrie J. Robertson L.G.C. Zeiger E.

This study is designed to explore the effect of B[a]P on COX-2 in human arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) from atherosclerotic lesions and in rat aortic SMC. We show that exposure to B[a]P increases COX-2 gene expression and protein production and that these effects, which are augmented by oxidant stress, are mediated by ERK1/2-MAPK signaling and the transcription factor NF-κB. DMEM medium was obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MA); fetal bovine serum was from Gemini-Bio-Products (Calabasas, CA). NS 398 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide), COX-2 polyclonal antibody, COX-2 standard, and enzyme immunoassay reagents were from Cayman Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Human COX-2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Stephen M. Prescott (University of Utah). Specific rat COX-2 primers and β-actin primers were made by Genosys (The Woodlands, TX).

Polyclonal antibody to phospho-ERK1/2-MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) was from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). B[a]P, Tri Reagent, and all other chemicals and biochemicals were from Sigma. Fisher-344 rats were from the National Institutes of Health Aging Institute Colony. Rat SMC (rSMC), explanted from the aortas of 18-month-old Fisher-344 rats, were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 1× minimal essential medium vitamins, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). These rSMC were previously shown to have atherogenic potential and enhanced proliferative capacity (37.McCaffrey T. Nicholson A. Szabo P. Weksler M. Weksler B.B. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Passage 10–14 rSMC were grown to 80% confluence and then growth arrested by incubation in 0.5% FBS/DMEM for 48 h prior to use. Human arterial SMC isolated in our laboratory from atherosclerotic carotid artery lesions under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols (E12 cells, hSMC) were cultured in the same medium detailed above and were incubated in 0.5% FBS/DMEM for 48 h prior to use. In studies of both cell types, medium was removed following growth arrest and replaced by fresh 0.5% FBS/DMEM to which B[a]P (0.5–10 μm) was added for 18–24 h to rSMC or for 6 h to hSMC prior to harvest of cells. SMC were washed twice and homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the method of Lowry. Proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated on a denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 3% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For detection of COX-2, polyclonal anti-COX-2 antibody (1:1,000) was incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase was used at 1:10,000, and signals were visualized by the ECL technique using Kodak x-ray film. For detection of ERK1/2-MAPK total protein, the primary antibody was rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1,000), whereas for detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2-MAPK, an antibody that recognizes only the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2-MAPK was used. The effects of different treatments on total COX activity of SMC were determined in intact cells cultured in 24-well plates and stimulated with B[a]P for 6 h, following which medium was removed and prewarmed serum-free medium containing 10 μm sodium arachidonate was added to stimulate maximum prostaglandin release. After 15 min, this medium was collected to measure formation of 6-keto-PGF1α, the stable metabolite of PGI2, or prostaglandin E2(PGE2), by specific enzyme immunoassay as described previously (23.Rimarachin J.A. Jacobson J.A. Szabo P. Maclouf J. Creminon C. Weksler B.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of oxidant stress on B[a]P-induced COX-2 protein synthesis, growth-arrested rSMC were pretreated with 100 μml-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) for 24 h and then stimulated with B[a]P for 18 h or were incubated at the same time with both B[a]P and 200 μm N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 18 h. Cells were then harvested for Western analysis as above. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells using Tri Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Tri Reagent (1 ml/T-25 flask) was added to the tissue culture flasks for 10 min. Cell lysates were harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C after adding 1/10 volume of chloroform. The upper aqueous layer was mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol to precipitate RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in DEPC-treated water. RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg total cellular RNA using random hexamer primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. One μg of cDNA was amplified for 30 cycles using the following rat COX-2 gene-specific primers (38.Feng L. Sun W. Xia Y. Tang W.W. Chanmugam P. Soyoola E. Wilson C.B. Hwang D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar): 5′-ACTTGCCTCACTTTGTTGAGTCATTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTTGATTAGTACTGTAGGGTTAATG-3′ (antisense). The cycling parameters were the following: 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 s at 60 °C for primer annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for polymerization. Meanwhile, the same amount of cDNA was amplified for 20 cycles using specific β-actin primers: 5′-GAGACCTTCAACACCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGCC-3′ (antisense). The products were visualized after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Ten μg of total cellular RNA per lane were electrophoresed in a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After baking, membranes were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer (SSPE), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 3 h and hybridized in the above solution containing 32P-labeled COX-2 cDNA probes for 16 h at 42 °C. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed twice for 20 min in 2× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, twice for 20 min in the same solution at 55 °C, and twice for 20 min in 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Washed membranes were then exposed to x-ray film. To verify the equivalency of RNA loading in the different lanes, the membranes were rehybridized with a probe for 18 S rRNA. The signal level of the bands was quantified densitometrically. Serum-deprived hSMC plated in T150 cell culture dishes were grown to 80% confluence, serum-starved for 48 h, and then stimulated with 1 μm B[a]P for 3 h. Nuclei were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen until use for transcription assays as described previously (39.Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were incubated in reaction buffer containing 100 μCi of uridine 5′-[α-32P]triphosphate and unlabeled nucleotides. After 30 min, labeled nascent RNA transcripts were isolated. COX-2 and 18S rRNA cDNAs were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes and prehybridized overnight. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h using 5 × 105 cpm of labeled nascent RNA transcripts. The filters were washed twice with 2× SSC buffer at 55 °C for 1 h and were then treated with 10 mg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed. Human SMC were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well culture dishes and grown for 24 h in medium containing 5% FBS.COX-2 promoter-luciferase plasmid DNA (40.Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and pSV-β-galactosidase were co-transfected into cells using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were maintained in 5% FBS/DMEM for another 24 h and then stimulated with B[a]P for 3 h. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured in the cellular extracts using an enhanced luciferase assay kit. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (41.Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds) (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, Ch. 9.7B, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Human vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with B[a]P in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 2 h. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42.Zhang F. Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2424-2428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For binding studies, an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was used with the following sequence: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (sense) and 3′-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5′ (antisense). A mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. for additional binding studies. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 20 mmTris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The annealed oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was performed by incubating 2 μg of nuclear protein in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 300 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 10 μl for 10 min at 25 °C. The labeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for an additional 20 min at 25 °C. To detect an antibody supershift, 2 μl of antibody to NF-κB p65 or p50 were added to the reaction mixture for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Data are presented as mean ± S.D., and statistical comparisons were made using the Student'st test for paired observations or analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Significance was defined at the p< 0.05 level. B[a]P treatment of hSMC produced a dose-dependent induction of COX-2 protein, maximal at 1 μm B[a]P (Fig.1 A). Treatment of rSMC with B[a]P also produced a dose- and time-dependent induction of COX-2 protein (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively.) Maximal effects were observed at 5 μmB[a]P and 18 h, respectively. To determine if B[a]P-induced COX-2 enzyme was functional, prostaglandin production was measured. Synthesis of PGE2, the main prostaglandin produced by hSMC, increased by 2–3-fold; this increase was blocked by 2 μm NS 398, a known specific COX-2 inhibitor (data not shown). Serum-deprived rSMC similarly treated with B[a]P increased prostaglandin production (mainly PGI2) up to 8-fold in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal production in response to 1–5 μmB[a]P (data not shown). Northern blot analysis was done to determine whether B[a]P induced COX-2 mRNA. Steady state levels of COX-2 mRNA increased after 1–3 h of exposure to B[a]P in both types of vascular SMC (Fig. 2). To determine if B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2 mRNA involved increased transcription, de novo COX-2 mRNA synthesis was determined by nuclear runoff assay in hSMC treated for 3 h with 1 μm B[a]P. Fig.3 A shows that B[a]P stimulated the transcription of COX-2. This increase was similar in extent to that induced by PMA, a known inducer of COX-2 gene expression. In complementary studies, transient transfections were performed with a human COX-2promoter-luciferase reporter construct (−1432/+59) demonstrating that exposure to B[a]P resulted in more than a 100% increase in COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3B[a]P increasesCOX-2 transcription and promoter activity. A, nuclear run-off. Nuclei were isolated from hSMC treated for 3 h with 0.01% Me2SO, 1 μmB[a]P, or 10 ng/ml PMA. Nuclear run-off assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” B[a]P treatment increased COX-2 transcription in hSMC to a similar degree as did PMA. B, COX-2 promoter activity. hSMC were cotransfected with 1.8 μg/ml COX-2promoter construct (−1432/+59) ligated to luciferase and 0.2 μg/ml pSV-β-galactosidase. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with or without 1 μm B[a]P for 3 h, and cell lysates were prepared to measure luciferase activity. The values expressed have been normalized to co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. Exposure to B[a]P significantly increased COX-2 promoter activity.

Serum-deprived rSMC either were pretreated for 24 h with 100 μm BSO and then with 5 μm B[a]P or were co-incubated with B[a]P and NAC for 18 h. Western blot analysis revealed that BSO alone caused a small increase in COX-2 protein (Fig.4 A). Markedly increased levels of COX-2 protein were detected in SMC pretreated with BSO and then exposed to B[a]P (Fig. 4 A). Conversely, NAC treatment blocked B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2 protein (Fig. 4 B.) To define the mechanism of B[a]P-mediated COX-2 induction in SMC, we examined the effect of B[a]P on ERK1/2 MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig.5 A (5 left lanes), B[a]P induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, with maximal activity appearing 20–30 min after initiating exposure to B[a]P. Amounts of ERK1/2 MAPK protein were unaffected by B[a]P during the same time interval (Fig. 5 B, 5 left lanes). To investigate whether ERK1/2 MAPK mediated the induction of COX-2 by B[a]P, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase, was used to block activation of ERK1/2 MAPK. Treatment of SMC with 20 μm PD98059 decreased B[a]P-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK (Fig.5 A). However, neither B[a]P nor PD98059 altered the total amounts of ERK1/2 MAPK (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of rSMC with 20 μmPD98059 also decreased B[a]P-mediated induction ofCOX-2 mRNA (Fig. 6 A), COX-2 protein (Fig.6 B), and prostaglandin synthesis (Fig. 6 C). The decline in both basal and B[a]P-stimulated PG synthesis in the presence of PD98059 can be attributed to the known inhibitory effect of PD98059 on enzymatic activity of COX-1 and COX-2 (43.Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasque S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), in addition to suppression of any increase in COX-2 protein. In contrast, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, had little effect on B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2 protein although it also decreased COX-2 enzymatic activity (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB signaling can stimulateCOX-2 transcription. Therefore, to study whether NF-κB binding mediates B[a]P-induced COX-2 gene transcription, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed. NF-κB binding activity increased in SMC treated with B[a]P (Fig. 7, Aand B). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by using excess unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (Fig.7 A) and an oligonucleotide containing a mutant NF-κB (Fig. 7 B). Supershift analyses identified both NF-κB p65 and p50 proteins in the binding complex (Fig. 7 B). The functional importance of NF-κB in mediating the induction of COX-2 by B[a]P was then tested by transient transfections. B[a]P treatment led to a 2-fold increase in COX-2 promoter activity. Stimulation by B[a]P was blocked by mutating the NF-κB (−223/−214) site in the 5′-region of the COX-2 promoter (Fig.7 C). Furthermore, inhibitors of NF-κB activation, Bay 11–7085 and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC), blocked B[a]P-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 8 A) and COX-2 protein (Fig.8 B).Figure 8NF-κB inhibitors block B[a]P-induction of COX-2. A, COX-2 promoter activity. hSMC were transfected with a human COX-2promoter (−1432/+59) construct ligated to luciferase. After transfection, cells were pretreated with NF-κB inhibitors, 0.1 mm PDTC, or 5 μm BAY 11–7085, for 1 h before exposure to 1 μm B[a]P for 3 h. Luciferase activity represents data that have been normalized to cotransfected β-galactosidase activity. Both NF-κB inhibitors blocked B[a]P-induced COX-2 promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W1565184863,"Induction of transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus 1 long terminal repeat by the RelA (p65) NF-κB subunit has been shown to be dependent upon an interaction with the zinc finger DNA-binding domain of Sp1. It was unknown, however, whether NF-κB could also interact with other zinc finger-containing transcription factors. In this study we demonstrate that the early growth response transcription factor Egr-1, whose DNA-binding domain shares a high degree of homology with that of Sp1, can also interact with RelA in vitro and regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity in vivo. Similar to the interaction with Sp1, the Rel homology domain of RelA interacts with the zinc finger domain of Egr-1. Surprisingly, and in contrast to Sp1, Egr-1 specifically represses RelA transcriptional activity through its zinc finger domain. Moreover, the interaction between RelA and the Egr-1 zinc fingers is mutually exclusive with DNA binding suggesting a model in which Egr-1 directly sequesters NF-κB from its target promoters. Because Egr-1 is induced by many of the same stimuli that activate NF-κB, this novel transcriptional regulatory mechanism has many implications for the involvement of both factors in cellular processes such as apoptosis and the response to stress and infection.

Both NF-κB1 and Egr-1 (also known as NGFI-A, Krox-24, or Zif268) are examples of transcription factors that function as important regulators of such cellular responses. NF-κB is a heterodimeric or homodimeric complex formed from five distinct subunits, RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p105/p50), and NF-κB2 (p100/p52) (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 2.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 3.Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These subunits share a sequence of approximately 300 amino acids within their amino termini, termed the Rel homology domain (RHD), which mediates DNA binding, dimerization, and interactions with heterologous transcription factors. NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 share a high degree of homology and are both synthesized as precursor proteins. Both remain in the cytoplasm until proteolytic processing yields the DNA-binding isoforms termed p50 and p52, respectively. In contrast, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel do not require proteolytic processing and contain transactivation domains within their carboxyl termini. Distinct combinations of subunits determine the specificity of transcriptional activation (3.Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and although most NF-κB subunits freely homo- and heterodimerize, there are some exceptions with RelB only efficiently dimerizing with p50 and p52 (4.Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NF-κB expression is rapidly induced by a range of stimuli including ionizing radiation, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1, growth factors, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol esters, and hypoxia (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 2.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 5.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). In the majority of unstimulated cell types, NF-κB is retained within the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to its inhibitor protein IκB (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar,2.Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 5.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). With most inducers of NF-κB, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated and thus becomes targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteosome. This releases NF-κB, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it can induce the expression of a diverse array of gene products, such as cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, immunoreceptors, and other transcription factors that mediate the cellular response to the initial stimulus (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 2.Baldwin A.S. Annu.

Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These genes will vary, however, dependent on the cell type and the nature of the stimulation. NF-κB is also an important regulator of cellular apoptosis. The RelA knockout mouse dies in utero as a result of extensive liver apoptosis (7.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of RelA has been shown to promote resistance to apoptosis induced by TNFα, ionizing radiation, and cancer therapeutic compounds (8.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 9.Wang C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 10.Van Antwerp D.J.

Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Under some circumstances, however, activation of NF-κB can lead to the induction of apoptosis (12.Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13.Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms exist to regulate the specificity of transcriptional activation by NF-κB. Different NF-κB homo- and heterodimers have subtly different DNA-binding specificities which can result in differential targeting to variant κB elements within promoters and enhancers (3.Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of different NF-κB subunit combinations will vary depending on the cell type, the stimulus, and the time point after activation (3.Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition to these important regulatory mechanisms, however, the interaction of different subunit complexes with heterologous transcription factors can also determine the selectivity and specificity of NF-κB-mediated gene activation. For example, RelA has been shown to interact with the serum response factor and with many b-Zip containing proteins, such as members of the C/EBP and Fos/Jun families of transcription factors (3.Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). RelA has also been shown to both bind DNA cooperatively and physically associate with the zinc finger containing transcription factor Sp1 (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,15.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Efficient induction of transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat by RelA was shown to require this interaction with Sp1, which was mediated by the RHD and zinc finger domains of these proteins respectively (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 15.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It was unknown, however, whether NF-κB transcriptional activity was regulated by interactions with other similar zinc finger-containing transcription factors. Egr-1 is an 80-kDa phosphoprotein and a member of the early growth response family of transcription factors which also includes Egr-2, Egr-3, and Egr-4 (16.Khachigian L.M. Collins T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17.Liu C.T. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1996; 7: 101-125Google Scholar). These proteins contain a DNA-binding domain, homologous to that found in Sp1, composed of three zinc fingers of the C2H2 type that recognizes the consensus, GC-rich, DNA sequence 5′-GCG(G/T)GGGCG-3′ (18.Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 19.Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the zinc finger domain of Egr-1 alone has been shown to be capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth (20.Huang R.P. Liu C.T. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). In many promoters, Sp1 and Egr-1 binding sites have been shown to overlap with induction of Egr-1 preventing Sp1 from interacting with its recognition element (21.Thottassery J.V. Sun D.X.

A number of recent reports suggested that Egr-1 might function similarly to Sp1 and both interact with and modulate NF-κB transcriptional activity. The expression of Egr-1 can be induced by a range of stimuli, which in many cases overlap with those known to be capable of inducing NF-κB expression. These include ionizing radiation (28.Ahmed M.M.

Interestingly, Egr-1 can also induce expression of TNFα, a potent activator of NF-κB (28.Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J.

Furthermore, NF-κB and Egr-1 cooperate to induce expression of the NF-κB1 gene, although in this report the authors indicated that they did not observe any direct interaction between the proteins (48.Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given these observations and our interest in whether other zinc finger-containing transcription factors might modulate NF-κB function, we have investigated whether Egr-1 can interact with and regulate RelA transcriptional activity. We have found that Egr-1 specifically represses NF-κB transcriptional activity. Surprisingly, this repression occurs through its zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Moreover, the RHD of the RelA NF-κB subunit specifically interacts with the Egr-1 zinc fingers but in a manner mutually exclusive with DNA binding, suggesting that Egr-1 might repress RelA by preventing its interaction with promoter target elements. The construction and sequence of the 2X κB and κB/Sp1 E1B CAT reporter plasmids have been described previously (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J.

The activation domain of RelA (from amino acids 428–551) was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) and inserted into the BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 Gal4. The RSV-IκBα transdominant negative expression construct has been detailed elsewhere (50.Wu B.Y. Woffendin C. MacLachlan I. Nabel G.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3161-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length human Egr-1 cDNA (pcDNA Egr-1) was the kind gift of Dr. Andrew Ward, University of Bath, United Kingdom. The pET3a Egr-1(ZnF) plasmid, containing the Egr-1 zinc finger domain (encoding aa 331–427) was constructed by PCR using Pfu Turbo with the following primers: 5′-CGCG GGATCC ACACCCCCCCATGAACGCCCATATGCTTGC-3′ (sense), and 5′-CGCG GGATCCTCTAGA TTAGTCTGCTTTCTTGTCCTTCTGTCT-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was isolated and subcloned into theBamHI site of pET3a downstream of the T7 tag, under the control of the T7 promoter. The pBS Egr-1 (NTD) plasmid, containing the amino-terminal domain of Egr-1 (encoding aa 1–330), was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CGC GTCGACAAGCTT CACCATGGCCGCGGCCAAGGCCGAGATGC-3′ (sense), 5′-CGC TCTAGA TTACTTGCTGGGCCGGTTGGG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was isolated and subcloned into theSalI-XbaI sites of Bluescript under the control of the T7 promoter. To optimize expression of full-length Egr-1 in human 293 cells, the full-length cDNA was amplified using PCR with the Egr-1 amino-terminal sense primer (see above) in conjunction with a carboxyl-terminal primer 5′-CGC TCTAGA TTAGCAAATTTCAATTGTCCTGGG-3′ (antisense) and then subcloned as a SalI-XbaI fragment into the pVR 1012 cytomegalovirus expression plasmid (51.Hartikka J.

The pcDNA3 Egr-1 (ZnF) plasmid was created by PCR from pET3a Egr-1 (ZnF) using the following primer: 5′-GCGC AAGCTT CACCATGGCTAGCATGACTGGTGG -3′ (sense), which encodes the T7 tag from pET3a and the Egr-1 ZnF-antisense primer (see above). The desired PCR product was isolated and subcloned as a HindIII-BamHI fragment into pcDNA3. Plasmids pBS-Sp1FL (encoding full-length Sp1), pET-Sp1 (N-terminal) (encoding aa 81 to 613), and pET-Sp1 (ZnF) (encoding the Sp1 zinc fingers) have all been described (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L.

The pcDNA3-Sp1 (ZnF) plasmid, which encodes the Sp1 zinc finger domain (encoding aa 560–619) was amplified from pET-Sp1 (ZnF) using the same amino-terminal primer annealing to the pET3a T7 tag used to create pcDNA3 Egr-1 (ZnF) (see above) and 5′-GCA GGATCCTCTAGA TTACTTCTTATTCTGGTGGGTCTT-3′ (antisense). The desired PCR product was isolated and subcloned as a HindIII-XbaI fragment into pcDNA3. All restriction sites in the oligonucleotides listed above are inbold italics with the Kozak sequences underlinedand initiating methionine residues in bold. Techniques used for cell culture and TNFα stimulations have been described previously (52.Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium phosphate transient transfection of human U20S osteosarcoma cells and 293 embryonic kidney cells has been detailed previously (52.Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All transfected cells were harvested at 24 h post-transfection except those used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis and where endogenous, non-TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activity was being assayed, which were harvested after 48 h. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity was assayed on 20–50 μg of whole cell extract, except for those assays where endogenous NF-κB activity was analyzed where 100 μg was used. Data were scanned using a Fujifilm FLA-2000 phosphorimager and then quantitated using MacBas version 2.5 quantitation software (Fujifilm Photo company Ltd.). For the preparation of nuclear extracts, 293 cells were transfected with 10–20 μg of the appropriate plasmids. Transfected cells were then harvested 48 h later, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (53.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed using 5 μg of crude nuclear extract in a 20-μl reaction volume consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 ng of poly(dI·dC) and ∼0.1 ng of the appropriate [32P]dATP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and then DNA-protein complexes were resolved using 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA-4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. GST and GST RelA (RHD), expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α, were purified using glutathione-agarose as described previously (15.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were synthesized using the TnT-Quick system (Promega Corp.) where the reticulocyte lysate had first been specifically depleted of endogenous NF-κB using Sepharose-linked, multimerized double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an NF-κB binding site. GST or GST RelA (RHD) (∼1 μg), bound to glutathione-agarose beads, was incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled protein in 100 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm NaV) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Where indicated, 100 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing 1X κB, 1X Egr-1, 2X κB, 2X Egr-1, 1X E2F binding sites, a control DNA sequence derived from the angiotensinogen promoter, or the κB and Egr-1 sites from the p105 promoter (with either the intervening spacer DNA present or deleted) (48.Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were added at this point. After incubation, the glutathione-agarose resin was washed with three 500-μl volumes of incubation buffer before being resuspended in 20 μl of SDS loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. Denatured proteins were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then fixed in a solution of 5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, 5% (v/v) propan-2-ol, washed, submerged in Autofluor (National Diagnostics), dried, and then exposed to photographic film overnight at −80 °C. The sequence of the κB/Egr-1 oligonucleotide (sites are underlined) derived from the p105 promoter, sense strand only, is 5′- TCGAGTAGGGCTTCCCCCACCCCCGGCAGCGACCCTACCTCCCGCCCCCGCAGTG-3′. The sequence of the ΔS κB/Egr-1 oligonucleotide derived from the p105 promoter but with the spacer region deleted, sense strand only, is 5′-TCGAGTGCGGGCTTCCCCCACCCCGCCCCCGCTGCGTG-3′. The zinc finger domain of Egr-1 is highly homologous with that of Sp1 and in many cases their respective DNA binding sites in cellular promoters have been found to overlap (21.Thottassery J.V.

Because an interaction with the Sp1 zinc finger domain is required for NF-κB-mediated stimulation of transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Egr-1 could also regulate transactivation by the RelA NF-κB subunit. Initial experiments were performed using a minimal κB/Sp1 E1B CAT reporter plasmid, which contains the core 3′-NF-κB and 5′-Sp1 motifs from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. RelA activation of this reporter plasmid has been previously shown to require the Sp1 motif in mammalian cells (14.Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RelA and Sp1 synergistically stimulate transcription from this promoter when cotransfected into Drosophila SL2 cells (15.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when an Egr-1 expression plasmid was cotransfected with RelA and κB/Sp1 E1B CAT into U2OS cells, a strong repression of RelA-induced CAT activity was observed (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether this repression was occurring through Egr-1 binding directly to the Sp1 site or resulted from a direct effect on RelA itself, a minimal NF-κB reporter plasmid was used containing two tandem κB elements upstream of the adenovirus E1B TATA box (2X κB E1B CAT) (15.Perkins N.D. Agranoff A.B. Pascal E. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6570-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Surprisingly and similar to the result observed in Fig.1 A, Egr-1 repressed RelA-mediated transactivation of the 2X κB E1B CAT plasmid, both as homodimer and when cotransfected"

Crystal structures of the ferric-NO forms of wild type (WT) fungal NOR, and of the Ser286 → Val and Ser286 → Thr mutant enzymes were determined to 1.7-Å resolution at cryogenic temperature (100 K). This shows a slightly tilted and bent NO binding to the heme iron, in sharp contrast to the highly bent NO coordination found in ferrous hemoproteins. In the WT structure, a specific hydrogen-bonding network that connects the active site to the solvent was identified, H2O(Wat74)-Ser286-H2O(Wat33)-Asp393-solvent. Wat74 is located 3.10 Å from the iron-bound NO. Replacement of Ser286 with Val or Thr scarcely alters the NO coordination structure but expels the water molecules, Wat74 from the active site. The Asp393 mutation does not influence the position of Wat74, but disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network at Wat33, as evidenced by enzymatic, kinetic, and spectroscopic (resonance Raman and IR) results. The structural changes observed upon the Ser286 or the Asp393 mutation are consistent with the dramatic loss of the enzymatic activity for the NO reduction of fungal NOR. We have conclusively identified the water molecule, Wat74, adjacent to the iron-bound NO as a proton donor to the Fe-NO moiety.

Nitric oxide (NO)1serves as a messenger molecule for a variety of biological functions, including neurotransmission, vascular relaxation, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation. In mammalian systems, NO is generated froml-arginine and molecular oxygen (O2), via catalysis by heme-enzyme nitric-oxide synthase, whose crystal structure has recently been reported (1.Crane B.R.

Subsequently, the generated NO binds to the heme iron of soluble guanylate cyclase activating the conversion of GTP to cGMP. In addition, the crystal structures of the heme-based NO transport protein, nitrophorin, of a blood sucking insect were recently reported (4.Weichsel A. Andersen J.F. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A.

NO is also a potential ligand (inhibitor) of many hemoproteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, and peroxidase (6.Brucker E.A. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Phillips Jr., G.N.

Despite the close relation of NO to hemoproteins, only a small amount of structural information is available for NO adduct of hemoproteins. It is particularly noteworthy that much less is known concerning the ferric-NO (Fe3+-NO) complex of hemoproteins, and only one crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase by Poulos and co-workers (8.Edwards S.L.

Fungal nitric oxide reductase (NOR), a heme enzyme, is involved in the denitrification process by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum(11.Nakahara K. Tanimoto K. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, NO is produced from the reduction of NO2− catalyzed by nitrite reductase, which represents an additional NO generating biological system. In order to detoxify the generated NO, fungal NOR converts NO to N2O by the reaction (11.Nakahara K. Tanimoto K. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol.

Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); Fe3++NO→Fe3+NOEquation EScheme_2 Fe3+NO+NADH→I+NAD+Equation EScheme_3 I+NO+H+→Fe3++N2O+H2OEquation EScheme_4 I is designated as the reaction intermediate, which is transiently generated in the catalytic reaction. The formation of I , i.e. the NADH-dependent reduction of the Fe3+-NO form, is the rate-determining step of the overall reaction. Recent time-resolved resonance Raman investigations have led to the suggestion that the intermediate is possibly in a Fe2+(NO)−H+ state, which is suitable for subsequent N-O bond cleavage and N-N bond formation in the third reaction step (Scheme 4) (13.Obayashi E. Takahashi S. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12964-12965Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Fe3+-NO form represents one of the key states in terms of our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the reduction of NO by fungal NOR. We recently reported crystal structures of fungal NOR in the ferric resting and ferrous CO states at a 2.0-Å resolution at room temperature (14.Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This represents the first report of the crystal structure of an enzyme which has NO reduction activity. The overall structure is essentially the same as those of monooxygenase cytochrome P450s, and is consistent with our conclusion that the fungal NOR is a member of the P450 superfamily (CYP 55A1) (15.Kizawa H.

The crystal structure indicated that Ser286 is present in the heme pocket, and forms a hydrogen-bonding network which connects the active site of the enzyme to the solvent region through Asp393: H2O(Wat74)-Ser286-H2O(Wat33)-Asp393-solvent (Ser286/Asp393 hydrogen-bonding network). When the Ser286 residue was replaced by Val or Thr, via mutagenesis techniques, the resultant mutant enzymes, S286V (Ser286 → Val) and S286T (Ser286 → Thr), exhibited only 1 and 8% activities of the wild type (WT) enzyme, respectively, suggesting the critical role of Ser286. A crystallographic and spectrophotometric study of the Ser286 and Asp393 mutation effects on the structure of the Fe3+-NO form of fungal NOR was required in order to understand the molecular mechanism of the biological NO reduction. In the present study, we report on the crystal structure of the Fe3+-NO complex of fungal NOR at cryogenic temperature. The use of cryogenic crystallography permits the assignment of the hydrogen-bonding networks in the heme pocket of the Fe3+-NO form more precisely, since even water molecules, which are rapidly exchanging with solvent water would be expected to be crystallographically visible. We have also determined the crystal structures of the Ser286 mutants, S286V and S286T, in the ferric-NO state at cryogenic temperature to reveal the Ser286 mutation effects on the overall structure, the location of water molecules, the NO coordination, and related issues. In combination with some enzymatic, kinetic, and spectroscopic results of, not only the Ser286 mutants, but also the Asp393 mutants, D393L (Asp393 → Leu) and D393V (Asp393 → Val), we discuss the role of the Ser286/Asp393 hydrogen-bonding network in the NO reduction by fungal NOR. The N-terminal coding portion of fungal NOR cDNA (15.Kizawa H. Tomura D. Oda M. Fukamizu A. Hoshino T. Gotoh O. Yasui T. Shoun H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 266: 10632-10637Google Scholar) was replaced with theNdeI-BssHII oligonucleotide duplex; TATGGCATCTGGTGCTCCGTCTTTCCCGTTCTCG ACCGTAGACCACGAGGCAGAAAGGGCAAGAGCGCGC composed of the Escherichia coli optimal codons, and the resultant fragment was cloned into the pRSET-C vector for its expression under the control of the T7 promoter. JM109(DE3) was used as an E. coli host strain. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using these mutated primers. The wild type (WT) and mutant genes were expressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3), and the gene products were purified by essentially the same procedure as has been reported for the native enzyme from F. oxysporum (11.Nakahara K. Tanimoto K. Hatano K. Usuda K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8350-8355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Shoun H. Sudo Y. Seto Y. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The E. coli, which was transformed with plasmid pRSET-C carrying a gene for either the WT or the mutant enzyme, was grown overnight with vigorous shaking at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This overnight culture was added to 20 liters of TB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking, followed by a further incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, following the addition of 0.05 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The harvestedE. coli was lysed by treatment with lysozyme in a hypotonic buffer containing 5 mm potassium phosphate at pH 8.0, followed by sonication for 10 min at 0 °C. The resulting cell homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from this centrifugation was dialyzed against the same buffer, and loaded on a high performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu, Model 8A) equipped with an anion-exchange column DEAE-FF (Amarsham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 5–50 mm potassium phosphate. The elute, which contained the enzyme, was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 10% glycerol, and chromatographed on a DE52 (Whatman) column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 10–20 mm potassium phosphate. The purity of the enzyme was monitored spectrophotometrically, and fractions showing aA 413/A 280 ratio of around 1.5 were pooled for use. The spectroscopic and enzymatic properties of the WT enzyme expressed in E. coli were identical to those of the native enzyme from F. oxysporum. The NO binding to the ferric iron of fungal NOR was determined using a flash-photolysis technique which has been described previously (6.Brucker E.A. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 1998; 30: 342-356Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow rapid scan measurements were carried out to kinetically and spectroscopically follow the formation of intermediate by reduction of the ferric-NO complexes with NADH using methods which have been described elsewhere (12.Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured at 20 °C using a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient of each enzyme was calculated by the pyridine hemochrome method (17.Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akeson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1284-1287Crossref Google Scholar). The catalytic activities of the enzymes were assayed by spectrophotometrically monitoring the rate of NADH consumption under the catalytic condition ([NADH] = 0.16 mm, [NO] = 1 mm, [Enzyme] = 10 nm) (12.Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADH was determined from the absorbance at 340 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1. The resonance Raman and IR spectra were measured using JASCO NR-1800 and JEOL JIR600 spectrometers, respectively; details of these procedures have been described previously (18.Obayashi E.

The single crystals in the ferric resting state were prepared by the method reported previously (14.Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and were converted to the corresponding NO adducts. All crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for both storage and data collection at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Analysis of diffraction images showed that the crystals of the recombinant enzymes were isomorphous to that of the fungal enzyme. High-resolution data were obtained at the synchrotron radiation source of the BL44B2 (RIKEN Beam Line 2) station in the SPring-8, Harima, Japan. All data sets were collected on R-AXIS IV imaging plates as a detector. Integrated intensities were obtained using the HKL DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (19.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Processdings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, England1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Statistics of the data collection are given in TableI. The atomic model was built using the program TURBO-FRODO (20.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar), and improved with SigmaA-weighted ‖2F o − F c‖ and ‖F o − Fc‖ maps (21.Read R.J. Acta Cryst. Sect.

Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The structures of the native fungal enzyme in the P212121 space group (PDB ID: 1ROM), without the coordinates of the ligand NO and water molecules, were used as an initial model for refinement of the structures of the WT and mutants. After the first round of rigid body, simulated annealing, and B-factor refinements, a ‖2F o −F c‖ map was calculated. A high electron density was found for the NO molecule. After manual rebuilding of the NO and water molecules, other rounds of refinement were done, in which positional, individual B-factors and bulk solvent correction of the protein model were included. Water molecules were placed at positions, where spherical densities were above 1.5ς in the ‖2F o − F c] map and above 3.0ς in the ‖2F o − F c‖ map, and where the stereochemically reasonable hydrogen bonds were allowed. Structural evaluations of the final models of the WT and the mutant enzymes using PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that 90.5% of the residues are in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandram plot, and no residues are in disallowed regions. Coordinates of the ferric-NO complexes of WT, S286V, and S286T mutants have been deposited at Brookhaven Data Bank with ID codes 1CL6, 1CMN, and 1CMJ, respectively.Table ICrystal parameters, data collection, and structure refinement of fungal NORsData SetWTS286VS286TResolution range (Å)100–1.7100–1.7100–1.7Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 54.53a = 54.67a = 54.69b = 81.71b = 81.85b = 81.13c = 85.55c = 85.89c = 85.79Reflections Measured/unique248,070/41,588258,529/41,933248,448/42,130Completeness (%) Overall/outer shell (1.76–1.70)97.4/89.797.8/90.497.8/93.0R merge (%)aR merge = ∑‖I i − 〈I〉‖/∑‖I i‖, whereI i is the intensity of an observation and 〈I〉 the mean value for that reflection and the summations are over all reflections.

Open table in a new tab The crystals of the Fe3+-NO form of fungal NOR were prepared by exposing a crystal of the ferric resting enzyme to NO gas under anaerobic condition. The color of the crystal changed from reddish-brown to red during the formation of the desirable complex (16.Shoun H. Sudo Y. Seto Y. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 2The formation of the NO complex in the crystal form was monitored by optical absorption spectral measurements at 100 K, using a customized microscopic spectrometer. After measuring the x-ray diffraction, the optical absorption spectrum of the crystal was also checked, confirming that x-rays had no effect on the iron oxidation state of the crystal. Immediately after complex formation, the crystal was frozen in liquid nitrogen for the x-ray diffraction measurements at cryogenic temperature. The binding of NO resulted in negligible change in the overall structure of fungal NOR (Fig. 1) (14.Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The structure of the active site in the Fe3+-NO form of fungal NOR is shown in Fig. 2. The Fe-NO bond length is 1.63 Å, and the Fe-N-O angle is 161° (a slightly bent configuration), in apparent agreement with the EXAFS results which we previously reported (18.Obayashi E. Tsukamoto K. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Nomura M. Iizuka T. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The nitrogen atom of the iron-bound NO is positioned off the heme normal axis (a slightly tilt configuration) toward the porphyrin β-meso direction, as illustrated in Fig. 2, where the angle between the heme normal axis and the Fe-N line is 9°. Temperature factors of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms are sufficiently low (12 and 13 Å2, respectively), indicating that the bound NO is highly ordered in this complex. This observation also indicates that the crystal sustained no x-ray radiation damage during the diffraction measurement. 3Rich et al. (26.Rich A.M. Armstrong R.S. Ellis P.J. Lay P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10827-10836Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) recently reported EXAFS of the ferric- and ferrous-NO complexes of Mb, showing that the Fe-N-O angle is 180° for ferric-NO Mb, and 155° for ferrous-NO Mb. In their paper (18.Obayashi E. Tsukamoto K. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Nomura M. Iizuka T. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), they were critical of our EXAFS results of fungal NOR, in which the Fe-N-O angle in the ferric-NO complex was poorly determined. They suggested that the ferric-NO form might be mixed with the ferrous NO form which could have been generated in the reduction by the x-ray during the EXAFS measurements. Our present crystallographic and spectroscopic results show unequivocally that the Fe-N-O angle of the ferric-NO complex of fungal NOR is 161°. The Fe-S(Cys352) bond length is 2.31 Å. The iron is displaced only 0.03 Å from the heme plane toward the direction of the bound NO, but remains basically in the in-plane configuration.Figure 2Stereo view of the heme iron-NO coordination structure of the WT fungal NOR in the ferric NO state.

Open table in a new tab The unique NO binding to the ferric iron in fungal NOR, i.e.the slightly bent and tilted coordination, can be explained in terms of the trans electronic effect from the Cys thiolate (S−) ligand rather than steric influence on the Fe-NO moiety. The environment of the iron-coordinated NO is not sterically crowded, as shown in Fig. 2. The electron-rich axial ligand possibly retards electron donation from the bound NO to the iron, but facilitates the back-donation from the iron to the bound NO. As a consequence, the electron density on the iron-bound NO in the fungal NOR is relatively high and the electronic state can be formally described as “Fe3+-NO.” As a result, its N-O stretching was observed at 1851 cm−1 (neutral NO) (18.Obayashi E. Tsukamoto K. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Nomura M. Iizuka T. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). (Neutral NO shows an the N-O stretching at 1840 cm−1, while nitrosonium (NO+) and nitroxyl anion (NO−) at 2300 and 1290 cm−1, respectively (31.Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar).) As the case of fungal NOR, the iron-bound NO in ferric cytochrome c peroxidase is bent with an Fe-N-O angle of 125–135° (8.Edwards S.L. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2588-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Edwards S.L. Kraut J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), since its proximal ligand has an imidazolate character, which results from the strong hydrogen bond with the Asp235 carboxylate. These electronic configurations are in sharp contrast to those of the ferric-NO forms of myoglobin (Mb) and hemoglobin (Hb), and of the model compounds (linear NO coordination (8.Edwards S.L. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2588-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Obayashi E. Tsukamoto K. Adachi S. Takahashi S. Nomura M. Iizuka T. Shoun H. Shiro Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7807-7816Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). In these cases, the electron donation from the bound NO to the ferric iron through the ς-orbital is facilitated, and NO acts as an electron donor. In the case of their ferrous-NO complexes, NO is an electron acceptor, and consequently the electron back-donation from the iron to the NO ligand through a π-orbital is favorable, resulting in a highly bent NO coordination. Indeed, the N-O stretching is located at 1925 cm−1 (NOδ+) and 1612 cm−1 (NOδ-) for the ferric and ferrous NO complexes of other hemoproteins (32.Maxwell J.C. Caughey W.S.

In vitroselection has been used to generate RNA ligands (aptamers) specific for the catalytic ricin A-chain (RTA). The anti-RTA aptamers bear no resemblance to the normal RTA substrate, the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL), and were not depurinated by RTA. An initial 80-nucleotide RNA ligand was minimized to a 31-nucleotide aptamer that contained all sequences and structures necessary for interacting with RTA. This minimal RNA formed high affinity complexes with RTA (K d = 7.3 nm) which could compete directly with the SRL for binding to RTA. The aptamer inhibited RTA depurination of the SRL and could partially protect translation from RTA inhibition. The IC50of the aptamer for RTA in an in vitro translation assay is 100 nm, roughly 3 orders of magnitude lower than a small molecule inhibitor of ricin, pteroic acid, and 2 orders of magnitude lower than the best known RNA inhibitor.

Class I ribosome-inactivating proteins have a catalytic A-chain that recognizes and depurinates a universally conserved adenosine found in a GAGA tetraloop in the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL)1 of eukaryotic 23–28 S rRNA (1.Endo Y.

Class II ribosome-inactivating proteins have an additional lectin B-chain that is required for cell surface attachment and subsequent endocytosis of the toxin domain (3.Lord J.M. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 15-22PubMed Google Scholar). Ricin, from the castor bean plant Ricinus communis, is a class II ribosome-inactivating protein that has the potential of being used as a weapon in a biological attack (4.Zilinskas R.A.

Once inside a cell, ricin is extremely toxic; one resident molecule is sufficient to kill the cell, and the enzyme has been reported to inactivate 1777 ribosomes min−1 (2.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aerosolized ricin causes severe respiratory distress and is lethal when injected intravenously at a level of only 3–5 μg/kg (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Ricin has so far proved to be a relatively inefficient biological weapon but is prepared easily even by Third World nations and terrorist groups. Therefore, facile detection of the toxin and the development of antidotes remain priorities (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 7.Christopher G. Cieslak T. Pavlin J. Eitzen E.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 336-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aptamers can be engineered readily to function as either therapeutics or sensors. For instance, RNA aptamers that bind to human immunodeficiency virus type I Rev also inhibit viral replication (10.Symensma T.L. Giver L. Zapp M. Takle G.B. Ellington A.D. J Virol. 1996; 70: 179-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, RNA aptamers that bind to the β2 integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 specifically inhibit a signal transduction pathway when expressed in vivo (11.Blind M. Kolanus W. Famulok M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3606-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Consequently, aptamers that recognize and potentially inhibit ricin might be useful prophylactic or therapeutic agents or could be adapted to function as biosensor elements for the detection of aerosolized ricin or areas contaminated by the toxin. The random sequence pool (N30) has been described previously (9.Conrad R.C. Giver L. Tian Y. Ellington A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 336-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bell S.D. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Ellington A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14309-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following chemical synthesis, the single-stranded DNA pool was purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and eluted by diffusion. The pool was then amplified via the polymerase chain reaction using primers 41.30 (5′-GATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAATGGATCCACATCTACG-3′) and 24.30 (5′-AAGCTTCGTCAAGTCTGCAGTGAA-3′). The selected aptamer 80RA was resynthesized as a doped sequence pool (D30). The sequence of the D30 pool was 5′-GGGAATGGATCCACATCTACGAATTCAGGGGACGTAGCAATGACTGAGATGCTGGGTTCACTGCACTTGACGAAGC- TT-3′, where italicized residues indicate positions that were doped at 85% wild type and 5% of each non-wild type nucleotide. All other residues were kept constant. The 5′-primer used for amplification was three nucleotides shorter from the 3′-end than 41.30, and the 3′-primer was 24.30. A small version of the ribosomal SRL binds the catalytic ricin A-chain (RTA) and has been used previously as a substrate in depurination assays (13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The sequence of the 34-nucleotide SRL (34SRL) was 5′-GGAAUCCUGCUCAGUACGAGAGGAACCGCAGGUU-3′; a double-stranded DNA template containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was used to transcribe 34SRL. The RNA pool (2.2 × 1014 molecules) was transcribed from the amplified DNA template (1.1 × 1014 molecules) using an Ampliscribe T7 in vitro transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). After purification on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the RNA pellet was dissolved in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and 5 mm MgCl2, then heated to 65 °C for 3 min and allowed to cool to room temperature over 10 min. To exclude filter-binding RNA sequences from the pool, the RNA was passed over a 0.45-μm HAWP filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and washed with an equal volume of buffer. RTA was added to the binding reaction (200 μl final volume) in varying amounts throughout the course of the selection (Table I). Binding reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, the solution was vacuum-filtered over a HAWP filter at 5 p.s.i. and washed twice with 0.5 ml of the selection buffer. RNA retained on the filter was eluted twice with 0.2 ml of 7 m urea, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.0) and 3 mm EDTA for 3 min at 100 °C, and the eluted RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. For the eighth and ninth rounds, the eluted RNA pool was passed over a HAWP filter after selection and precipitation to remove filter-binding species. Selected RNAs were reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the 3′-primer (24.30). The cDNA products were polymerase chain reaction amplified after the addition of 5′-primer (41.30) and DisplayTaq (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD). The polymerase chain reaction products were transcribed and gel purified to begin the next round of selection.Table ISummary of in vitro selection experimentsSelection and roundInput [RNA]Input [RTA][RNA]:[RTA]% Bound to RTA% Bound to filternmnmN3012,5005005 :1 22,5005005 :1 380026.730 :1 480026.730 :11.060.73 580026.730 :1 680026.730 :1 780026.730 :119.927.88 88008001 :1 98008001 :151.092.41D3011,0002005 :15.622.13 21,0002005 :115.522.86 32,00020010 :127.652.52 42,00020010 :128.721.38 Open table in a new tab After round 9, the pool was cloned (Topo TA cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced using standard dideoxy methods. The dominant clone (80RA) and its derivatives (31RA) were characterized using a nitrocellulose filtration assay similar to that used for selection. The doped sequence selection was carried out using procedures identical to those used in the initial selection. A total of 1.84 × 1013 DNA molecules were used for transcription, and a total of 1.2 × 1014 RNA molecules were introduced at the first round of selection. Based on the rate of mutagenesis and the size of the pool, this should have represented all possible single to hextuple mutations. Table I again summarizes selection conditions. 31RA and 34SRL were body labeled in a transcription reaction containing [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After labeling, products were gel purified and precipitated. In competition assays, the minimal aptamer, 31RA and 34SRL RNAs were incubated at equimolar amounts (0.5 μm) in the presence of limiting RTA (0.1 μm) in the selection buffer. The binding reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, and 80% of the volume was filtered over nitrocellulose and washed twice with 300 μl of selection buffer. Retained RNA molecules were eluted and precipitated. The remaining 20% of the reaction mixture was also precipitated. Both filtered and unfiltered samples were dissolved in 5 μl of stop dye (7m urea, 1 × TBE, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and analyzed on a denaturing 12% acrylamide gel. The amount of radioactivity in individual bands was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative binding activity was calculated based on the formula: ((counts filtered, 31RA/counts unfiltered, 31RA))/((counts filtered, 34SRL)/(counts unfiltered, 34SRL)). This formula has been used previously to assess the relative binding activities of RNA ligands (14.Hirao I. Spingola M. Peabody D. Ellington A.D. Mol. Divers. 1998; 4: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15.Giver L. Bartel D. Zapp M. Pawul A. Green M. Ellington A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5509-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Assuming that the binding reaction is at equilibrium (a likely assumption, given the length of the binding reaction), the binding ratio represents a ratio of the dissociation constants of individual RNA-protein complexes. After rounds 4, 7, and 9 of the initial selection, and at every round of the doped selection, the RNA pool was body labeled in a transcription reaction using [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Products were gel purified and precipitated. The labeled RNA (0.5 μm final concentration) was incubated with RTA (0.5 μm final concentration) in 0.1 ml of selection buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was filtered and washed three times with selection buffer. The filter was exposed to a PhosphorImager plate, and the amount of retained radioactivity was determined. The fraction of the pool or clone that bound RTA was calculated by comparing the counts retained on the filter with the total number of counts in the original RNA. For the determination of dissociation constants, 1.5 pmol of RNA was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (0.03 mCi, 6000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) after 5′-dephosphorylation. Labeled RNA was purified by two successive precipitations using ammonium acetate. The labeled RNA (2 nm final concentration) was incubated with increasing concentrations of RTA (1.2–450 nm) in 50 μl of the selection buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was filtered on a vacuum manifold (Schleicher & Schuell) equipped with a piece of pure nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) over a piece of Hybond (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (16.Conrad R.C. Baskerville S. Ellington A.D. Mol. Divers. 1995; 1: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17.Weeks K.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7728-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the nitrocellulose and nylon filter was quantitated, and the dissociation constant (K d) for aptamer-RTA complexes was determined using a curve-fitting algorithm on the program Kaleidagraph (Adelbeck Software, Reading, PA). The assay was performed as described previously (13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). RNA (2 μm) was denatured at 65 °C in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mmMgCl2 and allowed to cool to room temperature for 10 min. Dithiothreitol and EDTA were added to a 1 mm final concentration (20 μl final volume), and the reaction mixtures were incubated with varying concentrations of RTA for 60 min at 30 °C. After a phenol/CHCl3 extraction and ethanol precipitation, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of a buffered aniline solution and incubated for 15 min on ice. After a second precipitation, RNA molecules were 5′-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (0.03 mCi, 6000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals) in a 5-μl reaction volume. The RNA was precipitated and resuspended in loading dye, and products were analyzed on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed, and counts were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Recombinant RTA was prepared as described previously (18.Ready M.P. Kim Y. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A standard assay for RTA function is to observe the degradation of translation ability by isolated Artemia salinas ribosomes (19.Day P.J. Ernst S.R. Frankel A.E. Monzingo A.F. Pascal J.M. Molina-Svinth M.C. Robertus J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11098-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When RTA (2 nm) was added to an A. salinas in vitrotranslation system, the synthesis of 14C-labeled polyphenylalanine was reduced by 80%. Using this basal assay as our standard, different concentrations of 31RA were then assayed for their ability to inhibit RTA degradation of translation ability. Prior to use, solutions containing 31RA were heated at 65 °C for 3 min and allowed to cool at 25 °C for 10 min. Recombinant RTA was used as a selection target; the recombinant protein has been shown to possess full activity toward rat liver ribosomes as well as toward small variants of the SRL of 28 S rRNA (13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a). In vitroselection experiments were initiated with an RNA pool (N30) that contained 30 randomized positions. This pool has been utilized successfully in the past to generate aptamers against both small molecules and proteins (8.Famulok M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In each round of selection, the protein was mixed with the RNA pool, and bound species were separated from unbound by passing the mixture over a modified cellulose filter. After seven rounds of selection, modest protein-dependent binding activity was observed (Table I). To rid the pool of matrix-binding sequences the stringency of the selection was increased by increasing the ratio of input RNA to protein. After an additional two rounds of selection the protein-dependent binding ability of the pool had reached 51% in our standard assay, whereas matrix binding was only 2.5%. After round 9 of the selection, 24 individual aptamers were cloned and sequenced. Although the initial pool had contained approximately 2.2 × 1014 different sequences, the selected pool had been winnowed to a single consensus sequence. The program MulFold was used to model the secondary structure of the aptamer (RA80). The conformer predicted to be most stable contained a long paired stem topped by a large loop and is shown in Fig. 1 b. To determine which sequences in the limit aptamer contributed to recognition of RTA, a doped sequence population was prepared based on the apparent secondary structure of the aptamer. Each position in the original random sequence region and three positions from the 5′-constant region that contributed to the hypothesized stem structure contained 85% wild type residues and 5% of each non-wild type residue (e.g. 85% G, 5% A, 5% T, 5% C at position 21). This level of mutagenesis should have been sufficient to identify sequences and structures required for RTA binding function (21.Green R. Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 406-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) because the population would have contained all possible single to hextuple sequence substitutions. The constant regions and amplification primers were as before, except that the 5′-primer used for amplification was 3 residues shorter than previously. After four cycles of selection and amplification the population could bind as well as the parental aptamer to RTA. Early in the selection the population was sequenced to ensure that numerous mutants were present and were competing for RTA (Fig.2 a). In contrast, many of the positions that contained mutations in the first round of selection had completely returned to their wild type progenitors by the third round of selection (Fig. 2 b). Overall, the distribution of mutations within the variants suggests that mutations in the stem portion of the doped region were tolerated, whereas the loop region was much more highly conserved. These results were expected to some extent because the loop region was derived completely from the random sequence region, whereas the stem was established in part by pairing between the random sequence region and the 5′-constant region. Surprisingly, neither the limit aptamer nor its predicted secondary structure showed any gross similarity to 28 S rRNA. To determine if more subtle similarities existed, we compared the aptamer with the SRL of 28 S rRNA. The conformation of the SRL has been studied extensively (22.Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23.Szewczak A.A. Moore P.B. Chang Y.L. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9581-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 24.Correll C.C. Munishkin A. Chan Y.L. Ren Z. Wool I.G. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13436-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and both NMR and crystallography studies have indicated that it is essentially a continuous helix interrupted by a G-bulge and topped by a GAGA tetraloop. The sequence of the tetraloop has been shown to be critical for toxin recognition and binding (25.Chen X.Y. Link T.M. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11605-11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The original aptamer indeed contained a GAGA motif, but it is ensconced within a stable stem structure (Fig. 1 b). However, an alternative, less stable conformer was predicted to contain a putative GAGA recognition site in a loop (Fig. 3). To ascertain whether the original (RA80.1) or alternative (RA80.2) conformer was the active ricin-binding species, several deletion variants were prepared. The deletion variants that were predicted to favor the original conformer were active; those that were predicted to favor the alternative conformer were inactive. The selection of a completely non-native, anti-RTA aptamer is not necessarily unusual; many aptamers bear little or no resemblance to corresponding wild type RNA ligands (26.Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 27.Giver L. Bartel D.P. Zapp M.L. Green M.R. Ellington A.D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Multiple mutations occurred in the stem region after mutagenesis and reselection, indicating that many of the residues in the stem might not contribute to RTA binding. To test whether the loop was primarily responsible for interactions with RTA, we prepared a short, 31-mer RNA that contained most of the residues that were conserved on reselection (31RA, Fig. 3). The secondary structure of the minimal aptamer was stabilized by the inclusion of several designed G:C base pairings. The minimal aptamer was fully competent to bind RTA. The fact that a functional, quadruple mutant (the two designed G:C pairs) could be designed based on the predicted aptamer secondary structure is further evidence in favor of our nascent structural model. Interestingly, the minimal aptamer lacked the GAGA sequence but did contain a GGGG sequence in its loop. It is possible that this altered run of purines encourages tight interactions with RTA while avoiding the presentation of an adenosine substrate. The interaction between anti-RTA aptamers and RTA was assessed as a function of protein concentration using a filter binding assay similar to that used for selection. The RTA·RA80.1 complex was found to have aK d of 240 nm (data not shown), whereas the RTA·31RA complex was found to have a K d of 7.4 nm (Fig. 4). Because the binding ability of the aptamer actually improved after truncation it can again be argued that sequences in the loop region are primarily responsible for RTA recognition. Indeed, one of the reasons that the binding ability may have improved was that the shorter structure could no longer fold into alternate conformations (such as RA80.2). Although the affinity of the anti-RTA aptamer for RTA is reminiscent of the affinities of other anti-protein aptamers for their targets (28.Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), it is actually quite extraordinary considering that the SRL itself has a K m of 13.55 μm in a depurination assay (13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Even a small, SRL-like RNA containing a predesigned transition-state analog has been reported to inhibit RTA activity with a K i of only 0.73 μm (29.Chen X.-Y. Link T.M. Schramm V.L.U. Bronx N.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3067-3068Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular modeling studies have identified pteroic acid as an inhibitor of RTA activity, but the K i for pteroic acid is around 0.6 mm (30.Robertus J.D. Yan X. Ernst S. Monzingo A. Worley S. Day P. Hollis T. Svinth M. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31.Yan X. Hollis T. Svinth M. Day P. Monzingo A.F. Milne G.W. Robertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The anti-RTA aptamer therefore binds at least 3 orders of magnitude better than the best known small molecule inhibitor of ricin, and 2 orders of magnitude better than a designed RNA analog. The high affinity of the aptamer relative to other ligands exemplifies the dramatic possibilities afforded by in vitroselection. To prove that anti-RTA aptamers bound to the active site of RTA, a competition assay was employed. Briefly, 31RA and 34SRL were incubated with a limiting amount of RTA. A portion of the reaction was filtered, and bound RNAs were then separated by gel electrophoresis. As Fig. 5 shows, 31RA completely displaced the 34SRL substrate from RTA. This competition assay can also be used to quantitate the relative degree of binding (15.Giver L. Bartel D. Zapp M. Pawul A. Green M. Ellington A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5509-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the samples before filtration were compared with the specific activities after filtration. Within the limits of the assay, 31RA binds RTA at least 9-fold better than 34SRL. Although 31RA does not contain a canonical GAGA recognition sequence, it might still be depurinated (for example, at A32, A36, or even A39). To assess this possibility, we employed a depurination assay in which the accumulation of radiolabeled cleavage fragments is monitored (13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When 31RA was incubated with RTA and the same depurination assay used for the SRL was carried out, no RTA-specific radiolabeled cleavage products were observed (data not shown). In contrast, when the SRL was incubated with RTA, a characteristic depurination and cleavage product was observed (Fig. 6). When 31RA and the SRL were incubated together (5:1 31RA·SRL), the cleavage of SRL was inhibited, as would be expected if the two RNAs were binding to the same site on the enzyme. No inhibition of depurination was observed with a nonspecific RNA molecule, tRNA. Because of the many steps associated with the depurination assay, it was not feasible to attempt a shorter time course, nor could a K i value for the aptamer be derived. Overall, though, the data strongly support the nascent hypothesis originally suggested by the sequence and structure of 31RA: the aptamer binds to RTA, competes with the SRL, but is not itself a substrate for RTA. RTA activity can also be measured by observing the disruption of in vitroprotein synthesis by A. salina ribosomes. This sensitive method has been used previously to assess the activity of other RTA inhibitors (19.Day P.J. Ernst S.R. Frankel A.E. Monzingo A.F. Pascal J.M. Molina-Svinth M.C. Robertus J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11098-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The inhibition of RTA activity was assayed as a function of 31RA concentration, and Fig.7 shows that as the aptamer saturates RTA, the enzyme loses about 60% of its activity. The amount of 31RA that gives 50% of this maximal RTA inhibition (IC50) was approximately 100 nm. It may be that the bound aptamer partially occludes the RTA active site, retarding activity about 60%; partial active site occlusion has been observed previously in aptamers that bind to protein tyrosine phosphatases (12.Bell S.D. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Ellington A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14309-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the absence of RTA, the aptamer had no toxic effect on ribosomes. A non-cognate, anti-basic fibroblast growth factor aptamer, PS8 (32.Jhaveri S. Olwin B. Ellington A.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. PS8 was not an inhibitor of RTA function and did not have an effect on Artemia ribosomes (data not shown). The minimal aptamer may have protected translation more effectively than it protected the SRL from depurination because it was in greater excess over RTA in the translation assays. In addition, RTA acted on ribosomes for only 5 min in the in vitro translation assay, whereas it acted for 60 min on the isolated SRL. Nonetheless, the ability of the aptamer to inhibit the toxic effects of RTA at relatively low concentrations suggests that it may have promise as a scaffold for the development of gene or more conventional therapies for ricin exposure. For example, aptamers or their derivatives could be conjugated to pteroic acid to produce a highly efficient chimeric inhibitor in which the aptamer binds tightly and the pteroic acid completely inactivates RTA. Similar approaches in which aptamers were conjugated to peptides or transition state analogs yielded inhibitors with very high affinities for human neutrophil elastase (33.Good P.D. Krikos A.J. Li S.X. Bertrand E. Lee N.S. Giver L. Ellington A. Zaia J.A. Rossi J.J. Engelke D.R. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 34.Symensma T.L. Baskerville S. Yan A. Ellington A.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aptamers have been shown previously to inhibit a variety of protein targets (35.Osborne S.E. Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 5-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Famulok M. Jenne A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In general, though, there was little or no possibility that previous aptamers could be acted on by their targets. To our knowledge, RTA is the first selection target that could catalyze the cleavage of individual species in a RNA pool. It has been shown previously that short stems capped by GAGA tetraloops serve as substrates for RTA (25.Chen X.Y. Link T.M. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11605-11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Given these minimal requirements for interaction with RTA it is still somewhat surprising that the most bountiful anti-RTA aptamers were not also substrates. Minimal binding motifs frequently overrun in vitro selection experiments, a phenomenon that has been termed the “tyranny of small motifs” (37.Jhaveri S. Hirao I. Bell S. Uphoff K. Ellington A.D. Moos W. Ellington A. Kay B. Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity. 1. ESCOM Science Publishers, Leiden, The Netherlands1997: 169-191Google Scholar). However, any depurinated anti-RTA aptamers would have been copied inefficiently and would not have contained an adenosine in future generations, likely obviating the tyranny in these experiments. In addition, the selection of a novel sequence and structure is somewhat less startling when it is realized that the natural target of RTA is the ribosome. The SRL is surrounded by other RNA structures in the ribosome (38.Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and there are multiple amino acid residues in or adjacent to the RTA active site which could interact with these RNA structures (39.Mlsna D. Monzingo A.F. Katzin B.J. Ernst S. Robertus J.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Differences between rRNA interactions with RTA and SRL interactions with RTA are highlighted further by the fact that rRNA is depurinated 77,000-fold faster than the SRL (2.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because the relatively short RNA molecules present in the N30 pools lack the structural context of rRNA, very different sequences may be required to bind tightly to RTA. The anti-RTA aptamer contrived to bind to the active site of the enzyme, but in a way that eluded depurination. RNA molecules that inhibit a RNA glycosidase are reminiscent of proteins that inhibit proteases (40.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). For example, even though bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor are cleaved by trypsin, the inhibitor remains bound to the active site, allowing resynthesis. In addition, new evidence suggests that these inhibitors may bind in a “nonproductive” mode that is substantially different than the way in which substrates are bound and which preferentially stabilizes the ground state of the reaction (41.Coombs G.S. Rao M.S. Olson A.J. Dawson P.E. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24074-24079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, structural studies of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complexed with a thrombin mutant reveal that surface loops of the protease are rearranged, leading to inactivation (42.van de Locht A. Bode W. Huber R. Le Bonniec B.F. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. Stubbs M.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using this co-crystal structure as a model, mutagenesis studies have shown that a lack of productive electrostatic contacts may also contribute to the ability of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 to inhibit thrombin (43.Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, the “unnatural” interaction of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with a mutant thrombin may be especially germane to understanding 31RA function, in that it is possible that the unnatural aptamer similarly induces unproductive structural transitions in RTA. Efforts are now under way to determine the precise binding mode of the aptamer-RTA complex by x-ray diffraction analysis."

However, it is not known whether Ox-LDL can regulate proteoglycan expression and thus affect arterial wall lipoprotein retention. This study evaluated whether Ox-LDL, as compared with native LDL, regulates proteoglycan expression by monkey arterial smooth muscle cells in vitroand whether proteoglycans synthesized in the presence of Ox-LDL exhibit altered lipoprotein binding properties. Ox-LDL stimulated glycosaminoglycan synthesis, as measured by35SO4 incorporation, by 30–50% over that of native LDL. The effect was maximal after 72 h of exposure to 5 μg/ml of Ox-LDL. The molecular sizes of versican, biglycan, and decorin increased in response to Ox-LDL, as indicated by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These effects could be mimicked by the lipid extract of Ox-LDL. These size increases were largely due to chain elongation and not to alterations in the ratio of 35SO4 to [3H]glucosamine incorporation. Affinity chromatography indicated that Ox-LDL stimulated the synthesis of proteoglycans with high affinity for native LDL. Ox-LDL also specifically stimulated mRNA expression for biglycan (but not versican or decorin), which was correlated with increased expression of secreted biglycan. Thus, Ox-LDL may influence lipoprotein retention by regulating synthesis of biglycan and also by altering glycosaminoglycan synthesis of vascular proteoglycans so as to enhance lipoprotein binding properties.

According to the response-to-retention hypothesis of atherogenesis, two processes thought to be central to the development of atherosclerosis are the retention of lipoproteins by proteoglycans in the arterial wall and the subsequent modification of these retained lipoproteins by processes such as oxidation (8.Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether and how oxidative processes might influence lipoprotein retention within the arterial wall. Therefore, this study examined whether lipoprotein oxidation could influence proteoglycan synthesis by arterial smooth muscle cells in culture and whether these proteoglycans exhibited altered lipoprotein binding characteristics. Vascular proteoglycans are a heterogeneous group of molecules that have the common structure of a core protein, to which glycosaminoglycan chains are covalently attached (9.Hascall V.C. Hascall G.K. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1981: 39-63Crossref Google Scholar). Usually, one type of glycosaminoglycan is associated with a single core protein, giving rise to proteoglycans within the arterial wall extracellular matrix that contain chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (10.Wight T.N. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 175-202Google Scholar). The major types of vascular proteoglycans identified in blood vessels are the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican, the small dermatan sulfate proteoglycans decorin and biglycan, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, and the keratan sulfate proteoglycan lumican (10.Wight T.N. Comper W.D. Extracellular Matrix. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 175-202Google Scholar). Although proteoglycans are only a minor component of the normal arterial wall, their accumulation in intimal lesions is characteristic of all phases of atherogenesis (11.Evanko S.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Gold L.I. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 533-546PubMed Google Scholar, 12.O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A.

As examples, versican is prominent in the diffuse intimal thickening of early atherosclerosis, whereas biglycan and decorin are localized to the fibrous cap of more advanced atherosclerotic lesions (13.Gutierrez P.

These structural changes include increases in glycosaminoglycan chain length (14.Cardoso L. Maurao P.A.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increases in dermatan sulfate content (15.Cherchi G.M. Coinu R. Demuro P. Formato M. Sanna G. Tidore M. Tira M.E. DeLuca G. Matrix. 1998; 10: 362-372Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), both of which were found to be positively correlated with increased lipoprotein binding by LDL affinity chromatography (14.Cardoso L. Maurao P.A.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 115-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Cherchi G.M. Coinu R. Demuro P. Formato M. Sanna G. Tidore M. Tira M.E. DeLuca G. Matrix. 1998; 10: 362-372Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another structural characteristic of glycosaminoglycan chains that has been associated with increased lipoprotein binding is an increased ratio of chondroitin 6-sulfate to chondroitin 4-sulfate (5.Camejo G. Camejo E.H. Olsson U. Bondjers G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 385-391Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19.Mourao P.A. Pillai S. Di Ferrante N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 674: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount and structure of extracellular matrix proteoglycans is altered in atherosclerosis in ways that potentially affect their interactions with lipoproteins within the arterial wall. Although there is considerable information regarding the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis by cytokines (20.Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol.

Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are little data as to whether lipoproteins affect proteoglycan synthesis. Hyperlipidemia and high concentrations of LDL, but not high density lipoproteins (23.Wosu L. McCormick S. Kalant N. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), have been shown to increase total glycosaminoglycan secretion by smooth muscle cells in culture (23.Wosu L. McCormick S. Kalant N. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 24.Pietila K.

However, changes in specific proteoglycan composition or structure were not characterized in those studies. Oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) has been shown to modulate a variety of functions in vascular wall cells in ways that can contribute to all stages of atherosclerosis development (26.Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 27.Witztum J.L. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1994; 1: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28.Chait A. Heinecke J.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the effects of Ox-LDL on the regulation of proteoglycan synthesis have not been investigated to date, Ox-LDL has been shown to enhance the expression of other extracellular matrix molecules, including fibronectin (29.Roh D.D. Kamanna V.S. Kirschenbaum M.A. Am. J. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30.Ding G. Van Goor H. Ricardo S.D. Orlowski J.M. Diamond J.R. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), laminin (29.Roh D.D. Kamanna V.S. Kirschenbaum M.A. Am. J. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and collagen (31.Jimi S. Saku L. Uesugi N. Sakata N. Takebayashi S. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 116: 15-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that lipoprotein oxidation may play an important role in the extracellular matrix remodelling that occurs during atherogenesis. Therefore, in this study, the role of Ox-LDL as a potential regulatory molecule of proteoglycan synthesis in arterial smooth muscle cells was examined. Ox-LDL was found (i) to enhance total proteoglycan synthesis and to preferentially stimulate synthesis of the core protein for biglycan, but (ii) to stimulate glycosaminoglycan chain elongation on versican, biglycan and decorin, all of which (iii) display stronger binding to an LDL affinity column than proteoglycans synthesized under the influence of native LDL (N-LDL). Thus, lipoprotein oxidation may play a role in the pathobiology of atherosclerosis by regulating the synthesis of proteoglycans with enhanced lipoprotein binding properties. Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) cultures were isolated from monkey (Macaca nemestrina) thoracic aorta by the explant method (gift from Russell Ross) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids, supplemented with penicillin (105units/liter), streptomycin (105 μg/liter), and 5% calf serum, as described previously (21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between the 4th and 13th passage were plated on 35-mm dishes (6 × 104cells/dish) or 100-mm dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish). Upon reaching confluence, cells were growth-arrested in fresh medium containing 0.1% calf serum for 48 h. Quiescent cells were incubated for up to 72 h with 5–25 μg of N-LDL or Ox-LDL/ml, or phosphate-buffered saline (control) in fresh medium containing 0.1% calf serum (see figure legends for specific details). Cells were metabolically labeled with 35SO4 (50 μCi/ml) for 6 h following the treatment period, in fresh medium containing 0.1% calf serum with no lipoproteins. Alternatively, cells were metabolically labeled with 35SO4 (50 μCi/ml) for the last 12 or 24 h of the treatment period. In some experiments, cells were double-labeled with35SO4 (50 μCi/ml) and [3H]glucosamine (5 μCi/ml) for the last 12 h of the treatment period. LDL were isolated from plasma of normal human volunteers as described previously (32.Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In brief, LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was separated from normal human plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation in a Beckman VTi 50 vertical rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) (33.Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation (32.Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Ox-LDL was generated by incubation of N-LDL (300 μg/ml) in the presence of 5 μm copper sulfate for 18 h at 37 °C in air (34.Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in the formation of extensively oxidized LDL, as indicated by measurements of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (35.Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10822) Google Scholar), lipid peroxides, conjugated dienes, free amino groups by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid reactivity (36.Chait A. Henze K. Mazzone T. Jensen M. Hammond W. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels in barbital buffer at pH 8.6. N-LDL and Ox-LDL were extracted with chloroform and methanol according the method of Folch (37.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were dried down under N2 and then resolubilized in ethanol for treatment of cells. Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane and isopropanol for determination of cholesteryl ester and unesterified cholesterol, as described (38.Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) Media from metabolically labeled SMC cultures were harvested with the protease inhibitors benzamidine HCl, 6-aminocaproic acid, and phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride. Following thorough washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cell layer was solubilized with 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.25 m NaCl) and harvested with protease inhibitors. The medium and cell layer were applied to separate DEAE-Sephacel mini-columns equilibrated in 8 m urea buffer, washed in 8m urea buffer, and eluted with 8 m urea buffer containing 3 m NaCl. This ion exchange chromatography step served to remove free radiolabel and to concentrate proteoglycan samples. Radiolabeled proteoglycans then were applied to a preparative Sepharose CL-2B column (0.7 × 110 cm) equilibrated in 8m urea buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The radiolabeled proteoglycans eluting at a mean hydrodynamic size of K av ≤ 0.3 were pooled for the versican peak (Peak 1) (21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoglycans eluting at 0.55 ≤ K av ≤ 0.8 were pooled for the combined biglycan and decorin peak (Peak 2) (22.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Versican, biglycan, and decorin then were reconcentrated over DEAE-Sephacel mini-columns. The incorporation of 35SO4 into proteoglycans was measured by cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) precipitation. Aliquots (3 × 50 μl) of the 35SO4-labeled medium were spotted on filter paper and washed five times for 1 h in 1% CPC with 0.05m NaCl (20.Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol.

The amount of precipitate on the dried filter paper was determined by liquid scintillation counting. In some experiments, CPC precipitations were performed with and without the addition of carrier chondroitin sulfate to determine the recovery efficiency of radioactivity in the precipitate. The use of carrier chondroitin sulfate did not improve the recovery of radioactivity (data not shown). 35SO4-Labeled proteoglycans secreted into the medium were characterized by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions according to the procedure of Laemmli (40.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) on 4–12% gradient slab gels with a 3.5% stacking gel. Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of the35SO4-labeled proteoglycans were removed by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (0.03 U/ml) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in 0.3 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.6 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 18 mm sodium acetate with protease inhibitors for 4 h at 37 °C (21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For estimation of apparent relative masses, prestained high molecular weight standards (Novex, San Diego, CA) were run in separate lanes. Gels were dried, treated with Enlightning enhancer (NEN Life Science Products) and visualized by fluorography after exposure to Kodak XAR-2 film at −70 °C. Hydrodynamic size of35SO4-labeled proteoglycans was analyzed on an analytical Sepharose CL-2B molecular sieve column (0.7 × 110 cm) equilibrated in 8 m urea buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 (22.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 50,000 dpm of free 35SO4radiolabel were added to each sample just prior to application on the column. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The elution position of the free35SO4 was used as a marker for the total volume (V t). The void volume (V o) of the column was determined separately from the elution position of 3H-labeled DNA. Glycosaminoglycan chains were released from proteoglycans by reductive β-elimination with 1m sodium borohydride in 50 mm NaOH for 4 h at 45 °C (21.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by neutralizing the sample with glacial acetic acid. Approximately 50,000 dpm of free35SO4 radiolabel were added to each sample, and the liberated glycosaminoglycan chains then were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column (0.7 × 65 cm) in 0.2 m Tris, pH 7.0, with 0.2 m NaCl for analysis of chain length by size exclusion chromatography (22.Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Kinsella M.G. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elution position of the free35SO4 was used as a marker forV t. The void volume (V o) of the column was determined separately from the elution position of3H-labeled DNA. Total cellular RNA was isolated by lysis of cells in situ in guanidinium isothiocyanate, homogenized, and purified using guinidinium-acid-phenol (41.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). 15-μg aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed overnight in a denaturing 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and 1% MOPS running buffer. Agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide to visualize 28 S and 18 S RNA bands prior to transfer of RNA to nylon membranes with 10× standard saline citrate. Filters were prehybridized in a solution containing 0.5m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, with 1 g of bovine serum albumin/100 ml, 7 g of SDS/100 ml, and 10 mm EDTA and then hybridized overnight with random prime labeled cDNA for biglycan (cDNA for the full-length core protein of human bone PG-1) (42.Fisher L.W.

Autoradiography of the filters was performed, and autoradiograms were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet IIcx using ImageQuant software. Autoradiograms were normalized to 28 S, as visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Core proteins of chondroitin ABC lyase-digested samples were separated on SDS-PAGE 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 V for 35 min in 40 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine with 20 ml of methanol/100 ml, and 0.0375 g of SDS/100 ml in a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 2 ml of calf serum/100 ml of 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.05 ml of Tween-20/100 ml (TBST) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antiserum prepared against a peptide sequence near the N terminus of human biglycan (1:1000) (kindly provided by Dr. L.

Nitrocellulose membranes were washed with 0.1% calf serum in TBST before incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:2000) dilution in TBST with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and visualized by fluorography on Kodak XAR-2 film. LDL (5 mg/ml) was bound to 1 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's procedure. 50 μg of heparin/ml was included during the coupling step to protect the proteoglycan-binding arginine- and lysine-rich regions of apo B from being blocked during the reaction with activated gel (20.Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL-Sepharose was washed with 10 volumes of 2 m NaCl to dissociate the heparin from the covalently bound LDL and then equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 250 μm butylated hydroxy toluene. A column containing no LDL but blocked with ethanolamine served as the control. 10 ml of 35SO4-labeled medium was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 250 μm butylated hydroxy toluene. The medium from control or N-LDL- or Ox-LDL-stimulated cells were passed over separate 1-ml LDL-Sepharose columns, and the column flow-through was collected. The columns were washed twice with 10 ml of 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 250 μm butylated hydroxy toluene. The bound material then was eluted with a stepwise gradient consisting of 150, 200, and 400 mm NaCl. Five 1-ml fractions were collected at each concentration of NaCl, and an aliquot of each fraction was counted for 35SO4radioactivity. The significance of differences in mean values between N-LDL or Ox-LDL and control were determined by Student's t test. Cell protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (47.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the effects of N-LDL and Ox-LDL on [35SO4]proteoglycan synthesis, SMC treated for up to 72 h with 0–25 μg/ml N-LDL or Ox-LDL were metabolically labeled with 35SO4 for the 6 h time period following lipoprotein treatment. After 72 h of treatment, an increase in CPC-precipitable counts was observed at all concentrations of Ox-LDL within this range. However, the response was maximal at 5 μg of Ox-LDL/ml. A 30–50% (p < 0.005) increase in CPC-precipitable counts in both the medium (Fig.1 A) and cell layer extracts (Fig. 1 B) of SMC treated with 5 μg of Ox-LDL/ml for 72 h was observed. No significant effect of Ox-LDL was detected prior to 72 h. N-LDL had no effect at any time or at any concentration. Normalization of CPC-precipitable counts for cell number or cell protein did not alter these findings (data not shown), because neither N-LDL nor Ox-LDL had any effect on either cell numbers or cell protein (data not shown). Similar 35SO4incorporation results were obtained with protocols for longer labeling periods up to 24 h (data not shown). Thus, Ox-LDL stimulates35SO4 incorporation into proteoglycans. To investigate whether or not the effects of Ox-LDL on 35SO4 incorporation could be attributed to cholesterol loading of these monkey arterial SMC, unesterified and esterified cholesterol levels within the cells were determined. Ox-LDL (5 μg/ml) did not increase either unesterified or esterified cholesterol levels after 72 h of treatment (Table I). N-LDL (5 μg/ml) also did not increase either unesterified or esterified cholesterol levels after 72 h of treatment (Table I). Thus, the Ox-LDL effects on 35SO4 incorporation were not due to cholesterol loading of these cells.Table IOx-LDL does not increase intracellular levels of unesterified or esterified cholesterolUnesterified cholesterolcholesteryl Esterμg/mg proteinμg/mg proteinControl31.7 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.4N-LDL30.2 ± 0.61.4 ± 0.0Ox-LDL23.2 ± 0.60.9 ± 0.1Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane and isopropanol for determination of cholesteryl ester and unesterified cholesterol, as described (38.Francis G.A.

https://openalex.org/W1975327945,"The low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an enzyme that is involved in the early events of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signal transduction. In fact, LMW-PTP is able to specifically bind and dephosphorylate activated PDGF receptor, thus modulating PDGF-induced mitogenesis. In particular, LMW-PTP is involved in pathways that regulate the transcription of the immediately early genes myc andfos in response to growth factor stimulation. Recently, we have found that LMW-PTP exists constitutively in cytosolic and cytoskeleton-associated localization and that, after PDGF stimulation, c-Src is able to bind and phosphorylate LMW-PTP only in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction. As a consequence of its phosphorylation, LMW-PTP increases its catalytic activity about 20-fold. In this study, our interest was to investigate the role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation in cellular response to PDGF stimulation. To address this issue, we have transfected in NIH-3T3 cells a mutant form of LMW-PTP in which the c-Src phosphorylation sites (Tyr131and Tyr132) were mutated to alanine. We have established that LMW-PTP phosphorylation by c-Src after PDGF treatment strongly influences both cell adhesion and migration. In addition, we have discovered a new LMW-PTP substrate localized in the cytoskeleton that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated after PDGF treatment: p190Rho-GAP. Hence, LMW-PTP plays multiple roles in PDGF receptor-mediated mitogenesis, since it can bind and dephosphorylate PDGF receptor, and, at the same time, the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP, through the regulation of the p190Rho-GAP phosphorylation state, controls the cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to PDGF stimulation.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion on ECM results in clustering of integrins in focal adhesions that contain both cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. Formation of focal adhesions as well as the closely associated actin stress fibers requires activation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho (4.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar). Rho, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, cycles between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active state. Rho is regulated primarily by two groups of proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze exchange of GDP for GTP and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Upon binding to GTP, Rho interacts with and activates proteins such as Rho kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (5.Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). p190Rho-GAP is a GTPase-activating protein for Rho. During growth factor stimulation p190Rho-GAP becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Src in Tyr1105 (6.Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 335-368Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7.Roof R.W. Haskell M.D. Dukes B.D. Sherman N. Kinter M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and undergoes transient redistribution into perinuclear concentric arcs that coincide with epidermal growth factor-mediated focal adhesion assembly and reassembly (6.Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 335-368Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). p190Rho-GAP tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with rapid disassembly of actin stress fiber, suggesting that this phosphorylation may increase its Rho-GAP activity (6.Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 335-368Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Another function proposed for p190Rho-GAP phosphorylation is to form a binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of p120Ras-GAP even if a significant portion of p190Rho-GAP/p120Ras-GAP binding is Tyr(P)-independent (7.Roof R.W. Haskell M.D. Dukes B.D. Sherman N. Kinter M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to p190Rho-GAP, many other proteins present in focal adhesions, such as tensin, paxillin, p130Cas, and focal adhesion kinase, become tyrosine-phosphorylated during integrin and/or growth factor stimulation. This evidence would predict the requirement for protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the integrin downstream signaling. The PTP superfamily is composed of over 70 enzymes that, despite very limited sequence similarity, share a common active site motif CX 5R and an identical catalytic mechanism. On the basis of their function, structure, and sequence, PTPs can be classified in four main families: 1) tyrosine-specific phosphatases; 2) VH1-like dual specificity PTPs; 3) the Cdc25; and 4) the low molecular weight phosphatase (8.Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an 18-kDa enzyme that is expressed in many mammalian tissues (9.Ramponi G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1994; 8: 1-25Google Scholar). Our previous studies on the molecular biology of LMW-PTP in NIH-3T3 cells evidenced a well defined role of this enzyme in PDGF-induced mitogenesis. The most relevant phenotypic effect of LMW-PTP overexpression was the strong reduction of cell growth rate in response to PDGF stimulation. We have shown that activated PDGF-R is a LMW-PTP substrate (10.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and that LMW-PTP is involved in the control of specific pathways triggered by PDGF-R activation. In particular, LMW-PTP is able to modulate both myc expression, interfering with the Src pathway, and fos expression through an extracellular signal regulated kinase-independent pathway mediated by the STAT proteins (11.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that in NIH-3T3 cells LMW-PTP is localized constitutively in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fraction. These two different LMW-PTP pools are differentially regulated, since only the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src after PDGF stimulation (12.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a consequence of its phosphorylation, LMW-PTP shows an average 20-fold increase in its in vitro catalytic activity (13.Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) instead of the 2-fold activation that was previously reported (14.Rigacci S. Degl'Innocenti D. Bucciantini M. Cirri P. Berti A. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1278-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15.Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the physiological role of cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP in cell adhesion, migration, and spreading in relationship to the phosphatase phosphorylation state using a LMW-PTP mutant in which tyrosines in position 131 and 132 were replaced by alanine (double tyrosine mutant, dtmLMW-PTP). Hence, dtmLMW-PTP cannot be phosphorylated and, consequently, activated by c-Src. Here we have shown that cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP influences cell adhesion, spreading, and migration controlling the phosphorylation state of p190Rho-GAP, a protein that is able to regulate Rho activity and, hence, cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to PDGF stimulation. In addition, in this study we have demonstrated that, in vivo, LMW-PTP itself is regulated by c-Src phosphorylation, since phosphorylated LMW-PTP presents an increased activity on a physiologic substrate such as p190Rho-GAP. In conclusion, our findings strongly support the notion that LMW-PTP is able to perform multiple roles in PDGF-induced mitogenesis. In fact, cytosolic LMW-PTP binds and dephosphorylates PDGF-R (10.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), thus modulating part of its signaling cascade, whereas cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP acts on phosphorylated p190Rho-GAP, consequently playing a role in PDGF-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC; human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was from Peprotech; the ECL kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), except those against tensin (gift of Dr. Su Hao Lo). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Unique Restriction Elimination Site kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 26-base-long target mutagenesis primer contains two sequential ACA codons (alanine) substituting the original TAT codon (tyrosine). The mutated LMW-PTP coding sequence was completely sequenced by the Sanger method and subcloned in the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites of pRcCMV eukaryotic expression vector, harboring the neomycin resistance gene. NIH-3T3 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 10 μg of pRcCMV-wtLMW-PTP, pRcCMV-dnLMW-PTP, or pRcCMV-dtmLMW-PTP, conferring neomycin resistance, were transfected in NIH-3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Control cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 μg of pRcCMVneo alone. The clonal lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by (a) Northern blot analysis and (b) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP rabbit antibodies, which do not cross-react with murine endogenous LMW-PTP. 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of the specific antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Sartorius). Immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20, for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysate fractions were obtained as already described (12.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PDGF-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. Pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA and then resuspended in complete RIPA buffer, which is RIPA buffer plus 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, by shaking for 1 h at room temperature and newly clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. RIPA or complete RIPA fractions were then used for immunoprecipitation analysis. Cell adhesion was assessed as described elsewhere (16.Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before detaching with 0.25% trypsin for 1 min. Trypsin was blocked with 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min, and then resuspended in 2 ml/10-cm dish of DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Resuspended cells were maintained in suspension with gentle agitation for 30 min at 37 °C and then directly seeded in precoated dishes treated overnight with 10 μg/ml human fibronectin or 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine in PBS and then washed twice in PBS and blocked for 2 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cell adhesion was assessed as described elsewhere (16.Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 104 cells were seeded for the indicated time in a 96-well dish precoated for 2 h with 10 μg/ml human fibronectin and washed twice with PBS. Cell adhesion was stopped by removing the medium and by the addition of a 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After 5 min of staining, the fixed cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 200 μl/well of 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. The adhesion assay was performed either in complete medium or after 24 h of serum starvation followed by the addition of 10 ng/ml PDGF. All cell adhesion assays were performed in triplicate. Cell spreading was assessed as described elsewhere (16.Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in complete medium for the indicated time in a 24-well dish precoated for 2 h with 10 μg/ml human fibronectin and washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor. After removal of the medium, the cells were fixed in 1 ml of 0.25%p-formaldehyde for at least 1 h. Photographs were taken with Kodak 100 ASA film. Cell migration was assessed as described elsewhere with minor modifications (11.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Migration of NIH-3T3 cells was assayed with the Transwell system of Costar, equipped with 8-μm pore polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (6-mm diameter) precoated with human type I collagen (20 μg/ml) and placed between the chemoattractant (lower chamber) and the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with medium supplemented with different concentrations of PDGF-BB. Serum-free DMEM cultured cells were suspended by trypsinization, and 3 × 104 cells in 200 μl were added to the top wells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. After incubation, the cells attached to the upper side but not migrated through the filter were mechanically removed using cotton swabs. The filters were fixed in 96% methanol and stained with Diff Quick staining solutions. Chemotaxis was evaluated by counting the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the polycarbonate filters. For each filter, the number of cells in six randomly chosen fields was determined, and the counts were averaged (mean ± S.D.). In a previous paper (12.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that LMW-PTP exists in two spatially and functionally separated pools. The cytosolic LMW-PTP is not phosphorylated and is able to bind and dephosphorylate the activated PDGF receptor. In contrast, the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP becomes phosphorylated by c-Src during PDGF stimulation, and its substrate, in this subcellular localization, is a protein of about 190 kDa (12.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to study the properties of the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction, we analyzed if the disruption of the cytoskeleton architecture affects the localization of this phosphatase. NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the active LMW-PTP (wtLMW-PTP) were kept in suspension for 30 min and then stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB in parallel with control adherent cells. After cell fractionation by differential detergent treatment, we analyzed the cytoskeleton fractions by anti-LMW-PTP immunoblot. The result (Fig.1 A) indicates that LMW-PTP is not present in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction of the suspended cells, thus suggesting a requirement of cytoskeleton integrity for LMW-PTP localization in this subcellular district. Then we analyzed the dependence of LMW-PTP localization in the cell adhesion structures that are formed upon reseeding cells on different substrata. We seeded wtLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells on dishes coated with polylysine, a substratum that is unable to induce integrin clustering, or with fibronectin, a specific integrin receptor agonist. After 15 min, cells were stimulated or not with PDGF-BB, and the cytoskeletal fractions were assayed for LMW-PTP content. Fig. 1 B reports that LMW-PTP accumulates in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction only in fibronectin and PDGF-treated cells, suggesting that the targeting of LMW-PTP in this subcellular district is driven by the formation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion structures. Similar results were obtained treating cells with collagen type I (data not shown). In addition, only in cells seeded on fibronectin, LMW-PTP undergoes phosphorylation after PDGF treatment, suggesting that LMW-PTP phosphorylation is a phenomenon that requires both integrin-mediated cell adhesion and PDGF receptor stimulation (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained with collagen type I (data not shown). Taylor et al. (15.Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have reported that LMW-PTP tyrosine 131 and 132 are phosphorylated by Src family kinases in Jurkat T-cells. In order to study the physiological role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation, we generated by site-specific mutagenesis a double mutant (dtmLMW-PTP) in which both tyrosine 131 and 132 were substituted with an alanine. The resulting mutated enzyme, which maintains about 40% of the wtLMW-PTP specific activity onp-nitrophenyl phosphate, cannot be subjected to c-Src phosphorylation (13.Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have subcloned the dtmLMW-PTP coding region in pRcCMV eukaryotic expression vector, and we have stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells. Overexpressing clones were isolated by neomycin selection and anti-LMW-PTP Western blot screening. In all of the following experiments, we have used clones that overexpress wtLMW-PTP and dtmLMW-PTP at a similar level. Fig.2 A shows that dtmLMW-PTP is targeted to the cytoskeleton structures in response to PDGF treatment as well as wtLMW-PTP. As expected, the dtmLMW-PTP is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF treatment and fibronectin adhesion (Fig. 2 B). These findings indicate that LMW-PTP targeting to cytoskeleton is independent from its tyrosine phosphorylation and that, also in vivo, residues 131 and 132 are the only LMW-PTP tyrosines that are phosphorylated in response to PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, we were interested in determining the role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation in integrin-mediated signaling, especially for what concerns cytoskeleton rearrangements following the mitotic stimulus, such as cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion was tested by seeding previously suspended cells on fibronectin-coated dishes for 10, 30, and 60 min. The adherence of cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB was evaluated with crystal violet staining, and absorbance at 595 nm was plotted against time (Fig. 3). After PDGF stimulation, wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells showed a significant increase of cell adhesion in comparison with mock-transfected cells, whereas the dtmLMW-PTP overexpressing cells behave more similar to mock-transfected cells. We do not observe any effect of the overexpression of LMW-PTP in unstimulated cells. In agreement with this observation, dnLMW-PTP-expressing cells exhibit an opposite phenotype showing a clear decrease in cell adhesion with respect to wtLMW-PTP cells. The dominant negative LMW-PTP is a protein in which the mutation of the cysteine residue to serine in the signature motif (C12S) causes the complete loss of catalytic activity. Nevertheless, this dominant negative mutant (dnLMW-PTP) is still able to bind specific substrates (10.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Camici G. Manao G. Pazzagli L. Caselli A. Barghini I. Cappugi G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1161: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data indicate a role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation in integrin-mediated cell adhesion upon PDGF stimulation, since overexpression of an unphosphorylatable enzyme (dtmLMW-PTP) has a little effect on cell adhesion. Hence, we evaluated the effect of LMW-PTP overexpression in the cell spreading on the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Cells expressing the wild type, dnLMW-PTP, or the dtmLMW-PTP were seeded on fibronectin-treated six-well dishes and fixed by p-formaldehyde treatment after 10 and 30 min from seeding. Fig. 4 shows that the wtLMW-PTP overexpression leads to an increase in cell spreading with respect to control cells both at 10 and 30 min, while the overexpression of the dtmLMW-PTP has only a marginal effect, suggesting a specific role of LMW-PTP phosphorylation in mediating cell spreading. In addition, dnLMW-PTP overexpression inhibits cell spreading on fibronectin. Finally, we analyzed the chemotactic response to PDGF-BB in cells overexpressing either wild type or dtmLMW-PTP in comparison with mock-transfected cells. The results, shown in Fig.5, show that the wtLMW-PTP overexpression leads to an increase of the PDGF-induced chemotaxis with respect to mock-transfected cells, whereas the dtmLMW-PTP overexpression has little effect on the chemotactic response, indicating a possible regulative role of LMW-PTP in PDGF-induced cell migration. As previously reported (11.Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

We previously reported that a protein of about 190 kDa, distinct from PDGF-R, could be an LMW-PTP substrate in the cytoskeleton-associated fraction. In fact, this protein is differentially phosphorylated in wtLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells with respect to control cells after PDGF stimulation (12.Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Taddei L. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to obtain evidence of a direct association between the phosphorylated p190 and LMW-PTP, we performed an anti-LMW-PTP immunoprecipitation of the cytoskeleton fraction followed by a Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig.6 A shows that a protein of about 190 kDa coimmunoprecipitates with LMW-PTP both in wtLMW-PTP- and dtmLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells. We have recently shown that, in vitro, LMW-PTP phosphorylation by c-Src leads to an approximately 20-fold increase in LMW-PTP enzymatic activity (13.Bucciantini M. Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Taddei L. Stefani M. Raugei G. Nordlund P. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to establish if also in vivo LMW-PTP phosphorylation induces LMW-PTP activation, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation level of p190 in cells overexpressing wild type, double tyrosine mutant, or dominant negative LMW-PTP. Cells serum-starved for 24 h were stimulated with PDGF, and the cytoskeleton fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot (Fig. 6 B) reveals that the wtLMW-PTP overexpression leads to a decrease in the p190 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas this effect is much less evident in dtmLMW-PTP cells. Maximum phosphorylation of p190 was achieved, as expected, in the dominant negative-overexpressing cells, since this mutant is completely inactive. These data demonstrate that, also in vivo, LMW-PTP tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF leads to an increase of the catalytic activity of the phosphatase on a physiological substrate like p190. As far as the identity of p190 is concerned, we have tested various antibodies against cytoskeleton-associated proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to PDGF stimulation, such as talin, tensin, p190Rho-GAP, and PDGF-R itself, and we have found that p190 is p190Rho-GAP, the GTPase-activating protein for the small G-protein Rho. In fact, as shown in Fig. 7, aand b, LMW"
https://openalex.org/W2083655185,"Cooperativity in the interactions among proteins subunits and DNA is crucial for DNA recognition. LexA repressor was originally thought to bind DNA as a monomer, with cooperativity leading to tighter binding of the second monomer. The main support for this model was a high value of the dissociation constant for the LexA dimer (micromolar range). Here we show that the protein is a dimer at nanomolar concentrations under different conditions. The reversible dissociation of LexA dimer was investigated by the effects of hydrostatic pressure or urea, using fluorescence emission and polarization to monitor the dissociation process. The dissociation constant lies in the picomolar range (lower than 20 pm). LexA monomers associate with an unusual large volume change (340 ml/mol), indicating the burial of a large surface area upon dimerization. Whereas nonspecific DNA has no stabilizing effect, specific DNA induces tightening of the dimer and a 750-fold decrease in the K d. In contrast to the previous model, a tight dimer rather than a monomer is the functional repressor. Accordingly, the LexA dimer only loses its ability to recognize a specific DNA sequence by RecA-induced autoproteolysis. Our work provides insights into the linkage between protein-protein interactions, DNA recognition, and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2146361892,"The interaction of fibronectin with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is important biologically in inducing reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the assembly of focal adhesions. The major heparan sulfate-binding site in fibronectin, which is also implicated in these morphological events, is the COOH-terminal Hep-2 domain. We describe the first extensive study of the structural determinants required for the interaction between heparan sulfate/heparin and Hep-2. It is clear that, in heparan sulfate, there is a very prominent role for N-sulfate groups, as opposed to a relatively small apparent contribution from carboxyl groups. Furthermore, a minimal octasaccharide binding sequence appeared to contain at least two 2-O-sulfated iduronate residues, but no 6-O-sulfate groups. However, affinity was enhanced by the presence of 6-O-sulfates, and the interaction with Hep-2 also increased progressively with oligosaccharide size up to a maximum length of a tetradecasaccharide. This overall specificity is compatible with recent information on the structure of Hep-2 (Sharma, A., Askari, J. A., Humphries, M. J., Jones, E. Y., and Stuart, D. I. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 1468–1479) in which two separate, positively charged clusters, involving up to 11 basic amino acid residues (mostly arginines with their preferential ability to co-ordinate sulfate groups), could form a single extended binding site.

Interaction of a variety of ECM proteins with specific cell surface integrins initiates signal transduction, leading to re-organization of the cytoskeleton culminating in the assembly of focal adhesions. However, in the case of fibronectin, there is also an additional and necessary co-receptor role for the specific transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) syndecan-4 (1.Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This HSPG interacts with fibronectin via its heparan sulfate (HS) chains, and contributes additional signals through the ability of its unique cytoplasmic domain to bind and activate protein kinase Cα (for a review see Ref. 2.Woods A. Oh E.-S. Couchman J.R. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A fully developed adhesive response to fibronectin thus requires the co-ordinated extracellular interactions of integrin and HS with the “cell-binding” and “heparin-binding” domains of fibronectin, respectively (3.Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fibronectin is probably the most studied of the ECM proteins with HS/heparin affinity. However, its heparin affinity is relatively low (KD in the range of 0.1–1 μm) (4.Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W.

Rudland P.S. Gallagher J.T. Fernig D.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This weak affinity may reflect the requirement in vivo for physiologically reversible interactions between these macromolecules, which are present at relatively high localized concentrations within the pericellular matrix (6.Evington J.R.N. Luscombe M. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 243-244Crossref Google Scholar). The fibronectin monomer contains two physically separate and structurally distinct HS/heparin-binding regions, designated Hep-1 and Hep-2, which can be proteolytically excised as independent functional HS/heparin-binding units. The more carboxyl-terminal Hep-2 domain is the one specifically implicated in focal adhesion formation (3.Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is strategically sandwiched between the RGD-containing central cell binding domain, which is recognized by the α5β1 integrin (11.Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3891) Google Scholar), and the variably-spliced IIICS region, which contains two binding sequences for the α4β1 integrin (12.Humphries M.J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The HS/heparin affinity of isolated Hep-2 is 10–25-fold stronger than that of the amino-terminal Hep-1 domain (7.Benecky M.J. Kolvenbach C.G. Amrani D.L. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,8.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and much more comparable to that of intact fibronectin (8.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hep-2 also displays a greater specificity for HS/heparin than the Hep-1 domain, which binds HS/heparin and chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (CS/DS) with comparable affinities (15.Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S. Funahashi M. Matsumoto I. Seno N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14359-14365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has thus been suggested that the HS/heparin-binding properties of intact soluble fibronectin approximate to those of the Hep-2 domain alone (7.Benecky M.J. Kolvenbach C.G. Amrani D.L. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7565-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hep-2 comprises three contiguous repeats of fibronectin type III modules (III12–14). Solution interaction studies have suggested that it may contain two distinct HS/heparin-binding sites (8.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analyses of deletion mutants indicate that III13contains the main binding site, with III14 providing a secondary binding component (16.Barkalow F.J.B. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. Busby T.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12548-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, III13 has been identified as the essential component for initiating focal contact formation (18.Yoneda J. Saiki I. Igarashi Y. Kobayashi H. Fujii H. Ishizaki Y. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Azuma I. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although, interestingly, five distinct peptide sequences have been isolated from throughout Hep-2 which display both heparin affinity (albeit weak) and cell adhesion-promoting activityin vitro (3.Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of III13, together with subsequent mutational analyses, suggested that the major HS/heparin binding-site may be formed from the spatial juxtaposition of six discontinuous basic residues, rather than a linear sequence (19.Busby T.F. Scott-Argraves W. Brew S.A. Pechik I. Gilliland G.L. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18558-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of Hep-2 (20.Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has confirmed the existence of this positively charged cluster. It also revealed the existence of a separate cluster of positive charge, on the same face of Hep-2 but within III14, which may constitute the postulated secondary HS/heparin-binding site. Previous work, using a preparation of thermolysin-excised Hep-2, demonstrated that interaction with HS occurred within the sulfated domains (S-domains), and that the smallest S-domain with measurable affinity at physiological ionic strength was an octasaccharide (21.Walker A. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have now extended this investigation, using a recombinant Hep-2 domain, to gain further information on the structural specificity of this important interaction. The major HS/heparin-binding fragment of human fibronectin was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Makarem et al. (22.Makarem R. Newham P. Askari J.A. Green L.J. Clements J. Edwards M. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4005-4011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This recombinant fragment, here referred to as Hep-2, comprises the III12–14 sequence (i.e. the minimal Hep-2 domain as derived by thermolysin excision), together with the additional III15 repeat, but without any of the potentially intervening, alternatively spliced IIICS region.

Sulfur trioxide triethylamine complex and 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were from Sigma. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (20–45 Ci/mmol) and 3H-end-labeled porcine mucosal heparin (specific activity 0.55 mCi/mg) were from NEN Life Science Products (Stevenage, UK). Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum; EC4.2.2.7), chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4), and chondroitinase ACII (Arthrobacter aurescens; EC 4.2.2.5) were from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned) and heparinase III (F. heparinum; EC 4.2.2.8) were from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% (v/v) donor calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, in 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cultures were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride for 24 h, and [3H]HS was extracted and purified as described previously (23.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T.

Pronase-resistant glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were separated on a DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange column (10 × 1 cm). Residual CS/DS was removed from partially resolved HS by digestion with 50 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by re-chromatography. For the preparation of 3H-labeled chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), human skin fibroblasts were metabolically radiolabeled as described above. Culture medium was applied to a 2-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then washed with 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mmphosphate, pH 7.0. Crude CSPGs were eluted with 1.5 m NaCl, desalted on a PD-10 column, further purified on a Sepharose CL4B column (1.5 cm × 140 cm) eluted with 0.2 mNH4HCO3, and finally freeze-dried. CSPG purity was checked by its susceptibility to chondroitinases ACII and ABC, and resistance to nitrous acid. Free [3H]CS chains were isolated by Pronase digestion of [3H]CSPG and recovery on Sepharose CL-4B. [3H]DS chains were extracted and purified from metabolically radiolabeled rat embryo fibroblasts, as described previously (23.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Rahmoune H. Fernig D.G. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Metabolically radiolabeled [3H]HS was depolymerized with 20 mIU/ml heparinase III in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0 at 37 °C. For maximal breakdown, three additions of enzyme were made over 18 h. For a partial digestion, aliquots were removed at various time points, heated to 100 °C, and then re-pooled. [3H]HS fragments were fractionated on a Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration column (1 cm × 125 cm) eluted with 0.2m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. Peaks corresponding to di- to hexadecasaccharides were individually pooled and repeatedly freeze-dried. Porcine mucosal HS was converted to the pyridinium salt and then solvolyticallyN-desulfated in 95% (v/v) Me2SO, 5% (v/v) methanol (24.Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting de-N-sulfated HS, which contained free amino groups, was then re-N-acetylated using acetic anhydride, as described previously (25.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T.

De-2-O-sulfation of porcine mucosal HS was accomplished by a modified (26.Ishihara M. Shaklee P.N. Yang Z. Liang W. Wei Z. Stack R.J. Holme K.

Porcine mucosal HS was converted to the pyridinium salt, and then solvolytically desulfated in 90% (v/v) Me2SO, 10% (v/v) water (28.Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Re-N-sulfation was achieved by reaction with the sulfur trioxide triethylamine complex (29.Lloyd A.G. Embery G. Fowler L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in the loss of 54.8% of 6-O-sulfates, with a negligible effect upon N-sulfates but a small (9.6%) reduction in 2-O-sulfates (Table I). The relative contents of N-, 2-O-, and 6-O- sulfate groups in all native and modified, heparin and HS species were calculated from their disaccharide compositions (see below). Porcine mucosal heparin and 3H-labeled 3T3 fibroblast HS were carboxyl-reduced, essentially according to the method of Taylor and Conrad (30.Taylor R.L. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Carboxyl groups were activated by treatment with 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at pH 4.75, and then reduced using an excess of sodium borohydride. The levels of carboxyl reduction were not assessed, although, by comparison, Taylor and Conrad (30.Taylor R.L. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) achieved 85% carboxyl reduction of heparin. The effectiveness of the procedure was, however, suggested by the markedly reduced potency of the carboxyl-reduced heparin as a competitor for the binding of hepatocyte growth factor, an interaction that does appear to require carboxyl groups. 2M. Lyon and J. A. Deakin, unpublished work. Activated Affi-Gel 10 (1 ml) combined with 0.4 mg of recombinant Hep-2 in 3 ml of 10 mm HEPES coupling buffer, pH 7, was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. To prevent protein coupling through GAG-binding sites, these were protected by preincubation of Hep-2 with 1 mg/ml acetylated porcine mucosal heparin (prepared by acetylation of any free amino groups using excess acetic anhydride; Ref. 25.Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupling was terminated by addition of ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and incubation at room temperature for 1 h. Coupled gel was washed extensively with 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.0, before equilibration with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. A control gel was similarly prepared by omission of Hep-2. Purified [3H]GAGs/oligosaccharides were applied to the Hep-2 column in ≤1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and the eluate was collected and re-applied four times. The last loading was left in the column for 1 h at room temperature to maximize binding. After a 5-ml wash with equilibration buffer, the bound material was eluted stepwise (four or five 1-ml aliquots/step) with increasing NaCl concentrations in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and counted for their 3H content. For competition studies, a fixed amount of [3H]HS (3 × 104 cpm) or [3H]heparin (5 × 104 cpm) was applied to the Hep-2 column, in the absence or presence of potential competitors, in a total volume of 1 ml, as described above. Non-binding material was recovered by washing with 5 ml of equilibration buffer, and bound material was step-eluted with 5 ml of 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The quantity of radiolabeled GAG that bound in the presence of a potential competitor was calculated as a proportion of the maximal binding achieved by radiolabeled GAG alone. Correction for nonspecific binding was made by subtraction of that amount which bound to a parallel control column. [3H]Octasaccharides, purified from the oligosaccharide pool generated by partial heparinase III digestion of [3H]HS, were charge-fractionated on a ProPac PA1 strong anion-exchange HPLC column (0.4 × 25 cm; Dionex). Samples were loaded in Milli-Q water (acidified to pH 3.5 with HCl) and, after washing, were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.2 mNaCl in acidified water over 90 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/h. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and counted for their 3H content. The resultant profile was subdivided into a number of fractions, which were desalted on a PD-10 column, and then individually assayed for their Hep-2 affinity and disaccharide composition. [3H]Tetradecasaccharides, purified from the S-domain pool generated by a complete heparinase III digestion of [3H]HS, were fractionated into binding and non-binding fractions by Hep-2 affinity chromatography in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and step elution with 1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The non-binding fraction was depleted of binding material by repeated re-application to the affinity column, until no more material bound. The two pools of tetradecasaccharides were charge-fractionated on a Hydropore 5AX weak anion-exchange HPLC column (0.46 × 25 cm; Anachem). After application in Milli-Q water and a 3-ml water wash, oligosaccharides were eluted with a two-step linear gradient of 0–0.25 mNH4HCO3 over 10 min, followed by 0.25–0.55m NH4HCO3 over 50 min, at an overall flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and counted for their 3H content. The resultant profiles were subdivided into a number of fractions, which were desalted on a PD-10 column, and individually assayed for their Hep-2 affinity and disaccharide composition. Unlabeled HS/heparin species or [3H]oligosaccharide fractions (supplemented with unlabeled porcine mucosal HS) were exhaustively digested with a combination of 20 mIU each of heparinases I, II, and III in 0.1m sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. Digestion to completion was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 232 nm. The resulting disaccharides were applied to a ProPac PA1 strong anion-exchange HPLC column (0.4 × 25 cm) equilibrated with Milli-Q water (acidified to pH 3.5 with HCl). After a 5-ml water wash, the constituent disaccharides were eluted with a 45-ml gradient of 0–1m NaCl, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Unlabeled disaccharides were monitored by UV absorbance at 232 nm, while radiolabeled disaccharides were collected in 0.5-ml fractions and counted for their 3H content. Disaccharide peaks were identified by comparison with known disaccharide standards. The GAG binding specificity of recombinant Hep-2 (III12–15) was assessed by application of radiolabeled GAGs to a Hep-2 column under low ionic strength conditions (10 mm Tris-HCl), followed by stepwise elution with increasing NaCl concentrations (Fig.1). Heparin bound most strongly (Fig.1 a), requiring up to 0.25 m NaCl for complete elution (a control column retained negligible material above 0.05m NaCl), while 3T3 fibroblast-derived HS was predominantly eluted by 0.15–0.2 m NaCl (Fig. 1 b). Fractions eluted at different NaCl concentrations tended to maintain their specific elution positions upon re-application (data not shown). CS/DS displayed noticeably weaker binding than HS or heparin. DS, prepared by selective chondroitinase ACII digestion of a mixed CS/DS population, was mainly released at or below 0.1 m NaCl, although complete elution required up to 0.25 m NaCl (Fig.1 c). CSPG (Fig. 1 d), and its constituent CS chains (data not shown), also bound, but were almost completely eluted with only 0.1 m NaCl. Complete heparinase III digestion of 3H-labeled 3T3 fibroblast HS releases intact S-domains which, by their elution at up to 0.2 m NaCl (data not shown), retain most of the Hep-2 affinity of the parent HS chains. Preparative fractionation of such S-domains on Bio-Gel P10 (data not shown) generated specific size fractions, from di- (dp2) to hexadecasaccharides (dp16), which were subsequently assessed for Hep-2 affinity (Fig.2). No measurable affinity was displayed by dp6 or smaller (data not shown). dp8s were the smallest to exhibit some specific binding, requiring elution with 0.1 m NaCl. As S-domain size increased from dp8 to dp14, Hep-2 affinity (as measured by the maximum NaCl concentration required for elution) progressively increased. The behavior of ≥dp14 resembled that of the intact HS chains (compare Figs. 1 b and 2 d). Affinity column-based competition binding assays were performed to try and ascertain whether specific positions and/or levels of sulfation are critical for HS/heparin binding to Hep-2. To cover a wide range of sulfation levels, modified bovine lung heparins as well as modified porcine mucosal HS species (TableI) were tested as competitors for the binding of 3H-labeled mucosal heparin (Fig.3 a) and 3H-labeled fibroblast HS (Fig. 3 b), respectively. Bovine lung heparin was a better competitor than porcine mucosal heparin for the binding of [3H]heparin (IC50values of 5.3 and 21.5 μg, respectively). This may in part reflect the higher average sulfation level of lung heparin (2.79versus 2.46 sulfates/disaccharide). Selective replacement of nearly all (97.5%) N-sulfates by N-acetyl groups had relatively little effect (2-fold increase in IC50 to 10 μg), compared with the major effects elicited by almost complete loss of either 2-O- or 6-O-sulfates (IC50values were not experimentally attained, but must, by extrapolation, be considerably greater than 100 μg). Whereas complete de-2-O-sulfation can be selectively achieved, complete de-6-O-sulfation also results in a partial loss of 2-O-sulfates (Table I). Thus, a sample of partially de-6-O-sulfated heparin, in which there was a significantly smaller concomitant reduction in 2-O-sulfates (Table I), was also tested. Although this material was still a significantly poorer competitor than the parent lung heparin, it was still comparable (IC50 of 20.5 μg) to native mucosal heparin. Compared with desulfation, the reduction of carboxyl groups in mucosal heparin to uncharged primary alcohol groups elicited a <2-fold reduction in competitive ability (IC50 increased from 21.5 to 38.7 μg). This apparently minor contribution of carboxyl groups was confirmed by the failure of carboxyl reduction of [3H]HS to significantly affect its binding to a Hep-2 column (data not shown). Mucosal HS was much less effective than lung heparin (IC50values of 5.4 and 0.9 μg, respectively) as a competitor for the binding of 3H-labeled 3T3 HS to Hep-2, but more so than kidney HS (IC50 of 27.1 μg). Digestion of mucosal HS with heparinase I, which partially fragments it by cleaving centrally within S-domains, converted it to a very poor competitor (IC50 of 340 μg). Interestingly, the effects of selective desulfations of mucosal HS differed significantly from the equivalent modifications of lung heparin. Although substantial reductions in either 6-O-sulfates (55% loss) or 2-O-sulfates (83% loss) converted mucosal HS into a significantly poorer competitor (IC50 values of 15.8 and 31.6 μg, respectively, compared with the initial 5.4 μg), the modified species remained comparable to native kidney HS (IC50 of 27.1 μg). However, a 92% replacement of N-sulfates by N-acetyl groups transformed mucosal HS into a very poor competitor (IC50 of 316 μg), and similarly a 3H-labeled de-N-sulfated/re-N-acetylated fibroblast HS displayed very weak affinity for a Hep-2 column, being mostly eluted by 50 mm NaCl (data not shown). dp8s are the smallest oligosaccharides with measurable Hep-2 affinity, while maximal affinity is attained with dp14. We therefore specifically targeted both dp8s and dp14s for further study, with the aim of subfractionating them on the basis of either their affinity for Hep II or their total charge, and then attempting to correlate differential levels of Hep-2 affinity within each population with their specific levels and/or patterns of sulfation. dp14s (from a complete heparinase III digest of [3H]HS"
https://openalex.org/W1972855197,"cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) is a major cellular receptor of cGMP and plays important roles in cGMP-dependent signal transduction pathways. To isolate the components of the cGMP/cGK signaling pathway such as substrates and regulatory proteins of cGK, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system using cGK-Iα as a bait and isolated a novel male germ cell-specific 42-kDa protein, GKAP42 (42-kDa cGMP-dependent protein kinaseanchoring protein). Although the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–66) of cGK-Iα is sufficient for the association with GKAP42, GKAP42 could not interact with cGK-Iβ, cGK-II, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. GKAP42 mRNA is specifically expressed in testis, where it is restricted to the spermatocytes and early round spermatids. Endogenous cGK-I is co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GKAP42 antibody from mouse testis tissue, suggesting that cGK-I physiologically interacts with GKAP42. Immunocytochemical observations revealed that GKAP42 is localized to the Golgi complex and that cGK-Iα is co-localized to the Golgi complex when coexpressed with GKAP42. Although both cGK-Iα and -Iβ, but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase, phosphorylated GKAP42 in vitro, GKAP42 was a good substrate only for cGK-Iα in intact cells, suggesting that the association with kinase protein is required for the phosphorylation in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that the kinase-deficient mutant of cGK-Iα stably associates with GKAP42 and that binding of cGMP to cGK-Iα facilitates their release from GKAP42. These findings suggest that GKAP42 functions as an anchoring protein for cGK-Iα and that cGK-Iα may participate in germ cell development through phosphorylation of Golgi-associated proteins such as GKAP42. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) is a major cellular receptor of cGMP and plays important roles in cGMP-dependent signal transduction pathways.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). cGK is a member of a family of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases that also includes cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK). Previous studies have identified two forms of cGK (I and II) that are encoded by distinct genes and two different isoforms of cGK-I (designated Iα and Iβ) that are produced by alternative splicing (5.Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The regulatory compartment located in the N-terminal region of cGK-I isozymes contains the leucine zipper motif and autoinhibitory domain, followed by two cGMP-binding and catalytic domains. In addition to the structural similarity between cGK and cAK (6.Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), these kinases have many overlapping consensus phosphorylation motifs. Although possible substrates for cGK are often efficiently phosphorylated by cAKin vitro, the relatively low cytosolic concentration of cGK in most cells suggests that mechanisms other than recognition of consensus phosphorylation motifs may contribute to selective cGMP-mediated protein phosphorylation in intact cells. Recent reports indicate that specific anchoring proteins located at various sites in the cell compartmentalize the kinase proteins to their sites of action and that the location of anchoring proteins provides some of the specificity of the responses mediated by each kinase (7.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 8.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). cAK is one of the best characterized protein kinases and has been shown to bind to specific anchoring proteins that are termed AKAPs (for Akinase anchoring proteins) through the regulatory subunits (9.Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10.Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAK holoenzyme is a heterotetramer composed of a regulatory subunit dimer that associates with two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits of cAK releases the active catalytic subunits, enabling them to interact with and phosphorylate their substrates. Therefore, the localization of cAK near its substrates may be important for rapid phosphorylation of specific substrate in response to increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Similarly, when members of the protein kinase C family are activated, they undergo translocation from one intracellular compartment to another. A recent report has demonstrated that receptors for activated protein kinase C (RACK) anchor protein kinase C in the activated states and determine their subcellular localization (11.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For instance, RACK1, a 36-kDa protein isolated from rat brain, binds to activated protein kinase CβII and increases substrate phosphorylation by protein kinase C (12.Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence for other proteins being localized in the cell with substrates has been presented for Raf (13.Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).To investigate the potential functions of cGK-I isozymes and to determine the mechanism by which these functions are carried out, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate the components of the cGMP/cGK signaling pathway such as substrates and regulatory proteins of cGK. Because AKAPs have been shown to associate with the regulatory subunits of cAK in the inactive state, we used the regulatory region located in the N terminus of cGK-Iα as a bait. Here we report evidence that cGK-Iα directly interacts with and phosphorylates the novel male germ cell-specific protein GKAP42in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of cGK-Iα with GKAP42 facilitated the translocation of cGK-Iα to the Golgi complex, and cGK-Iα was released in response to intracellular cGMP accumulation. In the male germ cells, the Golgi complex is considered to be important for the formation of the acrosomic system and chromatoid body. These findings suggest that GKAP42 functions as an anchoring protein for cGK-Iα and that cGK-Iα might have functions through the interaction with Golgi-associated proteins during spermatogenesis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, a cDNA encoding a novel germ cell-specific protein was identified as a cGK-Iα-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening using the N-terminal regulatory region of cGK-Iα as a bait, and we demonstrated the physiological interaction of these two proteins in testis tissue. We also showed that GKAP42 selectively associates with cGK-Iα and that the phosphorylation of GKAP42 seems to be dependent on direct interaction with the kinase protein. Very recently, we showed that troponin T functions as an anchoring protein for cGK-I and that cGK-I may participate in the regulation of muscle contraction through phosphorylation of troponin I (14.Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, troponin T protein does not interact with cGK-II or cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the N-terminal region of cGK-I is essential for the association with troponin T, but the interaction between cGK-I and troponin T is not substantially affected by the activation state of cGK-I. One characteristic feature of the interaction with GKAP42 is that cGMP induces the release of cGK-Iα from GKAP42. In this respect, GKAP42 seems to be similar to AKAPs, which bind cAK via its regulator subunits. However, the catalytic subunits of cAK are released from regulatory subunits in response to intracellular cAMP elevation, suggesting that there is a distinct mechanism underlying the detachment of the regulatory domain of cGK-Iα from GKAP42. In addition, a kinase-inactive mutant of cGK-Iα also could dissociate from GKAP42 in response to cGMP binding. This observation suggests that the mechanism underlying cGMP-induced release of cGK-Iα from GKAP42 is not dependent on the increase in basal kinase activity or autophosphorylation in the presence of cGMP. Recent studies (27.Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28.Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that cGMP binding to cGK-I produces distinct conformational changes in the enzyme as evidenced by increased surface electronegativity, a larger Stokes radius, decreased mobility on native gel electrophoresis, and altered susceptibility to protease, suggesting that the conformational change in the presence of cGMP reduces the stability of this interaction. Another feature is that a kinase-inactive mutant of cGK-Iα stably associates with GKAP42 in the basal state. The transcription factor MEF2C was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening using a dead kinase of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (29.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that the in vitro binding of MEF2C to wild-type p38 was not detected when a large excess of ATP was included, the stability of this interaction appears to be reduced after phosphorylation of MEF2C. In fact, GKAP42 protein is efficiently phosphorylated by cGK-Iα both in vitro and in vivo, but in the presence of cGMP. Supposedly, the minor autophosphorylation of cGK-Iα in the absence of cGMP might reduce the stability of this interaction. As noted also, GKAP42 was efficiently phosphorylated by cGK. Because cGK and cAK have many overlapping consensus phosphorylation motifs, proteins identified as substrates for cGK are often efficiently phosphorylated by cAKin vitro. Only very few substrates of cGK are more specifically phosphorylated by cGK than by cAK. These include the G-substrate (30.Hall K.U. Collins S.P. Gamm D.M. Massa E. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3485-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase (PDE5) (22.Colbran J.L. Francis S.H. Leach A.B. Thomas M.K.

Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cAK-RI (32.Geahlen R.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1164-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all of which have ∼10-fold selectivity relative to cAK. Previous studies with peptide libraries defined optimal amino acid sequences for phosphorylation by cGK (RKX(S/T)) (25.Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, Glass and Smith (26.Glass D.B. Smith S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14797-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the recognition site specific to cGK requires an arginine on the C-terminal side (underlined) of the phosphorylated residue,X(S/T)R X. In fact, an autophosphorylation site (IGPRTT58RAQGI) in cGK-Iα fits this motif. Although GKAP42 does not contain a typical cGK phosphorylation site (RKX(S/T)), an arginine located on the C-terminal side of serine 106 (PAQKES106REEN) might be involved in the potential phosphorylation at serine 106 in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the association with GKAP42 is selective for cGK-Iα in a family of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases. More important, two isozymes of cGK-I (Iα and Iβ), produced by alternative splicing, differ in their N-terminal domains (amino acids 1–89 and 1–104, respectively), resulting in the specificity of interaction with GKAP42. Previous reports on AKAPs described differential subcellular localization of the isozymes likely due to specificity of the anchoring proteins. cAK-RIIα has a 6-fold increased affinity for microtubule-associated protein 2, and cAK-RIIβ has a 2-fold affinity for AKAP75 (33.Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a few AKAPs, dual-specificity AKAPs, interact with both type I and II regulatory subunits (34.Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 35.Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), whereas most AKAPs interact specifically with type II regulatory subunits. An added level of specificity in cAK signaling may be achieved thorough the differential localization of regulatory subunit isoforms by association with isoform-selective AKAPs. Likewise, the N-terminal domain of cGK-I isozymes, through the interaction with their anchoring proteins, may play an important role in the determination of subcellular localization, leading to the mediation of isozyme-specific functions.One of the intriguing observations of this study is that GKAP42 is located in the Golgi complex. Recently, a number of Golgi-associated proteins have been isolated by antibodies from patients with autoimmune diseases and by antibodies prepared in animals.

Although giantin/GCP372 is an integral membrane protein anchored to the membrane by the C-terminal hydrophobic domain, all the other proteins have no hydrophobic domain that could function as a signal sequence or participate in membrane localization. The common characteristic of all these proteins is a very large domain, enabling the formation of coiled-coil structures analogous to the myosin family. One of the predicted structural features of GKAP42 is a long helical domain that is very likely to form a coiled-coil structure. To date, the Golgi complex is considered to play a crucial role in the formation of acrosomes and the chromatoid body in male germ cells. The acrosome is a specialized membrane-bound organelle located in the head of sperm cells that contains a rich store of hydrolytic enzymes and that is crucial for fertilization (41.Thorne-Tjomsland G. Clermont Y. Hermo L. Anat. Rec. 1988; 221: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Very recently, male mice bearing a null mutation of golgin-160 (male-enhanced antigen-2) were reported to be sterile due to a block of spermatogenesis, showing apparent scarcity of spermatids and spermatozoa (42.Matsukuma S. Kondo M. Yoshihara M. Matsuda M. Utakoji T. Sutou S. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although spermatogenesis in the homozygotes proceeded at least to meiotic metaphase I, deformation of condensed nuclei was evident in elongated spermatids, suggesting the important roles of Golgi-associated proteins during spermatogenesis. On the other hand, although a large number of studies have reported that NO or natriuretic peptides/cGMP pathways play an important role in the nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems of various species, information concerning the cGMP-dependent signaling pathway in germ cells is still limited. Recently, a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel was identified in mammalian sperm, and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels have been demonstrated to be directly opened by either cGMP or cAMP and are permeable to Ca2+ ions (43.Weyand I. Godde M. Frings S. Weiner J. Müller F. Altenhofen W. Hatt H. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although a rise in the cellular Ca2+ concentration has been proposed to alter sperm motility and to trigger the acrosomal reaction, the acrosomal exocytosis of spermatozoa induced by natriuretic peptides is dependent on Ca2+ influx and the protein kinase C signaling pathway, but not on the cGK signaling pathway (44.Rotem R. Zamir N. Keynan N. Barkan D. Breitbart H. Naor Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E218-E223PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several works have focused on the cAMP signaling pathway during sperm differentiation. Although studies on mice lacking the transcription factor CREM, a nuclear target of cAK, have indicated an important role for the cAMP-dependent pathway in spermatid differentiation (45.Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksén K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 46.Blendy J.A.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are co-localized in the acrosomal membrane, suggesting one functional region for the cAMP signaling pathway during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, a variety of AKAPs, including AKAP82 (49.Johnson L.R. Foster J.A. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C.S. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Dev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), have been identified in testis. The introduction of anchoring inhibitor peptides designed to disrupt the interaction of cAK with AKAPs inhibited sperm motility (53.Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). AKAP82 and AKAP84 are localized in the flagellum, suggesting that they are involved in the assembly of the fibrous sheath surrounding the axoneme and in sperm motility. Taken together with the previous immunohistochemical analysis showing the presence of cGK-I protein in rat spermatocytes (54.Spruill W.A. Koide Y. Huang H.-L. Levine S.N. Ong S.-H. Steiner A.L. Beavo J.A. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 2239-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the current study suggests that cGK-Iα might participate in germ cell development through phosphorylation of Golgi-associated proteins such as GKAP42. cGMP, which is produced in response to NO and natriuretic peptides, plays important roles in the regulation of smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation, intestinal secretion, and endochondral ossification via the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs)1 (1.Hofmann F. Dostmann W. Keilbach A. Landgraf W. Ruth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2.Pfeifer A. Aszódi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fässler R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). cGK is a member of a family of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases that also includes cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK). Previous studies have identified two forms of cGK (I and II) that are encoded by distinct genes and two different isoforms of cGK-I (designated Iα and Iβ) that are produced by alternative splicing (5.Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The regulatory compartment located in the N-terminal region of cGK-I isozymes contains the leucine zipper motif and autoinhibitory domain, followed by two cGMP-binding and catalytic domains. In addition to the structural similarity between cGK and cAK (6.Takio K. Wade R.D. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), these kinases have many overlapping consensus phosphorylation motifs. Although possible substrates for cGK are often efficiently phosphorylated by cAKin vitro, the relatively low cytosolic concentration of cGK in most cells suggests that mechanisms other than recognition of consensus phosphorylation motifs may contribute to selective cGMP-mediated protein phosphorylation in intact cells. Recent reports indicate that specific anchoring proteins located at various sites in the cell compartmentalize the kinase proteins to their sites of action and that the location of anchoring proteins provides some of the specificity of the responses mediated by each kinase (7.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 8.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). cAK is one of the best characterized protein kinases and has been shown to bind to specific anchoring proteins that are termed AKAPs (for Akinase anchoring proteins) through the regulatory subunits (9.Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10.Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A.S. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24245-24251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAK holoenzyme is a heterotetramer composed of a regulatory subunit dimer that associates with two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits of cAK releases the active catalytic subunits, enabling them to interact with and phosphorylate their substrates. Therefore, the localization of cAK near its substrates may be important for rapid phosphorylation of specific substrate in response to increases in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Similarly, when members of the protein kinase C family are activated, they undergo translocation from one intracellular compartment to another. A recent report has demonstrated that receptors for activated protein kinase C (RACK) anchor protein kinase C in the activated states and determine their subcellular localization (11.Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). For instance, RACK1, a 36-kDa protein isolated from rat brain, binds to activated protein kinase CβII and increases substrate phosphorylation by protein kinase C (12.Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence for other proteins being localized in the cell with substrates has been presented for Raf (13.Fu H. Xia K. Pallas D.C. Cui C. Conroy K. Narsimhan R.P. Mamon H. Collier R.J. Roberts T.M. Science. 1994; 266: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential functions of cGK-I isozymes and to determine the mechanism by which these functions are carried out, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate the components of the cGMP/cGK signaling pathway such as substrates and regulatory proteins of cGK. Because AKAPs have been shown to associate with the regulatory subunits of cAK in the inactive state, we used the regulatory region located in the N terminus of cGK-Iα as a bait. Here we report evidence that cGK-Iα directly interacts with and phosphorylates the novel male germ cell-specific protein GKAP42in vitro and in vivo. The interaction of cGK-Iα with GKAP42 facilitated the translocation of cGK-Iα to the Golgi complex, and cGK-Iα was released in response to intracellular cGMP accumulation. In the male germ cells, the Golgi complex is considered to be important for the formation of the acrosomic system and chromatoid body. These findings suggest that GKAP42 functions as an anchoring protein for cGK-Iα and that cGK-Iα might have functions through the interaction with Golgi-associated proteins during spermatogenesis. DISCUSSIONIn this study, a cDNA encoding a novel germ cell-specific protein was identified as a cGK-Iα-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening using the N-terminal regulatory region of cGK-Iα as a bait, and we demonstrated the physiological interaction of these two proteins in testis tissue. We also showed that GKAP42 selectively associates with cGK-Iα and that the phosphorylation of GKAP42 seems to be dependent on direct interaction with the kinase protein. Very recently, we showed that troponin T functions as an anchoring protein for cGK-I and that cGK-I may participate in the regulation of muscle contraction through phosphorylation of troponin I (14.Yuasa K. Michibata H. Omori K. Yanaka N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37429-37434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, troponin T protein does not interact with cGK-II or cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the N-terminal region of cGK-I is essential for the association with troponin T, but the interaction between cGK-I and troponin T is not substantially affected by the activation state of cGK-I. One characteristic feature of the interaction with GKAP"
https://openalex.org/W1975648598,"The endocytic trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter and the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) are regulated by insulin. We have used a chimera between the intracellular domain of IRAP and the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the transferrin receptor (vpTR) to characterize IRAP-like trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP is sufficient to target vpTR to the insulin-regulated, slow recycling pathway in adipocytes and that the dynamic retention of vpTR is dependent on a di-leucine motif. Our kinetic analysis demonstrates that vpTR recycles as a single kinetic pool and that vpTR is very efficiently sorted from endosomes to the insulin-regulated recycling pathway. An implication of these findings is that the key step in the dynamic retention of vpTR occurs within the early endosomal system. We have previously shown that vpTR is trafficked by an insulin-regulated pathway in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Johnson, A. O., Subtil, A., Petrush, R., Kobylarz, K., Keller, S., and Mc Graw, T. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17968–17977). The behavior of vpTR in Chinese hamster ovary cells is similar to its behavior in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The main difference is that insulin has a larger effect on the trafficking of vpTR in the adipocytes. We concluded that the insulin-regulated slow recycling endocytic mechanism is expressed in many different cell types and therefore is not a unique characteristic of cells that express GLUT4.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Insulin regulates glucose uptake by inducing the translocation of GLUT4, a glucose transporter isoform expressed in fat and muscle, from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane, shifting the distribution of GLUT4 from less than 10% on the surface to greater than 50% on the surface (2.Cushman S.W.

The basal state intracellular sequestration of GLUT4 and redistribution in the presence of insulin are dynamic processes determined by the rate of internalization and the rate of return to the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 10.Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 11.Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many membrane proteins continually cycle between the cell surface and endosomal compartments (for review see Ref. 12.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The transferrin receptor (TR)1 is the model receptor of choice for studies of constitutive endocytic internalization and recycling. An advantage of using the TR is that the complete endocytic cycle can be monitored using the receptor's native ligand, transferrin (Tf). Although in no single study has the trafficking of GLUT4 and TR been directly compared, two characteristics are believed to distinguish GLUT4 trafficking from the trafficking of the TR (and more aptly the general endocytic trafficking) (1.Czech M.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13.Yeh J.I. Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J.

One is the more pronounced intracellular accumulation of GLUT4 in the basal state as follows: ∼90 versus ∼70% for GLUT4 and TR, respectively. The other is the large effect that insulin has on the surface expression of GLUT4, which increases 5–10-fold, whereas surface expression of the TR increases by less than 2-fold. The greater intracellular accumulation of GLUT4 relative to TR is believed to reflect slower recycling of internal GLUT4 to the cell surface. The major effect of insulin on the distribution of GLUT4 is believed to be an increase in the recycling rate. The molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic intracellular retention of GLUT4 and the effects of insulin on recycling are not known. Most data support a mechanism in which GLUT4 is targeted to an insulin-regulated, retention compartment distinct from the general endosomal recycling system, although this compartment has not been well characterized (16.Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17.Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J.

There is evidence that both amino and carboxyl cytoplasmic domains of GLUT4 are required for insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking (7.Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8.Verhey K.J. Yeh J.I. Birnbaum M.J. J.

Those data indicate that these domains contain the information (i.e. trafficking motif) that targets GLUT4 to the specialized compartment, although the specific amino acids that comprise this motif(s) have not been identified. A type II membrane protein with aminopeptidase activity, IRAP, was identified as a major component of immunopurified GLUT4-containing vesicles (21.Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R.

In subsequent studies it was found that IRAP co-localizes with GLUT4 in fat and muscle cells and that insulin stimulates a large increase in the surface expression of IRAP (24.Martin S. Rice J.E.

Commun. 1997; 239: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IRAP is the only other protein identified that has trafficking characteristics like GLUT4. The physiologic role of IRAP is not known. To develop a reporter molecule for studies of insulin-regulated trafficking, we have created a chimera, referred to as vpTR, containing the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP and the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the human TR (29.Johnson A.O. Subtil A. Petrush R. Kobylarz K. Keller S. Mc Graw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17968-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The advantage of using vpTR as a reporter molecule is that the methods developed for studying TR trafficking can be used. We have previously shown that vpTR expressed in CHO cells is more slowly recycled than the TR and that insulin specifically induces an ∼2-fold increase in the recycling rate of the chimera (29.Johnson A.O. Subtil A. Petrush R. Kobylarz K. Keller S. Mc Graw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17968-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Those studies demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP contains information that can direct trafficking when transferred to the TR. Finding that CHO cells have a specialized, insulin-regulated trafficking mechanism was unexpected because insulin-regulated trafficking was considered a characteristic of fat and muscle cells. Here we report our findings on the analysis of the endocytic trafficking of vpTR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We find the vpTR is trafficked by a specialized insulin-regulated mechanism in these cells. For the first time we have directly measured the internalization and recycling rate constants of a protein trafficked by the insulin-regulated pathway in adipocytes. The vpTR chimera is recycled at approximately one-fifth the rate of the TR in the basal state, and insulin stimulates recycling of the chimera by ∼4-fold, whereas insulin increases recycling of the TR by only ∼1.3-fold. These data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP is sufficient for targeting a heterologous protein to the insulin-regulated pathway in adipocyte cells. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that the di-leucine sequence at position 76,77 of the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP is necessary for the slow recycling of the chimera. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that vpTR is efficiently sorted from early endosomes to the insulin-regulated recycling pathway. In the basal state vpTR is localized to a peri-centriolar compartment that only partially overlaps with the TR-containing peri-centriolar recycling compartment, indicating that the insulin-regulated recycling endosomes are distinct from general recycling endosomes. Human Tf was obtained from Sigma and further purified by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Diferric Tf and125I-Tf were prepared as described previously (30.Garippa R.J. Judge T.W. James D.E.

Tf was labeled with the fluorescent dye, Cy3 (Biological Detection Systems, Pittsburgh), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (3T3-L1 culture medium).

Two days after transfection 1 mg/ml G418 was added to the culture medium. Individual clones were isolated using cloning rings, grown in 24-well clusters and tested for expression of the transfected genes as discussed below. On the day before the experiment, a rat monoclonal antibody (antibody 220, ATCC) that specifically binds the extracellular domain of the mouse TR was added to the culture medium. This antibody does not recognize the human TR and consequently does not bind the vpTR. The amount of antibody required to reduce Tf binding by non-transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes to less than 10% of control level was determined for each batch of antibody. For most experiments a dilution of hybridoma culture medium was used as a source of 220 antibody. Identical results were observed when the antibody was purified from the conditioned medium. The antibody was also present in the medium during the experiments to ensure that the background from the endogenous mouse TR was less than 10%. To identify clonal lines, cells were plated, differentiated, the endogenous TR down-regulated, and cells incubated with iodinated Tf. Glucose uptake was measured on differentiated cells grown in 24-well plates using 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H]glucose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (31.Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were preincubated at 37 °C in air for 3.5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (med 1), to ensure that the cells were in the basal state at the beginning of the experiment. The cells were washed 3 times in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRP: 128 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmCaCl2 1.25 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaPO4 pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min in KRP with or without 1 μm insulin before adding [3H]glucose (0.2 mm final, 2.5 mCi/mmol). After further incubation for 30 min, the cells were washed and solubilized in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured. [3H]Glucose uptake was linear over the 30 min of incubation. Cells, grown on coverslip bottom dishes, were incubated in med1 with 220 antibody and 3 μg/ml Cy3-Tf for 4 h at 37 °C to achieve steady-state occupancy of the receptors. For experiments with insulin, 700 nm insulin was added for the last 15 min of the incubation. The cells were washed twice with med 2, fixed for 30 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in med 2, and labeled with a polyclonal antibody specific for the C-terminal domain of GLUT4 (a kind gift of Giulia Baldini, Columbia University). The secondary antibody was an Alexa488-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were collected with an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit and a 63 × 1.4 NA plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). 543 and 488 nm light were used used to stimulate Cy3 and Alexa 488 fluorescence, respectively. Emissions were selected with a 560-nm long pass filter for Cy3 and a 505–530-nm band pass filter for Alexa 488 and collected sequentially to prevent crossover. For each assay, cells were grown in two 6-well clusters. Cells were incubated in med 1 with 220 antibody and 3 μg/ml iodinated Tf for 4 h at 37 °C to achieve steady-state occupancy of the receptors. 1 μminsulin was added in 1 plate in the last 30 min of incubation. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed using 1 μm insulin. Identical results were obtained using 100 nm insulin. The plates were then placed on ice and washed 4 times with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (med 2), at 4 °C. The cells were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in 1 ml/well 0.15 mNaCl, 0.02 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0, followed by 5 min at 4 °C in med 2 supplemented with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf and 100 μm of the iron chelator deferroxamine. This acid/neutral wash was repeated twice. These washes remove greater than 90% of the Tf bound to the surface. The washes were pooled, and the radioactivity was measured. This value represents the Tf bound to the cell surface. The cells were solubilized, and the radioactivity was measured. This value represents the Tf in intracellular compartments. Two wells per plate were treated as the others except that a 200-fold excess of unlabeled Tf was added with the iodinated Tf. The radioactivity in the acid/neutral washes and associated with the cells represents nonspecific binding and was subtracted from the acid/neutral washes and from the cell-associated radioactivity, respectively. For each assay, cells were grown in two 6-well clusters. Cells were incubated in med 1 with 220 antibody for 4 h at 37 °C, and insulin was added to 1 plate during the last 30 min of incubation. The plates were placed on ice and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 3 μg/ml125I-Tf, washed 4 times with med 2 (4 °C), solubilized, and the radioactivity measured. Two wells per plate were treated as the others except that a 200-fold excess of unlabeled Tf was added with the iodinated Tf. The radioactivity represents nonspecific binding and was subtracted from the cell-associated radioactivity. For each assay cells were grown in four 6-well clusters. Cells were incubated for 4 h in med 1 with 220 antibody at 37 °C, and insulin was added in 3 wells per plate at the last 30 min of incubation. 3 μg/ml 125I-Tf was then added in every well, and after the indicated times of incubation at 37 °C the plates were placed on ice and washed 4 times with med 2 at 4 °C. The cells were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in 1 ml/well of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0, followed by 5 min at 4 °C in med 2 supplemented with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf and 100 μm of the iron chelator deferroxamine. This acid/neutral wash was repeated twice. These washes remove greater than 95% of the Tf bound to the surface. The washes were pooled, and the radioactivity was measured. This value represents the Tf bound to the cell surface for each time point. The cells were solubilized, and the radioactivity was measured. This value represents the Tf internalized during the incubation at 37 °C. One additional plate was treated as the others except that a 200-fold excess of unlabeled Tf was added with the iodinated Tf before incubating the plate for 5 min at 37 °C. The radioactivity in the acid/neutral washes and associated with the cells represent nonspecific binding and was subtracted from the acid/neutral washes and from the cell-associated radioactivity, respectively, for every time point. The slope of a plot of the ratio of internal Tf to surface Tfversus time is the internalization rate constant. For each assay cells were grown in two 24-well clusters. Cells were incubated in med 1 with 220 antibody and 3 μg/ml iodinated Tf for 4 h at 37 °C to achieve steady-state occupancy of the receptors. The cells were washed with med 2, incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 5.0, followed by 2 washes with med 2. Incubation in the acidic medium releases Tf bound to TR on the cell surface. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in med 1 with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf, 100 μm of the iron chelator deferroxamine (efflux medium). Insulin was added to the efflux medium in one plate. At the times indicated the medium was collected, and the cells were solubilized. The radioactivity in the medium is the Tf released from the cells during the incubation, and the cell-associated radioactivity is the Tf remaining inside cells. All data have been corrected for nonspecific binding, determined using a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Tf, which was typically less than 10% of the total. The recycling rate constant is the slope of the natural logarithm of the percent radioactivity remaining cell-associated versus time. 55Fe-Chloride was neutralized by adding 0.05 ml of 1 n NaOH to the radioactive vial (1 mCi in 0.1 ml 0.5 m Hcl), and 0.5 ml of 100 mm disodium nitrilotriacetate and 0.5 ml of 9.5 mg/ml apotransferrin in 10 mm NaHCO3, 0.25m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, were added. The solution was incubated for 1 h at room temperature before being passed over a PD-10 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. TheA 465 nm/A 280 nm of the Tf fractions was 0.0486, which corresponds to 98% Fe saturation. To measure 55Fe uptake, cells were incubated for 2 h in med 1 before adding 5 μg/ml 55Fe-Tf. After incubation for the indicated times the cells were washed 3 times in med 2 and solubilized in 0.1% SDS, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined. Data were corrected for nonspecific binding that was measured by adding a 200-fold excess of nonlabeled Tf. Adipocytes were permeabilized using a modification of a previously described procedure (32.Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells in 24-well clusters were incubated in med 1 with 3 μg/ml 125I-Tf for 4 h at 37 °C. The plates were put on ice, washed twice in cold transport buffer (140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) before adding 0.2 ml/well of 0.4 units/ml streptolysin O (Murex Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) in cold transport buffer. The plates were transferred to 37 °C for 2 min, placed on ice, and washed twice with cold transport buffer before adding 0.2 ml/well of transport buffer with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, and at the indicated times the medium was collected, and the cells were solubilized. The radioactivity in the medium is the Tf released from the cells during the incubation, and the cell-associated radioactivity is the Tf remaining inside cells. Data were analyzed as described (33.Martys J.L. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The advantage of using vpTR as a reporter molecule is that insulin-regulated trafficking can be studied with assays previously developed to study the TR (e.g. Ref. 29.Johnson A.O. Subtil A. Petrush R. Kobylarz K. Keller S. Mc Graw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17968-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To use the chimera for studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes the endogenous mouse TR, which binds human Tf with high affinity (15.Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), must be “down-regulated.” Expression of the mouse TR can be down-regulated in fibroblasts by incubating cells with a rat monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the mouse TR extracellular domain (antibody 220) (34.Davis R.J. Meisner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16041-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with this antibody reduces the amount of Tf uptake by ∼10-fold (Fig.1 A). In all experiments, unless otherwise noted, the cells were incubated overnight with 220 antibody to down-regulate endogenous mouse TR. 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with vpTR or the human TR. Clonal lines expressing the transgenes were identified by screening for125I-Tf (iodinated-Tf) uptake following down-regulation of the mouse TR (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of cells with the antibody does not affect expression of vpTR because the chimera contains the human TR ectodomain, and the 220 antibody does not bind these sequences. Clones expressing the constructs to levels similar to the endogenous mouse TR were chosen for further studies. The vpTR55 cell line, based on anti-IRAP Western blot analysis of total cell extracts, expresses the chimera at a level similar to the endogenous IRAP, and the highest expressing line examined (vpTR85) expresses the chimera at ∼2-fold the level of endogenous IRAP (not shown). We found no differences between the trafficking of the endogenous mouse TR (analyzed in non-transfected, non-down-regulated 3T3-L1 cells) and the human TR expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (not shown), indicating that the down-regulation protocol does not affect general endocytic trafficking. The effect of insulin on glucose uptake was examined in clonal lines differentiated into adipocytes (Fig. 1 B). Insulin induced a large increase in glucose uptake, a response similar to that in non-transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although there is some clone-to-clone variation in response, this variation does not correlate with the level of expression of the chimera, and most likely reflects clonal variation unrelated to expression of vpTR. These data indicate that the insulin recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is not affected by the expression of vpTR. Importantly, incubation with the 220 antibody does not affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Fig.1 B), documenting that the down-regulation protocol does not affect insulin-regulated trafficking. To determine whether vpTR expression on the surface was regulated by insulin, cells were mock-treated or incubated with insulin for 30 min at 37 °C, and the binding of iodinated Tf to cells at 4 °C was determined. Insulin induced a 2–4-fold increase in surface expression of vpTR and only a 1.3-fold increase in surface expression of the TR (Fig. 2 A). Since TR is a marker for general endocytic recycling, these data demonstrate that the surface expression of vpTR is specifically regulated by insulin. Although the extent of translocation of vpTR varied among clones, in each case the effect of insulin on the surface expression of vpTR was significantly greater than the effect of insulin on the surface expressing the TR. The increased amount of vpTR on the surface could be due to a redistribution of a cycling pool of vpTR or to the recruitment of a storage pool (not in equilibrium with the cell surface in the basal state). To distinguish between these possibilities the total cycling pool of vpTR was measured in the presence and absence of insulin. If insulin recruits a storage pool of vpTR to the surface, then the total amount of vpTR accessible to binding Tf in the medium will be larger than in the basal conditions. If insulin stimulates a redistribution of a single vpTR cycling pool, then insulin will have no effect on the total cycling pool. Cells were incubated with iodinated Tf at 37 °C in the absence or presence of insulin, and the total cell-associated radioactivity as a function of time was determined (Fig.2 B). Tf rapidly binds to vpTR on the cell surface, and the cell-associated iodinated Tf increases over time until all the cycling vpTRs are occupied. The time-dependent increase in cell-associated Tf reflects the recycling of intracellular vpTRs, which are unoccupied with iodinated Tf, to the surface (35.Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The observation that the total amount of Tf cell-associated at steady state (i.e. plateau level) is the same for both the insulin and basal conditions demonstrates that in the basal state vpTR continually cycles between the surface and intracellular compartments, and therefore the increase in vpTR on the cell surface is a redistribution of the chimera. In the basal state, total cell-associated Tf plateaus at ∼3 h, when steady-state occupancy of vpTR was reached. In the presence of insulin, Tf accumulated faster, reaching the plateau level by ∼90 min. These data indicate that one effect of insulin is to increase the recycling of vpTR back to the plasma membrane"

They are biosynthesized by a special class of large, multifunctional enzyme called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS).1 NRPSs are organized into domains, each of which is ∼600 amino acids in length and is responsible for the activation by aminoacylation and thioesterification of one constituent amino acid. NRPSs containing 1 to more than 11 domains are known. Some NRPS domains also catalyze amino acid modifications such as α-carbon epimerization/racemization and N-methylation (1.De Crécy-Lagard V.

The filamentous fungus Cochliobolus carbonum (anamorphHelminthosporium carbonum or Bipolaris zeicola) synthesizes the cyclic tetrapeptide HC-toxin, the major form (HC-toxin I) of which has the structure cyclo(d-Pro-l-Ala-d-Ala-l-Aeo), where Aeo stands for 2-amino-9,10-epoxi-8-oxo-decanoic acid (4.Walton J.D.

HC-toxin is an essential determinant of virulence and specificity in the pathogenic interaction betweenC. carbonum and its host, maize (Zea mays L.). Resistance to the fungus and insensitivity to HC-toxin are conditioned by the maize Hm1 gene, which encodes an enzyme, HC-toxin reductase, that specifically detoxifies HC-toxin by reducing the 8-carbonyl group of the Aeo side chain (10.Meeley R.B.

The central enzyme in HC-toxin synthesis is HC-toxin synthetase (HTS), a 570-kDa NRPS with four amino acid-activating domains (17.Panaccione D.G. Scott-Craig J.S. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18.Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other NRPSs, HTS activates its substrate amino acids (l-Pro, l-Ala, and d-Ala, but notd-Pro) by aminoacylation and thioesterification (19.Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8444-8447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified HTS was also reported to racemize l-Pro and l-Ala to the corresponding d-amino acids (20.Walton J.D. Holden F.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1988; 1: 128-134Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the amino acid sequence of HTS deduced from the DNA sequence of its encoding gene, HTS1, revealed the presence of a motif in domain A of HTS that was a candidate to be an epimerization “signature” for NRPS domains. This motif, (S/A)RTXGWFT(T/S), was exclusively present in other known epimerizing NRPS domains, which at that time included only the single-domain enzymes gramicidin synthetase I and tyrocidine synthetase I and domain C of aminoadipyl-cysteinyl-valinyl (ACV) synthetase, a three-domain NRPS (18.Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this epimerase motif is present only once in HTS, in domain A, whereas the ability of partially purified HTS to epimerizel-Ala as well as l-Pro (20.Walton J.D. Holden F.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1988; 1: 128-134Crossref Google Scholar) would appear to require that there be another copy of the motif in domain C. Epimerization domains from many additional NRPSs have now been sequenced, and exhaustive alignment analyses indicate that there are definitely characteristic signature motifs (e.g.[I/V]HHLVVDXVSW) in all such domains. Clearly, HTS has only one epimerase motif, in l-Pro-activating domain A (1.De Crécy-Lagard V. Marlière P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3.Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the d-Ala of HC-toxin could not be made by HTS itself. The fact that HTS uses d-Ala (but notd-Pro) as a substrate in the ATP/PPi exchange assay suggested that the d-Ala in HC-toxin might be synthesized by a different enzyme. The original report that HTS could epimerize l-Ala could have been due to partial co-purification of this unknown enzyme with HTS (20.Walton J.D. Holden F.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1988; 1: 128-134Crossref Google Scholar). Cyclosporin is an undecapeptide containing d-Ala. Analysis of the primary sequence of its NRPS, cyclosporin synthetase, indicated that it, like HTS, also lacks an epimerization signature motif in itsd-Ala-activating domain (domain A) (1.De Crécy-Lagard V. Marlière P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J.

Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In this case, the producing fungus Tolypocladium niveum(Tolypocladium inflatum) has an alanine racemase that converts l-Ala to d-Ala for incorporation into cyclosporin by cyclosporin synthetase (22.Hoffmann K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that C. carbonum also has an alanine racemase to produced-Ala. HC-toxin production is controlled by a complex Mendelian locus,TOX2, in C. carbonum (23.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 887-897PubMed Google Scholar). All of the known genes comprising TOX2 (which, to date, include HTS1,TOXA, TOXC, TOXE, and TOXF) are present only in HC-toxin-producing (Tox2+) isolates, and, with one exception in some isolates, are all physically linked within a ∼600 kb region. However, the TOX2 genes are not tightly clustered; for example, the two copies of HTS1 are separated by ∼300 kb (23.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 887-897PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). Using a bacterial artificial chromosome library to find new genes involved in HC-toxin biosynthesis, we recently describedTOXF, which encodes a putative branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immediately adjacent to TOXFwas another gene, now called TOXG. This study describes the characterization of TOXG and biochemical and genetic evidence that it encodes an alanine racemase involved in HC-toxin biosynthesis. SB111 (ATCC 90305) and SB114 are standard Tox2+ (toxin-producing) and Tox2− (non-toxin-producing) laboratory strains of C. carbonum, and 164R10 is a Tox2+ progeny of a cross between them (24.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fungal growth conditions have been described previously (27.Van Hoof A. Leykam J. Schaefer H.J. Walton J.D. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 259-267Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). C. carbonum DNA and RNA isolation was described previously (28.Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). DNA and RNA blotting, probe labeling, hybridization, cDNA and genomic library screening, and DNA subcloning were done following standard procedures (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the MSU Macromolecular Facility. Automated DNA sequencing was done at the Yale University Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory and at the MSU DNA Sequencing Facility. Sequences were assembled and analyzed with the DNAStar Software package (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). Protein sequence alignments were generated with the ClustalW Program (30.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55405) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site of TOXG was determined by 5′ random amplification of cDNA ends using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. (31.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar). The primer for reverse transcription (GSP1) was 5′-CGATTCATTTTAGGGTGTGCCAGAT-3′, and the nested primer for polymerase chain reaction amplification (GSP2) was 5′-TGTTTCGACTAACCGGTAGCAGGG-3′. Escherichia coli strain TKL10 (dadX alr-ts, CGSC #5466) (32.Wijsman H.J. Genet. Res. 1972; 20: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was obtained from theE. coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University and maintained in LB medium supplemented with 200 μg/mld-Ala. The TOXG expression vector pARE was constructed by releasing a 1.2-kb fragment of the coding region ofTOXG (lacking 14 amino acids at the 5′-end of the open reading frame) from pGC1, which contains a full-length cDNA copy ofTOXG, by digestion with BamHI and KpnI and subcloning into pQE31 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The sequence of pARE was verified and then transformed into TKL10 by electroporation (2.5 kV, 25 microfarads, 200 Ω, 0.1 cm cuvette) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 42 °C. Two independent transformants were designated TKL10T1 and TKL10T2. To assay alanine racemase in transformed E. coli, the cells were grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 12 h and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μm pyridoxal phosphate) and incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min. The cells were then broken by sonication and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Alanine racemase was assayed in the supernatant (22.Hoffmann K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary reaction contained 50 mm Tris (pH 8.7), 50 mml-alanine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm pyridoxal phosphate, and an appropriate amount of protein extract (typically 10 μg) in a total volume of 1 ml. After incubation for 1–4 h at 42 °C, the reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and 500 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Five hundred μl of secondary reaction mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 0.5 unit ofd-amino acid oxidase (Sigma), 25 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 2 mm UDP-galactose, and 0.2 mm NADH) was added to the primary reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The decrease of absorbance at 340 nm compared with a blank (boiled enzyme) reaction was used to calculate the relative racemase activity. Fungal protoplast preparation, transformation, selection, and single-spore isolation of transformants were performed as described previously (17.Panaccione D.G. Scott-Craig J.S. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28.Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Most strains of C. carbonum contain three copies ofTOXG. Strain 164R10, which is Tox2+, contains two copies and was used for the mutation studies (24.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The two copies were sequentially mutated, the first by gene replacement mediated by double-crossover homologous recombination, and the second by gene disruption mediated by single-crossover homologous integration. To make the replacement vector pTOXGR1, a genomic clone ofTOXG (from plasmid pAATG1) was trimmed with EcoRV and HpaI to eliminate the TOXF coding region and re-ligated to make the intermediate construct pARM2. A 420-bpApaI/PstI fragment (containing the 3′-end of theTOXG cDNA) from pGC1 was subcloned into theBamHI/PstI sites of pARM2 to make another intermediate construct, pARM3. The 512-bp internalSphI/PstI fragment (corresponding to +362 to +874 bp in the genomic sequence) of pARM3 was replaced by a hygromycin resistance cassette (composed of the E. coli hph gene encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase driven by the Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter from plasmid pCB1003; Ref. 33.Carroll A.M. Sweigard J.A. Valent B. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1994; 41: 22Google Scholar) to make the final replacement vector pTOXGR1 (5.9 kb). The fragment (2.5 kb) containing the hph cassette plus flanking TOXGDNA was released from pTOXGR1 by digestion with NotI andHindIII and used for transformation. To make the disruption vector pTOXGD1, an 8-bp BamHI linker was inserted into the unique SacI site of pARM3 to make pARM4. The central part of the coding region from pARM4 (a 512-bpSphI/PstI fragment plus an 8-bp linker) was then subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pBC-phleo vector (Cayla, Toulouse, France), which contains the A. nidulans ZEO gene cassette for phleomycin resistance, to obtain the final construct pTOXGD1 (6.6 kb). Vector pTOXGD1 was linearized with BamHI before transformation. Strain 164R10 was first transformed with the 2.5-kb fragment from pTOXGR1. Strain T697 with one copy of TOXG replaced with thehph cassette was selected in medium containing 120 μg/ml hygromycin. Strain T697 was subsequently transformed with linearized pTOXGD1. Strain T698 with the second copy of TOXG disrupted was selected in medium containing 50 μg/ml phleomycin. HC-toxin was extracted from culture filtrates with chloroform and analyzed by TLC on Si250-PA plates (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ). The solvent system was acetone:dichloromethane (1:1 by volume). HC-toxin was detected using an epoxide-specific reagent. The plates were sprayed with 2% (w/v)p-nitrobenzylpyridine in acetone, heated for 10 min at 110 °C, and sprayed again with 10% (w/v) tetraethylenepentamine in acetone (10.Meeley R.B. Walton J.D. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34.Hammock L.G. Hammock B.D. Casida J.E. Bull. Environ. Contamin. Toxicol. 1974; 12: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry, the locations on the TLC plate of compounds of interest were identified by comparison to plates run in parallel that had been sprayed with the epoxide detection reagent, scraped from the TLC plate, suspended in ethanol, and centrifuged briefly. The supernatant was dried under vacuum and redissolved in glycerol-HCl solution for fast atom bombardment mass spectrometric analysis by the MSU-NIH Mass Spectrometry Facility. Fungal pathogenicity was assayed on maize inbred Pr (genotypehm1/hm1) by spraying with conidia (17.Panaccione D.G. Scott-Craig J.S. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28.Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Infected maize leaves were photographed every day from day 2 through day 6 after inoculation. Modified Fries' liquid medium containing 2% (w/v) sucrose (27.Van Hoof A. Leykam J. Schaefer H.J. Walton J.D. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1991; 39: 259-267Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was inoculated with conidia of C. carbonum and grown at room temperature (25 °C) in still culture for 3 days before the addition of d-Ala to a final concentration of 1, 10, 25, or 50 mm. Cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 12 days before collecting the culture filtrates for HC-toxin analysis by TLC. We previously reported the cloning of TOXF on the basis of its physical linkage to knownTOX2 genes (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Within a 2.9-kbPstI/PstI genomic DNA fragment (cloned in pAATG1) containing TOXF, we detected a partial open reading frame that started immediately in the 5′ direction of TOXF and was transcribed in the opposite orientation (Fig.1). A 1.1-kbPstI/HpaI fragment from pAATG1 was used as a probe to obtain a full-length cDNA clone (pGC1) of the corresponding gene, called TOXG. The insert of pGC1 was used as a probe to obtain the 3′-end of a genomic copy of TOXG(pGG2). The inserts of plasmids pGC1 and pGG2 were sequenced on both strands (Fig. 2). TOXG has one intron of 52 bp. The transcriptional start site is at −46 bp. The distances between the transcriptional and translational start sites ofTOXF and TOXG are 195 and 299 bp, respectively.TOXG encodes a predicted protein (ToxGp) of 389 amino acids with a calculated M r of 42,700 and a pI of 6.5. ToxGp contains no predicted signal peptide or glycosylation sites (Fig.2). The sequence of ToxGp showed strong similarity to threonine aldolases from many species (e.g. Gly1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GenBank P30831) and to a sequence (the product ofcssB) in the patent data base (GenBank A40406) annotated as encoding alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1) from the cyclosporin-producing fungus T. niveum (35.Kocher, H. P., Schneider-Scherzer, E., Schörgendorfer, K., and Weber, G. (1994) European Patent WO9425606Google Scholar). The sequence of ToxGp is 42% identical overall to the product of cssB and 32% identical to Gly1p. The identity is spread throughout the proteins, with no bias toward any region. Two lysine residues, which are candidates to be the pyridoxal phosphate binding site and are also present in the same relative locations in the product of cssB and in Gly1p, were identified at positions 220 and 235 in ToxGp (Fig. 2) (36.Liu J.-Q. Dairi T. Kataoka M. Shimizu S. Yamada H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Monschau N. Stahmann K.P. Sahm H. McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TOXG was present in three copies in all Tox2+ C. carbonum isolates tested except 164R10, which had two copies, and was completely absent in all Tox2− strains (data not shown). Like TOXF, TOXG mRNA expression was dependent on the regulatory gene TOXE (Fig.3). TOXE encodes a protein containing a bZIP DNA binding domain at its N terminus and four ankyrin repeats at its C terminus (25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). TOXE is also required for expression of TOXA, TOXC, and TOXD(25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). Recent unpublished results from this laboratory 2K. F. Pedley and J. D. Walton, unpublished results. indicate that ToxEp is a transcription factor that binds to specific consensus sequences in the promoters of the genes that it regulates. To test the putative function of ToxGp as an alanine racemase, we constructed a TOXGexpression vector, pARE, and transformed it into bacterial strain TKL10, which is defective in d-Ala biosynthesis and therefore requires exogenous d-Ala for survival (32.Wijsman H.J. Genet. Res. 1972; 20: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two random transformants, TKL10T1 and TKL10T2, were selected from a LB plate containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 42 °C. The transformants survived without d-Ala supplementation (Fig.4). The alanine racemase activity in cell-free extracts of TKL10T1 and TKL10T2 was 2- to 3-fold above background. These experiments indicated that TOXG encodes a functional alanine racemase. To investigate the role of TOXG in HC-toxin biosynthesis, both copies of TOXG in isolate 164R10 were mutated by transformation-mediated gene replacement or disruption. Homologous integration of the plasmid constructs into strains T697 (one copy disrupted) and T698 (both copies disrupted) was confirmed by Southern analysis (Fig. 5). The 5.2-kbXbaI band, corresponding to copy 1 of TOXG, was gone in both T697 and T698, as predicted for gene replacement (Fig.5 A). Subsequent transformation and homologous integration of pTOXGD1 into the 4.8-kb XbaI band (corresponding to copy 2 of TOXG) in strain T697 resulted in the disappearance of this band and the appearance of a new band of 18.0 kb, as seen in strain T698 (Fig. 5 A). This was predicted for homologous tandem integration of two copies of pTOXGD1 (17.Panaccione D.G. Scott-Craig J.S. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When the same blot was re-probed with the full-length cDNA clone pGC1, a 6.1-kb band hybridized in both T697 and T698, as predicted for the gene replacement event (Fig. 5 B). The putative toxG mutant was tested by RNA blotting. BecauseTOXF and TOXG are tightly clustered,TOXF was included in the analysis to be sure that mutation of one gene did not affect the expression of the other. Total RNA from 164R10 (wild type), the toxF null mutant D/R (renamed T696; Ref. 26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the toxG null mutant T698 was analyzed on three identical blots by probing with TOXF, TOXG, or GPD1 (encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a RNA loading control). The results indicated that thetoxF and toxG mutants had no detectableTOXF or TOXG mRNA, respectively, and that disruption of one gene did not influence the expression of the other (Fig. 6). Both the single (T697) and null (T698) toxG mutants showed normal growth and development on agar plates and in liquid culture. Along with its complete absence from Tox2− isolates ofC. carbonum, this indicated that TOXG has no essential housekeeping function. HC-toxin was extracted from culture filtrates of the wild type and T698 mutant grown with or without d-Ala supplementation (Fig.7). Some wild type isolates of Tox2+ C. carbonum produce four forms of HC-toxin that can be detected on TLC plates using an epoxide-specific reagent (8.Rasmussen J.B. Scheffer R.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1988; 86: 187-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three minor forms (HC-toxin II, III, and IV) contain Gly in place of d-Ala, d-trans-3-hydroxyPro in place of d-Pro, and 8-hydroxy-Aeo in place of Aeo, respectively. HC-toxin forms I, II, and III are active at 0.2, 0.4, and 2.0 μg/ml, respectively, whereas form IV is active only at ∼20 μg/ml (6.Kim S.-D. Knoche H.W. Dunkle L.D. McCrery D.A. Tomer K.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 969-972Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7.Rasmussen J.B. Host-selective Toxins from Helminthosporium carbonum: Purification, Chemistry, Biological Activities, and Effect on Chlorophyll Synthesis in Maize Ph.D. thesis.

Rasmussen J.B. Heterocycles. 1986; 24: 3423-3431Crossref Google Scholar). The C. carbonum wild type isolate 164R10 produced HC-toxin forms I, II, and IV but undetectable levels of the most polar minor form, HC-toxin III. The apparent absence of HC-toxin III probably reflects natural variation among isolates of C. carbonum. The toxG null strain T698 did not produce forms I or IV but still produced form II (Fig. 7). Form II differs from the others in having Gly in place of d-Ala (6.Kim S.-D. Knoche H.W. Dunkle L.D. McCrery D.A. Tomer K.B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 969-972Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The identities of HC-toxin II and IV were confirmed by mass spectrometry of samples scraped from the TLC plates. HC-toxin II had an experimental MH+ mass of 423.35 (theoretical for C20H30N4O6:422.2165), and HC-toxin IV had an experimental MH+ mass of 439.39 (theoretical for C21H34N4O6:438.2478). When T698 was grown in medium supplemented with d-Ala, production of HC-toxins I and IV was restored (Fig. 7). Higherd-Ala concentrations resulted in higher levels of thed-Ala-containing forms of HC-toxin (Fig. 7). These results indicate that TOXG has a specific role in the production of forms of HC-toxin that contain d-Ala. To test the affect of thetoxG mutation on virulence, conidia of C. carbonum wild type 164R10, single toxG mutant T697, and null toxG mutant T698 were spray-inoculated onto leaves of susceptible maize. On plants inoculated with the wild type, lesions became visible in 2 days, and after 6 days, the entire infected leaf was totally brown and dessicated (Fig.8). Mutation of one copy ofTOXG had no apparent affect on virulence (Fig. 8). However, mutation of both copies of TOXG slowed disease development. A large percentage of the infections initiated by T698 failed to develop into full lesions, and the lesions that did develop were consistently smaller than those caused by the wild type up to the first 6 days of disease development (Fig. 8). At day 8, the toxGmutant caused dessication and death of the leaf (data not shown). The modest decrease in virulence of the toxG mutant is in contrast to the results seen with mutants of other TOX2genes, such as HTS1, TOXC, TOXE, andTOXF, which are completely avirulent (17.Panaccione D.G. Scott-Craig J.S. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6590-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for this is that HC-toxin II, which is still made by the toxG mutant, is sufficient for almost full virulence. Many non-ribosomally synthesized peptides containd-amino acids. Here we present evidence thatd-Ala in the cyclic peptide HC-toxin is synthesized from the primary metabolite l-Ala by an alanine racemase encoded by TOXG. Like the other genes of the TOX2 locus,TOXG is specifically dedicated to HC-toxin biosynthesis because mutants of TOXG have no phenotype other than a failure to produce forms of HC-toxin that contain d-Ala. Furthermore, TOXG is clustered with another gene dedicated to HC-toxin production, TOXF, which itself was discovered by being within ∼70 kb of other genes previously shown to be required for HC-toxin synthesis (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mapping studies have shown that in isolate SB111, all copies of all of the TOX2 genes, including all three copies of TOXF/TOXG, are distributed over ∼600 kb on the same chromosome, except for one copy ofTOXE (23.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 887-897PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar).2 Hoffmann et al. (22.Hoffmann K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Kleinkauf H. Zocher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the purification and characterization of an alanine racemase involved in cyclosporin biosynthesis by the fungus T. niveum. The encoding gene (cssB) was isolated on the basis of peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein (35.Kocher, H. P., Schneider-Scherzer, E., Schörgendorfer, K., and Weber, G. (1994) European Patent WO9425606Google Scholar). ToxGp and the product ofcssB share significant similarity (42% overall amino acid identity). The involvement of specific alanine racemases in eukaryotic non-ribosomal peptide synthesis is therefore not an isolated occurrence. TOXG and cssB are unrelated at the primary amino acid level to any known bacterial alanine racemase (36.Liu J.-Q. Dairi T. Kataoka M. Shimizu S. Yamada H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3555-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Monschau N. Stahmann K.P. Sahm H. McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38.Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 39.Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, TOXG could complement ad-Ala-deficient mutant of E. coli. In addition to amino acid polymerization and peptide cyclization, some multifunctional NRPSs catalyze α-carbon epimerization. For example, gramicidin synthetase I and tyrocidine synthetase I, both of which are single-domain NRPSs, epimerize l-Phe to d-Phe by a mechanism involving pantothenic acid as co-factor and not, like known amino acid racemases, pyridoxal phosphate (40.Stein T. Kluge B. Vater J. Franke P. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4633-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, at least one other NRPS domain, domain A of cyclosporin synthetase, does not catalyze epimerization and relies instead on a separate enzyme to supply the required d-amino acid. HTS is the only known example of a NRPS that uses both types of epimerization mechanisms. Thed-Pro of HC-toxin is produced directly by the first domain of HTS (18.Scott-Craig J.S. Panaccione D.G. Pocard J.-A. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26044-26049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Walton J.D. Holden F.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1988; 1: 128-134Crossref Google Scholar), whereas the d-Ala of HC-toxin is synthesized by a separate protein, ToxGp, and is then activated and incorporated into HC-toxin by the third domain of HTS. HC-toxin biosynthesis differs from other non-ribosomal peptides in using two mechanisms to produce the necessary d-amino acids. The organization of the HC-toxin biosynthetic genes is also unusual compared with other fungal secondary metabolites. Genes controlling biosynthesis of fungal secondary metabolites such as penicillins in Penicillium, aflatoxin/sterigmatocystin inAspergillus, trichothecenes in Fusarium, and gibberellins in Gibberella are highly clustered (41.Brown D.W., Yu, J.-H. Kelkar H.S. Fernandes M. Nesbit T.C. Keller N.P. Adams T.H. Leonard T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 42.Trapp S.C. Hohn T.M.

In contrast, although some of the genes involved in HC-toxin biosynthesis (i.e. HTS1 with TOXA andTOXF with TOXG) are clustered (defined as being within ∼3 kb of each other) (Refs. 26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 28.Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar; this study), the other genes of HC-toxin biosynthesis are only loosely physically linked over ∼600 kb (23.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 887-897PubMed Google Scholar). The HC-toxin genes are also unusual in being present in multiple functional copies in all Tox2+ isolates that have been tested, with the exception of some laboratory-generated strains such as 164R10 and 243-7 (25.Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 462-469PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their being only loosely physically linked, there is little or no crossing over, even between the TOX2 genes that are more than 280 kb apart (28.Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This explains why the trait of HC-toxin biosynthesis appears to segregate as a single Mendelian locus, TOX2 (5.Walton J.D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1723-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 45.Scheffer R.P. Nelson R.R. Ullstrup A.J. Phytopathology. 1967; 57: 1288-1289Google Scholar). TOXG is tightly clustered with TOXF, which is also specifically dedicated to HC-toxin biosynthesis (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).TOXF is predicted to encode a BCAT, whose substrates arel-amino acids. Although the overall amino acid similarity is low between known BCATs and ToxFp, all of the nine essential active site residues are present (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ToxFp is responsible for aminating a precursor of Aeo (e.g.2-oxodecanoic acid). BCATs are structurally related tod-amino acid aminotransferases (44.Yu J. Chang P.-K. Cary J.W. Wright M. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Payne G.A. Linz J.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2365-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is intriguing in light of the fact that TOXG encodes an enzyme that makes d-Ala. Insofar as clustered genes might encode enzymes that act in concert, this raises the possibility that ToxF is ad-amino acid aminotransferase rather than a BCAT. However, if d-Ala, produced by ToxGp, is the essential substrate for ToxFp, which in turn is essential for the production of Aeo, then mutation of ToxGp would be expected to eliminate Aeo synthesis and hence all forms of HC-toxin, not just those that containd-Ala. Therefore, it seems unlikely that d-Ala is the amino donor substrate for ToxFp, and the reaction catalyzed by this protein remains to be established (26.Cheng Y.-Q. Ahn J.-H. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

We mutated the 13 non-cysteine residues in CTx PnIB, expressed α7/5-hydroxytryptamine-3 homomeric receptors in 293 HEK cells, and measured binding of each mutant toxin to the expressed receptors by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding. The results reveal that residues Ser-4, Leu-5, Pro-6, Pro-7, Ala-9, and Leu-10 endow CTx PnIB with affinity for α7/5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptors; side chains of these residues cluster in a localized region within the three-dimensional structure of CTx PnIB. We next mutated key residues in the seven loops of α7 that converge at subunit interfaces to form the agonist binding site.

To identify pairwise interactions that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex, we measured binding of receptor and toxin mutations and analyzed the results by double mutant cycles. The results reveal a single dominant interaction between Leu-10 of CTx PnIB and Trp-149 of α7 that anchors the toxin to the binding site. We also find weaker interactions between Pro-6 of CTx PnIB and Trp-149 and between both Pro-6 and Pro-7 and Tyr-93 of α7.

Previous work probed the binding site of the α7 AChR with α-conotoxin ImI (CTx ImI) and identified pairwise interactions that stabilize the toxin-receptor complex (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we further probe the binding site of the α7 AChR with α-conotoxin PnIB, a neuronal-specific toxin structurally divergent from CTx ImI, with the aim of uncovering novel pairwise interactions at the binding site. We mutate both the receptor and the toxin and use double mutant cycle analysis to identify pairs of residues that stabilize the conotoxin-receptor complex.α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptides that competitively antagonize muscle and neuronal nicotinic AChRs (4.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). All α-conotoxins have a conformationally constrained two-loop structure formed by two disulfide bridges. However, the various α-conotoxins differ by the number and type of residues in each loop, allowing specific targeting to different receptor subtypes. For example, the neuronal-specific conotoxins CTx PnIB and MII contain four residues in the first loop and seven in the second, whereas the muscle-specific conotoxins MI and GI contain three residues in the first loop and five in the second (Fig.1). Furthermore the α7-specific toxin CTx ImI differs from either of these classes containing four residues in the first loop and three in the second. Residue side chains also range widely from small to polar, hydrophobic, charged, and aromatic. Thus, diversity of backbone structure and residue composition makes α-conotoxins excellent probes of different receptor subtypes.Mutagenesis and site-directed labeling studies establish that the ligand binding sites of the AChR are formed at interfaces between subunits (6.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar, 7.Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas binding sites of muscle AChRs are formed at interfaces between α1 and δ, ε, or γ subunits, binding sites of α7 neuronal AChRs are formed at interfaces between identical α7 subunits. Residues of the α face of the binding site, termed the (+) face, cluster in three well separated regions of the primary sequence, termed loops A, B, and C (6.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar). Using the numbering system for human α7receptors, residues key to AChR function in these loops include Tyr-93 in loop A, Trp-149 in loop B, and Tyr-188 and Tyr-195 in loop C. Similarly, residues of the non-α face of the binding site, termed the (−) face, cluster in four separate regions of the primary sequence, termed loops I through IV. Residues key to AChR function in these loops include Ser-34 in loop I, Trp-55 in loop II, Gln-117 in loop III, and Asp-164 in loop IV. The convergence of these seven loops to form a localized binding site has led to a multiloop model of the major extracellular domain of the AChR (7.Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Binding site specificity of α-conotoxins should ultimately be traceable to differences in residues supplied by either the receptor or the conotoxin that form the complex. For example, α-conotoxins MI and GI bind with high affinity to muscle but not neuronal AChRs, presumably owing to differences in residues on both the (+) and (−) faces of the binding sites between the two classes of receptors (8.Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-conotoxins MI and GI select between binding sites of the muscle AChR owing to differences in residues supplied by the γ, ε, or δ subunits to the (−) face of the binding sites (2.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent work mutated both the receptor and conotoxin and identified pairwise interactions that stabilize the complex formed by α7 receptors and CTx ImI (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The primary anchor of the complex comprises a positively charged arginine supplied by the N-terminal loop of CTx ImI that interacts with a conserved tyrosine at position 195 of the (+) face of the binding site. The present study was motivated by the substantial differences between CTx PnIB and CTx ImI (Fig. 1), with the aims of establishing orientation of CTx PnIB in the α7 binding site and uncovering novel pairwise interactions that stabilize the complex.By mutating residues in both α7 and CTx PnIB, the present work delineates pairwise interactions that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex. We find that CTx PnIB interacts with the (+) face of the α7 binding site through hydrophobic side chains from both its N- and C-terminal loops. Moreover, the key side chains in CTx PnIB form a localized hydrophobic patch in its three-dimensional structure, which interacts with a cluster of conserved aromatic residues on the (+) face of the α7binding site.DISCUSSIONThe present work defines the essential hydrophobic nature of the interaction between CTx PnIB and the neuronal α7 receptor and places into close proximity aromatic residues in two of the three loops of the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The key bioactive residues in CTx PnIB run the length of a helix to form a hydrophobic spiral at one end of the compact three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3). The leucine side chain at position 10 protrudes from one end of the spiral to interact strongly with Trp-149 in loop B of the (+) face of the binding site. Side chains of Pro-6 and Pro-7 protrude one turn above Leu-10 to interact with Tyr-93 in loop A of the (+) face, as well as with Trp-149. The turn above Pro-6 and Pro-7 comprises side chains of the bioactive residues Leu-5 and Ser-4, which however, show no coupling with key residues on either the (+) or (−) faces of the binding site. The overall results reveal multiple pairwise interactions between a cluster of hydrophobic residues in CTx PnIB and aromatic residues at the (+) face of the α7 binding site.Both strong and weak hydrophobic interactions stabilize CTx PnIB in the α7 binding site. The hydrophobic spiral in CTx PnIB comprises leucine side chains at positions 5 and 10, together with proline side chains at positions 6 and 7. Three of these four side chains interact with aromatic side chains on the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The stabilization likely owes to exclusion of water from both the hydrophobic and aromatic surfaces, as well as to hand-in-glove complementarity between the surfaces of the toxin and binding site that maximizes van der Waal's contacts. The observed coupling coefficients suggest that the indole ring of Trp-149 packs into the groove bounded by Pro-6, Pro-7, and Leu-10, whereas the phenol side chain of Tyr-93 enters the same groove but from the opposite side. Finally, the phenol side chain of Tyr-151 packs on the external side of this groove, bounding the exposed length of Leu-10. The overall results place into close proximity the aromatic side chains Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 found on the (+) face of the α7 binding site.The CTx PnIB-α7 complex contrasts with the previously described CTx ImI-α7 complex (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in both the chemical nature of the interaction and the points of contact in the α7 binding site. The CTx ImI-α7 complex is anchored by an aromatic-quaternary interaction between arginine at position 7 of CTx ImI and tyrosine at position 195 of the (+) face of α7. Also, tryptophan at position 10 of CTx ImI interacts with multiple residues on the (−) face of the α7 binding site. The present results detect no interaction between residues in CTx PnIB and Tyr-195 of α7 nor between CTx PnIB and the (−) face of the binding site. The very different interactions of CTx ImI and CTx PnIB suggest that the various α-conotoxins evolved to target different microdomains within the AChR binding site.Although we only detect interaction between CTx PnIB and the (+) face of the binding site, we cannot exclude possible interactions with residues on the (−) face. We find significant contributions to CTx PnIB affinity of Ser-34 in loop I of the (−) face of the site, with the mutation S34K increasing affinity by about an order of magnitude. Also, pairwise interactions remain to be discovered for the bioactive residues Ser-4 and Leu-5 in CTx PnIB. Thus the possibility remains that residues not yet discovered on the (−) face interact with Ser-4 or Leu-5. Because residues at the (+) face of the binding site are conserved across AChR subtypes, selectivity of the various α-conotoxins for different AChR subtypes likely owes to different contributions of the (−) face.The large coupling coefficient between α7Trp-149 and Leu-10 of CTx PnIB does not by itself ensure that the two residues interact directly. However, the absence of other strong pairwise interactions for Leu-10 or Trp-149 strongly suggests that the interaction is direct. For example, if Trp-149 interacted with a second residue in α7 that in turn contacted Leu-10, mutating that second residue should both weaken CTx PnIB binding and show strong coupling to Leu-10. Our systematic mutagenesis shows no strong coupling of Leu-10 to other key residues of either the (+) or the (−) face of the α7 binding site, even though CTx PnIB binding is very sensitive to mutation of these key residues.Similarly without atomic structures of the mutant conotoxins, global conformational changes are difficult to distinguish from local changes at the site of mutation. For example, suppose hydroxyproline mutations at positions 6 or 7 distorted the peptide structure so the primary anchor, leucine at position 10, moved out of alignment with its counterpart in the receptor. Hydroxyproline retains the original restricted rotation about the N-Cα bond, but its hydroxyl group may increase hydration locally. However, we made a chemically similar mutation, A9S, which is even closer to the active residue Leu-10, but again found no coupling to Trp-149, indicating specificity of the hydroxyproline mutations. Furthermore, on the other flank of Leu-10, the mutation S11L did not affect CTx PnIB affinity, although local hydrophobicity was altered. Thus of the many possible combinations of receptor and conotoxin mutations, only a few interact in a pairwise manner; this high degree of specificity suggests the interactions are direct.The present observations of hydrophobic contributions of CTx PnIB to affinity suggest similar interactions for related α-conotoxins. CTx MII has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure, and contains proline at position 6, valine at position 7, and leucine at position 10 (Fig. 1). CTx EI also has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure and contains proline at position 6, threonine at position 7, and methionine at position 10. Our findings suggest that these hydrophobic residues from CTx MII and EI interact with Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 of the corresponding α subunit target.The overall results disclose the essential hydrophobic nature of the interaction between CTx PnIB and aromatic residues in the α7 binding site. The specificity of CTx PnIB for α7 receptors is due to its rigid scaffold that presents a hydrophobic spiral of side chains to the (+) face of the α7 binding site. Therefore the scaffold of CTx PnIB may be useful as a template to construct toxins selective for neuronal acetylcholine receptors. The pairwise interactions we identify provide spatial constraints to refine our picture of the α7binding site. The α-conotoxins have attracted considerable attention as probes of AChR1 binding sites owing to their remarkable receptor subtype and species specificity (1.Ackerman E.J. Ang E.H.-T. Kanter J.

Previous work probed the binding site of the α7 AChR with α-conotoxin ImI (CTx ImI) and identified pairwise interactions that stabilize the toxin-receptor complex (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we further probe the binding site of the α7 AChR with α-conotoxin PnIB, a neuronal-specific toxin structurally divergent from CTx ImI, with the aim of uncovering novel pairwise interactions at the binding site. We mutate both the receptor and the toxin and use double mutant cycle analysis to identify pairs of residues that stabilize the conotoxin-receptor complex. α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-rich peptides that competitively antagonize muscle and neuronal nicotinic AChRs (4.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). All α-conotoxins have a conformationally constrained two-loop structure formed by two disulfide bridges. However, the various α-conotoxins differ by the number and type of residues in each loop, allowing specific targeting to different receptor subtypes. For example, the neuronal-specific conotoxins CTx PnIB and MII contain four residues in the first loop and seven in the second, whereas the muscle-specific conotoxins MI and GI contain three residues in the first loop and five in the second (Fig.1). Furthermore the α7-specific toxin CTx ImI differs from either of these classes containing four residues in the first loop and three in the second. Residue side chains also range widely from small to polar, hydrophobic, charged, and aromatic. Thus, diversity of backbone structure and residue composition makes α-conotoxins excellent probes of different receptor subtypes. Mutagenesis and site-directed labeling studies establish that the ligand binding sites of the AChR are formed at interfaces between subunits (6.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J.

Whereas binding sites of muscle AChRs are formed at interfaces between α1 and δ, ε, or γ subunits, binding sites of α7 neuronal AChRs are formed at interfaces between identical α7 subunits. Residues of the α face of the binding site, termed the (+) face, cluster in three well separated regions of the primary sequence, termed loops A, B, and C (6.Prince R.J. Sine S.M. Barrantes F.J. The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar). Using the numbering system for human α7receptors, residues key to AChR function in these loops include Tyr-93 in loop A, Trp-149 in loop B, and Tyr-188 and Tyr-195 in loop C. Similarly, residues of the non-α face of the binding site, termed the (−) face, cluster in four separate regions of the primary sequence, termed loops I through IV. Residues key to AChR function in these loops include Ser-34 in loop I, Trp-55 in loop II, Gln-117 in loop III, and Asp-164 in loop IV. The convergence of these seven loops to form a localized binding site has led to a multiloop model of the major extracellular domain of the AChR (7.Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P.

Binding site specificity of α-conotoxins should ultimately be traceable to differences in residues supplied by either the receptor or the conotoxin that form the complex. For example, α-conotoxins MI and GI bind with high affinity to muscle but not neuronal AChRs, presumably owing to differences in residues on both the (+) and (−) faces of the binding sites between the two classes of receptors (8.Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-conotoxins MI and GI select between binding sites of the muscle AChR owing to differences in residues supplied by the γ, ε, or δ subunits to the (−) face of the binding sites (2.Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent work mutated both the receptor and conotoxin and identified pairwise interactions that stabilize the complex formed by α7 receptors and CTx ImI (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The primary anchor of the complex comprises a positively charged arginine supplied by the N-terminal loop of CTx ImI that interacts with a conserved tyrosine at position 195 of the (+) face of the binding site. The present study was motivated by the substantial differences between CTx PnIB and CTx ImI (Fig. 1), with the aims of establishing orientation of CTx PnIB in the α7 binding site and uncovering novel pairwise interactions that stabilize the complex. By mutating residues in both α7 and CTx PnIB, the present work delineates pairwise interactions that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex. We find that CTx PnIB interacts with the (+) face of the α7 binding site through hydrophobic side chains from both its N- and C-terminal loops. Moreover, the key side chains in CTx PnIB form a localized hydrophobic patch in its three-dimensional structure, which interacts with a cluster of conserved aromatic residues on the (+) face of the α7binding site. DISCUSSIONThe present work defines the essential hydrophobic nature of the interaction between CTx PnIB and the neuronal α7 receptor and places into close proximity aromatic residues in two of the three loops of the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The key bioactive residues in CTx PnIB run the length of a helix to form a hydrophobic spiral at one end of the compact three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3). The leucine side chain at position 10 protrudes from one end of the spiral to interact strongly with Trp-149 in loop B of the (+) face of the binding site. Side chains of Pro-6 and Pro-7 protrude one turn above Leu-10 to interact with Tyr-93 in loop A of the (+) face, as well as with Trp-149. The turn above Pro-6 and Pro-7 comprises side chains of the bioactive residues Leu-5 and Ser-4, which however, show no coupling with key residues on either the (+) or (−) faces of the binding site. The overall results reveal multiple pairwise interactions between a cluster of hydrophobic residues in CTx PnIB and aromatic residues at the (+) face of the α7 binding site.Both strong and weak hydrophobic interactions stabilize CTx PnIB in the α7 binding site. The hydrophobic spiral in CTx PnIB comprises leucine side chains at positions 5 and 10, together with proline side chains at positions 6 and 7. Three of these four side chains interact with aromatic side chains on the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The stabilization likely owes to exclusion of water from both the hydrophobic and aromatic surfaces, as well as to hand-in-glove complementarity between the surfaces of the toxin and binding site that maximizes van der Waal's contacts. The observed coupling coefficients suggest that the indole ring of Trp-149 packs into the groove bounded by Pro-6, Pro-7, and Leu-10, whereas the phenol side chain of Tyr-93 enters the same groove but from the opposite side. Finally, the phenol side chain of Tyr-151 packs on the external side of this groove, bounding the exposed length of Leu-10. The overall results place into close proximity the aromatic side chains Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 found on the (+) face of the α7 binding site.The CTx PnIB-α7 complex contrasts with the previously described CTx ImI-α7 complex (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in both the chemical nature of the interaction and the points of contact in the α7 binding site. The CTx ImI-α7 complex is anchored by an aromatic-quaternary interaction between arginine at position 7 of CTx ImI and tyrosine at position 195 of the (+) face of α7. Also, tryptophan at position 10 of CTx ImI interacts with multiple residues on the (−) face of the α7 binding site. The present results detect no interaction between residues in CTx PnIB and Tyr-195 of α7 nor between CTx PnIB and the (−) face of the binding site. The very different interactions of CTx ImI and CTx PnIB suggest that the various α-conotoxins evolved to target different microdomains within the AChR binding site.Although we only detect interaction between CTx PnIB and the (+) face of the binding site, we cannot exclude possible interactions with residues on the (−) face. We find significant contributions to CTx PnIB affinity of Ser-34 in loop I of the (−) face of the site, with the mutation S34K increasing affinity by about an order of magnitude. Also, pairwise interactions remain to be discovered for the bioactive residues Ser-4 and Leu-5 in CTx PnIB. Thus the possibility remains that residues not yet discovered on the (−) face interact with Ser-4 or Leu-5. Because residues at the (+) face of the binding site are conserved across AChR subtypes, selectivity of the various α-conotoxins for different AChR subtypes likely owes to different contributions of the (−) face.The large coupling coefficient between α7Trp-149 and Leu-10 of CTx PnIB does not by itself ensure that the two residues interact directly. However, the absence of other strong pairwise interactions for Leu-10 or Trp-149 strongly suggests that the interaction is direct. For example, if Trp-149 interacted with a second residue in α7 that in turn contacted Leu-10, mutating that second residue should both weaken CTx PnIB binding and show strong coupling to Leu-10. Our systematic mutagenesis shows no strong coupling of Leu-10 to other key residues of either the (+) or the (−) face of the α7 binding site, even though CTx PnIB binding is very sensitive to mutation of these key residues.Similarly without atomic structures of the mutant conotoxins, global conformational changes are difficult to distinguish from local changes at the site of mutation. For example, suppose hydroxyproline mutations at positions 6 or 7 distorted the peptide structure so the primary anchor, leucine at position 10, moved out of alignment with its counterpart in the receptor. Hydroxyproline retains the original restricted rotation about the N-Cα bond, but its hydroxyl group may increase hydration locally. However, we made a chemically similar mutation, A9S, which is even closer to the active residue Leu-10, but again found no coupling to Trp-149, indicating specificity of the hydroxyproline mutations. Furthermore, on the other flank of Leu-10, the mutation S11L did not affect CTx PnIB affinity, although local hydrophobicity was altered. Thus of the many possible combinations of receptor and conotoxin mutations, only a few interact in a pairwise manner; this high degree of specificity suggests the interactions are direct.The present observations of hydrophobic contributions of CTx PnIB to affinity suggest similar interactions for related α-conotoxins. CTx MII has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure, and contains proline at position 6, valine at position 7, and leucine at position 10 (Fig. 1). CTx EI also has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure and contains proline at position 6, threonine at position 7, and methionine at position 10. Our findings suggest that these hydrophobic residues from CTx MII and EI interact with Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 of the corresponding α subunit target.The overall results disclose the essential hydrophobic nature of the interaction between CTx PnIB and aromatic residues in the α7 binding site. The specificity of CTx PnIB for α7 receptors is due to its rigid scaffold that presents a hydrophobic spiral of side chains to the (+) face of the α7 binding site. Therefore the scaffold of CTx PnIB may be useful as a template to construct toxins selective for neuronal acetylcholine receptors. The pairwise interactions we identify provide spatial constraints to refine our picture of the α7binding site. The present work defines the essential hydrophobic nature of the interaction between CTx PnIB and the neuronal α7 receptor and places into close proximity aromatic residues in two of the three loops of the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The key bioactive residues in CTx PnIB run the length of a helix to form a hydrophobic spiral at one end of the compact three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3). The leucine side chain at position 10 protrudes from one end of the spiral to interact strongly with Trp-149 in loop B of the (+) face of the binding site. Side chains of Pro-6 and Pro-7 protrude one turn above Leu-10 to interact with Tyr-93 in loop A of the (+) face, as well as with Trp-149. The turn above Pro-6 and Pro-7 comprises side chains of the bioactive residues Leu-5 and Ser-4, which however, show no coupling with key residues on either the (+) or (−) faces of the binding site. The overall results reveal multiple pairwise interactions between a cluster of hydrophobic residues in CTx PnIB and aromatic residues at the (+) face of the α7 binding site. Both strong and weak hydrophobic interactions stabilize CTx PnIB in the α7 binding site. The hydrophobic spiral in CTx PnIB comprises leucine side chains at positions 5 and 10, together with proline side chains at positions 6 and 7. Three of these four side chains interact with aromatic side chains on the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The stabilization likely owes to exclusion of water from both the hydrophobic and aromatic surfaces, as well as to hand-in-glove complementarity between the surfaces of the toxin and binding site that maximizes van der Waal's contacts. The observed coupling coefficients suggest that the indole ring of Trp-149 packs into the groove bounded by Pro-6, Pro-7, and Leu-10, whereas the phenol side chain of Tyr-93 enters the same groove but from the opposite side. Finally, the phenol side chain of Tyr-151 packs on the external side of this groove, bounding the exposed length of Leu-10. The overall results place into close proximity the aromatic side chains Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 found on the (+) face of the α7 binding site. The CTx PnIB-α7 complex contrasts with the previously described CTx ImI-α7 complex (3.Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in both the chemical nature of the interaction and the points of contact in the α7 binding site. The CTx ImI-α7 complex is anchored by an aromatic-quaternary interaction between arginine at position 7 of CTx ImI and tyrosine at position 195 of the (+) face of α7. Also, tryptophan at position 10 of CTx ImI interacts with multiple residues on the (−) face of the α7 binding site. The present results detect no interaction between residues in CTx PnIB and Tyr-195 of α7 nor between CTx PnIB and the (−) face of the binding site. The very different interactions of CTx ImI and CTx PnIB suggest that the various α-conotoxins evolved to target different microdomains within the AChR binding site. Although we only detect interaction between CTx PnIB and the (+) face of the binding site, we cannot exclude possible interactions with residues on the (−) face. We find significant contributions to CTx PnIB affinity of Ser-34 in loop I of the (−) face of the site, with the mutation S34K increasing affinity by about an order of magnitude. Also, pairwise interactions remain to be discovered for the bioactive residues Ser-4 and Leu-5 in CTx PnIB. Thus the possibility remains that residues not yet discovered on the (−) face interact with Ser-4 or Leu-5. Because residues at the (+) face of the binding site are conserved across AChR subtypes, selectivity of the various α-conotoxins for different AChR subtypes likely owes to different contributions of the (−) face. The large coupling coefficient between α7Trp-149 and Leu-10 of CTx PnIB does not by itself ensure that the two residues interact directly. However, the absence of other strong pairwise interactions for Leu-10 or Trp-149 strongly suggests that the interaction is direct. For example, if Trp-149 interacted with a second residue in α7 that in turn contacted Leu-10, mutating that second residue should both weaken CTx PnIB binding and show strong coupling to Leu-10. Our systematic mutagenesis shows no strong coupling of Leu-10 to other key residues of either the (+) or the (−) face of the α7 binding site, even though CTx PnIB binding is very sensitive to mutation of these key residues. Similarly without atomic structures of the mutant conotoxins, global conformational changes are difficult to distinguish from local changes at the site of mutation. For example, suppose hydroxyproline mutations at positions 6 or 7 distorted the peptide structure so the primary anchor, leucine at position 10, moved out of alignment with its counterpart in the receptor. Hydroxyproline retains the original restricted rotation about the N-Cα bond, but its hydroxyl group may increase hydration locally.

Thus of the many possible combinations of receptor and conotoxin mutations, only a few interact in a pairwise manner; this high degree of specificity suggests the interactions are direct. The present observations of hydrophobic contributions of CTx PnIB to affinity suggest similar interactions for related α-conotoxins. CTx MII has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure, and contains proline at position 6, valine at position 7, and leucine at position 10 (Fig. 1). CTx EI also has the same number of residues in the two-loop structure and contains proline at position 6, threonine at position 7, and methionine at position 10. Our findings suggest that these hydrophobic residues from CTx MII and EI interact with Trp-149, Tyr-93, and Tyr-151 of the corresponding α subunit target.

https://openalex.org/W2010533134,"The initial and rate-limiting step in prostaglandin biosynthesis is stereoselective removal of the pro-S hydrogen from the 13-carbon of arachidonic acid. This is followed by oxygenation at C-11, formation of the five-membered ring, and a second oxygenation at C-15 to yield the endoperoxide product, prostaglandin G2. Aspirin treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 is known to acetylate an active site serine, block prostaglandin biosynthesis, and give 15R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE) as the only product. 15R-HETE and prostaglandins have opposite stereoconfigurations of the 15-hydroxyl. To understand the changes that lead to 15R-HETE synthesis in aspirin-treated COX-2, we employed pro-R- and pro-S-labeled [13-3H]arachidonic acids to investigate the selectivity of the initial hydrogen abstraction. Remarkably, aspirin-treated COX-2 formed 15R-HETE with removal of the pro-Shydrogen at C-13 (3–9% retention of pro-S tritium label), the same stereoselectivity as in the formation of prostaglandins by native cyclooxygenase. To account for this result and the change in oxygenase specificity, we suggest that the bulky serine acetyl group forces a realignment of the omega end of the arachidonic acid carbon chain. This can rationalize abstraction of the C-13 pro-Shydrogen, the blocking of prostaglandin synthesis, and the formation of 15R-HETE as the sole enzymatic product.

Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5344-5354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) established that cyclooxygenase initiates prostaglandin biosynthesis by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen from the 13-carbon of the polyunsaturated fatty acid substrate. This is followed by insertion of two molecules of oxygen at positions 11 and 15 on the carbon chain to form the endoperoxide product PGG2.1 In terms of stereochemistry, both of these oxygenations are on the opposite face of the substrate with respect to the hydrogen removed at C-13 (1.Hamberg M.

This so-called antarafacial relationship between hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion has proved to be the rule for all stereospecific reactions of cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases investigated so far (e.g. Refs. 1.Hamberg M.

In contrast to all other NSAIDs, aspirin is known to modify covalently COX-1 and COX-2 by acetylation of a critical serine residue that lines the cyclooxygenase active site (6.Picot D. Loll P.J.

Acetylation of Ser-530 (using the numerical designation of this serine in ovine COX-1) results in complete inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by both COX-1 and COX-2. With COX-2 only, the effect of aspirin treatment is a shift in reaction specificity; prostaglandin synthesis is blocked and 15R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE) is formed as the only enzymatic product (10.Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Shornick L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21438-21445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

This reaction is particularly unusual in that 15R-HETE has the opposite stereoconfiguration at carbon-15 to prostaglandin G2 and the other prostaglandins. A question arises whether the formation of the 15R configuration product is associated with removal of the opposite hydrogen at C-13 as would be predicted from the typical antarafacial relationship (Fig. 1)? Either way, a knowledge of the stereochemistry of the hydrogen removal will lend some insights into the mode of substrate binding in the cyclooxygenase active site.With these considerations in mind we synthesized [13-pro-R-3H]- and [13-pro-S-3H]arachidonic acids by a combined chemical and biosynthetic approach, and we employed these substrates to address the question of hydrogen removal in 15R-HETE synthesis by aspirin-treated COX-2. To explain our experimental results, we propose a model of arachidonic acid binding that involves a changed conformation induced by the acetylation of Ser-530.RESULTSWe used incubations with [14C]arachidonic acid to establish the appropriate enzyme and substrate concentrations for the subsequent experiments with stereospecifically labeled arachidonic acids. Fig. 2 shows the metabolism of [14C]arachidonic acid by native COX-2 and the effects of aspirin treatment. The native enzyme forms prostaglandins as the major polar products, together with HHT and minor amounts of 15-HETE and 11-HETE (Fig. 2 A). Aspirin treatment of COX-2 blocked prostaglandin synthesis and the associated formation of HHT and 11-HETE; as expected, 15R-HETE was recovered as the main product (Fig. 2 B) (10.Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Shornick L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21438-21445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Under the conditions of our incubations, we found that the peroxidase activity of the enzyme was not sufficient to reduce fully the 15R-HPETE to 15R-HETE. This resulted in the appearance of polar derivatives of the 15-hydroperoxide on the chromatograms (not shown). To eliminate these products we treated the samples with SnCl2 prior to extraction. This reduction step ensured that no secondary products were formed upon HPETE degradation that might have an influence on the isotopic composition of the products.Figure 2RP-HPLC analyses of [1-14C]arachidonic acid metabolites of native (A) and acetylated (B) COX-2.COX-2, the native enzyme or pretreated with aspirin, was incubated with 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid for 10 min on ice, and the products were subsequently extracted and analyzed by RP-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Panel A,analysis of radiolabeled products from native COX-2. Panel B, analysis of products from acetylated (aspirin-treated) COX-2. Samples were chromatographed on a Beckman Ultrasphere ODS 5-μm column (25 × 0.46 cm) using a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (80/20/0.01, by volume, switched to 100% methanol to elute the arachidonic acid) at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min with on-line detection of radiolabeled products on a Packard Flo-One Radiomatic detector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following incubation with the stereospecifically labeled [13-3H]arachidonic acids (admixed with [3-14C]arachidonic acid as internal standard), the major products were purified through at least two steps of HPLC (see under “Experimental Procedures”), and the 3H/14C ratios were determined by liquid scintillation counting. In the case of 15-HETE from the aspirin-treated COX-2 incubations, the final HPLC step was carried out on a chiral column and fractions were collected across the peaks, Fig. 3. By using [13-pro-S-3H]arachidonic acid substrate (panel A) the main peak of 15R-HETE is comprised of 14C with very little retention of 3H label. This shows that the pro-S hydrogen is removed from C-13 during conversion of arachidonic acid to 15R-HETE. From [13-pro-R-3H]arachidonic acid (panel B), it is clear that the tritium is retained in the 15R-HETE. The results from three separate experiments are given in Table I. The pro-Stritium was retained only 3–9% in the 15R-HETE, whereas the pro-R tritium showed 108–147% retention. Table I also summarizes the results of incubations with native COX-2 (not acetylated). The tritium retentions in the major cyclooxygenase product, PGH2 (measured as PGE2), indicate removal of the pro-S hydrogen during catalysis and, correspondingly, retention of the pro-R radiolabel.DISCUSSIONOne of the main interests in conducting this study relates to potential insights into substrate binding in the cyclooxygenase active site. From x-ray structural analyses, the location and overall topologies of the substrate access channel and the binding site for cyclooxygenase catalysis are identified (6.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 7.Loll P.J. Picot D. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct.

Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). There are also mutational analyses and modeling data on the binding of arachidonic acid (13.Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15.Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There is not yet data on the precise conformation of arachidonic acid nor an explanation for the synthesis of 15R-HETE by aspirin-treated COX-2.By using stereospecifically labeled arachidonic acid substrates, we established that the hydrogen abstraction associated with formation of 15R-HETE by aspirin-treated COX-2 is identical to the hydrogen abstraction in prostaglandin biosynthesis. This is surprising for a couple of reasons. First, prostaglandins and 15R-HETE have opposite configurations of the 15-hydroxyl, and accordingly, there is some fundamentally different stereochemistry involved in the two reactions. Second, the stereochemical relationship between hydrogen removal and the 15R-oxygenation would appear to contradict the antarafacial rule observed in all other cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase reactions. This point is discussed later.We considered three possible models to equate the stereochemistry of hydrogen abstraction with the stereochemistry of the 15R-HETE product. Before the results of the present study were in hand, a theoretical explanation of 15R-HETE synthesis could have involved a reversed orientation of substrate in the active site. This phenomenon is well precedented in lipoxygenase catalysis (e.g. Refs. 16.Schwarz K. Borngräber S. Anton M. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15327-15335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 17.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1287-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Assuming no other changes in the oxygenation machinery, a “head-to-tail” reorientation of arachidonic acid would lead to formation of 15R-HETE at the position that yields 11R-HETE in the normal alignment (Fig.4, panel A, top). This model, however, predicts removal of the pro-R hydrogen at C-13 during catalysis. This is opposite to the observed experimental result, and thus this first possibility can now be dismissed.Figure 4Illustration of reverse orientation of arachidonic acid in the acetylated COX-2 active site (A) and redirection of approach of molecular oxygen in acetylated COX-2 (B). Panel A, thetop structure shows the usual cyclooxygenase reaction with pro-S hydrogen abstraction at C-13 of arachidonic acid and oxygenation in the 11R configuration. Immediately below is shown substrate in reversed orientation; this might explain 15R-HETE synthesis but is associated with pro-Rhydrogen abstraction at C-13. Panel B, approach of molecular oxygen from above or below changes the configuration at C-15.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A potential explanation that equates abstraction of the 13-pro-S hydrogen with synthesis of 15R-HETE entails approach of molecular oxygen from the opposite side of the substrate (Fig. 4, panel B) (11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control of molecular oxygen in the two oxygenations in cyclooxygenase catalysis, assuming there is any active control, is not understood. Therefore, based on our present understanding it could be argued that we cannot dismiss the possibility of its reversal by acetylation of Ser-530. Notwithstanding this caveat, it remains true that there are no rational explanations for how acetylation of Ser-530 could lead to a change in the direction of approach of molecular oxygen. Furthermore, if acetylation of Ser-530 interferes only with the movement of molecular oxygen, it is even less clear how this could interfere with the initial cyclooxygenase reaction in the usual position at C-11. On a number of grounds, therefore, we consider this explanation unlikely.A third model to account for the experimental results predicts that acetylation of Ser-530 constricts the available space normally occupied by the omega end of the arachidonic acid carbon chain. In the native enzyme (Fig. 5, panel A) a radical on Tyr-385 initiates the cyclooxygenase reaction by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13 of arachidonic acid (18.Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). This is followed by two successive oxygenations involving approach of molecular oxygen from behind the plane of view to react initially in the 11R configuration and subsequently 15S. In the acetylated enzyme (Fig. 5, panel B), the bulky acetyl group has blocked the normal arachidonic acid conformation and forced a twisting over of the tail end of the carbon chain. The approach of molecular oxygen in the normal way will now lead to reaction in the 15R configuration. It is also apparent that C-11 might no longer be accessible for oxygen attack as it is “protected” or shielded by the arachidonic acid omega carbon chain, and, as a consequence of the lack of oxygenation at C-11, prostaglandin synthesis is blocked. This model, therefore, can account for the production of 15R-HETE as the sole product of aspirin-treated COX-2.Figure 5Proposed conformations of arachidonic acid in the active site of native (A) and acetylated (B) COX-2. Panel A, in native COX-2, arachidonic acid assumes an L-shape (13.Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A radical on Tyr-385 initiates the cyclooxygenase reaction by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13. Reactions with molecular oxygen, approaching from below, occur in the 11R and then in the 15S configuration. Panel B, in aspirin-treated COX-2, the bulky acetyl group forces a re-alignment of the omega carbon chain of arachidonic acid. This is now twisted over so that approach of molecular oxygen in the usual way results in oxygenation in the 15R configuration. The repositioning of the fatty acid may interfere with reaction of molecular oxygen at C-11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In characterizing oxygenase reactions, the relative stereochemistry of hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion can be described as suprafacial (the two occur on the same face of the substrate) or antarafacial. When the term antarafacial is applied to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase reactions, it is assumed that the 1,4-pentadiene is in a planar conformation with the two cis double bonds lying in parallel. From this viewpoint, all lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase oxygenations, except for the 15R-HETE synthesis studied here, are antarafacial. This has proved a useful concept for unifying the diverse reactions of these families of oxygenase. The terminology is of more questionable value when the pentadiene is viewed in different conformations, for example with one double bond twisted over, as in the model of arachidonic acid in Fig. 5 B. In examples like this the terminology loses its utility and is probably best avoided.As a final point, there is one more line of argument that supports the realignment explanation for the synthesis of 15R-HETE in acetylated COX-2. This relates to the known differences in the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2, the very differences that contribute to the selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors. Comparison of the crystal structures of the two enzymes indicate that COX-2 has more available space in the active site (8.Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 9.Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus J.M. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K.

Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). If a change in approach of molecular oxygen were the only significant consequence of acetylation of the COX enzymes, it is unclear why COX-2 retains the ability to synthesize 15R-HETE while the oxygenase activity of COX-1 is completely blocked. Considering instead that the COX-2 active site has more available space, this fits with a model that predicts movement of the omega carbon chain in acetylated COX-2, a realignment that is not physically possible in the more restricted active site of acetylated COX-1. In 1967, Hamberg and Samuelsson (1.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5344-5354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) established that cyclooxygenase initiates prostaglandin biosynthesis by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen from the 13-carbon of the polyunsaturated fatty acid substrate. This is followed by insertion of two molecules of oxygen at positions 11 and 15 on the carbon chain to form the endoperoxide product PGG2.1 In terms of stereochemistry, both of these oxygenations are on the opposite face of the substrate with respect to the hydrogen removed at C-13 (1.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5344-5354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This so-called antarafacial relationship between hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion has proved to be the rule for all stereospecific reactions of cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases investigated so far (e.g. Refs. 1.Hamberg M.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are well known as inhibitors of the two mammalian cyclooxygenase enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2 (4.Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

In contrast to all other NSAIDs, aspirin is known to modify covalently COX-1 and COX-2 by acetylation of a critical serine residue that lines the cyclooxygenase active site (6.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 7.Loll P.J. Picot D. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct.

Acetylation of Ser-530 (using the numerical designation of this serine in ovine COX-1) results in complete inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by both COX-1 and COX-2. With COX-2 only, the effect of aspirin treatment is a shift in reaction specificity; prostaglandin synthesis is blocked and 15R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE) is formed as the only enzymatic product (10.Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Shornick L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21438-21445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

This reaction is particularly unusual in that 15R-HETE has the opposite stereoconfiguration at carbon-15 to prostaglandin G2 and the other prostaglandins. A question arises whether the formation of the 15R configuration product is associated with removal of the opposite hydrogen at C-13 as would be predicted from the typical antarafacial relationship (Fig. 1)? Either way, a knowledge of the stereochemistry of the hydrogen removal will lend some insights into the mode of substrate binding in the cyclooxygenase active site. With these considerations in mind we synthesized [13-pro-R-3H]- and [13-pro-S-3H]arachidonic acids by a combined chemical and biosynthetic approach, and we employed these substrates to address the question of hydrogen removal in 15R-HETE synthesis by aspirin-treated COX-2. To explain our experimental results, we propose a model of arachidonic acid binding that involves a changed conformation induced by the acetylation of Ser-530. RESULTSWe used incubations with [14C]arachidonic acid to establish the appropriate enzyme and substrate concentrations for the subsequent experiments with stereospecifically labeled arachidonic acids. Fig. 2 shows the metabolism of [14C]arachidonic acid by native COX-2 and the effects of aspirin treatment. The native enzyme forms prostaglandins as the major polar products, together with HHT and minor amounts of 15-HETE and 11-HETE (Fig. 2 A). Aspirin treatment of COX-2 blocked prostaglandin synthesis and the associated formation of HHT and 11-HETE; as expected, 15R-HETE was recovered as the main product (Fig. 2 B) (10.Holtzman M.J. Turk J. Shornick L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21438-21445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Under the conditions of our incubations, we found that the peroxidase activity of the enzyme was not sufficient to reduce fully the 15R-HPETE to 15R-HETE. This resulted in the appearance of polar derivatives of the 15-hydroperoxide on the chromatograms (not shown). To eliminate these products we treated the samples with SnCl2 prior to extraction. This reduction step ensured that no secondary products were formed upon HPETE degradation that might have an influence on the isotopic composition of the products.Following incubation with the stereospecifically labeled [13-3H]arachidonic acids (admixed with [3-14C]arachidonic acid as internal standard), the major products were purified through at least two steps of HPLC (see under “Experimental Procedures”), and the 3H/14C ratios were determined by liquid scintillation counting. In the case of 15-HETE from the aspirin-treated COX-2 incubations, the final HPLC step was carried out on a chiral column and fractions were collected across the peaks, Fig. 3. By using [13-pro-S-3H]arachidonic acid substrate (panel A) the main peak of 15R-HETE is comprised of 14C with very little retention of 3H label. This shows that the pro-S hydrogen is removed from C-13 during conversion of arachidonic acid to 15R-HETE. From [13-pro-R-3H]arachidonic acid (panel B), it is clear that the tritium is retained in the 15R-HETE. The results from three separate experiments are given in Table I. The pro-Stritium was retained only 3–9% in the 15R-HETE, whereas the pro-R tritium showed 108–147% retention. Table I also summarizes the results of incubations with native COX-2 (not acetylated). The tritium retentions in the major cyclooxygenase product, PGH2 (measured as PGE2), indicate removal of the pro-S hydrogen during catalysis and, correspondingly, retention of the pro-R radiolabel. We used incubations with [14C]arachidonic acid to establish the appropriate enzyme and substrate concentrations for the subsequent experiments with stereospecifically labeled arachidonic acids.

DISCUSSIONOne of the main interests in conducting this study relates to potential insights into substrate binding in the cyclooxygenase active site. From x-ray structural analyses, the location and overall topologies of the substrate access channel and the binding site for cyclooxygenase catalysis are identified (6.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 7.Loll P.J. Picot D. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct.

Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). There are also mutational analyses and modeling data on the binding of arachidonic acid (13.Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15.Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There is not yet data on the precise conformation of arachidonic acid nor an explanation for the synthesis of 15R-HETE by aspirin-treated COX-2.By using stereospecifically labeled arachidonic acid substrates, we established that the hydrogen abstraction associated with formation of 15R-HETE by aspirin-treated COX-2 is identical to the hydrogen abstraction in prostaglandin biosynthesis. This is surprising for a couple of reasons. First, prostaglandins and 15R-HETE have opposite configurations of the 15-hydroxyl, and accordingly, there is some fundamentally different stereochemistry involved in the two reactions. Second, the stereochemical relationship between hydrogen removal and the 15R-oxygenation would appear to contradict the antarafacial rule observed in all other cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase reactions. This point is discussed later.We considered three possible models to equate the stereochemistry of hydrogen abstraction with the stereochemistry of the 15R-HETE product. Before the results of the present study were in hand, a theoretical explanation of 15R-HETE synthesis could have involved a reversed orientation of substrate in the active site. This phenomenon is well precedented in lipoxygenase catalysis (e.g. Refs. 16.Schwarz K. Borngräber S. Anton M. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15327-15335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 17.Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1287-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Assuming no other changes in the oxygenation machinery, a “head-to-tail” reorientation of arachidonic acid would lead to formation of 15R-HETE at the position that yields 11R-HETE in the normal alignment (Fig.4, panel A, top). This model, however, predicts removal of the pro-R hydrogen at C-13 during catalysis. This is opposite to the observed experimental result, and thus this first possibility can now be dismissed.A potential explanation that equates abstraction of the 13-pro-S hydrogen with synthesis of 15R-HETE entails approach of molecular oxygen from the opposite side of the substrate (Fig. 4, panel B) (11.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control of molecular oxygen in the two oxygenations in cyclooxygenase catalysis, assuming there is any active control, is not understood. Therefore, based on our present understanding it could be argued that we cannot dismiss the possibility of its reversal by acetylation of Ser-530. Notwithstanding this caveat, it remains true that there are no rational explanations for how acetylation of Ser-530 could lead to a change in the direction of approach of molecular oxygen. Furthermore, if acetylation of Ser-530 interferes only with the movement of molecular oxygen, it is even less clear how this could interfere with the initial cyclooxygenase reaction in the usual position at C-11. On a number of grounds, therefore, we consider this explanation unlikely.A third model to account for the experimental results predicts that acetylation of Ser-530 constricts the available space normally occupied by the omega end of the arachidonic acid carbon chain. In the native enzyme (Fig. 5, panel A) a radical on Tyr-385 initiates the cyclooxygenase reaction by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13 of arachidonic acid (18.Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). This is followed by two successive oxygenations involving approach of molecular oxygen from behind the plane of view to react initially in the 11R configuration and subsequently 15S. In the acetylated enzyme (Fig. 5, panel B), the bulky acetyl group has blocked the normal arachidonic acid conformation and forced a twisting over of the tail end of the carbon chain. The approach of molecular oxygen in the normal way will now lead to reaction in the 15R configuration. It is also apparent that C-11 might no longer be accessible for oxygen attack as it is “protected” or shielded by the arachidonic acid omega carbon chain, and, as a consequence of the lack of oxygenation at C-11, prostaglandin synthesis is blocked. This model, therefore, can account for the production of 15R-HETE as the sole product of aspirin-treated COX-2.Figure 5Proposed conformations of arachidonic acid in the active site of native (A) and acetylated (B) COX-2. Panel A, in native COX-2, arachidonic acid assumes an L-shape (13.Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A radical on Tyr-385 initiates the cyclooxygenase reaction by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-13. Reactions with molecular oxygen, approaching from below, occur in the 11R and then in the 15S configuration. Panel B, in aspirin-treated COX-2, the bulky acetyl group forces a re-alignment of the omega carbon chain of arachidonic acid. This is now twisted over so that approach of molecular oxygen in the usual way results in oxygenation in the 15R configuration. The repositioning of the fatty acid may interfere with reaction of molecular oxygen at C-11.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In characterizing oxygenase reactions, the relative stereochemistry of hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion can be described as suprafacial (the two occur on the same face of the substrate) or antarafacial. When the term antarafacial is applied to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase reactions, it is assumed that the 1,4-pentadiene is in a planar conformation with the two cis double bonds lying in parallel. From this viewpoint, all lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase oxygenations, except for the 15R-HETE synthesis studied here, are antarafacial. This has proved a useful concept for unifying the diverse reactions of these families of oxygenase. The terminology is of more questionable value when the pentadiene is viewed in different conformations, for example with one double bond twisted over, as in the model of arachidonic acid in Fig. 5 B. In examples like this the terminology loses its utility and is probably best avoided.As a final point, there is one more line of argument that supports the realignment explanation for the synthesis of 15R-HETE in acetylated COX-2. This relates to the known differences in the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2, the very differences that contribute to the selectivity of COX-2 inhibitors.

If a change in approach of molecular oxygen were the only significant consequence of acetylation of the COX enzymes, it is unclear why COX-2 retains the ability to synthesize 15R-HETE while the oxygenase activity of COX-1 is completely blocked. Considering instead that the COX-2 active site has more available space, this fits with a model that predicts movement of the omega carbon chain in acetylated COX-2, a realignment that is not physically possible in the more restricted active site of acetylated COX-1. We thank William E. Boeglin for help in the synthesis of the stereospecifically labeled substrates and Drs. Scott W. Rowlinson and Lawrence J. Marnett for the generous supplies of mouse COX-2."

Here we show that when the LPS-activated cells are prelabeled with [3H]oleic acid (OA), they also mobilize and release OA to the extracellular medium. The time and concentration dependence of the LPS effect on OA release fully resemble those of the AA release. Experiments in which both AA and OA release are measured simultaneously indicate that AA is released 3 times more efficiently than OA. Importantly, LPS-stimulated OA release is strongly inhibited by the selective sPLA2 inhibitors 3-(3-acetamide-1-benzyl-2-ethylindolyl-5-oxy)propane sulfonic acid and carboxymethylcellulose-linked phosphatidylethanolamine. The addition of exogenous recombinant sPLA2 to the cells also triggers OA release. These data implicate a functionally active sPLA2as being essential for the cells to release OA upon stimulation with LPS. OA release is also inhibited by methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate but not by bromoenol lactone, indicating that the group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 is also involved in the process.

Interestingly, in some instances the sPLA2 involved is not a group V sPLA2 but rather a closely related group IIA enzyme (15.Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

Recently, a surface receptor that recognizes certain sPLA2forms with high affinity has been cloned (18.Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In line with the existence of putative sPLA2 receptors, it has been suggested that sPLA2-mediated AA release in some systems may not involve the hydrolytic activity of the sPLA2. Rather, the sPLA2 would act as a ligand-like agonist that stimulates the cPLA2 for an increased AA release response (19.Fonteh A.N. Samet J.M. Surette M. Reed W. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20.Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A major argument in favor of the above scenario is the finding that no fatty acids other than AA are detected in the extracellular medium (19.Fonteh A.N. Samet J.M. Surette M. Reed W. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20.Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Specific AA release would be inconsistent with the involvement of a sPLA2, since this enzyme shows little or no fatty acid preference (22.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the augmentative role that group V sPLA2 plays in LPS-activated P388D1 macrophages appears to depend on enzyme activity (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have now examined the hypothesis of whether these cells mobilize other fatty acids in addition to AA. Our results show that the activated cells do release measurable amounts of oleic acid (OA), that this release appears to be due to the hydrolytic action of the sPLA2 acting on the cellular surface, and that the regulatory features of the OA release are strikingly similar to those previously found for the AA release. Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (endotoxin <0.05 ng/ml) was from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Nonessential amino acids were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). [9,10-3H]Oleic acid (specific activity 55 Ci/mmol) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (specific activity 100 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products.

Human recombinant group V sPLA2 was produced in our laboratory utilizing the Pichia pastoris expression system (6.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

P388D1 cells were plated at 106/well, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for experiments the following day. All experiments were conducted in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. When required, radiolabeling of the P388D1 cells was achieved by including 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]OA or 0.1 μCi/ml [14C]OA plus 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA during the overnight adherence period (20 h). Labeled fatty acid that had not been incorporated into cellular lipids was removed by washing the cells six times with serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml albumin. The cells were placed in serum-free medium for 30 min before the addition of LPS or exogenous sPLA2 for different periods of time in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The supernatants were removed, cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. When inhibitors were used, they were added 30 min before the addition of LPS. Except for the data in Fig. 2, which are given as percentage of release with respect to total cellular radioactivity levels, agonist-stimulated OA release is expressed by subtracting the basal rate observed in the absence of agonist and inhibitor. These background values were in the range of 1000–2000 cpm. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented are from representative experiments. We have previously shown that exposure of P388D1 macrophages (MAB clone) to LPS induces a concentration-dependent release of AA to the extracellular medium that spans several hours (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We began the current study by determining whether LPS was able to cause the extracellular release of OA as well. To this end, the cells, labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]oleic acid, were exposed to different concentrations of LPS for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS did induce a time- (Fig.1 A) and concentration- (Fig. 1 B) dependent release of [3H]OA from the cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, the kinetics of the LPS effect on OA release was very similar to that previously found for the LPS-induced AA release (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, after a lag of about 3 h, OA release proceeded linearly up to about 10 h, after which it continued at a slower rate. The concentration dependence of the LPS-induced OA equally resembled that of the LPS-induced AA release (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By simultaneously labeling the cells with [3H]AA and [14C]OA, it was possible to measure under identical settings the release of these two fatty acids in response to LPS. To allow for a direct comparison, the results are given as the percentage of labeled fatty acid incorporated into cells that is released. Fig.2 shows that despite the fact that the LPS-activated cells released OA to a significant level (2-fold above basal), AA was released about 3 times more efficiently. To address the involvement of the different PLA2 forms in LPS-induced OA release, we first utilized MAFP (2.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), a dual cPLA2/iPLA2 inhibitor that has previously been found to block the cPLA2-dependent release of AA from LPS-stimulated P388D1 macrophages (2.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, MAFP strongly blocked the LPS-induced [3H]OA release. iPLA2 involvement was studied with BEL, a compound that manifests a 1000-fold selectivity for inhibition of the iPLA2 versus the cPLA2 in vitro (2.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, BEL had no measurable inhibitory effect on LPS-induced [3H]OA release. Nevertheless, it completely inhibited iPLA2 activity in homogenates prepared from LPS-treated cells (not shown). In turn, these data indicate that the effects of MAFP shown above are due to inhibition of the cPLA2. To assess the involvement of sPLA2, we utilized two structurally unrelated inhibitors, namely LY311727 and CMPE (Fig.4). The first compound is an indole derivative (24.Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Jones N.D. Mihelich E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and the second one is composed ofN-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine covalently linked via the head group to carboxymethyl cellulose (23.Dan P. Dagan A. Krimsky M. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Yedgar S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both of these compounds strongly inhibited [3H]oleic acid release (Fig. 4). When, in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 B, carboxymethyl cellulose alone was added instead of CMPE, no effect on LPS-induced [3H]OA release was observed at all (data not shown). CMPE is a cell-impermeable inhibitor that prevents the sPLA2from attacking the phospholipids on the outer surface (23.Dan P. Dagan A. Krimsky M. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Yedgar S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the data shown in Fig. 4 B imply that the extracellular sPLA2 pool is the one that participates in OA release in the LPS-treated cells. Given that group V sPLA2 is activeper se toward cell membranes (i.e. no “membrane rearrangement” is needed for this enzyme to attack the outer membrane) (6.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 25.Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Muñoz N.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the addition of exogenous group V sPLA2 to the macrophages should result in an enhanced release of OA to the extracellular medium. This is exactly what happened in the experiment shown in Fig.5. Recent work by several laboratories has highlighted the importance of sPLA2 (either group V or group IIA) in AA mobilization and attendant prostaglandin formation (26.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sPLA2is thought to amplify the AA release signal initiated by the cPLA2 to generate large amounts of free AA, part of which will eventually be converted into eicosanoids (26.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That the sPLA2 plays merely a hydrolytic role in the process of AA release has been argued against recently on the basis that AA mobilization in some cell types appears to be highly specific for AA (i.e. no release of other fatty acids is detected) (19.Fonteh A.N. Samet J.M. Surette M. Reed W. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20.Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The latter finding would be inconsistent with the hydrolytic action of an enzyme such as the sPLA2, which shows no fatty acid preference (22.Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative explanation has been proposed that involves the sPLA2 acting as a ligand-like molecule independent of enzyme activity. According to this hypothesis, the sPLA2 acts as a a receptor-directed agonist that stimulates the selective release of AA via cPLA2activation. In addition to the lack of release of fatty acids other than AA (19.Fonteh A.N. Samet J.M. Surette M. Reed W. Chilton F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1393: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20.Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 165: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), this hypothesis is also supported by data showing that sPLA2s from different sources that have been rendered catalytically inactive by inhibitors are still able to elicit the AA release (20.Hernández M. Burillo S.L. Sánchez Crespo M. Nieto M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 606-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21.Xing M. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, a large number of studies have shown that sPLA2 inhibitors markedly diminish the release of AA (2.Balsinde J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have recently found that the addition of exogenous group V sPLA2 to the cells induces an AA release response that is not observed if chemically inactivated enzyme is used. In agreement with our data, Tada et al. (8.Tada K. Murakami M. Kambe T. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar) have found that catalytically inactive group IIA sPLA2 mutants are incapable of promoting AA release from cytokine-primed cells. The current results clearly show that the LPS-activated P388D1 macrophages do release OA and that the regulatory features of the OA release are strikingly similar to those found previously for the AA release (2.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Simultaneous measurement of the OA release versus AA release revealed that the activated cells appear to release AA in preference over OA, which is fully consistent with recent data of Murakami and colleagues (10.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17.Murakami M. Kambe T.

However, it is important to note that OA release was not detected in these previous studies, or it was detected at a very low level (10.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17.Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H.

In contrast, we show in this study that OA release in the LPS-activated cells is actually quite significant (2-fold over basal). LPS-activated OA release can be blocked by sPLA2inhibitors, which implies that a catalytically active sPLA2is needed for the OA release to occur. Hence, in the LPS-activated cells, AA-containing phospholipids are not the only substrates for the sPLA2. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fatty release observed in cells may reflect the fatty acid composition of the specific phospholipid pools that come in contact with the sPLA2. sPLA2 docking in a membrane domain highly enriched in AA-containing phospholipids could explain why this enzyme appears to release AA in preference to other fatty acidsin vivo. Importantly, at least one of the sPLA2 inhibitors utilized in this study, CMPE, is cell-impermeable. CMPE anchors to the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane by its phospholipid moiety, thereby protecting the membrane from the hydrolytic action of the sPLA2 (23.Dan P. Dagan A. Krimsky M. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Yedgar S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From the results obtained with this compound, it can be concluded that the sPLA2 pool involved in the OA release is the one on the cellular surface, because if the sPLA2 were acting inside the cell, CMPE would not have had any effect on the release. Similar to OA release, we have observed that CMPE also strongly blunts AA release in the LPS-activated P388D1 cells, 2J. Balsinde and E. A. Dennis, unpublished observation. which also points at the cell surface as the site for sPLA2-dependent AA mobilization. In agreement with these observations, we show that exogenous sPLA2 is able to induce both AA (6.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and OA (this study) release from the P388D1 cells. Our inhibitor studies indicate that, in addition to the sPLA2, OA release in the LPS-activated P388D1cells also involves the cPLA2. Since the cPLA2is highly AA-specific, it appears very unlikely that this enzyme contributes to the OA release by directly cleaving OA-containing phospholipids. We (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that a catalytically active cPLA2 is required for the cells to show enhanced expression of sPLA2 in response to LPS. Thus, inhibition of OA release by cPLA2 inhibitors most likely reflects the diminished capacity of the cells to synthesize sPLA2, in an analogous manner to what we (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and others (13.Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have previously described for the AA release. P388D1 macrophages contain a third PLA2 type, the group VI iPLA2. Given that iPLA2 is not fatty acid-selective, a possible role for this enzyme in OA mobilization could in principle be envisioned. However, in analogy again with the AA release, we have failed to detect any role for this enzyme in the LPS-induced OA release. Under conditions wherein cellular iPLA2 is completely inhibited by BEL, no effect on LPS-stimulated OA release is observed. In agreement with our data, a recent study by Ito et al. (32.Ito Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2278-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) also failed to detect any effect of BEL on OA release. Thus, these data lend further support to the idea that the group VI iPLA2 may not be involved in cellular signaling in P388D1 macrophages (33.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In support of this view, elegant studies by Murakami et al. (10.Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of iPLA2 in 293 fibroblasts does not modify the AA release response triggered by interleukin-1, but overexpression of either cPLA2, group IIA sPLA2, or group V sPLA2 does result in all cases in an increased AA release in response to interleukin-1 (10.Murakami M.

In summary, we have found that LPS-stimulated P388D1macrophages release OA by a mechanism that involves the hydrolytic actions of both group V sPLA2 and cPLA2 and appears to be strikingly similar to the one previously described for AA release. The one other PLA2 present in these cells (i.e. the group VI iPLA2) appears not to be required for stimulated release. We thank Dr. Edward Mihelich for providing LY311727 and Drs. M. Krimsky and A. Dagan from the laboratory of S. Yedgar for synthesizing the CMPE."
https://openalex.org/W2010880750,"Abstract Pre-steady state partitioning analysis of theHhaI DNA methyltransferase directly demonstrates the catalytic competence of the enzyme·DNA complex and the lack of catalytic competence of the enzyme·S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) complex. The enzyme·AdoMet complex does form, albeit with a 50-fold decrease in affinity compared with the ternary enzyme·AdoMet·DNA complex. These findings reconcile the distinct binding orientations previously observed within the binary enzyme·AdoMet and ternary enzyme·S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine·DNA crystal structures. The affinity of the enzyme for DNA is increased 900-fold in the presence of its cofactor, and the preference for hemimethylated DNA is increased to 12-fold over unmethylated DNA. We suggest that this preference is partially due to the energetic cost of retaining a cavity in place of the 5-methyl moiety in the ternary complex with the unmethylated DNA, as revealed by the corresponding crystal structures. The hemi- and unmethylated substrates alter the fates and lifetimes of discrete enzyme·substrate intermediates during the catalytic cycle. Hemimethylated substrates partition toward product formation versus dissociation significantly more than unmethylated substrates. The mammalian DNA cytosine-C-5 methyltransferase Dnmt1 shows an even more pronounced partitioning toward product formation."

The crystal structure of this aminotransferase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was determined to a resolution of 2.1 Å. ArATPh has a homodimer structure in which each subunit is composed of two domains, in a manner similar to other well characterized aminotransferases. By the least square fit after superposing on a mesophilic ArAT, the ArATPh molecule exhibits a large deviation of the main chain coordinates, three shortened α-helices, an elongated loop connecting two domains, and a long loop transformed from an α-helix, which are all factors that are likely to contribute to its hyperthermostability. The pyridine ring of the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate covalently binding to Lys233 is stacked parallel to F121 on one side and interacts with the geminal dimethyl-CH/π groups of Val201 on the other side. This tight stacking against the pyridine ring probably contributes to the hyperthermostability of ArATPh. Compared with other ArATs, ArATPh has a novel substrate specificity, the order of preference being Tyr > Phe > Glu > Trp > His ≫ Met > Leu > Asp > Asn. Its relatively weak activity against Asp is due to lack of an arginine residue corresponding to Arg292* (where the asterisk indicates that this is a residues supplied by the other subunit of the dimer) in pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase.

To determine temperature dependence, the activities for five sets of substrates, tryptophan-2-ketoglutarate (Trp-2OG), tryptophan-phenylpyruvate (Trp-KetoPhe), histidine-2-ketoglutarate (His-2OG), histidine-phenylpyruvate (His-KetoPhe), and glutamate-phenylpyruvate (Glu-KetoPhe) were measured at different temperatures (25–90 °C) at pH 8.0. Based on the following molar extinction coefficients of 2-oxo acid derivatives, the concentration of the enzymatic products were calculated: at 310 nm, 24.5 and 3200 cm−1m−1 for 2OG and 3-indolepyruvate, respectively, and at 280 nm, 21 and 450 cm−1m−1 for 2OG and KetoPhe (22.Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Aki K. Watanabe Y. Takagi T. Nishigai M. Ikai A. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), respectively. The product from His was monitored at 293 nm using a coefficient difference of 3050 cm−1m−1 obtained to subtract the spectrum for the reaction of histidine with the PLP enzyme from that of the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate enzyme (23.Spolter P.D. Baldridge R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2071-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 nmArATPh, and various concentrations of amino acids or keto-acids. The optimum temperature for ArATPh activity was measured as described previously (24.Marino G. Nitti G. Arnone M.I. Sannia G. Gambacorta A. De Rosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme reaction was carried out in a solution (3.05 ml) containing ArATPh (3.8 nm), l-cysteinsulfinic acid (12.8 mm), 2-oxoglutaric acid (2.0 mm), EDTA (98 μm), and DTNB (1.5 mm) in 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 30–98 °C, and the rate of increase in absorbance at 412 nm because of the reduction of DTNB was monitored for 5 min. For controls, the reactions were performed under the same conditions but without the enzyme. To determine thermostability, the enzyme solutions (0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) were incubated at 95 °C for 90 and 120 min and then autoclaved in sealed Eppendorf tubes at 110 °C for 5, 15, 30, and 90 min. The heated enzymes were assayed in duplicate at 90 °C, as described elsewhere (24.Marino G. Nitti G. Arnone M.I. Sannia G. Gambacorta A. De Rosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the ionization of the internal Schiff base, the absorption spectra of the enzyme at a protein concentration of approximately 20 μm in a 1-cm cell were measured at 25 °C using a Hitachi spectrophotometer (model U-3000). The buffer solution was comprised of 100 mm KCl, 0.01 mm EDTA, and a buffer component of 50 mmMES, 50 mm PIPES, or 50 mm HEPES. The gross conformation and pH stability of ArATPh were studied using CD spectroscopy. The CD spectra of ArATPh, at a protein concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/ml in a 1-mm cell, were measured at 25 °C using a spectropolarimeter (J-720W, Jasco, Japan). The solution was comprised of 100 mm KCl and a buffer component of 50 mmacetate, 20 mm phosphate, 50 mm borate, or 20 mm carbonate. The thermal denaturation curve of ArATPh was measured using a Nano Differential Scanning Calorimeter (CSC5100, Calorimetry Science Co.). Before measurement, the enzyme solution (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and degassed for 15 min using an aspirator. The sample cell was filled with the degassed enzyme solution, and the reference cell was filled with the outer solution from the dialysis. The measurement was performed at a temperature range of 0–125 °C. A scan rate of 1 K/min was used throughout. The denaturation profile was analyzed using Nano differential scanning calorimetry CpCalc data analysis software (Calorimetry Science Co.). Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. An equi-volume of 3 m 1,6-hexane-di-ol solution at pH 7.5 (100 mm HEPES buffer) containing 10 mm MgCl2 was added to a protein solution containing 1.6% ArATPh and 20 μmpyridoxal-5′-phosphate and a 10-μl droplet of the solution was equilibrated with 1 ml of a 3 m 1,6-hexane-di-ol solution. Crystals were grown at room temperature for 1 week. X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out on an Enraf FAST differactometer equipped with a FR571 generator (40 kV, 50 mA; focal spot size, 0.2 mm), and intensity data were collected at a resolution of 2.1 Å for the native crystal and at 3.0 Å for the heavy atom derivatives. The structure was determined using the multiple isomorphous replacement method. A structure model was built on an electron density map calculated with multiple isomorphous replacement phases with a figure of merit of 0.93. The amino acid sequence was unambiguously traced on the map and most of the side chains were identified. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2.1 Å using X-PLOR (25.Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992: 1-269Google Scholar). All coordinates have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank as entry 1DJU. In the substrate-binding model, the coordinates of ArATPh with water molecules were fixed, but the torsion angles of the substrates were changed to find the best fitting configuration to the enzyme. We performed a sequence alignment of 11 aminotransferases within subfamily 1γ using the GeneWorks program (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) based on a PAM-250 scoring matrix.

Phylogenetic trees for the same sequences were constructed using the GeneWorks program based on the unweighted pair group method with an arithmetic mean (37.Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York1987: 293-298Google Scholar). Because we were unable to construct a united alignment among aminotransferases belonging to the subfamilies 1α, 1β, and 1γ from P. horikoshii, other archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes because of a lack of similarity between each subfamily, we made the alignment using 11 candidates belonging to subfamily 1γ to identify its conserved residues. The best alignment was obtained with the five thermophilic aminotransferases shown in Fig. 1. ArATPh showed poor identity to E. coli AspAT (AspATEc) (38.Kuramitsu S. Okuno S. Ogawa T. Ogawa H.

According to these results, ArATPh was nominated to the aminotransferase subfamily Iγ (2.Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3.Jensen R.A. Gu U. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ArATPh was closer to the thermophilic AspATs than to the tyrosine ATs from eukaryotes in subfamily Iγ. The ArATPh gene was abundantly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the recombinant ArATPh comprised 30% of the total protein. After heat treatment at 80 °C for 15 min, which removed most of the endogenousE. coli proteins, the protein was purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography on HiTrap Q and HiLoad Superdex 200 columns. The final preparation of the ArATPh displayed a single band (42 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing indicated a pI value of 5.2 for ArATPh. The N-terminal sequence of the recombinant ArATPh was ALSDRLELVSASEIRKL, which was identical to that deduced from the DNA sequence without the initial methionine residue. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa as estimated by gel filtration on a calibrated TSK gel G2000SWXL column, and a subunit molecular mass of 42 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This suggests that it has a dimeric structure similar to other aminotransferases (24.Marino G. Nitti G. Arnone M.I. Sannia G. Gambacorta A. De Rosa M. J. Biol.

The k app of ArATPh increased steadily in the range of the temperature studied here. The k app forl-cysteinsulfinic acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid as substrates was 1.39 × 102 s−1 at 90 °C and pH 6.5.

The MexA protein is thought to be located at the inner membrane and has been assumed to link the xenobiotics-exporting subunit, MexB, and the outer membrane channel protein, OprM. To verify this assumption, we analyzed membrane anchoring and localization of the MexA protein.n-[9,10-3H]Palmitic acid incorporation experiments revealed that MexA was radiolabeled with palmitic acid, suggesting that the MexA anchors the inner membrane via the fatty acid moiety. To evaluate the role of lipid modification and inner membrane anchoring, we substituted cysteine 24 with phenylalanine or tyrosine and tested whether or not these mutant MexAs function properly. When the mutant mexAs were expressed in the strain lacking chromosomalmexA in the presence ofn-[9,10-3H]palmitic acid, we found undetectable radiolabeling at the MexA band. These transformants restored antibiotic resistance to the level of the wild-type strain, indicating that lipid modification is not essential for MexA function. These mutant strains contained both processed and unprocessed forms of the MexA proteins. Cellular fractionation experiments revealed that an unprocessed form of MexA anchored the inner membrane probably via an uncleaved signal sequence, whereas the processed form was undetectable in the membrane fraction. To assure that the lipid-free MexA polypeptide could be unbound to the membrane, we analyzed the two-dimensional membrane topology by the gene fusion technique. A total of 78 mexA-blaM fusions covering the entire MexA polypeptide were constructed, and all fusion sites were shown to be located at the periplasm. To answer the question of whether or not membrane anchoring is essential for the MexA function, we replaced the signal sequence of the MexA protein with that of the azurin protein, which contains a cleavable signal sequence but no lipid modification site. The signal sequence of the azurin-MexA hybrid protein was properly processed and bore the mature MexA, which was fully recovered in the soluble fraction. The transformant, which expressed azurin-MexA hybrid protein restored the antibiotic resistance to a level indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. We concluded from these results that the MexA protein is fully functional as expressed in the periplasmic space without anchoring the inner membrane.

Problems associated with P. aeruginosa infection are that this organism is naturally resistant to many noxious compounds such as β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline (1.Bryan L.E. Doggett R.G. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Academic Press, London1979: 219-270Google Scholar). Upon exposure to antibiotics, the organism easily elevates the antibiotic resistance to a higher level than the wild type strain (2.Masuda N. Sakagawa E. Ohya S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that both basal and elevated levels of intrinsic multiantibiotic resistance in this organism are mainly attributable to interplay between the antibiotic efflux pumps and low outer membrane permeability (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Among several efflux pumps reported in P. aeruginosa, the MexA, B-OprM pump plays a central role in antibiotic resistance because it is expressed in the wild-type strain and up-regulated upon nalB mutation (5.Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).A MexA,B-OprM pump, encoded by the mexA,B-oprMgenes, consists of two inner membrane-associated components, MexA and MexB, and an outer membrane component, OprM (6.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It has been assumed on the basis of computer-aided structural prediction that MexA belongs to a membrane fusion protein family that is thought to connect the inner and the outer membranes (7.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that each of MexB and OprM functions as an antibiotic-exporting component and an antibiotic exit outer membrane channel, respectively (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Both MexA and OprM have been assumed to be lipoproteins, since they contain a consensus signal sequence for amino-terminal lipid modification, and amino-terminal amino acids seem to be blocked (6.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 9.Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the membrane topology and precise localization of these proteins remain obscure, except for the two-dimensional structure of the MexB protein, which spans the cytoplasmic membrane 12 times and forms 2 large hydrophilic domains extending toward the periplasmic space (10.Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10517-10522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This protein was predicted to function as the substrate-exporting subunit across the cytoplasmic membrane.Computer-aided hydropathy analysis of membrane fusion proteins suggested that they might be highly hydrophilic (7.Dinh T.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Preliminary analyses of the topology of the MexA homologues, such as CzcB ofAlcaligenes eutrophus and CvaA, HlyD, and AcrA ofEscherichia coli, suggested that they might be largely located at the periplasmic space (12.Rensing C.

However, the precise membrane topology and localization of the MexA protein remained unclear. We analyzed whether or not the MexA protein can function without a lipid moiety and report that the lipid-free MexA protein was soluble in the periplasmic space and fully functional in the antibiotic export.DISCUSSIONAll the living organisms may be exposed to the external milieu, which may contain noxious compounds such as surfactants, hydrophobic materials, heavy metals, cytotoxic agents, and drugs. Most, if not all, of them must defend against the hazards of these noxious compounds by several means of detoxification. An efficient way to avoid suffering from such agents would be to lower the intracellular concentration of the noxious compounds by active extrusion. P. aeruginosaappeared to bear the efflux pumps, of which up-regulation renders this bacterium resistance to many antibiotics, dyes, surfactants, and organic solvents (5.Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y.

Since P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium, the efflux pump assembly consists of the inner membrane efflux pump, the outer membrane exit channel, and the membrane fusion protein (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).The MexA subunit of the MexA,B-OprM pump has been assumed to function as the membrane fusion protein, which connects the inner membrane pump, MexB, and the outer membrane exit channel, OprM (7.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The MexA protein contains the lipoprotein consensus sequence at the amino terminus (9.Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yet the biological significance of the lipid modification has remained obscure. We addressed this issue by replacing cysteine 24 with phenylalanine or tyrosine. These MexA variants had both processed and unprocessed forms of MexA (Fig. 2 a), as confirmed by analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence. Strains expressing only the mutant MexA restored an antibiotic susceptibility indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. This result is consistent with the E. coli membrane fusion protein, AcrA, in that modification of the cysteine residue did not grossly affected the function (30.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our result demonstrated unequivocally that lipid modification was not essential for the function of MexA but did not answer the question of whether or not membrane anchoring is essential to the function of MexA.We addressed this issue by constructing a recombinant MexA containing the signal peptide of azurin and found that the signal peptide was properly cleaved and that the mature MexA became a soluble protein (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, MexA protein without a membrane anchor fully functioned for antibiotic export. An analogous experiment has been carried out by subcloning the signal sequence-less acrA gene downstream from the OmpA signal sequence (30.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Since E. colicells harboring this recombinant gene expressed both processed and unprocessed forms of the AcrA proteins, these materials cannot be used to test whether the soluble form of AcrA is functional or not. The periplasmic localization of the entire MexA protein was confirmed by the expression of 78 MexA-β-lactamase fusion proteins (Table III). This result is consistent with topology studies previously carried out for membrane fusion proteins: the ABC transporter in CzcB of A. eutrophus and AcrA, HlyD, and CvaA of E. coli (12.Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Schulein R. Gentscher I. Mollenkopf H-J. Goebel W. Mol. Gen.

Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the investigators constructed only 5, 10, 16, and 11 fusion protein, in CzcB, AcrA, HlyD, and CvaA, respectively (12.Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Schulein R. Gentscher I. Mollenkopf H-J. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 234: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14.Skvirsky R.C. Reginald S. Shen X. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6153-6159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This small number of constructs was not enough to account for the entire length of polypeptides with a molecular mass of about 50 kDa.The function of MexA can be predicted from these results. Two essential functions are conceivable. (i) MexA functions as a hollow, connecting MexB and OprM, forming the antibiotic path. (ii) MexA interacts with MexB, and when MexB pumps out noxious compounds using the transmembrane proton gradient, MexA transmits this energy to OprM and opens the gate, which blocks the OprM channel. The latter possibility is analogous to the function of the TonB protein in ferric ion transport across the outer membrane (31.Silver S. Walderhaug M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 195-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have analyzed the membrane topology of the MexB protein and reported our findings as follows (10.Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10517-10522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). (i) The MexB protein spans the inner membrane 12 times, leaving both amino and carboxyl termini at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. (ii) The 1st and the 4th periplasmic domains contain large polypeptides, consisting of 311 and 314 amino acid residues, respectively, and are extended largely to the periplasmic space. In contrast, the present study revealed that a large part, if not all, of the MexA is exposed to the periplasmic space. Based on these structural analyses of two inner membrane proteins of the MexA, B-OprM pump, we propose the following two topological models. It is conceivable that the MexA protein was held by the largely extended two periplasmic domains of the MexB protein, as illustrated in Fig. 5 a. Based on this assumption, a tight combination of MexA and MexB is essential for interaction with OprM, energy transmission to OprM, and for outward delivery of noxious compounds. Alternatively, the MexA protein may be located over the large periplasmic loops of the MexB protein and may interact with OprM forming a hollow tube (Fig. 5 b). The former model is supported by our previous result that tight coupling of MexA and MexB is essential for pump functioning (32.Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter model is consistent with the hypothesis that the MexA protein forms a noxious compound path tubing, through which the out-coming chemicals can be delivered to the outer membrane protein (8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In any case, either MexB or a combination of MexB and MexA should be able to transmit cellular energy to OprM in order to open the channel gate of OprM. Further investigations are needed to clarify the precise role of individual subunits in the proper function of the MexA, B-OprM pump. Furthermore, the present finding that MexA protein free from the membrane fully functions in the antibiotic export encourages further structural analysis of the MexA, B-OprM pump. Pseudomonas aeruginosa often infects immuno-compromised patients with cancer, dialysis, cystic fibrosis, and transplantation. Problems associated with P. aeruginosa infection are that this organism is naturally resistant to many noxious compounds such as β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline (1.Bryan L.E. Doggett R.G. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Academic Press, London1979: 219-270Google Scholar). Upon exposure to antibiotics, the organism easily elevates the antibiotic resistance to a higher level than the wild type strain (2.Masuda N. Sakagawa E. Ohya S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that both basal and elevated levels of intrinsic multiantibiotic resistance in this organism are mainly attributable to interplay between the antibiotic efflux pumps and low outer membrane permeability (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Among several efflux pumps reported in P. aeruginosa, the MexA, B-OprM pump plays a central role in antibiotic resistance because it is expressed in the wild-type strain and up-regulated upon nalB mutation (5.Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A MexA,B-OprM pump, encoded by the mexA,B-oprMgenes, consists of two inner membrane-associated components, MexA and MexB, and an outer membrane component, OprM (6.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It has been assumed on the basis of computer-aided structural prediction that MexA belongs to a membrane fusion protein family that is thought to connect the inner and the outer membranes (7.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that each of MexB and OprM functions as an antibiotic-exporting component and an antibiotic exit outer membrane channel, respectively (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Both MexA and OprM have been assumed to be lipoproteins, since they contain a consensus signal sequence for amino-terminal lipid modification, and amino-terminal amino acids seem to be blocked (6.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 9.Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the membrane topology and precise localization of these proteins remain obscure, except for the two-dimensional structure of the MexB protein, which spans the cytoplasmic membrane 12 times and forms 2 large hydrophilic domains extending toward the periplasmic space (10.Guan L. Ehrmann M. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10517-10522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This protein was predicted to function as the substrate-exporting subunit across the cytoplasmic membrane. Computer-aided hydropathy analysis of membrane fusion proteins suggested that they might be highly hydrophilic (7.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Preliminary analyses of the topology of the MexA homologues, such as CzcB ofAlcaligenes eutrophus and CvaA, HlyD, and AcrA ofEscherichia coli, suggested that they might be largely located at the periplasmic space (12.Rensing C. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6871-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Schulein R. Gentscher I. Mollenkopf H-J. Goebel W. Mol. Gen.

Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise membrane topology and localization of the MexA protein remained unclear. We analyzed whether or not the MexA protein can function without a lipid moiety and report that the lipid-free MexA protein was soluble in the periplasmic space and fully functional in the antibiotic export. DISCUSSIONAll the living organisms may be exposed to the external milieu, which may contain noxious compounds such as surfactants, hydrophobic materials, heavy metals, cytotoxic agents, and drugs. Most, if not all, of them must defend against the hazards of these noxious compounds by several means of detoxification. An efficient way to avoid suffering from such agents would be to lower the intracellular concentration of the noxious compounds by active extrusion. P. aeruginosaappeared to bear the efflux pumps, of which up-regulation renders this bacterium resistance to many antibiotics, dyes, surfactants, and organic solvents (5.Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J.

Zhao Q. Wada A. Yamasaki T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Since P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium, the efflux pump assembly consists of the inner membrane efflux pump, the outer membrane exit channel, and the membrane fusion protein (3.Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 382-388Crossref Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).The MexA subunit of the MexA,B-OprM pump has been assumed to function as the membrane fusion protein, which connects the inner membrane pump, MexB, and the outer membrane exit channel, OprM (7.Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H.

Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The MexA protein contains the lipoprotein consensus sequence at the amino terminus (9.Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yet the biological significance of the lipid modification has remained obscure. We addressed this issue by replacing cysteine 24 with phenylalanine or tyrosine. These MexA variants had both processed and unprocessed forms of MexA (Fig. 2 a), as confirmed by analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence. Strains expressing only the mutant MexA restored an antibiotic susceptibility indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. This result is consistent with the E. coli membrane fusion protein, AcrA, in that modification of the cysteine residue did not grossly affected the function (30.Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our result demonstrated unequivocally that lipid modification was not essential for the function of MexA but did not answer the question of whether or not membrane anchoring is essential to the function of MexA.We addressed this issue by constructing a recombinant MexA containing the signal peptide of azurin and found that the signal peptide was properly cleaved and that the mature MexA became a soluble protein (Fig. 3).

Based on this assumption, a tight combination of MexA and MexB is essential for interaction with OprM, energy transmission to OprM, and for outward delivery of noxious compounds. Alternatively, the MexA protein may be located over the large periplasmic loops of the MexB protein and may interact with OprM forming a hollow tube (Fig. 5 b). The former model is supported by our previous result that tight coupling of MexA and MexB is essential for pump functioning (32.Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter model is consistent with the hypothesis that the MexA protein forms a noxious compound path tubing, through which the out-coming chemicals can be delivered to the outer membrane protein (8.Ma D. Cook D.N. Hearst J. Nikaido H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In any case, either MexB or a combination of MexB and MexA should be able to transmit cellular energy to OprM in order to open the channel gate of OprM. Further investigations are needed to clarify the precise role of individual subunits in the proper function of the MexA, B-OprM pump. Furthermore, the present finding that MexA protein free from the membrane fully functions in the antibiotic export encourages further structural analysis of the MexA, B-OprM pump. We are grateful to J. K. Broome-Smith at the University of Sussex, UK, for her kind gift of the plasmids pYZ4 and pKM1 and helpful discussion on the gene fusion technique."

We examined the effect of a Gq-coupled receptor on PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling and p70 S6 kinase activation using Rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing the human α1A-adrenergic receptor. Treatment of the cells with phenylephrine, a specific α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, activated p70 S6 kinase but did not activate PI 3-kinase or any of the three known isoforms of Akt. Furthermore, phenylephrine blocked the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and the phosphorylation and activation of Akt-1. The effect of phenylephrine was not confined to signaling pathways that include insulin receptor substrate-1, as the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist also inhibited the platelet-derived growth factor-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt-1. Although increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration with the ionophore A23187 inhibited the activation of Akt-1 by IGF-I, Ca2+does not appear to play a role in the phenylephrine-mediated inhibition of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. The differential ability of phenylephrine and IGF-I to activate Akt-1 resulted in a differential ability to protect cells from UV-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that activation of p70 S6 kinase by the α1A-adrenergic receptor in Rat-1 fibroblasts occurs in the absence of PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling. Furthermore, this receptor negatively regulates the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, resulting in enhanced cell death following apoptotic insult.

Due to its importance in the growth response, the signal transduction pathways leading to activation of p70 S6 kinase have received considerable attention. A variety of experimental approaches have led to the identification of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream effector, the protein kinase Akt, as signaling intermediates that link cell surface receptors to p70 S6 kinase. First, treatment of cells with wortmannin or LY294002, two inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, prevents the activation of Akt (7.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

Second, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor mutants that cannot bind PI 3-kinase were unable to induce efficiently the activation of Akt (7.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

Conversely, expression of dominant-negative mutants of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase inhibits the PDGF-induced activation of Akt (7.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) and p70 S6 kinase (12.Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Akt causes a reduction in insulin-induced activation of p70 S6 kinase (18.Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M.

Together, these results suggest the existence of a linear signaling pathway leading from receptors to PI 3-kinase, Akt and p70 S6 kinase. This pathway is also thought to involve additional components, as Akt does not phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase directly in vitro (21.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Like p70 S6 kinase, Akt is activated by a wide variety of hormones, growth factors, and other stimuli (7.Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 9.Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Akt is thought to mediate many of the cellular effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) on glucose metabolism and cell survival (23.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 24.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). For example, Akt phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3 in cells treated with insulin or IGF-I, thus promoting glycogen synthesis (25.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anti-apoptotic effect of insulin and IGF-I is partly mediated by Akt phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (26.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 27.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the activation loop of the catalytic domain and Ser-473 in the carboxyl-terminal tail (22.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). It is believed that phosphorylation of both sites requires an interaction between the amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of Akt with membrane inositol phospholipids generated by PI 3-kinase (23.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 24.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 28.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Translocation of Akt to the membrane is thought to induce a conformational change that permits phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 by membrane-associated Akt kinases. The kinase that phosphorylates Thr-308 in Akt has been identified as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (29.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 also phosphorylates the equivalent site in some other protein kinases, including p70 S6 kinase (21.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 31.Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In contrast to insulin and IGF-I, treatment of cells with catecholamines to activate α1-adrenergic receptors (ARs) induces glycogenolysis. Three α1-AR subtypes have been cloned (α1A, α1B, and α1D), and all three receptors activate phospholipase C β, which promotes increased production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (32.Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.I. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that α1-ARs also stimulate additional physiologically relevant signaling pathways. For example, treatment of cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes with the α1-AR agonist phenylephrine (PE) leads to activation of p70 S6 kinase and an increase in the rate of protein synthesis and cell growth (33.Boluyt M.O. Zheng J.S. Younes A. Long X. O'Neill L. Silverman H. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Since activation of Akt promotes glycogen synthesis, it seemed inconsistent that α1-ARs, which stimulate glycogen breakdown, would signal to p70 S6 kinase via an Akt-dependent pathway. In this study, we examined this question using Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing the human α1A-AR. We show that treatment of these cells with PE activates p70 S6 kinase but does not activate PI 3-kinase or Akt. Moreover, we show that the α1A-AR inhibits the activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt induced by other growth factors. Finally, we tested whether the differential ability of PE and IGF-I to activate Akt correlates with their ability to protect cells from UV-induced apoptosis. PE and IGF-I were from Sigma. Human recombinant PDGF A/B was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [3H]myo-inositol (10–25 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. PI was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Phospho-specific Akt-1 antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). A23187, rapamycin, LY294002, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Calbiochem. All other reagents of molecular biology grade were obtained from standard commercial sources. Rat-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with the human α1A-AR were a gift from Dr. G. Johnson of Pfizer (34.Kenny B.A. Miller A.M. Williamson I.J. O'Connell J. Chalmers D.H. Naylor A.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before treatment, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16–18 h. For experiments involving Ca2+, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in high salt glucose buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4 and 10 mmglucose) plus either 2 mm EGTA or 1 mmCa2+. Drugs were then added to the buffer at the indicated doses. Akt activity was assayed following a method described previously (35.Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. Cells were scraped off the plate, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Equal amounts of lysate protein were incubated with antibody against Akt-1 (New England Biolabs), Akt-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or Akt-3 (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. The beads were washed 2 times with lysis buffer and once with Akt assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmbenzamidine and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 25 μl of Akt assay buffer containing 40 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Sigma), and 100 μm Akt peptide substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and then an aliquot was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper. Following extensive washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid, radioactivity on the papers was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). S6 kinase activity in cell lysates was measured using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate as described previously (11.Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M. Parker P.J. Ballou L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of 32P incorporated into S6 was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. To measure PI 3-kinase activity, cell lysate (0.5–1 mg of protein) was incubated with 4 μg of PY20 phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) overnight at 4 °C and then with 20 μl protein A-agarose for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with PI 3-kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 μm EDTA). The immunocomplexes were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity essentially as described previously (36.Lin R.Z. Hu Z.W. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31196-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except that micelles of PI were produced by sonication in assay buffer. Reaction products were resolved by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates. Spots containing PI 3-phosphate were scraped off the plate and quantitated by scintillation counting. Cell lysates were prepared as described above, and proteins were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were incubated with primary antibody. After extensive washing the blots were incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and proteins were visualized with the ECL detection kit (NEN Life Science Products). Membranes were stripped by incubating them for 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then reprobed with another primary antibody. Rat-1 cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells per dish. After 24 h the medium was changed to inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol. The cells were allowed to incorporate the label for 48 h, and then they were incubated in serum-free medium for 12 h before treatment with growth factors. Phospholipids were extracted, deacylated, and fractionated on a Whatman Partisphere SAX HPLC column essentially as described previously (37.Carter N. Downes C. Neuroprotocols: A Companion to Methods in Neurosciences. 1993; 3: 107-118Google Scholar). [3H]Inositol present in each column fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Column standards were produced by incubating PI, l-α-PI-4-phosphate (Sigma), orl-α-PI-4,5-bisphosphate (Sigma) with [γ-32P]ATP and PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitated from PDGF-treated cells essentially as described above for the PI 3-kinase assay. The 32P-labeled lipids were extracted, deacylated, and fractionated on the HPLC column as described above. Cells were loaded with 1.2 μm fura-2 AM in high salt glucose buffer plus 1 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C for 30–45 min (38.Zhang B.X. Ma X. McConnell B.K. Damron D.S. Bond M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Loaded cells were washed with fresh buffer to remove the extracellular dye and resuspended in high salt glucose buffer containing either 1 mm Ca2+ or 100 μm EGTA. The 340/380 excitation ratio was measured with a PTI Delta Scan spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Inc., South Brunswick, NJ) using 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission. [Ca2+]i values were calculated according to the equation: [Ca2+]i (nm) =K d(R −R min)/(R max −R), where R is the 340/380 fluorescent ratio;R min and R max are the minimal and maximal fluorescent ratios, respectively; and theK d (dissociation constant) of fura-2 for Ca2+ is taken to be 224 nm (39.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After a stable basal fluorescent ratio was established, the cells were subjected to various treatments. Rat-1 cells expressing the α1A-AR were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish. The next day the medium was removed, and the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then pretreated with or without agonists for 5 min. The medium was then removed, and the cells were exposed to 10 mJ/cm2 of 254 nm UV light, and the medium with or without agonists was replaced. Apoptotic cells were labeled 6 h after irradiation using the fluorescein-based In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed by flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Rat-1 fibroblasts used in this study stably express the human α1A-AR; they do not express endogenous α1-ARs (40.Chen J. Lin R. Hu Z.W. Hoffman B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 1376-1384PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with PE, a selective α1-AR agonist, promoted an increase in S6 kinase activity as measured in whole cell lysates. Maximal activation of approximately 3-fold was reached after 30 min in the presence of 10 μm PE (Fig. 1 A). The degree of stimulation achieved with PE was about 70% that obtained using IGF-I. Concurrent treatment with PE plus IGF-I did not lead to an additive effect but rather to a level of kinase activity that was lower than that obtained with IGF-I alone (Fig. 1 A). The PE-induced increase in S6 kinase activity was almost completely blocked by pretreatment of cells with the immunosuppressant rapamycin (Fig.1 B), indicating that the activated S6 kinase is p70 S6 kinase and not Rsk (41.Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have previously shown that PE does not activate Erk1/2 or Rsk2 in these cells (42.Lin R.Z. Chen J. Hu Z.W. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30033-30038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of p70 S6 kinase by PE was abolished in cells pretreated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1 B). We next asked whether the α1A-AR signals to p70 S6 kinase via a PKC-dependent pathway. Down-regulation of PKC by long term treatment with PMA had no effect on the subsequent activation of p70 S6 kinase by PE, whereas activation induced by a 30-min treatment with PMA was lost (Fig. 1 C). Thus, signaling to p70 S6 kinase by the α1A-AR appears to require PI 3-kinase but not PKC. As outlined in the Introduction, a variety of evidence suggests that PI 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt act upstream of p70 S6 kinase in signaling pathways activated by extracellular ligands. If this is the case, then PE treatment of Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing the α1A-AR should cause an increase in Akt activity. This hypothesis was tested by performing Akt immunocomplex kinase assays on lysates prepared from cells treated for 5 min with or without PE. Surprisingly, no increase in Akt-1 activity was detected in cells treated with PE (Fig. 2 A). Exposure of cells to PE for a longer time (up to 30 min; see Fig.5 B) or at a higher concentration (100 μm; data not shown) did not lead to a measurable activation of Akt-1. By contrast, treatment with IGF-I caused a large increase (approximately 11-fold) in Akt-1 activity (Fig. 2 A). To assess the possibility that the α1A-AR might activate one of the other two known isoforms of Akt, we also performed immunocomplex kinase assays of Akt-2 and Akt-3. The basal Akt-2 activity was about 4 times higher than that of Akt-1 or Akt-3 in untreated cells, and treatment with PE or IGF-I induced no further increase in Akt-2 activity (Fig.2 A). Little or no activation of Akt-2 by insulin has been observed in other cell types (43.Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of Akt-2 in these Rat-1 cells (data not shown). Immunocomplex kinase assays revealed that, similar to Akt-1, IGF-I stimulated a 9-fold increase in Akt-3 activity, whereas PE had no effect (Fig.2 A).Figure 5Inhibitory effect of PE on PDGF-induced PI 3-kinase activation. A, cells were treated for the indicated times with 50 ng/ml PDGF in the presence or absence of 10 μm PE, and PI 3-kinase activity was measured in phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data are plotted as the percentage increase over basal PI 3-kinase activity measured in untreated control cells. B, cells were treated for 30 min with 10 μm PE, 50 ng/ml PDGF, or both agonists together, and Akt-1 activity was measured in immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results were unexpected because activation of p70 S6 kinase in response to PE treatment was sensitive to LY294002 (Fig.1 B), implying that PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling participates in this response. To resolve this apparent contradiction, PI 3-kinase activity was directly measured by analyzing the production of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in cells treated with PE. Rat-1 fibroblasts grown in the presence of [3H]myo-inositol were treated with or without agonists and 3H-labeled phospholipids were analyzed by HPLC. The amount of PI 3,4-bisphosphate and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate recovered from cells simulated with PE was not increased above the control levels, whereas PDGF induced more than a 2-fold increase in the amount of both of these phospholipids (Fig.2 B). Together, these results show that PE induces a significant activation of p70 S6 kinase without a corresponding increase in Akt or PI 3-kinase activity in these cells. Akt has been proposed to play an important role in insulin-induced glycogen synthesis (25.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Since physiological stress induces a relatively insulin-resistant state, we wondered whether catecholamines might negatively regulate insulin signaling to Akt. We found that IGF-I-induced Akt-1 kinase activation was strongly suppressed in cells co-treated with PE (Fig.3 A). Activation of Akt-1 is associated with phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the catalytic domain and Ser-473 in the carboxyl-terminal tail (22.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). We used Western blots probed with antibodies that specifically recognize these phosphorylated residues to examine further the activation state of Akt-1 in cells treated with IGF-I and PE. As shown in Fig. 3 B (upper two panels), Akt-1 in untreated cells was not phosphorylated at either Thr-308 or Ser-473, and IGF-I strongly stimulated the phosphorylation of both residues. In contrast, cells treated with PE contained no detectable phospho-Thr-308 or phospho-Ser-473. In cells treated with IGF-I plus PE, the phosphate content of both residues was"

The role of CydR in regulating cydAB expression in the supposedly anoxic cytoplasm of A. vinelandii and similarities to cydAB regulation by Fnr in Escherichia coli are discussed. base pair(s) glutathione S-transferase Azotobacter vinelandii is an obligate aerobe that fixes nitrogen under a wide range of oxygen concentrations, even at air saturation (1.Poole R.K. Hill S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nitrogen fixation is an energy-demanding process that consumes 16 mol of ATP to convert 1 mol of N2 to 2 mol of NH3 (2.Kim J. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This energy requirement can be met only by aerobic respiration, yet paradoxically, nitrogenase is notoriously sensitive to oxygen damage (3.Robson R.L. Postgate J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). One way to avoid this damage is “respiratory protection,” i.e. the rapid utilization of oxygen to achieve subinhibitory levels of oxygen, thus allowing the coexistence in a cell of aerobic respiration and nitrogenase activity (1.Poole R.K. Hill S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4.Hill S. Stacey G. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1992: 86-133Google Scholar). To scavenge traces of oxygen yet consume excess oxygen, A. vinelandii has a branched respiratory chain with at least two routes of electron transport to oxygen (1.Poole R.K. Hill S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One branch is terminated by an oxidase closely resembling the cytochrome bd-type oxidase of Escherichia coli and certain other bacteria (5.Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6.Poole R.K. Anthony C. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 231-291Google Scholar). The oxidase comprises a low-spin cytochrome b 558and two ligand-binding hemes, cytochromes d andb 595 (previously called cytochromea 1 (8.Haddock B.A. Jones C.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 47-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) (7.D'mello R. Palmer S. Hill S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 115-120Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another respiratory branch is terminated by an oxidase of the heme-copper superfamily (9.Leung D. Van Der Oost J. Kelly M. Saraste M. Hill S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is probably the oxidase referred to previously as cytochrome o(8.Haddock B.A. Jones C.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 47-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yang T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 848: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, a gene fragment from A. vinelandii has been independently sequenced and shown to resemble fixN orccoN encoding a cb-type cytochrome coxidase (11.Thöny-Meyer L. Beck C. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome o are distinct oxidases. Direct evidence for the essential role of cytochrome bd in respiratory protection of nitrogenase and the first molecular genetic analysis of respiratory metabolism in A. vinelandii were provided by Kelly et al. (12.Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who obtained mutants with transposon insertions in and around that region of the genome homologous to the E. coli cydAB genes. One class of mutants had insertions within the cydAB operon, had no spectroscopically detectable cytochrome bd, and significantly, could not fix nitrogen in air. Sequencing of the entirecydAB operon (13.Moshiri F. Chawla A. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6230-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed striking similarities to theE. coli cytochrome bd-type oxidase, in accord with spectral studies (5.Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6.Poole R.K. Anthony C. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 231-291Google Scholar, 7.D'mello R.

Purification of A. vinelandii cytochrome bd (15.Kolonay J.F. Moshiri F. Gennis R.B. Kaysser T.M. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4177-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Junemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16213-16220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) confirmed similarities in subunit composition, complement of redox centers, and reaction mechanisms in these bacteria. However, a remarkable difference between the E. coli and A. vinelandii oxidases is that the former is synthesized maximally microaerobically (17.Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Niedhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella : Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar), whereas synthesis of the A. vinelandii oxidase increases with oxygen supply (1.Poole R.K. Hill S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18.D'mello R. Leung D. Poole R.K. Hill S. Microbiology. 1996; 143: 231-237Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, and consistent with the patterns of regulation, cytochrome bd in A. vinelandii has a surprisingly low affinity for oxygen (apparent K m∼ 4.5 μm) (14.D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1395-1402Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), unlike the oxidase in E. coli, which has the highest affinity yet recorded (K m as low as 5 nm) for a terminal oxidase (19.D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An explanation of the different responses in these bacteria of oxidase expression to oxygen supply is now beginning to emerge. In E. coli, regulation of cytochrome bd expression is complex and coordinated by the ArcAB two-component system and by Fnr, major global regulators of the aerobic/anaerobic switch (20.Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar, 21.Sawers G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ArcA activates cydAB gene expression at low-oxygen tensions (22.Iuchi S. Chepuri V. Fu H.-A. Gennis R.B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23.Cotter P.A. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 91: 31-36Crossref Google Scholar). As oxygen tension falls farther, Fnr is activated and repressescydAB expression (24.Tseng C.-P. Albrecht J. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified twocydAB promoters, but the roles played by Fnr and ArcA have not been fully elucidated. Lynch and Lin (25.Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found three sites for ArcA, one of which (site III) was located downstream of the previously identified cydAB promoter P1 (referred to hereafter as P1). A second promoter was found downstream of this site, but could not be detected by analysis of RNA extracted from aerobically grown cells, suggesting that cydAB P1 is used preferentially under such conditions. It was suggested that ArcA-P (i.e. the active phosphorylated form) bound at site III activates cydABanoxically when Fnr prevents transcription from P1 (25.Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Cotter et al. (26.Cotter P.A. Melville S.B. Albrecht J.A. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a single site for ArcA-P upstream of P1 was sufficient for activation of cydABexpression. Significantly, two sites for Fnr were found, one at the start of cydAB transcription at P1 and another centered 53.5 bp1 upstream of the +1 site of P1. Thus, collectively, ArcA and Fnr afford maximal cydABexpression in E. coli growing in microaerobic environments, consistent with the finding that this quinol oxidase has a remarkably high affinity for oxygen (19.D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A simpler pattern of cydAB expression in response to oxygen availability is observed at the physiological level in A. vinelandii. In this strict aerobe, cydAB transcription is up-regulated as the oxygen tension, and thus danger of nitrogenase damage, increases (1.Poole R.K. Hill S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 3.Robson R.L. Postgate J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 4.Hill S. Stacey G.

Mutagenesis in the region of theA. vinelandii genome upstream of the cydAB genes revealed a region in which insertions resulted in marked overproduction of the cytochrome bd complex (12.Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants failed to grow in a microaerobic atmosphere (1.5% O2) on defined medium either containing (BSN medium) or lacking (BS medium) a supply of fixed nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions (12.Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region, separated from the downstream cydAB operon by ∼1 kilobase pair, was sequenced by Wu et al. (27.Wu G. Hill S. Kelly M.J.S. Sawers G. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and revealed a gene whose deduced product is highly similar to Fnr. The gene was namedcydR (a) to indicate clearly its role in theregulation of the cyd operon (this being the only operon in A. vinelandii so far demonstrated to be CydR-regulated) and (b) because the termfnr appears inappropriate since neither fumarate nor nitrate respiration occurs in A. vinelandii (27.Wu G. Hill S. Kelly M.J.S. Sawers G. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was postulated that CydR is a repressor ofcydAB transcription (27.Wu G. Hill S. Kelly M.J.S. Sawers G. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fnr senses anaerobiosis via an oxygen-labile [4Fe-4S]2+cluster that promotes dimerization of the protein and enhances site-specific DNA binding (20.Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Homologues of Fnr control a variety of physiological functions in a diverse range of phylogenetically distinct prokaryotes (21.Sawers G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They are characterized by the presence of four essential cysteine residues that act as ligands for the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster and the amino acid sequence EXXSR in the DNA-binding region, which confers specificity for the Fnr “box” or -binding site with the consensus sequence TTGAT . . . . . ATCAA. Both of these features are conserved in CydR. In this paper, purified CydR is shown to be an oxygen-responsive, DNA-binding, Fnr-like protein that is exceptionally oxygen-labile. Furthermore, it is shown for the first time that this member of the Fnr family is also responsive to nitric oxide, with wide implications for regulation of gene expression by Fnr-like proteins and probably several other Fe-S proteins.

To prepare high-quality DNA for footprinting, the wild-type and mutated promoter sequences were finally cloned into the Promega pGEM-T-Easy vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids pRKP1025 (wild-type), pRKP1026 (mutated +1 site), pRKP1028 (mutated −50.5 site), and pRKP1029 (both sites mutated) were thus obtained (Table I). The insert in pRKP1028 is in the opposite orientation from that in the other three. DNA fragments containing wild-type and mutated CydR-binding sites were isolated from plasmids pRKP1025, pRKP1026, and pRKP1029 after cutting withBamHI-ApaI and from pRKP1028 after cutting withBamHI-SacI. The cydABtranscript was mapped by extracting total RNA by the hot phenol method (33.Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from a culture of A. vinelandii strain MK8. This strain carries a Tn5-B20 mutation in cydR and consequently overproduces cytochrome bd (12.Kelly M.J.S. Poole R.K. Yates M.G. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Wu G. Hill S. Kelly M.J.S. Sawers G. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); it was grown under conditions of high aeration (50 ml of culture in a 1-liter conical flask shaken at 200 rpm) for 7 h before harvest. Primer extension was performed according to Yagüe et al.(34.Yagüe E. Wood D.A. Thurston C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The primer used was purified by running a 15% sequencing gel, and the band was visualized using a “shadowing technique” against the background of a thin-layer chromatographic plate under UV light and isolated from the gel using standard procedures (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten ng of 5′-end-labeled 34-mer oligonucleotide RP141 (5′-AAGATTGGGATGGTTTAGACATGTGGGCAGCTCCAA-3′) were mixed with 5 μg of total RNA in 30 μl of primer extension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each dNTP, and 0.5 mm spermidine), heated at 75 °C for 3 min, and then cooled at room temperature for 10 min. Twenty units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, RNase H−) containing sodium pyrophosphate (1.8 μl of a 125 mm solution) were added to the annealed primer/RNA. The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 30 min, and the nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in formamide loading dye and resolved on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. The sizes of the primer-extended products were determined by running a known sequence ladder (M13mp18 DNA sequenced with the M13 −40 primer; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in parallel. To clone cydR into the pGEX-KG vector, a NcoI site was introduced at the ATG initiation codon of cydR on plasmid pGW33 (Table I) using site-directed mutagenesis directed by oligonucleotides RP34 (5′-CAGAGAAAGTTGCCCATGGCGGATAAATCC-3′) and RP35 (complementary to RP34). These primers additionally result in changes in the first two amino acid residues of CydR from Met-Ser to Met-Ala. The NcoI-HindIII fragment from pGW33 was then cloned into pGEX-KG to give plasmid pRKP1082. CydR was purified from French press extracts of aerobic cultures of E. colistrain RKP3363 (DH5α containing plasmid pRKP1082) grown in 2× YT broth (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) plus ampicillin (200 mg/liter). Three h after inoculation with an overnight culture (1.6% of the final volume), the expression of GST-CydR was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mmfinal concentration) during the exponential phase of growth. Cells were harvested after a further 4 h of growth. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to adsorb the GST-CydR fusion protein according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl and 138 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (10× the resin bed volume), and CydR was cleaved from GST by thrombin protease by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. For reconstitution of CydR (30.Green J. Bennett B. Jordan P. Ralph E.T. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), NifS (purified from A. vinelandii) and dithiothreitol (2.5 mm final concentration) were added to the purified CydR protein, and the mixture was flushed with O2-free nitrogen gas for 1 h. Cysteine (1 mm final concentration) and (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O (10 mol of iron/mol of CydR monomer) were added to the mixture in an Mk3 Anaerobic Work station (Don Whitley Scientific Ltd, Shipley, England). The reconstitution was monitored spectrophotometrically. Upon completion, CydR was separated from excess cysteine, iron, dithiothreitol, and residual nucleic acid (see below) by passing through a column packed with Toyopearl ether-650M hydrophobic interaction resin, which was first washed with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0) (low-salt buffer; 5–10× the resin bed volume) and then equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) plus 1.7m (NH4)2SO4 (high-salt buffer). The reconstituted CydR protein containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 was loaded on the column, which was washed with high-salt buffer (5× resin bed volume), and finally eluted with low-salt buffer (200 μl at a time). Acid-labile sulfur in denatured CydR samples was determined by the method of Beinert (35.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) in the anaerobic cabinet. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad dye binding procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A Beckman DU Series 600 spectrophotometer or a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer with Winlab software was used for optical spectroscopy. CydR samples were transferred from the anaerobic cabinet in sealed cuvettes. Air-saturated H2O (∼230 μm O2at 23 °C) and freshly prepared NO solution (∼1.9 mm in H2O at room temperature) prepared as described by Pooleet al. (36.Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernández J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) were added to the sample by injection in the anaerobic cabinet. For determining CydR binding to thecydAB promoter, reconstituted CydR protein was diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and incubated anaerobically for 10 min with labeled promoter DNA (20–50 counts/min/μl), 150 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and band-shift buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl) in a final volume of 5 μl. Sensitivity of CydR to O2 was studied by preincubation of 10 μm protein (monomer) for 20 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) in the presence of mixtures of anoxic water and air-saturated water to give final concentrations of up to 60 μm O2. Sensitivity of CydR to NO was studied similarly, but in anoxic aqueous solutions of NO or NaNO2to give final concentrations of up to 60 μm NO or NaNO2. Superoxide dismutase (5 units; Sigma) and/or catalase (5 units; Sigma) was added to these reactions where indicated. O2 concentrations quoted refer to those in the preincubation mixture, not to the incubation with DNA. To allow CydR·DNA complex formation, 1-μl samples of the reactions were then incubated for 10 min as described above in a final volume of 5 μl. The loading of samples was performed at a voltage of 20 V after pre-running at 120 V for 5 min. Promoter DNA and purified CydR-protein interactions were visualized on 5% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) buffered with 25 mm Tris and 250 mm glycine (pH 8.3). The gel was run for ∼1 h at 60 mA (for two gels). Quantitation of shifted and non-shifted bands was performed by determining density expressed as counts/mm2using a Bio-Rad Model GS-S25 Molecular Imager® system. DNase I footprinting using purified CydR and DNA restriction fragments containing the cydABpromoter was performed according to Green et al. (28.Green J. Trageser M. Six S. Unden G. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 1310: 137-144Google Scholar) and Rhodes (37.Rhodes D. Creighton T. Protein Function. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1989: 186-195Google Scholar), except that reactions were not extracted with phenol/chloroform. The details of the binding conditions are presented under “Results.” The C lane was included as a sequence reference to determine the location of the binding sites. It has been reported (38.Moshiri F. Smith E.G. Taormino J.P. Maier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23169-23174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the cydA and cydBgenes are cotranscribed and that the transcriptional start site is ∼275 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon of cydA. An oligonucleotide (RP141) starting 188 bp upstream of thecydAB ATG initiation codon was therefore used for primer extension experiments. Fig. 1 shows that the transcriptional start site is actually 268–269 bp upstream of the ATG codon of cydA. Putative −10 and −35 regions were sought. The sequence TTTATT (labeled “−10” in Fig. 4; see later) has four matches with the −10 motif (TATAAT) characteristic of E. colipromoters transcribed by the major ς70 complex of the RNA polymerase. On the basis of ribonuclease protection analysis, Moshiriet al. (38.Moshiri F. Smith E.G. Taormino J.P. Maier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23169-23174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified the sequence GTAAAT as the probable −10 site, having three matches with the consensus sequence. These workers also tentatively identified a −35 sequence (TGGTCA) that also has four matches with the E. coli consensus sequence TTGACA. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the gap between our −10 sequence and the putative −35 sequence is 24 bp, considerably exceeding the usual distance in E. coli, for example, of 17 bp. Two sequences similar to the E. coli Fnr boxes (TTGAT . . . . . ATCAA) were located in the promoter region ofcydAB (see Fig. 4 below), which we designate here as the +1 CydR box (TTGAC . . . . . ATCAA) and the −50.5 CydR box (TTGAC. . . . . GTCAA), the latter being centered 50.5 bp away from the more upstream G marked in Fig. 4. The +1 site has one mismatch compared with the Fnr consensus sequence (39.Spiro S. Guest J.R. Trends Bioch"

We report here the characterization of a novel cellular factor sharing homology with the specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the basic helix-loop-helix repressor protein I-mfa. The synthesis of this new factor, called HIC for Human I-mfa domain-Containing protein, is controlled at the translational level by two different codons, an ATG and an upstream non-ATG translational initiator, allowing the production of two protein isoforms, p32 and p40, respectively. We show that the HIC protein isoforms present different subcellular localizations, p32 being mainly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas p40 is targeted to the nucleolus. Moreover, in trying to understand the function of HIC, we have found that both isoforms stimulate in T-cells the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I-long terminal repeat in the presence of the viral transactivator Tax. We demonstrate by mutagenesis that the I-mfa-like domain of HIC is involved in this regulation. Finally, we also show that HIC is able to down-regulate the luciferase expression from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat induced by the viral transactivator Tat.

However, these infections lead to two extremely different diseases. Infection with HTLV-I results in dysregulation of T-cell proliferation, sometimes causing the development of adult T-cell leukemia. By contrast, infection with HIV-1 causes the loss of T-cells, resulting in systemic immunosuppression and development of AIDS. Characterization of molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions between viral and cellular components contributes to understanding why HTLV-I and HIV-1 have different effects on the infected T-cell growth. For instance, the transcriptional regulators used by T-cells to control cell function are used differently by HTLV-I and HIV-1 to regulate expression of their genome. Both retroviruses utilize the cellular RNA polymerase II to transcribe their genome (1.Chun R.F. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins regulate cell determination and differentiation during embryogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 32.Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar and 33.Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). For example, the cell fate of skeletal muscle precursors is regulated by the MyoD subfamily of bHLH factors includingMyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (33.Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar,34.Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). bHLH proteins are also involved in lineage commitment and differentiation as Mash2 and Hand1, which play a role in trophoblast development (35.Guillemot F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 36.Firulli A.B. McFadden D.G. Lin Q. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nat.

The activity of bHLH factors is regulated to achieve the coordinated expression of genes during development. Recently, a novel myogenic repressor has been identified called I-mfa for Inhibitor of MyoD family (38.Chen C.-M.A. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 39.Kraut N. Snider L. Chen C.-M.A. Tapscott S.J. Groudine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6276-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). I-mfa is generated with two additional proteins, I-mfb and I-mfc, by alternative splicing (38.Chen C.-M.A. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The three I-mf proteins share a common N-terminal region, but each has a different C terminus, the I-mfa-specific C terminus being characterized by a high content of cysteines. I-mfa is distributed mainly throughout the cytoplasm, although it is also detectable in the nucleus (38.Chen C.-M.A. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). I-mfa inhibits myogenic bHLH proteins by retaining them in the cytoplasm and by interfering with their DNA binding activity in the nucleus (38.Chen C.-M.A. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). I-mfa is also able to inhibit the transactivation activity of Mash2 and plays an important role in trophoblast and chondrogenic differentiation (39.Kraut N. Snider L. Chen C.-M.A. Tapscott S.J. Groudine M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6276-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the functions of I-mfb and I-mfc still remain unclear. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a human cDNA clone encoding a novel protein, which exists in two isoforms differing by the presence or absence of a basic amino acid-rich N-terminal domain and by their localization in the cell. Both isoforms contain a common C terminus sharing homology with the specific C-terminal domain of I-mfa. We show that this new factor, called HIC for human I-mfa domain-containing protein, stimulates the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the HTLV-I LTR in the presence of Tax. By using mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the I-mfa-like domain of HIC is required to stimulate luciferase expression. Finally, we also show that HIC is able to down-regulate expression from HIV-1 LTR in the presence of Tat. From these results, we propose that HIC and I-mfa represent a new family of proteins regulating gene expression and are characterized by the presence of a specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Our results also suggest that HIC could differently regulate expression of HTLV-I and HIV-1 genomes. HIC cDNA clones were first isolated from a MT-2 cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid approach. MT-2 cDNA fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the pGAD10 vector (20.Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was screened by using the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 as a bait fused to the LEXA DNA binding domain of the pBTM116 vector. The two-hybrid screen was performed as already described (20.Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 reporter strain. The multiple tissue Northern blot and the human spleen cDNA library cloned into λgt11 were purchased from CLONTECH. RNA hybridization and library screening were performed as described by the manufacturer. The HIC cDNA encompassing the nucleotides from position 1148 to 1639 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the method of random priming and was used as a probe. All the different HIC cDNAs cloned into pSPORT 1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine by using the TNT T7 coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system of Promega. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. pHIC-1 corresponds to anSalI-SpeI fragment that contains the first 1532 bp of the HIC cDNA subcloned into pSPORT 1. The 5′-deleted plasmids, pHIC-2, -3, -4, and -5, were either constructed by restriction endonuclease digestion and religation of pHIC-1 or generated by PCR amplification on pHIC-1 and subcloned into pSPORT 1. Templates where CTG or GTG were mutated were also generated by PCR amplification; CTG at position 246 was transformed into ATG (pHIC-I-atg) or CGG (pHIC-I-cgg), GTG at position 264 into ATG (pHIC-II-atg) or CGG (pHIC-II-cgg), and CTG at position 321 into ATG (pHIC-III-atg). To express HIC p32 and p40 with a GFP ormyc tag, the complete coding sequences of both proteins were subcloned into the vectors pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), and pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His (Invitrogen). We also cloned an NheI-KpnI fragment of HIC cDNA (from position 95 to 1328) into pEGFP-N1 to analyze the production of HIC protein isoforms in vivo from the wild type leader. COS7 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method with 20 μg of expression vector. Cells were cultivated on the glass slides and then analyzed by fluorescence 24 h after transfection. p32 and p40 tagged with themyc epitope were detected by using the anti-mycmonoclonal antibody purchased from Sigma and goat anti-mouse immunoglobin G antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Analysis of the green, red, and yellow fluorescence was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. The coding sequences of p32 and p40 were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). The plasmid pcDNA3.1/His-HICΔ, which contains the entire coding sequence of p40 except for the I-mfa-like domain, was constructed by digesting p40 cDNA cloned into pcDNA3.1/His with EcoRV and XhoI. The resulting digest was treated with Klenow and religated as blunt ends. This approach resulted in the deletion of the last 101 amino acids. The Tat and Tax expression vectors, pBg312HIV-1Lai-Tat and pSG-Tax, respectively, have been described previously (40.Hirsch I. Spire B. Tsunetsugu-Yokota Y. Neuveut C. Sire J. Chermann J.C. Virology. 1990; 177: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41.Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CEM cells were transiently cotransfected according to the procedure published previously (42.Lemasson I. Thébault S. Sardet C. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23598-23604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 5 μg of pACβ1 (β-galactosidase-containing reference plasmid) was included in each transfection for controlling the transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was the same, the balance being made up with empty pcDNA3.1/His. Cell extracts equalized for protein content were used for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. For the assays with the GAL4-binding site promoter-reporter plasmid, HIC (amino acids 120 to 355), Tax, and Tat were fused in frame with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (cloned into pBIND vector, Promega). Cotransfection assays were performed in CEM cells in the presence of the luciferase reporter plasmid pG5luc containing five GAL4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box. Protein extracts were electrophoresed onto SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-10% PAGE) and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blot was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk) prior to addition of antiserum. After 2 h at 20 °C, the blot was washed three times with 0.5% phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-peroxidase conjugate (Immunotech, Marseille, France). After three washes, the membrane was incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was then exposed for 0.5 to 5 min to hyperfilms-ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-Xpress serum was purchased from Invitrogen and recognizes the tag found in the Xpress leader peptide in the vector pcDNA3.1/His. The anti-HIC serum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with purified His6-tagged HIC polypeptide corresponding to the first 163 amino acids of p32. HIC cDNA was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The N-terminal His6-tagged protein was purified as described by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation assay was carried out as described previously (43.Coudronnière N. Corbeil J. Robert-Hebmann V. Mesnard J.-M. Devaux C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Two cDNA clones coding, respectively, for the last 60 and 153 C-terminal amino acids of a novel protein were isolated from an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line cDNA library (20.Gachon F. Péléraux A. Thébault S. Dick J. Lemasson I. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8332-8337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the predicted polypeptide presented homologies with the specific C-terminal domain of I-mfa, a cellular factor known to be a bHLH repressor, we decided to characterize further this novel protein. At first, the tissue distribution of the mRNA coding for this novel HIC protein was analyzed. All the tested lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes) expressed an mRNA of about 4.4 kb (Fig. 1). This mRNA is not specific to lymphoid tissues since it is expressed in prostate, uterus, and small intestine. Finally, it is almost absent in testis and colon. From these observations, we decided to screen a human spleen cDNA library cloned into λgt11 to characterize the complete sequence of HIC cDNA. By this approach, we were able to isolate a 4,152-bp full-length HIC cDNA that was completely sequenced (GenBankTM number AF054589). The full-length HIC cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 246 amino acids if the ATG at position 591 is the initiation codon (Fig. 2). We examined the proteins synthesized in a cell-free system with a cDNA containing the first 1532 nucleotides of HIC sequence (the stop codon TAA is at position 1329; see Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE of the translational products effectively revealed a protein of 32 kDa, p32, but also an unexpected product of 40 kDa, p40 (Fig. 3 a, lane pHIC-1). To determine the origin of both polypeptides, a series of 5′ truncation mutants of pHIC-1 was generated. These experiments (Fig.3) demonstrated that p32 translation initiation was located between position 393 and 617 (compare the lanes pHIC-3 andpHIC-5) suggesting that ATG at position 591 could be an initiation codon. To confirm this hypothesis, the entire region 5′ to this ATG was deleted. SDS-PAGE of the translation products synthesized from this template revealed one major protein of 32 kDa (lane pHIC-4) indicating that the first ATG effectively is the initiation codon involved in p32 synthesis.Figure 3Mapping of the translation initiation sites of the HIC cDNA clone with a cell-free system. a, all mRNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with either an HIC cDNA clone containing the first 1532 bp or PCR-generated DNAs as templates for transcription. [35S]Methionine and [35S]cysteine were used in translation reactions to label proteins. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 35S-Labeled p40 and p32 are designated byarrows. Molecular size markers in kilodaltons are shown on the right. The exact start of the different HIC constructs are shown in b below the autoradiographs.b, nucleic acid sequence of the 5′ end of the HIC cDNA clone. The stop codon TAG at position 171 and the putative initiation codons are indicated in bold. The exact position of the 5′ end of the different HIC cDNA clones is indicated by anarrow. pHIC-1 and the 5′ deleted plasmids, pHIC-2, -3, -4, and -5, encode the wild type nucleotide sequence of HIC cDNA. For the other deleted constructs, the 5′ end was modified as follows: CTG at position 246 was transformed into ATG (pHIC-I-atg) or CGG (pHIC-I-cgg), GTG at position 264 into ATG (pHIC-II-atg) or CGG (pHIC-II-cgg), and CTG at position 321 into ATG (pHIC-III-atg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the other hand, from the template pHIC-3, p40 was no longer synthesized, whereas it was still produced from pHIC-2 (Fig.3 a). This observation suggests that the HIC cDNA clone contains another initiation site upstream of the first ATG, located between positions 174 and 393. There are many examples of proteins where codons other than ATG are initiation codons (44.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Boeck R. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3608-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 46.Drabkin H.J. Rajbhandary U.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5140-5147Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In human cells, TTG and CTG have been found as initiation codons. To determine whether one or both CTG located upstream of the ATG (Fig.3 b) could be translational initiator, templates starting at positions 246 or 321, where CTG was transformed into ATG (respectively, pHIC-I-atg and pHIC-III-atg), were constructed. Only the ATG which starts at position 246 generated a 40-kDa major product that could correspond to p40 (Fig. 3 a, lane pHIC-I-atg). However, when the CTG at position 246 was mutated into a non-initiation codon (CGG), p40 was still synthesized (Fig. 3 a, lane pHIC-I-cgg). Based on these results, it appears that both CTGs are not initiation codons and that the initiation codon must be contained within the nucleotide region between position 246 and 321. In this region, only the GTG located at position 264 belongs to the non-ATG codons known to be able to initiate translation in mammalian cells. For this reason, this GTG was mutated into ATG or CGG corresponding, respectively, to the plasmids pHIC-II-atg and pHIC-II-cgg (Fig. 3 b). From pHIC-II-atg a 40-kDa protein was produced, whereas the synthesis of this product was abolished with pHIC-II-cgg (Fig. 3 a). This result clearly demonstrates that the GTG at position 264 is initiator in our cell-free system. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that HIC mRNA codes for two protein isoforms, p32 and p40, synthesized from two different initiation codons as follows: a standard ATG initiator for p32, and a GTG located upstream of the ATG for p40. p32 and p40 only differ by the presence of a N-terminal sequence containing two basic subdomains (Fig.4 a). Moreover, their common C-terminal region shares 77% identical amino acids with the specific C-terminal domain of I-mfa (Fig. 4 b). Next we investigated the subcellular localization of both HIC protein isoforms in vivo. COS7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing p32 or p40 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), fused either to their N-terminal end or their C-terminal end. As shown in Fig.5, the position of the GFP tag apparently has no influence on the localization of the HIC proteins. p32 is distributed primarily throughout the cytoplasm, although weak staining is detectable in the nucleus (Fig. 5, a and c). Two different cytoplasmic patterns of p32 localization are observed, a diffuse (Fig. 5, a and c) and a bright punctate staining (Fig. 5, b and d). p40 also exhibits a granular distribution in the cytoplasm, but in addition, it shows a staining pattern in the nucleus, localized around and in the nucleoli (Fig. 5, e and f). To be certain that the GFP tag did not influence their localization, p32 and p40 were fused to a smaller tag, containing either themyc epitope fused to their C-terminal end (Fig.6) or the X-press leader peptide fused to their N-terminal end (data not shown). In COS7 cells transfected with these constructs, p32 and p40 give the same staining pattern as that observed with the GFP tag (compare Fig. 5 and 6). In conclusion, p32 is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas p40 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Moreover, p32 is distributed in both a diffuse and a punctate staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm. We do not know why two different patterns are observed with p32. However, preliminary data 2S. Thébault, unpublished results. suggest that the I-mfa-like domain of HIC could be involved in the formation of these cytoplasmic granular structures. To raise polyclonal antibodies against HIC, rabbits were immunized with highly purified HIC polypeptide corresponding to the first 163 amino acids of p32. We studied the expression of HIC protein isoforms in vivo with this antiserum by using two additional approaches. First, we analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 7 a) protein extracts of 293T cells transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His containing the HIC coding sequence under the control of the wild type leader (from nucleotide 95 to 1300, see Fig. 2). Second, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-HIC from extracts of HTLV-I infected T-cells (Fig. 7 b). In both cases, a single protein was detected with anti-HIC but not with preimmune serum (Fig. 7), the size of this protein being consistent with the size of recombinant p32 when expressed in eukaryotic cell lines (data not shown). These results demonstrate that p32 is the major protein isoform produced from HIC mRNA in vivo. p40 was not detected by both approaches suggesting that p40 is weakly expressed in vivo, probably because GTG is a poor translation initiator. To check the existence of p40 in vivo, the HIC coding sequence under the control of the wild type leader (from nucleotide 95 to 1328, see Fig. 2) was cloned into the vector pEGFP-N1, in frame with the GFP nucleotide sequence. If both HIC isoforms are expressed in vivo, the products synthesized from our construct should correspond to p40- and p32-GFP fusion proteins, easily detectable by fluorescence microscopy. Indeed, after transfection of COS7 cells, different patterns of staining were observed with a confocal microscope. At first, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8 a) was detected confirming that p32 is expressed in vivo from HIC cDNA. We also found a granular staining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8,a–c), a pattern common to p32-GFP and p40-GFP (see Fig. 5,d and f). Finally, staining around and in the nucleoli (Fig. 8 c), similar to the pattern described for p40-GFP (Fig. 5 f), was observed. In conclusion, taken together, our analyses demonstrate that both p32 and p40 can be synthesized in vivo. Our results suggest that HIC protein belongs with I-mfa to the same family of proteins that is characterized by the presence of a specific cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. Therefore, by analogy with I-mfa, we postulated that HIC should be involved in gene expression regulation. Moreover, we first isolated the HIC cDNA clone from a cDNA library of MT-2, a T-cell line persistently infected by HTLV-I and producing high quantity of viral particles (47.Miyoshi I. Taguchi H. Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Ohtsuki Y. Shiraishi Y. Akagi T. Gann. 1982; 28: 219-228Google Scholar). For all these reasons and in order to try to understand the function of HIC, w"
https://openalex.org/W2002947656,"One of the most interesting properties of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter ofEscherichia coli is the strong regulation of its activity by pH. This regulation is accompanied by a conformational change that can be probed by digestion with trypsin and involves the hydrophilic loop connecting the transmembrane helices VIII–IX. In the present work we show that a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1F6, recognizes yet another domain of NhaA in a pH-dependent manner. This antibody binds NhaA at pH 8.5 but not at pH 4.5, whereas two other mAbs bind to NhaA independently of pH. The epitope of mAb 1F6 was located at the NH2 terminus of NhaA by probing proteolytic fragments in Western blot analysis and amino acid sequencing. The antibody bound to the peptide HLHRFFSS, starting at the third amino acid of NhaA. A synthetic peptide with this sequence was shown to bind mAb 1F6 both at acidic and alkaline pH suggesting that this peptide is accessible to mAb 1F6 in the native protein only at alkaline pH. Although slightly shifted to acidic pH, the pH profile of the binding of mAb 1F6 to the antiporter is similar to that of both the Na+/H+ antiporter activity as well as to its sensitivity to trypsin. We thus suggest that these pH profiles reflect a pH-dependent conformational change, which leads to activation of the antiporter. Indeed, a replacement of Gly-338 by Ser (G338S), which alleviates the pH dependence of both the NhaA activity as well as its sensitivity to trypsin, affects in a similar pattern the binding of mAb 1F6 to NhaA. Furthermore, the binding site of mAb 1F6 is involved in the functioning of the antiporter as follows: a double Cys replacement H3C/H5C causes an acidic shift by half a pH unit in the pH dependence of the antiporter; N-ethylmaleimide, which does not inhibit the wild-type protein, inhibits H3C/H5C antiporter to an extent similar to that exerted by mAb 1F6.

Escherichia coli has two antiporters, NhaA (5.Goldberg B.G. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of nhaA, which is dependent on NhaR, a positive regulator, is induced by Na+ in a pH-dependent manner (8.Karpel R. Alon T. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21753-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Rahav-Manor O. Carmel O. Karpel R. Taglicht D. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol.

NhaA is an electrogenic antiporter that has been purified to homogeneity and reconstituted in a functional form in proteoliposomes (11.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its H+/Na+ stoichiometry is 2H+/Na+ (12.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its activity drastically depends on pH, changing its V max over 3 orders of magnitude from pH 7 to pH 8 (12.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A strong pH sensitivity is characteristic for antiporters as well as for other transporters that are involved in pH homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 4.Padan E. Oren A. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Hypersaline Environments. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998: 163-175Google Scholar). Identifying the amino acid residues and the protein domains involved in the pH sensitivity of these proteins is important for understanding the mechanism of pH regulation. Out of the eight histidines of NhaA only His-225 was found to be essential for the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of NhaA (13.Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas the activation of the wild-type NhaA occurs between pH 7.5 and pH 8, replacement of His-225 by Arg (H225R) yields an antiporter that is activated between pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. In addition, although the wild-type antiporter remains almost fully active, at least up to pH 8.5, H225R becomes inactive above pH 7.5, retaining only 10–20% of the maximal activity at pH 8.5 (13.Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Replacement of His-225 by either cysteine (H225C) or serine (H225S), but not alanine (H225A), yielded an antiporter with a wild-type pH sensitivity, implying that polarity, size, and/or hydrogen bonding, the common properties shared by His, Cys, and Ser, are essential at position 225 for pH regulation of NhaA (14.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 45: 26813-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Changes of Gly-338 also affect the pH dependence of NhaA activity; its replacement by serine (G338S) produced a transporter whose activity is independent of pH; it is active throughout pH 6.5 to 8.5 (15.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, we have also found that NhaA undergoes a conformational change upon its activation by pH which can be probed by trypsin (16.Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,17.Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In everted membrane vesicles at acidic pH, the protein is completely resistant to trypsin, whereas at alkaline pH it is digested with a similar pH dependence as the antiporter activity. Furthermore, two variants with a modified pH dependence of activity are susceptible to trypsin, in isolated membrane vesicles, only at the pH range where they are active and reflecting the level of activity (16.Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17.Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); H225R, the variant with a pH profile of activity shifted toward acidic pH, is digested at that pH; the G338S variant, which lost pH control, is active and exposed to trypsin throughout the entire pH range. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1have been raised against numerous membrane proteins, and they are a versatile tool for their biochemical and structural characterization. Most importantly, if they recognize a native epitope of a protein, they can be used to probe conformational changes in this epitope (18.Belli S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19.Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Nikaido K. Ames G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23051-23058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modifying the standard ELISA (His-tag ELISA) we have recently isolated four NhaA-specific mAbs (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this assay the antigen is presented in its native form when bound on Ni2+-NTA-coated polystyrene plates via its His tag in the presence of the detergent LM and under physiological conditions. Three of the mAbs obtained recognize only the native antiporter and are Western blot-negative (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fourth mAb (1F6), which is Western blot-positive, showed a unique behavior. In His tag ELISA it gave rise to much higher signals at alkaline pH as opposed to acidic pH. In this work we show that mAb 1F6 recognizes the NH2 terminus of NhaA which appears to be exposed at alkaline pH but not at acidic pH.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DH5α (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and JM109 were used as hosts for construction of plasmids. Cells were grown in modified LB broth (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in which NaCl was replaced by KCl (87 mm, pH 7.5, (7.Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). For overexpression cells were grown in minimal medium A without sodium citrate (21.Davies B.D. Mingioli E.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 60: 17-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with either glycerol (0.5%) or melibiose (10 mm) as a carbon source. Thiamine (2.5 μg/ml) was added to the minimal medium. For plates, 1.5% agar was used. The concentrations of antibiotics were 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml kanamycin and/or 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol and/or 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. Resistance to Li+and Na+ was tested as described previously (13.Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Plasmid pAXH, which encodes Xa-His-tagged NhaA, was constructed previously (22.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol.

Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pG338S-XH is a plasmid isogenic with pAXH but encodes NhaA with a Ser-338 instead of Gly (G338S) (15.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). pGMAR100 is a pBR322 derivative that bears nhaA and most of the nhaR gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted following a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol (15.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DNA of pGMAR100 was used as a DNA template with the forward mutagenic primer 5′-GTG AAA TGT CTC TGC AGA TTC TTT AGC-3′ and the backward mutagenic primer 5′-GCT AAA GAA TCT GCA GAG ACA TTT CAC-3′. Assays of Na+/H+ antiporter activity were conducted on everted membrane vesicles (22.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The assay of antiport activity was based upon the measurement of Na+- (or Li+)-induced changes in the ΔpH as described (5.Goldberg B.G. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E.

To overproduce the wild-type and the mutated antiporters, plasmids leading to overproduction of the His-tagged proteins in TA16 cells were used. The transformed cells were grown in minimal medium to A 600 = 0.6, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown for 2 h to A 600 = 1–1.2, harvested, and used for preparation of membranes either after storage overnight at 4 °C or after freezing at −20 °C (11.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged NhaA and the mutant His-tagged G338S were affinity purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described (22.Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purified antiporter was subjected to trypsin digestion in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μg of antiporter protein, 30 ng of trypsin (type III from bovine pancreas, Sigma T-8253), 0.1% LM (Calbiochem), 8.3 mm potassium acetate, 200 mm KCl, 6.5% glycerol, 0.7 mmNa/EDTA, 20 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 8, if not indicated otherwise), and 1 mm CaCl2. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (short treatment) or 60 min (long treatment). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 ng of trypsin inhibitor (type II-S from soybean, Sigma T-9128). To determine the extent of digestion samples of 5 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15.Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A protein sample (50 μg) was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer and loaded on 15% (for fragments larger than 10 kDa or 20% for smaller ones) bisacrylamide gel. After separation the polypeptides were transferred (400 mA for 60 min) to polyvinylidene difluoride type (Millipore ImmobilonTM-P) transfer membranes in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris/HCl, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.025% SDS, pH 8.4. The filters were then washed in distilled water, stained for 5 min in 0.1% Coomassie Blue (R-250) in 50% methanol, destained for 5–10 min in 10% acetic acid in 50% methanol, and washed for 5–10 min in distilled water. The stained bands were cut and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing using a Perkin-Elmer (Applied Biosystem Division) 492 (Procise) Microsequencer System. The production and purification of mAb 1F6, 2C5, and 5H4 have been described previously (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The His tag-based ELISA was conducted practically as described previously (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). His-tagged NhaA was bound to Ni2+-NTA-coated 96-well microtiter plates (Qiagen) using a final concentration of 12 μg/ml, in coating buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (if not indicated otherwise), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) LM), and gently shaking the plates at room temperature for 45 min. The plates were washed three times with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.03% (w/v) LM, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Ni2+-NTA-coated plates do not need any blocking since they are pre-blocked by the manufacturer. The washing buffer was also used for dilution and subsequent incubation of purified mAbs on the plates. All other steps were performed as described in the standard ELISA protocol (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The competition assay was performed by incubating mAb solutions at a final concentration of 12 μg/ml with different concentrations of either synthetic peptide, wild-type His-tagged NhaA, or His-tagged G338S-NhaA in a volume of 200 μl overnight at 4 °C. The mixtures were then used to probe Ni2+-NTA plates, which were previously coated with His-tagged NhaA (12 μg/ml). The subsequent steps were as described for the His tag-based ELISA. SDS-PAGE was done according to Ref. 24.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar. For Western blot analysis (25.King S.M. Olter T. Witman G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4717-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry blotting apparatus by applying 50 mA/gel for 1 h at 4 °C. After transfer, the membrane was blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 3% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. All washing steps were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. For incubation with primary antibodies, blood sera, and secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated), the probes were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reaction was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 9.8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2. Protein concentrations were determined according to Ref. 26.Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 4 °C on a SMARTTMsystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assess molecular weights a calibration curve was calculated based on purified proteins (aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin, Sigma). The running buffer contained 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) LM, and either 25 mmpotassium acetate, pH 4.5, 25 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 6, 25 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7, or 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. For each run mAb 1F6 and His-tagged NhaA, 20 μg each, were mixed in the respective buffers and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The general protocol has been described previously (27.Monnet C. Laune D. Laroche-Traineau J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Briant L. Bès C. Pugnière M. Mani J.-C. Pau B. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardès T. J. Biol.

Membranes were obtained from Abimed (Langenfeld, Germany); Fmoc amino acids andN-hydroxybenzotriazole were obtained from Nova Biochem (Läufelfingen, Switzerland). The ASP222 robot (Abimed) was used for the coupling steps. Two hundred and eight overlapping decapeptides frameshifted by two residues, representing the entire NhaA, were synthesized on cellulose membrane. All peptides were acetylated at their NH2 termini. After the peptides were assembled, the side chain protecting groups were removed by trifluoroacetic acid treatment. The technique was performed as described previously for epitope analysis (27.Monnet C. Laune D. Laroche-Traineau J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Briant L. Bès C. Pugnière M. Mani J.-C. Pau B. Cerutti M.

The saturated membrane was incubated with 12 μg/ml mAb 1F6 solution in the blocking buffer (Genosys Biotechnologies, UK) for 2 h at room temperature. Bound mAb 1F6 was detected by incubation of the membrane at 25 °C for 30 min in a 1:3000 dilution of an anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and subsequent addition of a phosphatase substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma). A blue precipitate on the spot indicated mAb binding. The 8-mer peptide (NH2-) HLHRFFSS (-COOH) was synthesized by Fmoc solid-phase synthesis on a Labortec peptide synthesizer (model SP640, Bubendorf, Switzerland). The peptide was deprotected and released from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid treatment in the presence of appropriate scavengers. The peptide was lyophilized, and its purity was assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptide was dissolved in distilled water to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, activated, and bound to the Covalink NH plates, according to the Covalink NH manual (Nunc). Then the plates were washed in 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.03% LM, and either 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, or 20 mm potassium acetate, pH 4.5, and probed in the respective solutions with mAb 1F6 (12 μg/ml), according to the His tag ELISA. For construction of the column (2 ml) the ImmunoPure Protein A IgG Plus Orientation kit from Pierce was used. 3 mg of purified mAb 1F6 were bound to the protein A and cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. The column was washed in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5% glycerol, and 0.03% LM. Purified His-tagged NhaA (800 μg) was loaded onto the column in the same buffer, and the column was washed in 5 column volumes of the buffer. His-tagged NhaA was eluted in 2 column volumes of the binding buffer containing 25 mm potassium acetate, pH 4.5, instead of Tris/HCl. Table I summarizes the results of an experiment that led us to consider the possibility that the Western blot-positive mAb 1F6 recognizes a peptide that is specifically exposed in a pH-dependent manner. In this experiment Ni2+-NTA ELISA plates were coated with His-tagged NhaA at pH 7.9, washed, and exposed to mAb 1F6 at different pH values. As a control we used mAb 2C5, another monoclonal antibody, which is Western blot-negative and recognizes only a native form of NhaA (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results show that, whereas the signal obtained from mAb 2C5 was high and independent of pH, the signal from mAb 1F6 was pH-dependent. Increasing the pH from pH 4.5 to 8.3 doubled the signal of mAb 1F6. At pH 9.5 a small decrease in the maximal signal was observed.Table IpH-dependent binding of mAb 1F6 to His-tagged NhaA in the His-tag ELISApHmAb 1F6mAb 2C5A405–450 nm4.50.96 (±0.03)2.12 (±0.02)51.16 (±0.04)2.38 (±0.03)61.50 (±0.04)2.19 (±0.02)71.58 (±0.03)2.46 (±0.01)7.52.28 (±0.05)2.57 (±0.05)8.32.14 (±0.01)2.48 (±0.03)9.51.93 (±0.03)2.11 (±0.03)Ni2+-NTA ELISA plates were coated with His-tagged NhaA at pH 8, washed, and probed with either mAb 1F6 or mAb 2C5 at different pH values as indicated. The various pH values were obtained with the following buffers: pH 4.5 and 5, 25 mm potassium acetate; pH 6, 25 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.5 to pH 9.5, 25 mm Tris/HCl. The plates were developed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiment was done in triplicate. The S.D. is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Ni2+-NTA ELISA plates were coated with His-tagged NhaA at pH 8, washed, and probed with either mAb 1F6 or mAb 2C5 at different pH values as indicated. The various pH values were obtained with the following buffers: pH 4.5 and 5, 25 mm potassium acetate; pH 6, 25 mm Bis-Tris/HCl, pH 7, 25 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.5 to pH 9.5, 25 mm Tris/HCl. The plates were developed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiment was done in triplicate. The S.D. is shown in parentheses. To test directly the possibility that the binding of mAb 1F6 to NhaA is pH-dependent, purified NhaA and mAb 1F6 were mixed, incubated at either pH 8 or pH 4.5, and then separated at the respective pH values by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.1). For control NhaA and mAb 1F6 were also run each separately on this column. Their retention volumes at both pH values were similar, 1.57 and 1.60 ml, respectively (not shown), and thus could not be separated on this column. Calibration of the column with the molecular weight standards indicated in Fig.1 A showed that these retention volumes correspond to 160 and 150 kDa for His-tagged NhaA and mAb 1F6, respectively. The apparent molecular weight observed for NhaA is much higher than expected from its amino acid composition (41 kDa (11.Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This is due to the LM micelle and to the dimeric form of NhaA in the LM micelle (20.Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At pH 4.5 one main peak (Fig. 1 A, peak D) was observed with a retention volume of 1.58 ml and a shoulder at 1.5 ml corresponding to molecular mass of 160 and 300 kDa, respectively. Samples were taken from the shoulder and various fractions of peak D (corresponding to retention volumes of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 ml) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). It was evident that the shoulder contained only mAb 1F6 (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) which eluted at a retention volume corresponding to an apparent molecular weight higher than expected. This was most probably due to some aggregation of the antibody occurring during preincubation. Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–5, shows that most of peak D was composed of a mixture of the free uncomplexed proteins NhaA and mAb 1F6. This conclusion was based on the fact mentioned above that the apparent molecular weights of both proteins when uncomplexed are very similar and do not allow their separation on this column. At pH 8 three peaks were observed with retention volumes of 0.88, 1.29, and 1.58 ml corresponding to molecular mass of 800, 500, and 160 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the three peaks (Fig. 1 B) showed that the material eluting at high molecular weight (Fig. 1 A, peak A) consisted only of the antibody (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). As discussed above this apparent very high molecular weight observed in the gel filtration was most probably due to aggregation. The medium molecular weight peak (Fig.1 A, peak B) contained both NhaA and mAb 1F6 (Fig.1 B, lane 7). Since the apparent molecular weight of this peak is higher than that of either NhaA or mAb 1F6 (see above), it can be concluded that this fraction contains the mAb 1F6-NhaA complex. The low molecular weight peak (Fig. A, peak C) contained the residual NhaA left unbound (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence of the formation of NhaA-1F6 complex. It is evident that at pH 4.5 NhaA and 1F6 did not bind, but with increasing pH the complex was progressively formed. At pH 8, very little NhaA was left free (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). The apparent molecular weight of the complex is in agreement with a stoichiometry of 2 NhaA dimers pe"
https://openalex.org/W2089211487,"β-Oxidation of acyl-CoAs in mammalian peroxisomes can occur via either multifunctional enzyme type 1 (MFE-1) or type 2 (MFE-2), both of which catalyze the hydration oftrans-2-enoyl-CoA and the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, but with opposite chiral specificity. Amino acid sequence alignment of the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 domain in human MFE-2 with other MFE-2s reveals conserved protic residues: Tyr-347, Glu-366, Asp-370, His-406, Glu-408, Tyr-410, Asp-490, Tyr-505, Asp-510, His-515, Asp-517, and His-532. To investigate their potential roles in catalysis, each residue was replaced by alanine in site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting constructs were tested for complementation in a yeast. After additional screening, the wild type and noncomplementing E366A and D510A variants were expressed and characterized. The purified proteins have similar secondary structural elements, with the same subunit composition. The E366A variant had ak cat/K m value 100 times lower than that of the wild type MFE-2 at pH 5, whereas the D510A variant was inactive. Asp-510 was imbedded in a novel hydratase 2 motif found in the hydratase 2 proteins. The data show that the hydratase 2 reaction catalyzed by MFE-2 requires two protic residues, Glu-366 and Asp-510, suggesting that their catalytic role may be equivalent to that of the two catalytic residues of hydratase 1. β-Oxidation of acyl-CoAs in mammalian peroxisomes can occur via either multifunctional enzyme type 1 (MFE-1) or type 2 (MFE-2), both of which catalyze the hydration oftrans-2-enoyl-CoA and the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, but with opposite chiral specificity.

Examples of biosynthetic events are the formation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (1.Donadio S. Staver M.J. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthetases in microbes use (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA thioesters as substrates, whereas fatty acid synthetases use acyl carrier protein as a carrier for acyl groups. For the catabolic processes, if peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acyl-CoA proceeds via a multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE-2)1-dependent pathway, it must involve (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates (3.Hiltunen J.K.

Furthermore, a number of MFE-2 deficiencies have been identified in peroxisomal disorder patients suffering from profound hypotonia, psychomotor dysfunction, and craniofacial dysmorphosis (15.Suzuki Y.

The addition of water to trans-2-enoyl-CoA by hydratase 1, yielding (3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoA, has been well characterized (17.Waterson R.M. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

These facts, together with the importance of hydratase 2 for intermediary metabolism, prompted us to design experiments to elucidate further the biological enzymology of hydratase 2. We identified a conserved amino acid sequence motif, called here the hydratase 2 motif, and two amino acid residues, Glu-366 and Asp-510, in human MFE-2 as being important for catalysis. Furthermore, the data showed that the hydratase 2 reaction occurs by way of an acid-base mechanism. All of the bacterial manipulations were performed with Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae fox-2(ura3–52, trp1, leu2–3, 112, ade, fox2), which is devoid of endogenous peroxisomal MFE, as described previously (3.Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A.

The harvested cells were stored frozen at −70 °C until required for enzyme assay. Plates containing oleic acid were prepared by pouring a thin layer of YPOD medium onto them (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% Bacto-peptone, 0.1% oleic acid, 0.1% glucose, 0.5% Tween 40 at pH 7.0), with 2% (w/v) agar (22.Filppula S.A.

The pUC18::HsMFE-2 vector containing the open reading frame of human MFE-2 cDNA (23.Adamski J. Normand T. Leenders F. Monte D. Begue A. Stehelin D. Jungblut P.W. de Launoit Y. Biochem.

This plasmid was used as a template in polymerase chain reactions for constructing all of the mutants with HsMFE-2-specific primers (TableI), using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The SacI- andXhoI-digested fragments containing HsMFE-2cDNAs were isolated and subsequently cloned into similarly digested plasmid pYE352 behind a catalase A1 promoter (22.Filppula S.A. Sormunen R.T.

The mutations in the constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The resulting construct pYE352::HsMFE-2 and its mutant variants were transformed into fox-2 cells by the lithium acetate method (24.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A.

The harvested yeast cells were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 5 mm mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0, and disrupted with glass beads (0.5 mm). The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for the assays of enzyme activity. Acyl-CoA esters were prepared, and the activities of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 and (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were measured as described previously (25.Hiltunen J.K. Palosaari P.M. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13536-13540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding residues 319–735 of HsMFE-2 (23.Adamski J. Normand T. Leenders F. Monte D. Begue A. Stehelin D. Jungblut P.W. de Launoit Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was chosen because the corresponding fragment from the rat had been shown to encode a stable protein (10.Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Conry D. Cuebas D.A. Hiltunen J.K. Novikov D.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with HsMFE-2-specific primers: 5′-primer, catatgACA GCA ACA TCA GGA TTT GCT G and 3′-primer, ggatccTCA GAG CTT GGC GTA GTC TTT AAG. The primers contain NdeI and BamHI sites, indicated by lowercase letters. The 1254-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into a similarly digested pET3a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the resultant plasmid pET3a:: HsMFE-2(dhΔ), with the nucleotides encoding the (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA domain deleted, was used as a template for constructing mutant hydratase 2 variants with HsMFE-2-specific primers (Table I) using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, resulting in pET3a::HsMFE-2(dhΔE366A), pET3a::HsMFE-2(dhΔY347A), and pET3a::HsMFE-2(dhΔD510A). All of the sequences of the inserts were verified and the plasmids transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The recombinant HsMFE-2(dhΔ)p and its variants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS as described previously (10.Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Conry D. Cuebas D.A. Hiltunen J.K. Novikov D.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A bacterial cell pellet (1.0 g wet weight) was suspended in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, pH 8.0 (buffer A), containing 25 μg/ml DNase, 25 μg/ml RNase, and 10 mm MgCl2, and the cellular lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to an anion exchange DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 12.5 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. Pooled fractions of the nonbound protein were dialyzed against 20 mm PIPES and 75 mmNaCl, pH 6.7, and applied to a cation exchange Poros 10 SP (0.5 × 10.0 cm) column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). The bound proteins were eluted in a NaCl gradient increasing linearly from 75 to 400 mm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peak fractions containing hydratase 2 activity were pooled and applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 200 mm potassium phosphate, 3 mm EDTA, and 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. The protein sample (0.5 mg/ml in 200 mmpotassium phosphate, 3 mm EDTA, and 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) was passed through 0.02-μm filters, and the hydrodynamic radius was determined with a DynaPro-MSTC dynamic light scattering device (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) at 22 °C. CD spectroscopy was performed at 22 °C using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter as described earlier (12.Qin Y.-M. Marttila M.S. Haapalainen A.M. Siivari K.M. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28619-28625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of the wild type enzyme and its E366A mutant were obtained by monitoring the hydration reaction at 263 nm using atrans-2-decenoyl-CoA substrate (4–60 μm) in a final volume of 0.5 ml at 22 °C (26.Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 401-411Google Scholar). The pH dependence experiment was performed in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH values varying from 5 to 10. The pH values were assessed before the assay (21.Kiema T.-R. Engel C.K. Schmitz W. Filppula S.A. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2991-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kinetic data, the pK a values, and their errors were calculated with the GraFit computer software (Sigma). Amino acid sequence alignment of the hydratase 2 domain (amino acid residues 319–612 in HsMFE-2) (23.Adamski J. Normand T. Leenders F. Monte D. Begue A. Stehelin D. Jungblut P.W. de Launoit Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) with those of nine eukaryotic MFE-2s found in PSI-BLAST (27.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar) showed around 15% sequence identity (Fig. 2). The comparison revealed that the hydratase 2 region contains 12 conserved protic amino acids, namely, Tyr-347, Glu-366, Asp-370, His-406, His-408, Tyr-410, Asp-490, Tyr-505, Asp-510, His-515, Asp-517, and His-532 (following the numbering of HsMFE-2). These residues were identical except that the Asp-370 of HsMFE-2 was replaced by Glu in chicken MFE-2. A PSI-BLAST search using the amino acid sequence of HsMFE-2 hydratase in the most conserved region of the hydratase 2 protein (residues 452–612), yielded significant amino acid sequence similarities (E values ranging from 8e-95 to 4e-27 in the first iteration) with five dehydratases of the β-subunit of the fungal fatty acid synthetase complexes and three domains from fatty acid synthetases of prokaryotic microorganisms (Table II) in addition to the MFE-2s given in Fig. 2. The dehydratase/hydratase 2 parts were extracted from chimerical polypeptides (both MFE-2s and fatty acid synthases) and their amino acid sequences aligned. The alignment (data not shown) showed three highly conserved regions located close to each other (residues 501–521, 529–538, and 556–582 in HsMFE-2), the most conserved region showed the motif [YF]-X(1,2)-[LVIG]-[STGC]-G-D-X-N-P-[LIV]-H-X(5)-[AS], which is called here the hydratase 2 motif. Using this motif to search SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL with the Expasy ScanProsite tool (28.Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we found the same proteins used to identify this motif. In addition, the search recognized nine new proteins with uncharacterized functions (Table II). The proteins extracted originate from bacteria (five), archae (three), and fungi (one), and the predicted sizes of the polypeptides fell into two groups: one with 146–290 amino acid residues and the other with 1914–2082.Table IIProteins containing hydratase 2 amino acid sequence motifSpeciesAccession no.Position of hydratase 2 motifHydratase 2 domain of MFE-2 Indicated in the Fig. 2β-Polypeptides of fatty acid synthetases Saccharomyces cerevisiaeP071491553–1570 Candida albicansP347311539–1556 Yarrowia lipolyticaP342291574–1591 Schizosaccharomyces pombeAB0102741569–1586 Emericella nidulansU753471578–1595 Mycobacterium tuberculosisZ838631223–1240 Corynebacterium ammoniagenesX647951169–1186 Corynebacterium ammoniagenesS555051191–1208Proteins with unknown function Mycobacterium tuberculosisZ82098184–200 Mycobacterium tuberculosisU27357181–197 Mycobacterium tuberculosisZ9277230–47 Mycobacterium tuberculosisAL021929184–201 Mycobacterium lepraeAL022486184–201 Archaeoglobus fulgidusAE00109230–47 Archaeoglobus fulgidusAE00094430–47 Emericella nidulans (Aspergillus nidulans)Q007061436–1453 Archaeoglobus fulgidusAE00102656–73The sequences were collected with the hydratase 2 domain ofHsMFE-2 using PSI-BLAST to search data bases, which gave MFE-2 and eight β-polypeptides of fatty acid synthases. The sequences were aligned with the ClustalX program and refined further with the GeneDoc program as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” This alignment gave the most conserved region in the motif of [YF]-X(1,2)-[LVIG]-[STGC]-G-D-X-N-P-[LIV]-H-X(5)-[AS] (hydratase 2 motif). A further data base search with the hydratase 2 motif yielded nine additional polypeptides with unknown function.

The positions of hydratase 2 motif residues are also indicated by numbering in each polypeptide. Because amino acid residues crucial for catalysis are generally highly conserved in orthologs and because the dehydration-hydration of Δ2 carboxylates has been shown previously to take place through acid-base catalysis, the conserved protic residues mentioned above (Fig. 2) were assumed to contribute to the hydratase 2 reactions. Each of them in turn was mutated to alanine and testedin vivo in the yeast, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fox-2 cells transformed with pYE352::HsMFE-2 grew on the oleic acid plates, and a clear zone appeared (12.Qin Y.-M. Marttila M.S. Haapalainen A.M. Siivari K.M. Glumoff T. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28619-28625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) similar to that in wild type S. cerevisiae UTL-7A cells, indicating the utilization of oleic acid (Fig. 3), and those expressing theHsMFE-2 variants D370A, H406A, H408A, Y410A, D490A, D517A, and H532A also developed clear zones. Thus these protic amino acid residue substitutions did not perturb the significant functional integrity of HsMFE-2. However, no clear zone formation was observed with any of the following replacements: Y347A, E366A, Y505A, D510A, or H515A (Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility that the noncomplementing variants were not expressed at all, immunoblotting experiments were carried out with antibody to rat 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (5.Qin Y.-M. Pontanen M.H. Helander H.M. Kvist A.-P. Siivari K.M. Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Hellmann U. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This revealed 79-kDa signals corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of HsMFE-2, with about the same staining intensities as in the soluble cellular extract of fox-2cells transformed with the plasmid pYE352::HsMFE-2and its complementing variants. No signals were observed with wild typeS. cerevisiae UTL-7A or fox-2 cells (data not shown). To discover whether clear zone formation on the oleic acid plates correlated with the expression ofHsMFE-2, hydratase 2 and (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities were measured in the yeast lysates. The values in wild type UTL-7A cells were 0.40 and 0.091 μmol × mg−1 × min−1, respectively, but the activities were below the detection limit in the fox-2 cells (Table III). Interestingly, the values of both activities in the cells transformed by pYE352::HsMFE-2 were very close to those in the UTL-7A cells. Both dehydrogenase and hydratase activities were detected in all of the variants found to be capable of complementing thefox-2 mutant, whereas the three noncomplementing variants, E366A, D510A, and Y347A, had lost only the hydratase 2 activity, as their dehydrogenase activity was still present. Both activities were below the detection limit in the variants H515A and Y505A. Because the immunoblots showed that the corresponding polypeptides were expressed, the data were taken to suggest that H515A and Y505A substitution caused incorrect folding, and no further analysis was carried out on them here. When the G16S variant, which is a substitution at the NAD+ binding site of the (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domain resulting in MFE-2 deficiency in humans (16.Van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E.

To characterize the HsMFE-2 variants that had lost their hydratase 2 activity but retained dehydrogenase activity, nucleotides 1–954 of HsMFE-2 (encoding the dehydrogenase domain) were deleted by polymerase chain reaction and the truncated gene HsMFE-2(dhΔ) and its variants,HsMFE-2(dhΔE366A), HsMFE-2(dhΔY347A), andHsMFE-2(dhΔD-510A), were overexpressed in a pET3a system in E. coli.

https://openalex.org/W2163948723,"Hemoglobins are best known as oxygen transport proteins. Here we describe a hemoglobin from the parasitic nematodeMermis nigrescens (Mn-GLB-E) that has an optical, light shadowing function. The protein accumulates to high concentration as intracellular crystals in the ocellus of mature phototactic adult females while also being expressed at low concentration in other tissues. It differs in sequence and expression pattern from Mn-GLB-B, a second Mermis globin. It retains the structure and oxygen-binding and light-absorbing properties typical of nematode hemoglobins. As such, recruitment to a shadowing role in the eye appears to have occurred by changes in expression without modification of biochemistry. Both globins are coded by genes interrupted by two introns at the conserved positions B12.2 and G7.0, which is in agreement with the 3exon/2intron pattern model of globin gene evolution.

Hemoglobins (Hbs)1 and Hb-like proteins have been characterized in an ever extending list of invertebrates, plants, fungi, protozoa, and bacteria. Comparisons across this protein family have revealed unexpected diversity in function and structure (1.Riggs A.F. Am. Zool. 1991; 31: 535-545Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2.Vinogradov S.N.

Despite the great variability in primary and quaternary structure of their Hbs, the globin domains of phylogenetically widely diverged species all display the “globin fold” (5.Bolognesi M. Bordo D.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that globins arose from a common ancestor long before the advent of atmospheric oxygen (1.Riggs A.F. Am.

During evolution, the globin domain evolved to assist the reversible binding to heme of small gaseous ligands (O2, CO, H2S, and NO) resulting in biological functions as diverse as O2 storage, transportation, and scavenging, as well as transportation and accumulation of NO and H2S (2.Vinogradov S.N.

Biol. Bull. 1995; 188: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These functions generally require large amounts of Hb. High molecular weight Hb complexes likely evolved to avoid excretion of Hb that is present in the body fluids as a solute (10.Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A different solution to this problem was the packaging of highly concentrated Hb in specialized cells, e.g. erythrocytes. Alternatively, smaller amounts of myoglobin-like proteins are present in virtually all cells, perhaps providing an efficient intracellular oxygen delivery system to the respiring mitochondria and chloroplasts (4.Hardison R.

These are found particularly in unicellular systems, notably bacteria in which the electron transport system and the O2 carrying hemoproteins are not contained within separate compartments. The flavohemoglobins ofEscherichia coli, Alcaligenes euthropus, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae catalyze redox reactions, with the heme playing a direct role in electron transfer much as in cytochromes (13.Zhu H.

From eggs ingested by the host, larvae grow to the 10-cm adult length coiled inside the body cavity. The L4-stage larvae break out of the host and burrow into the soil where the final molt takes place and the adult nematode matures. The gravid adult females emerge 1–2 years later from the soil and exhibit a positive phototaxis during the search for suitable egg-laying sites in grass (27.Burr A.H.J. Eggleton D.K. Patterson R.

We here describe the structure, function and expression of a Hb used in an optical function in the ocellus of the nematode M. nigrescens. Egg-laying adult females were collected from vegetation in Vancouver, Canada and stored at about 8 °C in moist autoclaved soil. The desert locust hostSchistocerca gregaria was infected by feeding a counted number of eggs, and the female fourth stage (L4) larvae were collected as they emerged 4–5 weeks later. Larvae were investigated 1–2 days after emergence. Immature adult females were investigated 2–3 months post emergence before visible amounts of eye Hb had developed. The mature adults, which had densely colored ocelli, were either field collected or cultivated for at least 10 months post emergence. Anterior pieces containing the ocellus were fixed 16 h in 3% glutaraldehyde, 0.5 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. After washing 2 h in buffer, fixing 3 h in 2% OsO4, and washing 2 h in buffer, the pieces were dehydrated in an ethanol series to propylene oxide and embedded in Epon. Sections approximately 60 nm thick were mounted on Formvar-coated grids and stained for 25 min with uranyl acetate and for 6 min with lead citrate. A Phillips EM300G electron microscope was used with a eucentric tilting apparatus. Light micrographs were obtained under either bright field or laterally incident illumination. Arena and test conditions were similar to those described previously (27.Burr A.H.J. Eggleton D.K. Patterson R. Leutscher-Hazelhoff J.T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 89-95Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28.Burr A.H.J. Babinszki C.P.F. Ward A.J. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 167: 245-255Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Burr A.H.J. Babinszki C.P.F. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 167: 257-268Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After acclimation to 21 °C and light, the motion of individual worms crawling on moistened black felt was recorded under far-red and near-infrared light (630–990 nm) with a CCD video camera (Cohu model 4915) and VCR. The test stimulus was a horizontal monochromatic (420 nm) beam at 1.33 × 1013 photons s−1 cm−2 (6.3 μW cm−2), which was filtered to remove all heat radiation (27.Burr A.H.J. Eggleton D.K. Patterson R. Leutscher-Hazelhoff J.T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 89-95Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An active worm was placed in the arena, and the test stimulus was provided in the following sequence: 30 min at 420 nm, 5 min of darkness, 30 min at 420 nm, and 60 min of dark control period. During playback, the angular orientation of the “neck” (the 3 mm behind the 2-mm “head”) was measured every 30 s during light or dark periods except for an initial 4-min recovery interval. For hypothesis testing, mean vectors of neck orientations were calculated for each worm. A mean vector is 1/n times the vector sum of unit vectors pointing in the sampled directions. Treating the xand y coordinates of the ends of the mean vector as samples from a bivariate normal population, Hotelling's one-sample test estimates the probability that the population of x andy points has the origin 0.0 as its center. If this null hypothesis can be rejected at p < 0.05, then one can conclude worm necks are significantly oriented. The mean of mean vectors indicates the average direction (34.Batschelet E. Circular Statistics in Biology. Academic Press, London1981Google Scholar). Hb was isolated from 75 egg-laying females. The anterior part was cut, and the Hb was leached from 25 worms into 4 μl of distilled water (32.Burr A.H. Schiefke R. Bollerup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 405: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, a prominent band with M r∼ 17,000 was selected for amino acid sequencing using an ABI 471-B sequencer (35.Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M-L. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E.L. Marden M. Griffon N. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19865-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). N-terminal peptide sequence was used to design a sense strand degenerate primer for PCR. MnG-d(AT) is designed to be an AT biased primer (GTWAATTTAGATATWTTWMGIGC, a 23-mer with 64 redundancies). The first 4 mm of theMermis head was dissected from 10 young adult females that had faintly visible eye spots. Two headless bodies were also kept for RNA isolation. Total RNA was made from the heads and bodies by (i) grinding the nematode sections in a sterile mortar under liquid nitrogen and (ii) extracting using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was generated using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer). Head and body cDNAs and the degenerate primer were used in two separate reactions with an anchored oligo(dT) primer DGDT(GCGCGGATCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT) to generate PCR fragments for cloning and sequencing. The amplified products were cloned into the pMOS t-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant plasmids were sequenced using vector-derived primers and the ABI 377 sequencer. To determine the globin cDNA sequence, three separate cloned cDNAs were sequenced from the sense and antisense strands, and a consensus was generated. Two primers were designed based on the difference between the Mn-glb cDNA sequence and the amino acid sequence information obtained by Edman degradation of eye Hb. MerF1A (GTTGGCCAAATTGCCCATCAACGAGA) is a primer that matches the Mn-glb cDNA sequence completely. MerF1T (GTTGGCCAAATTGCCCATCAACGAGT) is a primer that matches the “body isoform” cDNA except for the very last base, which changes the codon to one encoding Phe instead of Ile. Both primers were high pressure liquid chromatography-purified and were used together with the oligo(dT) primer in a RT-PCR with RNA from both head and body. Positive fragments were cloned and sequenced as described earlier. The 5′ end of the Mn-glb-e cDNA was isolated using rapid amplification of cDNA Ends (Life Technologies, Inc.). In this procedure, first strand cDNA was synthesized using the specific primer MerR2UTR (GGAATAAGACGACGAACCATTCCC). A poly(C) tail was added to the 3′ end of the cDNA with terminal deoxytransferase. PCR was then carried out using an oligo(dG) adaptor and the specific primer MerR1INT (GGGCACCTCCTCCGGCTTGATTGC). Positive fragments were cloned and sequenced. The gene for the eye globin was amplified using the specific primers MereyeF (CAGTACTTGTGGTTCTGGCGGT) and MerR2UTR. The gene of the body globin was amplified using the specific primers MnG-S5 (ATGGTGGTGAATTTGGACATT) and MnG-E6 (TCACCAGCCTCCGATGTACTTC). The gene fragments were subsequently purified, cloned, and sequenced. Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using MacVectorTM 6.0.1. (Oxford Molecular Ltd.) and AssemblyLIGNTM 1.0.7. (Eastman Kodak Company). Data base searches for amino acid sequence similarities were performed using the BLAST server (36.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 460-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) to search a collection of data bases including GenBankTM and dbEST. The Mermis globin sequence was aligned to other globins. The alignment was used to derive phylogenetic trees using neighbor joining as implemented in the TREECON program (37.Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). Support for trees was assessed using the bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). Multiplex reactions were performed in which eitherMn-glb-b or Mn-glb-e was co-amplified with a fragment of the M. nigrescens ribosomal protein gene L6 (Mn rpl-6), which was sequenced by chance from the nonglobin clones isolated from the original degenerate PCR reactions. The following primers were used in the multiplex reactions: (i) for amplification of Mn rpl-6, MnR-1F (CTGTACTGATCGTATTAGTTG) and MnR-2R (GATCGCACCTATGATCATGCCATC); (ii) for amplification ofMn-glb-b, MnG-S6 (AGGGAATTCCATATGGTCGTCAATTTGGACATTA) and MnG-E7 (CGCGGATCCGCGTCACCAGCCTCCGATGTACTTC); and (iii) for amplification of Mn-glb-e, MereyeF and MerR2UTR. In addition to analyzing the RT-PCR results by agarose gel electrophoresis, the specificity of the PCR reactions was confirmed by digesting the PCR products with Sau3AI to distinguish Mn-glb-bproducts from Mn-glb-e products. The anterior of adult gravid females of M. nigrescenscontains a strongly pigmented region forming a hollow cylinder (Fig.1, A and B). The cylindrical conformation of the ocellus is due to deposition of pigment in the hypodermal cells of the region, swelling the hypodermal chords to envelop the body cavity (Fig. 1 B). In transmission electron micrographs of thin sectioned worms, the cells are seen to be densely packed with needle-like crystals having a hexagonal symmetry in cross-section (Fig. 1 C). In longitudinal sections, parallel stripes disappear and reappear at 60° intervals as a section is tilted. The patterns and dimensions are consistent with parallel rows of protein molecules forming hexagonal tubes with shared walls. Microspectrophotometry through the ocellus in fresh worm heads reveals an absorption spectrum and dichroic spectrum typical of HbO2 and its crystals (33.Burr A.H. Harosi F. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus both the eye pigmentation and crystals are shown to consist of oxyHb. There was no detectable Hb in neighboring tissues. The heme concentration in the ∼0.5 nl volume of the pigmented region is ∼10 mm, nearly that of Hb in vertebrate erythrocytes (32.Burr A.H. Schiefke R. Bollerup G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 405: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 33.Burr A.H. Harosi F. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In other nematode ocelli, melanin plays a shadowing role. A sensory nerve ending lies anterior to a melanin pigment spot or shallow pigment cup (38.Siddiqui I.A. Viglierchio D.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1970; 32: 558-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39.Burr A.H. Burr C. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1975; 51: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40.Burr A.H. Ali M.A. Photoreception and Vision in Invertebrates. Plenum Press, London1984: 131-178Crossref Google Scholar) where it would be shadowed when the head is pointed away from a light source (41.Burr A.H. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 134: 85-93Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This provides an orientation signal for negative phototaxis (40.Burr A.H. Ali M.A. Photoreception and Vision in Invertebrates. Plenum Press, London1984: 131-178Crossref Google Scholar). The oxyHb in the ocellus of Mermisfemales appears to have a similar role, but its arrangement results in positive rather than negative phototaxis (27.Burr A.H.J. Eggleton D.K. Patterson R. Leutscher-Hazelhoff J.T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 89-95Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28.Burr A.H.J. Babinszki C.P.F. Ward A.J. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 167: 245-255Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Burr A.H.J. Babinszki C.P.F. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1990; 167: 257-268Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of Hb further, taking advantage of a period during development before the oxyHb pigmentation appears. From videotaped images recorded under infrared illumination, we measured the neck orientations of three ages of female in the presence of a 420 nm test source at 1.33 × 1013 photons s−1 cm−2 (6.3 μW cm−2) (Fig. 2). Only in the pigmented, mature females was there significant phototaxis, as judged by the Hotelling's one-sample test. The nonpigmented, 2–3-month-old immature females were not significantly phototactic, nor were the nonpigmented, 1–2-day-old L4 larvae (Fig. 2). This confirms that the presence of a pigmented ocellus is necessary for positive phototaxis. We noted further that the positive phototaxis of mature adults is significant over the 350–560 nm range, which includes most of the wavelengths where the concentrated Hb in the ocellus would cast a shadow (27.Burr A.H.J. Eggleton D.K. Patterson R. Leutscher-Hazelhoff J.T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 49: 89-95Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Together, the spectrophotometry, morphology, and behavioral experiments strongly implicate the Hb to be involved in a shadow-casting function during positive phototaxis. Both the high absorptivity of oxyHb and the high concentration are required for the 25–35-μm-thick pigment cylinder to cast a shadow. The use of a Hb in such an optical role is, to present knowledge, unique. Have there been any structural modifications related to this optical function? How is this Hb related to the rest of the globin family? To answer these questions, we isolated and characterized the Hb cDNA and gDNA. Hb was leached from cut anterior tips of nematodes, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A prominent band,M r ∼17,000, was sequenced resulting in 33 N-terminal amino acid residues of the eye globin (Mn-GLB-E; Fig. 3). MnG-d(AT), a degenerate forward primer based on this sequence, and oligo(dT) were used in RT-PCR reactions using total cDNA from head as template. The amplified fragment differed by three predicted residues from the N-terminal sequence obtained from protein sequencing, suggesting the presence of a second globin isoform, which we designate Mn-GLB-B. Primers designed to distinguish between the different codons at residue 19 (for Phe or Ile; Fig. 3) were used in conjunction with an anchored oligo(dT) reverse primer to separately amplify and clone fragments of theMn-GLB-E and Mn-GLB-B isoforms. Complete cDNA sequences were obtained using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The predicted amino acid sequences of Mn-GLB-E andMn-GLB-B are aligned with selected globins in Fig. 3. Both cDNAs encode proteins of 146 amino acid residues with sequences typical of globins. An unambiguous alignment of theMermis sequences with globins of known structure shows: (i) the correct location of Phe(CD1) and His(F8), the two absolutely conserved residues of globins, (ii) the correct alignment of Pro(C2), which determines the folding of the BC corner, and of Gly(B6) and Gly(E8), which position the cross-over of the B and E helices, (iii) congruence with the six conserved secondary structural motifs of the globin fold, and (iv) acceptable substitutions at buried and surface sites that are known to have restricted polarity and volume in vertebrate and nonvertebrate globins (7.Kapp O. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8.Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Van de Peer Y. Peeters K. Kapp O.

These residues project into the distal heme pocket, where oxygen is bound and replace the Leu and His found in the majority of globins. They are usually associated with a high oxygen affinity because of a low rate constant for dissociation of the ligand (43.De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C. Richelle J. Trotman C.

For Ascaris suum pseudocoelomic Hb it is shown that the exceptionally high oxygen affinity is due to an H bonding network that includes residues Tyr(B10), Gln(E7), and bound oxygen (46.Yang J.

The same residues in the Mermis globins may account for the relatively high oxygen affinity observed for eye Hb (33.Burr A.H. Harosi F. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 527-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The presence of a ligand stabilizes Hb against oxidation of the heme and denaturation and loss of absorbance in the visible region. The high oxygen affinity of eye Hb may ensure the retention of the high absorbance necessary for its shadowing function. Mn-GLB-E and Mn-GLB-B are 84% identical, indicating their origin in a relatively recent duplication event. A Cys in eye globin at the exposed position E1 could be available for an intermolecular disulphide bond. The other substitutions between the two sequences have no obvious structural or functional consequences. Sequence comparisons suggest that the Mermis globins are distantly related to the other nematode globins sequenced to date (Fig.4 and Refs. 43.De Baere I. Liu L. Moens L. Van Beeumen J. Gielens C.

With exception of the human HbC variant (β6 Glu → Val),Mermis eye Hb is unique in forming true crystals in nature (51.Diggs L.W. Kraus A.P. Morrison D.B. Rudnicki R.P.T.

These are structurally different from the paracrystalline arrays of aggregated fibers formed by deoxygenated sickle cell Hb (53.Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar,54.Harosi F.I. Von Herbing I.H. Van Keuren J.R. Biol. Bull. 1998; 195: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our evidence indicates that the crystals consist predominantly or entirely of eye globin. Indeed, the amino acid sequence encoded byMn-glb-e exactly matches the 33 N-terminal residues of the protein sequenced from eye extracts; therefore, Mn-glb-e is most likely the eye globin gene. Mn-glb-b product cannot be present in significant amounts in the eye extracts because the protein sequencing products of residues 7, 19, and 31 had no trace of the different amino acids encoded by Mn-glb-b. There was no evidence of residues encoded by other globin genes in the Edman degradation products of any of the residues sequenced, and no other cDNAs were isolated. Thus Mn-GLB-E is likely the only globin present at high concentration in the eye. Although the sequence strongly suggests that eye globin forms a globin fold, it is not possible to identify the residues that stabilize the contacts between molecules in the crystal without information from x-ray crystallography. The genes encoding each globin were sequenced. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences shows the interruption of both genes by two introns at the conserved positions B12.2 and G7.0 (Ref. 55.Long M. Rosenberg C. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The functions of the vertebrate homologs are often similar to those of their Drosophilacounterparts. While studying Drosophila mutants with nervous system defects, a gene was isolated that was transiently expressed in cells of the nervous system destined to become glia (1.Hosoya T. Takizawa K. Nitta K. Hotta Y. Cell. 1995; 82: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 2.Jones B.W. Fetter R.D. Tear G. Goodman C.S.

Because flies in which this gene was inactivated showed a selective loss of all glial cells in the nervous system with the exception of midline glia, the gene was named glial cells missing (gcm). Detailed inspection of the phenotypes resulting from gene inactivation and transgenic overexpression revealed that GCM1 is in fact the earliest marker known for cells of glial fate and is directly involved in the choice of an uncommitted precursor in favor of a glial and against a neuronal fate.Biochemical analyses later showed that GCM had all the characteristics of a transcription factor with an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (4.Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5.Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At the time of its identification, GCM did not show any homology to proteins in the data bases. However, intense investigations have since led to the description of two mammalian proteins with sequence similarity to GCM (4.Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5.Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These proteins are named GCMa (or GCM1) and GCMb (or GCM2) with a single letter prefix usually indicating the species of origin.Drosophila GCM and its two mammalian relatives thus make up a novel family of transcription factors.Sequence homology between GCM and the mammalian GCMa and GCMb is restricted to the amino-terminal region, which contains the DNA-binding domain. Sequence comparison between the DNA-binding domains ofDrosophila GCM and mouse GCMa (mGCMa) has in fact helped us to define the important structural determinants of the DNA-binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the importance of seven symmetrically spaced cysteine residues and an adjacent lysine residue for integrity and binding capability of the DNA-binding domain (10.Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The functions of the mammalian GCM family members are not well understood at the moment. Under the assumption that conservation of sequence is a good indicator for conservation of function, one might expect these proteins to have a role in mammalian gliogenesis. Developmental in situ hybridization studies, however, have so far only revealed GCMa expression in the embryonic trophectoderm (6.Altshuller Y. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Frohman M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,11.Basyuk E. Cross J.C. Corbin J. Nakayama H. Hunter P. Nait- Oumesmar B. Lazzarini R.A. Dev.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12364-12369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).When mouse GCMa was expressed as a transgene in the developing nervous system of Drosophila, formation of surplus glial cells was observed (9.Kim J. Jones B.W. Zock C. Chen Z. Wang H. Goodman C.S. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12364-12369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression in the fly thus seems to indicate that GCMa has very similar functional characteristics asDrosophila GCM. In agreement, both proteins behaved virtually interchangeably in transiently transfected cells when assayed for transcriptional activity (13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similar to GCM, GCMa also had a strong transferable transactivation domain in its 80 carboxyl-terminal amino acids.GCMb on the other hand behaved very differently when expressed as a transgene throughout the developing nervous system ofDrosophila. Transformation of presumptive neurons into glia was not observed despite the fact that all parameters were identical to the ones used for ectopic GCMa expression (9.Kim J. Jones B.W. Zock C. Chen Z. Wang H. Goodman C.S. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12364-12369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus it was concluded that GCMb differs from GCMa and Drosophila GCM in its functional characteristics. To understand this difference in function and to obtain an idea of the structure of GCMb, we have undertaken a detailed comparative analysis of its properties in tissue culture.RESULTSComparison of the amino acid sequence of mGCMb with those of mGCMa and GCM reveals significant homology only in the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain. Within the DNA-binding domain of mGCMa, we have previously identified several amino acids, in particular seven symmetrically arranged cysteine residues and an amino-terminally adjacent lysine residue, which are essential for strength or specificity of DNA binding or influence the domain's conformation (10.Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, all of these amino acids are present and conserved within the amino-terminal region of mGCMb leading to the assumption that mGCMb might have DNA-binding characteristics similar to mGCMa.The preferred recognition element for Drosophila GCM had been determined to be 5′-ATGCGGGT-3′ (4.Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5.Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14912-14916Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We have previously used a set of oligonucleotide probes with this consensus or single site mutations thereof to analyze DNA binding of mGCMa in detail (10.Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Here we used this set of probes to analyze DNA-binding characteristics of mGCMb in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Whole cell extracts from COS cells transfected with an expression plasmid for the DNA-binding domain of mGCMb served as a protein source. As observed for mGCMa and Drosophila GCM, mGCMb exhibited the highest affinity for the consensus motif (Fig.2 A). Single point mutations of this motif influenced binding of mGCMb very differently. Changes in positions 3, 6, and 7 had the most severe effects; changes in positions 1, 4, and 5 were less dramatic. Intermediate effects were observed for changes in positions 2 and 8. Binding of mGCMb to this panel of oligonucleotides thus very closely resembles the pattern previously observed for both mGCMa and Drosophila GCM (10.Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that this second mammalian GCM protein has DNA-binding characteristics not very different from the other members of the family.However, closer inspection of DNA-binding characteristics exhibited minor differences between mGCMa and mGCMb. Using constant amounts of protein and probes with very similar specific activities, mGCMb reproducibly exhibited a higher affinity for the probe with mutation at position 4 (m4) than for the probe with mutation at position 5 (m5). Complex strength for the m4 probe was approximately 25% of the strength observed for the wild-type probe compared with approximately 10% for m5. In parallel experiments, mGCMa showed comparable affinities for both m4 and m5 (approximately 25% of the wild-type probe) as previously observed (10.Schreiber J. Enderich J. Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2337-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present what these minor differences are caused by.As mGCMb binds to the GCM consensus element with high affinity, it should be possible to analyze the function of mGCMb as a transcription factor in transiently transfected cells using luciferase reporters under the control of GCM consensus elements (4.Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). mGCMb was expressed from its CMV-driven effector plasmid and was detected in its epitope-tagged version in COS cell nuclear extracts by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). mGCMa was detected using an antiserum directed against amino acids 169–436 of this protein (Fig. 3 A) or in its epitope-tagged version by the same monoclonal antibody used for mGCMb (Fig. 3 F).Figure 3Transcriptional activities of the two mammalian GCM homologs. A, expression of mGCMa and mGCMb proteins in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analyses of COS nuclear extracts using a polyclonal antiserum against mGCMa and a monoclonal antibody directed against the T7-epitope tag on mGCMb, respectively. Numbers indicate size of molecular mass markers in kDa. B–E, a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying six tandemly arranged GCM binding sites (6x gbs luc) was transfected into U138 glioblastoma cells (B), COS cells (C), 293 cells (D), and Drosophila S2 cells (E) together with standard amounts (2 μg) of empty expression plasmid (−) or expression plasmids for mGCMa or mGCMb. Luciferase activities in extracts from transfected cells were determined in three independent experiments each performed in duplicates. Data are presented as fold inductions that were calculated for each reporter plasmid by comparing luciferase activities to values from cells transfected with reporter plasmid and empty expression plasmid. F, 6x gbs luc was transfected in 293 cells with increasing amounts of expression plasmids for epitope-tagged mGCMa or mGCMb (5 ng, 50 ng, 500 ng, 2 μg, 4 μg). The amounts of epitope-tagged mGCMa and mGCMb present in transfected 293 cells were determined by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against the T7 epitope (G). Equal amounts of extracts were used in each lane. All lanes were developed simultaneously and for the same length of time. Theasterisks mark a cross-reactive band present in 293 extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When transient transfections were performed in U138 cells (Fig. 3B), mGCMb caused a 10-fold induction of a luciferase reporter with six tandemly arranged binding sites. In parallel transfections, mGCMa elicited a robust 180-fold stimulation of the same reporter. Thus, mGCMb is a relatively poor transcriptional activator in U138 cells when compared with mGCMa.To analyze whether this effect was cell line-specific or a general phenomenon, we carried out additional transfections with the same luciferase reporter in a number of other cell lines. When COS cells were used, we obtained a 3-fold induction for mGCMb versus a 10-fold induction for mGCMa (Fig. 3 C). In 293 cells, activation rates for mGCMb were higher, approximately 20–30-fold. Still, mGCMb was clearly less effective than mGCMa, which on average elicited a 100–110-fold stimulation in parallel transfections (Fig. 3,D). Thus, there is significant variation in the transactivation capacity of mGCMb depending on the cell line used. These differences notwithstanding, mGCMb is always much less active than mGCMa.As functional differences between both mammalian GCM homologs were originally observed in transgenic flies (9.Kim J. Jones B.W. Zock C. Chen Z. Wang H. Goodman C.S. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12364-12369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we repeated our comparative transactivation studies in Drosophila S2 Schneider cells (Fig. 3 E). Reporter gene activation achieved with mGCMb was again low. On average we obtained an 11-fold stimulation for mGCMb, compared with a 98-fold stimulation for mGCMa. Thus, mGCMb exhibits only 11% the activity of mGCMa in Drosophilacells. This low transcriptional activity could in fact explain the different behavior of mGCMa and mGCMb transgenes inDrosophila.All transactivation studies reported so far were carried out under conditions of maximal reporter gene activation. Using increasing amounts of expression plasmids for the epitope-tagged versions of mGCMa and mGCMb, we next analyzed reporter gene activation in relation to steady-state levels of both proteins in transfected 293 cells. For any given amount of expression plasmid, activation rates were higher for mGCMa than for mGCMb (Fig. 3 F). Even with the highest amount of mGCMb expression plasmid, reporter gene induction remained significantly below the activation rates obtained with as little as 50 ng of mGCMa expression plasmid.Western blot analysis with an antibody directed against the epitope tag was used to study the steady-state levels of GCM proteins in the transfected 293 cells. Even though the same expression system was used for both proteins, the amount of accumulated mGCMb protein was significantly below the amount detected for mGCMa for any given amount of expression plasmid (Fig. 3 G). Thus, there is a good correlation between the reporter gene activation achieved by each GCM protein and its ability to accumulate in the transfected cell.To determine the region responsible for the lower transcriptional activity of mGCMb as compared with mGCMa, we generated chimeras between both proteins. Chimera C1 contained the DNA-binding domain of mGCMa in the context of mGCMb sequences. Chimera C2 carried the DNA-binding domain of mGCMb with all other sequences being derived from mGCMa (Fig.4 A). Transient transfections were performed with these chimeras in 293 cells, as these cells not only allowed a clear distinction between mGCMa and mGCMb transactivation levels but also showed mGCMb transactivation levels significantly above background. In these cells, chimera C1 exhibited a transactivation capacity similar to mGCMb (29-fold for C1 and 32-fold for mGCMb), despite the fact that the amino-terminal domain was mGCMa-derived (Fig. 4 B). Chimera C2, on the other hand, was even more active than mGCMa (180-fold for C2 and 110-fold for mGCMa). Thus, transactivation of both chimeras does not correlate with the origin of the DNA-binding domain but instead with the origin of the sequences carboxyl-terminal to the DNA-binding domain. The latter sequences therefore have to be responsible for the functional difference between mGCMa and mGCMb.In the case of mGCMa, the sequences following the DNA-binding domain contain two transactivation regions, one between amino acids 220 and 300 of mGCMa, the other from amino acid 349 to the carboxyl terminus (13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of these transactivation domains is a good explanation for the strong transcriptional activity of mGCMa in transient transfection experiments. Both transactivation domains were transferable to the unrelated DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 transcription factor and functioned independently of each other.To evaluate the presence of transactivation domains within those parts of mGCMb following its DNA-binding domain, we generated an in frame fusion of amino acids 174 to 504 to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and assayed this protein for its ability to activate a reporter gene driven by a Gal4-dependent promoter (Fig.5 A). We failed to detect reporter gene activation independent of whether U138, COS or 293 cells were used (Fig. 5 B, and data not shown). In parallel transfections, the comparable mGCMa construct (Gal4(aC) in Fig.5 B) showed the expected activation (13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, when the expression of the Gal4/mGCMb fusion was checked by Western blot analysis with an antibody directed against the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, we likewise failed to detect protein of the correct size (Fig.5 C). Other fusions between the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and shorter regions of mGCMb also failed to be detected in Western blots, despite the fact that all constructions were repeatedly verified by DNA sequencing (Fig. 5 C and data not shown). This argues that the Gal4/mGCMb fusions were highly unstable in the cells and that transactivation domains, if present, could not be detected by this method.Figure 5Fusion proteins between regions of mGCMb and the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. A, summary of Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4 DBD) constructs. The mGCMb regions present in each fusion protein are indicated by the first and last amino acid still contained within the fragment. Gal4(aC) represents a fusion between Gal4 DBD and amino acids 169–436 of mGCMa. Gal4(aTA2) contains amino acids 330–436 of mGCMa fused to Gal4 DBD (13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). B, the Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter (3x UAS luc) was transfected into 293 cells together with expression plasmids for Gal4 DBD or for the Gal4 DBD fusions depicted in A. Luciferase activities were determined in three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Data are presented for each Gal4 DBD fusion as fold induction above the level of luciferase activity obtained in transfections with an expression plasmid for Gal4 DBD alone, which was given an arbitrary value of 1. C, expression of Gal4 DBD fusion proteins was analyzed by Western blots of nuclear extracts from transfected 293 cells with a monoclonal antibody against the Gal4 DBD. Numbers indicate size of molecular mass markers in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We reasoned that the stability of mGCMb fusions might vary with the domain to which mGCMb regions are fused. Thus, we undertook a second attempt by fusing amino acids 174 to 504 to the POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (Fig. 6 A). We first checked with an antibody directed against the POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP whether this fusion is at all expressed in transfected 293 cells (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis revealed a protein of correct size indicating that this POU/mGCMb fusion is indeed more stable than the analogous Gal4/mGCMb fusion.Using a luciferase reporter which is activated by POU proteins, we analyzed this mGCMb fusion for its transactivation capacity (Fig.6 C). The POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP did not lead to significant transactivation of the luciferase reporter on its own and served as a negative control. The Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP holoprotein, on the other hand, elicited a 7-fold stimulation of reporter gene expression. Similar activation rates were also observed for the mGCMb fusion indicating that there is indeed a transactivation domain between amino acids 174–504 of mGCMb.To determine the borders of this domain, we generated further POU fusion proteins with mGCMb portions starting at amino acids successively closer to the protein's carboxyl terminus (Fig.6 A). The regions analyzed in these fusion proteins corresponded to amino acids 174–504, 258–504, 347–504, and 426–504 of mGCMb. All were made at detectable levels in transiently transfected cells as evident from Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 B). When tested for their ability to stimulate the POU-responsive promoter, the fusion with amino acids 258–504 only yielded a 3-fold stimulation of reporter gene expression, which was significantly lower than the 8-fold stimulation obtained with amino acids 174–504 (Fig. 6 C). This result indicates that some of the transactivation potential is localized between amino acids 174 and 258, which in the context of mGCMb immediately follow the DNA-binding domain of the protein. Further shortening of the mGCMb portion again led to a significant increase in reporter gene expression, as evident from the 12-fold induction obtained with amino acids 347–504. Thus, the region around amino acids 258–346 exerts a negative influence on the transactivation potential of mGCMb. With amino acids 426–504 of mGCMb a 15-fold stimulation was obtained, indicating that the 79 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of mGCMb constitute a second independent transactivation domain. The localization of this transactivation domain correlates well with the localization of transactivation domains within mGCMa andDrosophila GCM (4.Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).To obtain an idea of the relative strength of this transactivation domain, we also fused amino acids 330–436 of mGCMa to the POU domain of Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP. This region had previously been shown in the context of Gal4 fusions to contain the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of mGCMa (13.Reifegerste R. Schreiber J. Gulland S. Ludemann A. Wegner M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In parallel transfections the mGCMa fusion elicited activation rates comparable to the ones obtained with the corresponding mGCMb fusion (amino acids 426–504 in Fig.6 C).A second deletion series of POU/mGCMb fusions was constructed with mGCMb fragments starting at amino acid 174 and extending variable distances toward the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 6 A). A fusion that contained amino acids 174 to 353 of mGCMb exhibited a 13-fold induction of reporter gene expression compared with the 8-fold induction obtained with amino acids 174–504. A fusion with amino acids 174–263 of mGCMb yielded even higher induction rates as evident from the 29-fold stimulation in Fig. 6 C. This result proves, on the one hand, that there are two completely nonoverlapping domains with transactivation potential in mGCMb. It confirms, on the other hand, the presence of an inhibitory domain contained within amino acids 258–346 of mGCMb. Thus, mGCMb has a structure very similar to mGCMa with regard to its transactivation domains. The transactivation domains per se do not seem to be weaker than the ones found in mGCMa. The main difference between the two mammalian GCM proteins is the inhibitory domain in mGCMb, which therefore might be responsible for the significantly weaker transcriptional activity of mGCMb as compared with mGCMa.Taking our observation into account that mGCMb did not accumulate to the same amount in transfected cells as mGCMa and that fusions between portions of mGCMb and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain were extremely labile, we reasoned that part of the functional difference between both mammalian GCM homologs could also be based on differences in protein stability. To compare the stability of mGCMb and mGCMa, we performed pulse-chase experiments in transiently transfected COS cells (Fig.7). This allowed us to follow specifically the decay of protein synthesized de novo during a 1-h period in the presence of 35S-labeled cysteine and35S-labeled methionine over a 6-h chase period. When quantifying the amount of radioactivity present within mGCMb immunoprecipitated from such cells, it became evident that approximately two thirds of the protein had already disappeared after a chase period of 40 min (Fig. 7, A and B). After 2 h, only 17% of the radioactivity was still detectable and 95% of all label had disappeared from mGCMb immunoprecipitates after 6 h. Accordingly, the half-life of mGCMb was estimated to be approximately 30 min in these cells. When this experiment was repeated under identical conditions with mGCMa, we still retrieved almost half the label in immunoprecipitates after a chase period of 2 h (Fig.7 C). Even after 6 h, 20% of the total label remained detectable. The half-life of mGCMa was therefore estimated to be close to 2 h and is therefore in the same range as the one observed for Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in transiently transfected COS cells (Fig.7 D). Thus, we conclude that mGCMb has a significantly shorter half-life and significantly higher turnover than mGCMa.Figure 7Stability of mammalian GCM proteins.mGCMb, mGCMa, their chimeras, C1 and C2, as well as Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP were immunoprecipitated after various chase periods from pulse-labeled COS cells and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

C., Pasco, S., Borel, J. P., and Kefalides, N. A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 20395–20401). We have isolated the receptors for the α3(IV)185–203 peptide from melanoma and prostate tumor cells and identified them as CD47/integrin-associated protein and the integrin αVβ3 (Shahan, T. A., Ziaie, Z., Pasco, S., Fawzi, A., Bellon, G., Monboisse, J. C., and Kefalides, N. A. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 4584–4590). In the present study we have examined the effect of CD47 and the integrin αVβ3 on in vitro tumor cell chemotaxis and Ca2+imodulation in response to COL IV, from the anterior lens capsule (ALC-COL IV) and peptides from its NC-1 domain. COL IV as well as the α3(IV) peptide promoted tumor cell chemotaxis with an immediate increase in intracellular [Ca2+]. Treating tumor cells with CD47 and integrin αVβ3-reactive antibodies reduced chemotaxis as well as the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to ALC-COL IV or the α3(IV)185–203 peptide but not to Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-COL IV or fibronectin. The α3(IV)185–203 synthetic peptide stimulated an increase in calcium from intracellular stores exclusively, whereas ALC-COL IV, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-COL IV, and fibronectin stimulated Ca2+ flux from both internal and external stores. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with Ca2+ chelator bis-(O-aminophenoxyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraaceticacid-acetomethoxy ester inhibited chemotaxis toward both ALC-COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. These data indicate that CD47 and integrin αVβ3 regulate tumor cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism.

We have shown that synthetic peptides comprising residues 185–203 of the NC-1 domain of the α3 chain of COL IV from anterior lens capsule (ALC), enhance melanoma cell adhesion by 50–60% over controls. On the other hand, peptides from a similar region of the other chains (i.e.α1, α2, α4, or α5) were less efficient in promoting adhesion. In these biological activities, the presence of the -SNS- triplet (residues 189–191) in the above peptide appears to be an absolute requirement (8.Han J. Ohno N. Monboisse J.C. Pasco S. Borel J.P.

Pretreatment of the α3(IV)185–203 peptide substrate with a peptide-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibited melanoma cell attachment; however, the treatment of a substrate composed of EHS-COL IV did not inhibit attachment. More recently we have isolated the α3(IV)185–203 peptide-specific receptors on melanoma and prostate tumor cells and identified them as CD47/integrin-associated protein and the αVβ3 integrin by affinity chromatography and Western blot analysis (9.Shahan T.A.

COL IV from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse tumor, which contains only the α1 and α2 chains of COL IV (10.Wisdom Jr., B.J. Gunwar S. Hudson M.D. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1992; 27: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has been previously demonstrated to induce melanoma cell chemotaxis (11.Savarese D.M. Russell J.T. Fatatis A. Liotta L. J. Biol.

(13.Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J.

They concluded that the inhibition was due to a yet unknown post-adhesive event following binding to the β2 integrin subunit. The signal transduction pathways by which CD47 and integrin αVβ3 regulate chemotaxis are mostly unknown. Schwartz et al. (14.Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first described the role of CD47 on Ca2+ flux in endothelial cells. Based on the primary sequence homology of CD47 with known Ca2+ channel proteins, they hypothesized that it may play a role in Ca2+modulation. Their data showed that CD47 is specifically required for integrin-mediated Ca2+ flux in endothelial cells (14.Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Ca2+ modulation in the alteration of the cell cytoskeleton to accommodate cell movement for spreading and motility has been demonstrated (15.Smith T.W. Menter D.G. Nicholson G.L. McIntire L.V. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16.Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, the effect of CD47 on the regulation of Ca2+ flux and motility in tumor cells has not been previously reported. The primary aim of this study was to examine the influence of CD47 and integrin αVβ3 on tumor cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and the NC-1 domain of its α3 chain. The data do indicate that both CD47 and integrin αVβ3influence tumor cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and to synthetic peptides from the α3(IV) chain. Furthermore, we show that the α3(IV)185–203 peptide causes an immediate rise in [Ca2+]i that was inhibited by pretreatment of tumor cells with CD47 or integrin αVβ3-reactive mAbs. The Ca2+chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited chemotaxis toward COL IV, indicating an association between the receptors, cell motility, and Ca2+flux in response to COL IV and its peptides. Cell media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). All pathway inhibitors, dotarazine (17.Tejerina T. Chulia T.

The prostate (DU-145) tumor cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD).

The ovarian tumor cell lines (OV10), which are CD47-positive or -negative, were obtained from Dr. Eric Brown at the University of California, San Francisco. The OV10 cell line, which is CD47-negative, was made CD47-positive by transfection (22.Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

The above cells were cultivated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 2% FBS, and Genticin (10 μg/ml) and counted before plating using a Coulter counter (model ZM; Coulter, Hialeah, FL) or Neubauer hemocytometer. COL IV was extracted from bovine ALC according to the protocol of Brinker et al. (24.Brinker J.M. Pegg M.T. Howard P.S. Kefalides N.A. Collagen Relat.

EHS-COL IV, which contains only the α1 and α2 chains, was a gift from Dr. Hynda Kleinman, National Institutes of Health (25.Kleinman H.K. McGarvery M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K.

Synthetic peptides corresponding to the primary sequence regions of the NC-1 domain of human COL IV α1 and α3 chains (26.Kefalides N.A. Ohno N. Wilson C.B. Fillit H. Zabriski J. Rosenbloom J. Kidney Int. 1994; 43: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were synthesized and purified at the Protein Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) essentially according to the method of Barany and Merrifield (27.Barany G. Merrifield R.B. Gross E. Meinhofer J. The Peptides. II. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-284Google Scholar).

The peptides were solubilized in medium without FBS (overnight at 4 °C) or with 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted to the appropriate concentration in medium with FBS (2%). Vehicle control consisted of only medium into which peptides were diluted.

(Cabin John, MD) (29.Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Lenard E.J. J. Immun. Methods. 1988; 33: 33239-33247Google Scholar). Cells were detached from culture by incubation with Sigma cell dissociation medium and washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h (37 °C at 5% CO2) in the same. In some cases, cells were pretreated for 30 min with integrin-reactive mAbs and washed (twice) with HBSS prior to their addition to the upper well. In other studies, cells were pretreated with BAPTA-AM (145 μm) for 25 min at 37 °C or dotarazine (10 μm) or nifedipine (50 μm), Ca2+ channel modulators, for 60 min before use. Chemoattractants (158 ± 1 μl of various concentrations diluted in medium with 1% FBS) were loaded into the lower compartment, and 110 ± 1 μl of cell suspension (1.5 × 105 cells/ml) was added to the upper compartment. The two compartments were separated by a polyvinylfluoride-free polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores (Poretics, Livermore, CA) precoated with a 0.05% gelatin solution (15 min, room temperature). The apparatus was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 60 min. Filters were then scraped, fixed, stained using a Leukostat kit (Fisher Scientific Inc.), and mounted on glass microscope slides according to manufacturer's instructions. Motility was analyzed by manually counting 6 high power oil-immersion fields using an Olympus microscope (model BH-2) equipped with a Toshiba CCD color video camera (model IXTU40a, Laser and Motion Development, Union City, CA) connected to a PC running Image tool software for Windows (University of Texas, version 1.28). To determine if COL IV and synthetic peptides stimulate a rise in [Ca2+]i, fura-2 fluorescence was measured in melanoma cells. Cells were removed from adherence by incubation with cell dissociation media, washed twice in HBSS without phenol red, and placed in the same appended with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was solubilized in Me2SO (99%) and added to the cell suspension (1.67 × 106/ml) at a final concentration of 25 μm and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, washed and resuspended in Ca2+-free HBSS containing 1 mm EGTA, and used immediately. For extracellular Ca+2 depletion studies, cells were incubated in Ca2+-free HBSS containing 1 mm EGTA for 25 min. For intracellular depletion studies, cells were incubated in Ca2+ free HBSS containing BAPTA-AM (145 μm) for 20 min. In these experiments, COL IV or its synthetic peptides were added to cells alone or to cells that had been previously treated with integrin-reactive mAbs (30 min) and washed (twice) prior to their addition. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured using a Photon Technologies Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) fluorescent spectrophotometer (model MP-2) equipped with a mercury arc lamp and a Windows-based PC running PTI Alpha Scan software (version 2.050). Incubation temperature was automatically maintained at 37 °C. Software was set to allow alternating excitement wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm every 2 s while emission spectra passed through a 510-nm filter before measurement with a photon detector. Uptake of Fura-2 AM among cells was uniform, as determined by fluorescence microscopy immediately after loading and between 1 and 2 h after loading (30.Grynkiewitz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Melanoma cells were washed twice and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS with 25 μm ionomycin and 7 mm EGTA. To the cell suspension, an equal volume of HBSS containing 5 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm Ca2+, and 20 μm ionomycin was added. Free [Ca2+]i concentrations were calculated using the equation of Grynkiewicz (30.Grynkiewitz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were then expressed as nanomolar Ca2+. Data were analyzed using Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA) and were expressed as mean ± S.E. To evaluate the effect of the receptors on agent-mediated chemotaxis, comparisons were performed using Student'st test. Data were considered statistically significant ifp values were <0.05 (31.Dowdy S. Wearden S. Bradley R.A. Hunter J.S. Kendall D.G. Miller R.G. Watson G.S. Statistics for Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1983: 32-38Google Scholar). Tumor cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and synthetic peptides was studied using a modified Boyden chamber. The melanoma cell line W-164 migrated toward ALC-COL IV and the bioactive α3(IV)185–203 synthetic peptide (which contains the triplet -SNS-) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1). On the other hand, the α3(IV)190–203 peptide (which contains -NS-, rather than the -SNS- sequence) failed to induce chemotaxis; similarly, cells responded poorly to the α1(IV)185–203 peptide, which has the -ANS- sequence, even at 1000 μg/ml. Chemotaxis of melanoma cells toward ALC-COL IV peaked at approximately 10 μg/ml at 533 ± 41 cells/HPF, toward EHS-COL IV peaked at 1000 μg/ml with 332 ± 31 cells/HPF and toward the α3(IV)185–203 synthetic peptide peaked at 10 μg/ml with 373 ± 30 cells/HPF (Fig. 1). Motility toward fibronectin peaked at 100 μg/ml with 213 ± 24 cells/HPF for fibronectin (data not shown). It is evident that chemotaxis of melanoma cells toward ALC-COL IV and its α3(IV) peptides was more efficient as compared with EHS-COL IV or synthetic peptides lacking the -SNS- triplet. We have recently isolated the cellular receptors from both melanoma and prostate tumor cells for the α3(IV)185–203 peptide ligand and identified them as CD47 and the αVβ3 integrin (9.Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of these receptors on tumor cell chemotaxis in response to ALC-COL IV, EHS-COL IV, or the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (10 μg/ml), cells were pretreated with receptor-reactive antibodies before analysis (Fig.2, A and B). Treatment of melanoma cells with the CD47-reactive mAb (1 μg/ml) inhibited chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV by 5% (509 ± 55 cells/HPF) (Fig. 2 A), toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide by 16% (275 ± 33 cells/HPF) (Fig. 2 B) and had no effect on chemotaxis toward EHS-COL IV (182 ± 23 cells/HPF) (data not shown). Treatment of the melanoma cells with the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb (0.5 μg/ml) inhibited chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV by 24% (403 ± 34 cells/HPF) (Fig. 2 A), toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide by 32% (221 ± 27 cells/HPF) (Fig. 2 B) and had no effect toward EHS-COL IV (188 ± 39 cells/HPF) (data not shown). Treatment of cells with both mAbs together inhibited chemotaxis toward the ALC-COL IV by 34% (323 ± 33 cells/HPF) (Fig.2 A) and toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide by 71% (103 ± 22 cells/HPF) (Fig. 2 B). As a control, β1 and β2 integrin subunit-reactive mAbs (2 μg/ml) were also tested. These antibodies had no effect on chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide; however, they inhibited chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV by 23% and 6%, respectively (data not shown). This is consistent with previous observations, which demonstrate that COL IV is a ligand for the β1 and β2 integrin subunits (32.Eble J.A. Ries A. Lichy A. Mann K. Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Murphy G. Kuhn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30964-30970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33.Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kuhn K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To further test the effect of these receptors on chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV and the peptides, we examined the ability of the ovarian tumor cell lines, OV10(+) (CD47-positive) and the OV10(−) (CD47-negative), as well as the CS-1(−) (integrin β3-negative) melanoma cell line, to respond to the chemoattractants. Chemotaxis of the OV10(+) cell line toward ALC-COL IV at 100 μg/ml was 441 ± 23 cells/HPF, whereas chemotaxis of the OV10(−) cell line was only 341 ± 28 cells/HPF (Fig.3 A). In comparison, chemotaxis of the CS-1(−) cell line in response to ALC-COL IV at 100 μg/ml was 98 ± 4 cells/HPF in the CS-1(−) cell line (Fig. 3 A). To determine the influence of the CD47 and the integrin αVβ3 receptors in chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV, tumor cells were treated with receptor blocking mAbs before analysis. Treatment of the OV10(+) cell line with CD47-reactive mAb inhibited chemotaxis by 6% (433 ± 34 cells/HPF), whereas treatment with the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb inhibited chemotaxis by 21% (367 ± 31 cells/HPF) toward ALC-COL IV (100 μg/ml) (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of the CS-1(−) cell line with CD47-reactive mAb inhibited chemotaxis by 4% (92 ± 12 cells/HPF), whereas treatment with the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb had no effect on chemotaxis in response to ALC-COL IV (Fig. 2 A). When the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (100 μg/ml) was used as a chemoattractant, chemotaxis of the OV10(+) cell line was 192 ± 13 cells/HPF, whereas of the OV10(−) cell line it was rather lower (98 ± 11 cells/HPF) at the same concentration (Fig.3 B). In comparison, chemotaxis of the CS-1(−) cell line in response to α3(IV)185–203 peptide at 100 μg/ml was 51 ± 4 cells/HPF in the CS-1(−) cell line. To determine the role of CD47 and integrin αVβ3 in chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide, tumor cells were treated with receptor blocking mAbs before analysis (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of the OV10(+) cell line with the CD47-reactive mAb (1 μg/ml) inhibited chemotaxis by 13% (167 ± 17 cells/HPF), whereas treatment with αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb (0.5 μg/ml) inhibited chemotaxis by 63% (70 ± 11 cells/HPF) toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (100 μg/ml). On the other hand, treatment with both antibodies inhibited chemotaxis by 82% (32 ± 6 cells/HPF) toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Fig. 2 Bshows that treatment of the OV10(−) cell line (lacking the CD47 receptor) with the CD47-reactive mAb failed to effect chemotaxis (114 ± 11 cells/HPF), whereas treatment with αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb inhibited chemotaxis by 39% (70 ± 11 cells/HPF) toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (100 μg/ml). As expected, treatment with both antibodies inhibited chemotaxis at the same level as treatment with the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb alone. Treatment of the CS-1(−) cell line (lacking the αVβ3 receptor) with the CD47-reactive mAb inhibited chemotaxis by 47% (24 ± 8 cells/HPF), whereas treatment with the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAb had no effect on chemotaxis in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (Fig. 2 B). Together, these data indicate that both CD47 and the αVβ3 integrin are needed for normal chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV, EHS-COL IV, and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide; however, the αVβ3integrin plays a more substantial role than CD47 in chemotaxis toward these ligands. To investigate the effect of Ca2+ flux on melanoma cell chemotaxis in response to COL IV and its peptides, cells were pretreated with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (145 μm) or with the Ca2+ channel modulators dotarazine (inhibits most Ca2+ channel types) (10 μm) or nifedipine (inhibits L-type Ca2+ channels) (50 μm). Pretreatment of the melanoma cells with BAPTA-AM (145 μm) inhibited chemotaxis by 81% toward ALC-COL IV (89 ± 10 cells/HPF), by 79% toward EHS-COL IV (52 ± 7 cells/HPF), and by 95% toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (15 ± 6 cells/HPF) (Fig.4); these results indicate the general need for Ca2+ in melanoma cell chemotaxis. Similar experiments, performed without external Ca2+, demonstrated that chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide proceeded at near normal levels; however, chemotaxis toward COL IV or fibronectin was inhibited (data not shown). Addition of Ca2+ to the cell medium returned melanoma cell chemotaxis toward ALC-COL IV and EHS-COL IV to near normal levels; however, it had little effect on chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (data not shown). Pretreatment of melanoma cells with dotarazine (10 μm) inhibited chemotaxis by 62% toward ALC-COL IV (197 ± 21 cells/HPF) and by 72% toward EHS-COL IV (77 ± 13 cells/HPF); however, had no effect on chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Pretreatment with nifedipine (50 μm) had no effect on melanoma cell chemotaxis toward the α3(IV) peptide (Fig. 4). These data indicate that Ca2+ modulation in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide is from interior stores almost exclusively and that this modulation is necessary for melanoma cell chemotaxis toward these ligands. We have shown that Ca2+channel modulators as well as the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM influence chemotaxis toward COL IV and its synthetic peptides (Fig. 4). To further understand the effect of COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide as well as the role of CD47 and αVβ3 integrin receptors on [Ca2+]i levels in tumor cells, we measured actual [Ca2+]i level in melanoma cells in response to these agents in the presence or absence of receptor-reactive mAbs or dotarazine. ALC-COL IV, EHS-COL IV and α3(IV)185–203 (100 μg/ml) caused an immediate rise in [Ca2+]i in the melanoma cell line (W-164) of 1271 ± 69 nm, 1115 ± 75 nm, and 1103 ± 34 nm (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 5 A). By comparison, the α1(IV)185–203, α2(IV)185–203, and α3(IV)190–203 synthetic peptides, which lack the -SNS- sequence, had little effect on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5 A). Basal melanoma cell cytoplasmic [Ca2+] level for the melanoma cell line W-164 was calculated to be 195 ± 37 nm on average. Treatment of melanoma cells with the CD47 or the αVβ3 integrin-reactive mAbs decreased [Ca2+]i and therefore mobilization in response to ALC-COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide as compared with levels without antibody treatment. When melanoma cells were treated with the CD47 mAb (1 μg/ml), [Ca2+]i decreased primarily in response to the α3(IV) peptide; mobilization peaked at 1068 ± 25 nm in response to ALC-COL IV, 1124 ± 59 nm in response to EHS-COL IV, and 623 ± 13 nm in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Treatment of melanoma cells with the αVβ3integrin-reactive mAb allowed [Ca2+]i to peak at 791 ± 26 nm in response to ALC-COL IV, 1121 ± 94 nm in response to EHS-COL IV, and 701 ± 9 nm in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Whereas treatment of the tumor cells with both mAbs together decreased [Ca2+]i mobilization to 0 nm in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide, it allowed [Ca2+]i to peak at 797 ± 57 nm in response to ALC-COL IV and 1127 ± 107 nm in response to EHS-COL IV (Fig. 5 B). Treatment of the cells with the CD47 mAb at levels above 10 μg/ml inhibited Ca2+i mobilization in response to both EHS-COL IV or fibronectin (data not shown), indicating that high levels of the CD47-reactive mAb may inhibit Ca2+i modulation in a nonspecific manner. Comparison of these data to studies without antibodies was made using the data presented in Fig. 5 A. As an additional control, the cells were treated with either integrin β1or β2 subunit-reactive mAbs. These mAbs had little effect on [Ca2+]i at the concentration used. Treatment of the cells with the antibodies alone had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i (data not shown). These data indicate that the α3(IV)185–203 peptide initiates Ca2+ mobilization by virtue of the -SNS- at residues 189–191; they also demonstrate that both CD47 and the αVβ3 integrin regulate Ca2+i mobilization in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide, ALC-COL IV, and EHS-COL IV. To determine whether the α3(IV)185–203 peptide stimulated Ca2+ flux was from internal or external sources, specific channel modulators were used. The calcium channel modulator dotarazine (Fig. 5 B) had no effect on Ca2+ mobilization, with (Fig. 5 B) or without (data not shown) external Ca2+ on melanoma cells stimulated with the α3(IV)185–203 synthetic peptide, further suggesting that the primary source of Ca2+ is from intracellular stores. In contrast, ALC-COL IV or EHS-COL IV failed to increase [Ca2+]i in the presence of dotarazine (Fig. 5 B). Treatment with nifedipine had no effect (data not shown) on [Ca2+]imobilization. As expected, treatment of cells with BAPTA-AM inhibited Ca2+i mobilization in response to all agents (data not shown). The ability of CD47 and integrin αVβ3to function as receptors mediating chemotaxis in response to the α3 chain of COL IV is a novel observation. Type IV collagen is found in BM and contributes to its structural and functional properties. Our studies have discovered additional biological properties of BMs that can be attributed to COL IV. Because of their critical location, underlying all endothelial and epithelial surfaces, BMs can be considered as our first line of defense. As with the enhancement of PMN chemotaxis toward BM components (32.Eble J.A. Ries A. Lichy A. Mann K. Stanton H. Gavrilovic J. Murphy G. Kuhn K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30964-30970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the present studies demonstrate that COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide enhance tumor cell chemotaxis. The chemotactic potential of other BM components such as fibronectin, laminin, and entactin has also been demonstrated (34.Senior R.M. Gresham H.D. Griffin G.L. Brown E.J. Chung A.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2251-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,35.Klominek J. Sumitran-Karuppan S. Hauzenberger D. Int. J. Can. 1997; 72: 1034-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that the α3(IV)185–203 peptide bound specifically to CD47 and the αVβ3integrin (9.Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). CD47 is known to influence PMN motility; however, the mechanism of this process is unknown (12.Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble J.R. Brown E.J. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3978-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13.Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence which demonstrates that these receptors are necessary for unabated tumor cell chemotaxis toward COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Treatment of these cells with either CD47 or integrin αVβ3 mAbs alone partially inhibited chemotaxis; however, treatment of the tumor cells with both mAbs together markedly inhibited chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide and ALC-COL IV. On the other hand, the mAbs had little or no effect in the presence of other chemoattractants such as EHS-COL IV or fibronectin. These data indicate that CD47 and integrin αVβ3 are involved in chemotaxis in response to ALC-COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. CD47 has been previously shown to associate with and modulate integrin activation. Data support its association with the β1(33.Vandenberg P. Kern A. Ries A. Luckenbill-Edds L. Mann K. Kuhn K. J.

Previous data from our laboratory suggest that the interaction of CD47 with αVβ3 is necessary for the complete inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and normal tumor cell adhesion to a substrate composed of the α3(IV)185–203 peptide (9.Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have presented evidence that both these receptors are also necessary for normal chemotaxis toward the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. The same argument holds true for the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to the above peptide. The requirement of Ca2+ flux for cell movement has already been described (15.Smith T.W. Menter D.G. Nicholson G.L. McIntire L.V. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16.Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that COL IV and the α3(IV)185–203 peptide cause an immediate, unsustained rise in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, treatment of melanoma cells with either CD47 or integrin αVβ3-reactive mAbs alone inhibited the rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, Aand B). In comparison, treatment of melanoma cells with either CD47 or integrin αVβ3-reactive mAbs alone inhibited chemotaxis partially in response to ALC-COL IV and markedly in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide but had no effect on chemotaxis toward EHS-COL IV. These data suggest that the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide is mediated through the same receptors for the peptide as those required for chemotaxis. Based on the predicted structure of CD47 (5 transmembrane domains) and its primary sequence homology to known channel proteins, it has been hypothesized that the receptor may function in the capacity of an ion channel or be closely associated with one (11.Savarese D.M. Russell J.T. Fatatis A. Liotta L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21928-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the relationship among these factors, namely the peptide, the two receptors, and Ca2+ modulation, we examined the source of the Ca2+ flux. We found that the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide was primarily from intracellular sources. In comparison, the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to ALC-COL IV and EHS-COL IV was mostly from extracellular sources. Since we have demonstrated that the receptors for the α3(IV)185–203 peptide are CD47 and integrin αVβ3, these data suggest that CD47 may not act as an ion channel in melanoma cells in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide; however, the receptors are likely linked to a signal transduction pathway that leads to the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. On the other hand, treatment of melanoma cells with the CD47 mAb (B6H12) at concentrations above 10 μg/ml inhibited the rise in [Ca2+]i in response to either EHS-COL IV and fibronectin, each of which were shown to cause a rise in [Ca2+]i mostly from extracellular stores. This indicates that CD47 may function as a Ca2+ channel in response to certain agents, but not in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. In this report we have demonstrated a regulatory effect of normal type IV collagen from ALC and peptides derived from the NC-1 domain of the α3(IV) chain on tumor cell chemotaxis in vitro. Specifically, we have shown that CD47 and the αVβ3 integrin are necessary for melanoma cell chemotaxis in response to the α3(IV)185–203 peptide. Our current findings also indicate that calcium flux is an important regulator of chemotaxis toward these ligands and suggest the presence of a Ca2+-sensitive signal transduction pathway through CD47 and the integrin αVβ3.

https://openalex.org/W2017981180,"The structural bases of general anesthetic action on a neuronal K+ channel were investigated using the series of homologous 1-alkanols, electrophysiology, and mutational analysis. Domain swapping between dShaw2 (alkanol-sensitive) and hKv3.4 (alkanol-resistant) and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that a 13-amino acid cytoplasmic loop (S4-S5) determines the selective inhibition of native dShaw2 channels by 1-alkanols. The S4-S5 loop may contribute to a receptor for both 1-alkanols and the inactivation particle, because the enhanced 1-alkanol sensitivity of hKv3.4 channels hosting S4-S5 mutations correlates directly with disrupted channel inactivation. Evidence of a discrete protein site was also obtained from the analysis of the relationship between potency and alkyl chain length, which begins to level off after 1-hexanol. Rapid application to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out membrane patches shows that the interaction between dShaw2 channels and 1-alkanols equilibrates in <200 ms. By contrast, the equilibration time is >1000-fold slower when the drug is applied externally to outside-out membrane patches. The data strongly favor a mechanism of inhibition involving a discrete internal site for 1-alkanols in dShaw2 K+ channels.

Furthermore, these studies suggest that diverse sites but similar molecular mechanisms may underlie general anesthesia and alcohol intoxication. The application of mutational analysis and electrophysiology to the investigation of model ion channels that directly interact with 1-alkanols can provide detailed information about the general characteristics of the 1-alkanol sites in membrane proteins and the molecular interactions that underlie the effects of general anesthetics and 1-alkanols on more complex neuronal ion channels. We have investigated the molecular properties of the putative 1-alkanol site in Drosophila dShaw2 K+ channels. These channels are expressed in Drosophila neurons and exhibit low voltage sensitivity, low open probability, and no inactivation (13.Wei A. Covarrubias M. Butler A. Baker K. Pak M.D. Salkoff L.

The earlier work also showed that dShaw2 subunits confer 1-alkanol sensitivity to hybrid channels and suggested that a dShaw2-specific isoleucine in the S4-S5 cytoplasmic loop of the channel subunit contributes to a hydrophobic site of action (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic S4-S5 loop (13 amino acids) is also associated in various ways with the gating of voltage-gated K+ channels. Point mutations or chemical modification in the S4-S5 loop alter the development of rapid inactivation and destabilize the inactivated state of the channel (18.Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.-N. Jan L.-N. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19.Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen.

Thus, it has been suggested that the S4-S5 loop is a component of the receptor for the inactivation particle of the channel. Other studies have also shown that the S4-S5 loop contributes to voltage-dependent gating and the structural stability of K+ channels (21.McCormack K. Tanouye M.A. Iverson L.E. Lin J.W. Ramaswami M.

J. 1993; 65: 1740-1748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on this information and on structural criteria, current models of voltage-gated K+ channels depict the S4-S5 loop as a short α-helical segment that together with the cytoplasmic sections of S5 and S6 form the inner mouth of the pore (23.Durell S.R. Hao Y. Guy H.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 263-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

In this study, mutational analysis identifies the cytoplasmic S4-S5 loop of dShaw2 channels as a necessary molecular determinant of 1-alkanol action and suggests that the structure of this region is critical to maintain both the 1-alkanol site and the receptor site of the inactivation particle. Further evidence of a discrete site is obtained by examining long chain 1-alkanols, and kinetic analysis confirms that the 1-alkanol site is most likely located at the cytoplasmic side of the channel. The data are consistent with a new working model where 1-alkanols interact with discrete protein crevices near the putative internal gate (which is influenced by the S4-S5 loop) and thereby lock the pore in its closed conformation. Ethanol and 1-butanol were purchased from Fisher. 1-Hexanol was from Sigma, and 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-decanol, and 1-undecanol were from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). All 1-alkanols were mixed in the external or internal bath solutions. For adequate mixing, solutions containing long-chain 1-alkanols (1-octanol, 1-decanol, and 1-undecanol) were sonicated (bath sonicator, 15–30 min). In some cases, long-chain 1-alkanols were also predissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (maintaining the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide below 0.02%). The concentration of the long-chain 1-alkanols was verified by gas chromatography in the perfusion reservoir (see below), the recording chamber, and the perfusate. For all of the 1-alkanols, no losses were detected in the perfusion system. Two to four ml of the buffer from the perfusion reservoir, the recording chamber, or the perfusate were extracted with 0.2 ml of hexane and dried briefly over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Completeness of the extraction was assessed by extracting and analyzing known amounts of standard 1-alkanols added to the buffer. For analysis, an alkanol differing by one carbon atom from the one in the sample was added to the buffer as an internal standard. The 1-alkanols were separated by capillary gas liquid chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard 5890A gas-liquid chromatograph with a fused silica highly polar stabilized biscyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane phase SP-2380 column (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, 0.2-μm film thickness) (Supelco, Bellefont, PA). The column temperature was linearly programmed from 120 to 140 °C at 5 °C/min with an initial time of 5 min and a final time of 1 min, and the injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. The 1-alkanols were identified by comparison with retention times of standard 1-alkanols and were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard 3393A computing integrator to calculate the area percentage of each 1-alkanol. The detector response was checked daily with 1-alkanol standards. Wild-type cDNAs encoding dShaw2 and hKv3.4 were maintained as described previously (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Quick Change (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make the mutations according to the manufacturer specifications and as described before (29.Beck E.J. Sorensen R.G. Slater S.J. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The objective of the mutagenesis was to convert all seven amino acid differences between the S4-S5 loops of dShaw2 and hKv3.4 (including a total of 13 amino acids). Table I summarizes the main mutations investigated in this study. Multiple dShaw2 mutations were created sequentially as follows: wild-type dShaw2 → I319G → I319G/F322L → S3 → S5 → S6 → SK chimera (complete conversion). The S4-S5 loop of the SK chimera was identical to that of hKv3.4. I319G and F322L were used to make I319G/A326T and F322L/A326T, respectively. Introducing G319I in the SK chimera created a reversal mutant. S5 was also made by cassette mutagenesis (named S5′). Briefly, plasmids hosting wild-type dShaw2 and the mutant dShaw2 were digested with two restriction endonucleases (HpaI and PshAI at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively). These enzymes excised the mutant fragment of interest (residues 314–328) and created compatible restriction endonuclease sites in the wild-type dShaw2 vector for subcloning (following digestion, the vector was also treated with alkaline phosphatase to prevent self-ligation). The fragment and the wild-type host vector were then gel-purified and ligated (10:1, vector:insert) using commercially available techniques and standard procedures (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Multiple hKv3.4 mutations were created sequentially as follows: Wild-type hKv3.4 → G371I → G371I/L374F → K3 → K5 → K6 and KS chimera (two possible combination of six substitutions; Table I). Except for Asn379, the S4-S5 loop of the KS chimera is identical to that of dShaw2. The mutation N379K creates K7. The S4-S5 loop of K7 is identical to that of dShaw2 (Table I). G371I and L374F were used to make G371I/T378A and L374F/T378A, respectively. K5′ was made from the KS chimera by introducing F374L. The mutants K5, K6, and K7 did not express or expressed very poorly (<300 nA). The K7 mutant allowed, however, a limited analysis of 1-alkanol sensitivity. Thus, a complete quantitative analysis of 1-alkanol sensitivity and inactivation gating that approximates a complete exchange was obtained from the KS chimera (see “Results”). To make hKv3.4 Δ1–28, the M1G mutation effectively deleted the first 28 amino acids of the channel protein because the next starting site in the cDNA corresponds to Met29. All mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Jefferson Cancer Institute). To verify the absence of undesired mutations, the complete reading frames of the KS and the SK chimeras were sequenced. Capped cRNA for expression inXenopus oocytes was produced by in vitrotranscription using the Message Machine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).Table IS4-S5 loop mutations examined in this studyThe 13 residues of the loop are labeled as single digit numbers.

For each mutant, amino acids that remained unchanged are highlighted. Wild-type and mutant cRNAs were injected into defolliculated Xenopus oocytes (∼50 ng/cell) using a Nanoject microinjector (Drummond, Broomall, PA). Currents were recorded 3–7 days postinjection. The two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (TEV-200; Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) was used to record whole-oocyte currents. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (tip resistance was <1 megaohms). The bath solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Current traces (generally 450–900-ms depolarizations) were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz (−3 decibels) and digitized at 500 μs/point. The voltage offset recorded at the end of an experiment was generally small (−0.75 ± 2.2,n = 22) and was not subtracted from the command voltage. Correction was applied when offset appeared to be greater than one S.D. value. The leak current was subtracted off-line, assuming ohmic leak or using a P/4 procedure. In whole-oocyte experiments, 1-alkanols were applied externally as described previously (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whole-oocyte currents were recorded at 23 °C using a temperature-controlled microscope stage (PDMI-2, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). Patch clamp recording was conducted as described before (27.Jerng H.H. Shahidullah M. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 641-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes were constructed from Corning glass 7052 (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Typically, for macropatch recording, the tip resistance of the recording pipettes in the bath solution (see below) was 0.5–1 megaohms. The pipette solution (external) was as described above. For inside-out patches, the bath solution (internal) contained 98 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH). For outside patches, the pipette solution had the composition of the internal solution described above, and the bath solution was a standard external solution (see above). Patch clamp experiments were recorded at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). For rapid patch perfusion experiments with inside-out macropatches, the dShaw2 currents were evoked by holding the membrane potential at +50 mV (since dShaw2 channels do not inactivate). These currents were low pass-filtered at 1.5 kHz (−3 decibels, 8-pole Bessel filter; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 5 kHz (see below). Control and 1-alkanol solutions were delivered from the thinned tip of a θ capillary tube (diameter, 100 μm; septum, 8 μm) by a gravity-driven system. Both solutions flow constantly during an experiment (flow rate of 4 μl/s), creating a sharp interface (<2 μm) between the two streams. The patch pipette tip exposing the cytoplasmic face of an inside-out patch is positioned in front of the θ tube, about 100 μm from the tip. To accomplish rapid solution exchange, the sharp solution interface is moved by means of a piezoelectric translator (LSS-3100, Burleigh Instruments, Fishers, NY) that controls the position of the θ tube. The solution switching time was estimated to be on the order of 0.4–1 ms (10–90% rise time) by measuring the current elicited by a change in the liquid junction potential at the open tip of a patch pipette. The actual solution exchange time for inside-out oocyte macropatches is found to be ≤3 ms (30.Antz C. Bauer T. Kalbacher H. Frank R. Covarrubias M. Kalbitzer H.R. Ruppersberg J.P. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Generally, the average of 70–100 on/off sweeps was stored for later analysis. Voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition were controlled by a desktop personal computer interfaced to a 12-bit A/D converter (Digidata 1200B using pClamp 6.0 or pClamp 7.0; Axon Instruments). Data analysis and curve fitting were conducted using Clampfit (pClamp 6.0; Axon Instruments), Sigmaplot (Jandel, San Rafael, CA), or Origin (Microcal Software Inc., Northhampton, MA). Equilibrium dose-inhibition experiments were analyzed as described before (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, all pooled values are expressed as mean ± S.D. The program AGADIR (developed by Dr. L. Serrano's laboratory (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to model the free energy changes associated with the putative α-helix/random coil equilibrium in the S4-S5 loop (assuming that this segment is not inserted in the membrane). Based on the helix/coil transition theory (31.Muñoz V. Serrano L. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 32.Muñoz V. Serrano L. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1995; 6: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the AGADIR algorithm uses empirical parameters stored in a data base to estimate a set of energy contributions, which accounts for the stability of the α-helix in solution (31.Muñoz V. Serrano L. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 33.Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The energy contributions include the intrinsic tendency of amino acids to be in helical dihedral angles, short range interactions, and long range electrostatics. AGADIR has accurately predicted the α-helical content of more 1000 peptides (including more than 200 protein fragments). Fig. 1illustrates the sequence alignment and putative α-helical wheel projections of the S4-S5 loops in dShaw2 and hKv3.4 subunits (both members of the Shaw family). Although no direct information about the secondary structure of the S4-S5 loop is available yet, the results of other studies are consistent with such a model (18.Isacoff E.Y. Jan Y.-N. Jan L.-N. Nature. 1991; 353: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 19.Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23.Durell S.R. Hao Y. Guy H.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 263-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Between the dShaw2 and related Kv3 subunits there are seven amino acid differences in the S4-S5 loop (Fig. 1), and, compared with dShaw2, hKv3.4 and rKv3.1 K+ channels exhibit low sensitivity to 1-alkanols (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17.Covarrubias M. Rubin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6957-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Note, however, that the upper right-hand quadrant of the wheel is nearly identical between the two and that most of the differences are in the lower quadrants including various hydrophobic substitutions. In particular, isoleucine occupies position 319 in dShaw2 and glycine occupies the equivalent position in hKv3.4 and the vast majority of voltage-gated K+ channels. The mutation G371I in hKv3.4 confers enhanced 1-alkanol sensitivity (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, a unique hydrophobic residue in the S4-S5 loop of dShaw2 appears to contribute to the site of 1-alkanol action. Here, we report a systematic analysis to test the contribution of the S4-S5 loop to the putative 1-alkanol site in dShaw2 and examine the mechanism of action. We created the chimeras depicted in Fig. 2 to test whether the S4-S5 loop is indeed a critical determinant of the 1-alkanol binding site in dShaw2 K+ channels. The loops were effectively swapped to obtain the KS chimera (hKv3.4 is the host, and dShaw2 is the donor; see “Experimental Procedures”) and the SK chimera (dShaw2 is the host and hKv3.4 is the donor). Fig.3 A (top row) shows wild-type hKv3.4 and dShaw2 outward currents (elicited by a pulse to +40 mV) in the absence and presence of 11 mm 1-butanol. While dShaw2 currents are inhibited 39% in a reversible manner, hKv3.4 currents are nearly unaffected. The apparent equilibrium constants (K 12) estimated from the 1-butanol equilibrium dose-inhibition analysis are 17 and 70 mm for dShaw2 and hKv3.4, respectively (Fig.3 B). Relative to the host channel, the chimeras produce nearly opposite results that closely match the donor channel. Under the same conditions described above, the SK chimera is inhibited only 8.6%, whereas the KS chimera is inhibited 50% (Fig. 3 A). The K 1/2 values were 50 and 10 mmfor the SK and KS chimeras, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The Hill coefficients revealed another interesting difference. While the values for the alkanol-sensitive channels are 1.2 and 1.4 (dShaw2 and the KS chimera, respectively), those for the alkanol-resistant channels were 2 and 2.8 (hKv3.4 and the SK chimera, respectively). This result suggests that the latter channels may exhibit multiple interacting sites.Figure 3Exchanging the S4-S5 loop is sufficient to enhance or reduce the 1-alkanol sensitivity of K+channels. A, whole-oocyte currents recorded in the absence and presence of 11 mm 1-butanol (traces 1 and 2, respectively) and after washout (trace 3). All currents were elicited by a step depolarization to +40 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV (thedashed line represents the zero current level). In hKv3.4 Δ1–28, the inactivation particle was deleted to remove the rapid N-type inactivation. Because a complete conversion of the S4-S5 loop in hKv3.4 caused the lowest expression (mutant K7; Table I), for better resolution in dose-inhibition experiments the hKv3.4 chimera maintains a wild-type amino acid at position 379 (i.e. conversion of six out of seven differences; Table I and Experimental Procedures). Fig. 4 B shows single concentration data of the K7 mutant.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 1-alkanol sensitivity of the NH2-terminal-deleted hKv3.4 (Δ1–28) was examined to rule out the influence of the inactivation domain on the inhibition by 1-alkanols. As expected, the deletion mutant exhibits no rapid inactivation, and as for the wild-type hKv3.4 and the SK chimera, the inhibition by 11 mm 1-butanol is also very small (4.8%; Fig. 3 A). In fact, the dose-inhibition curves from hKv3.4 and Δ1–28 were nearly identical (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the presence of the inactivation domain does not determine the low 1-alkanol sensitivity of hKv3.4. It is clear, however, that swapping the S4-S5 loop between hKv3.4 and dShaw2 is sufficient to enhance or reduce 1-alkanol action. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the S4-S5 loop of dShaw2 was progressively converted into that of hKv3.4 and vice versa to examine the contribution of added mutations to the inhibitory action of 1-alkanols (see TableI for nomenclature; Fig.4). Their effects were assessed by a protocol described above. In dShaw2 (Fig. 4 A), a minimum of six mutations was necessary to reduce the inhibitory effect of 1-butanol by 2-fold, and a complete conversion (seven substitutions) produced nearly an additional 2-fold reduction. Interestingly, the F322L and I319G/F322L mutations abolish functional expression, but when combined with other mutations they enhance inhibition by 1-alkanols (F322L/A326T and S3). This effect is reversed by two additional mutations K316R/I317V before a significant reduction of the 1-butanol sensitivity is apparent by the addition of a sixth mutation (K327N). In hKv3.4 (Fig. 4 B), a previously characterized single mutation (G371I) (6.Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was sufficient to enhance inhibition by ∼4-fold, and other double and triple mutations (L374F/T378A; G371I/T378A; and K3) also enhanced the inhibition considerably (∼3–5-fold). Notice, however, that two of these mutants already include the G371I mutation, and the mutation L374F in two mutants (G371I/L374F and K3) appears to partly reverse the level of inhibition established by G371I. As with F322L in dShaw2, the reverse mutation L374F at the equivalent site in hKv3.4 destroyed functional expression. Also, a hKv3.4 mutant with six substitutions exhibits enhanced inhibition above the level expected in wild-type dShaw2 channels (this mutant is characterized as the KS chimera in Fig. 3). The mutant K5′ had already reached the level of inhibition observed with dShaw2 chann"

Except for the latter three proteins, which are not active toward standard carboxypeptidase substrates and have been hypothesized to function as binding proteins, all of the other members of this subfamily cleave C-terminal Arg from small synthetic peptides. Carboxypeptidase Z (CPZ)1 was discovered during a search for novel carboxypeptidases that could compensate for defective carboxypeptidase E inCpe fat /Cpe fat mice (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,10.Fricker L.D. Leiter E.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 390-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These mice lack carboxypeptidase E but are still capable of a reduced level of processing of neuroendocrine peptides (11.Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 12.Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L. Leiter E.H. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30619-30624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, based on the non-neuroendocrine tissue distribution of CPZ, it is unlikely that this enzyme plays a role in neuroendocrine peptide processing. For example, in brain, CPZ is primarily expressed in the leptomeningeal cells and is not detectable in neurons (13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzymatic properties of CPZ are not consistent with a role for this enzyme in the processing of peptides within the secretory pathway (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most importantly, CPZ is essentially inactive at the acidic pH values of the regulated secretory vesicles (14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that CPZ performs another role, possibly outside the cell. CPZ is predicted to be secreted from cells based on the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system, CPZ was not detected in the medium, although enzyme activity was detected on the cell surface despite the absence of a conventional membrane-binding domain (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CPZ is unique among the members of the metallocarboxypeptidase family in that CPZ contains a cysteine-rich domain that has amino acid sequence identity with proteins that bind Wnt/wingless, such as the frizzled receptors, frzb, sizzled, and several other proteins (15.Chan S.D.H.

This cysteine-rich domain within CPZ is highly conserved between the human and rat proteins, suggesting that it is functional. Although many of the Wnt-binding proteins function as receptors with Wnt being the ligand that initiates the signal transduction events, several Wnt-binding proteins are thought to bind Wnt and form inactive complexes (21.Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 22.Wang S. Krinks M. Lin K. Luyten F.P. Moos M.J.

Since CPZ does not resemble a transmembrane-spanning receptor, a more likely function would be analogous to that of frzb and other proteins that inactivate Wnt. To investigate whether CPZ is present in the parts of the cells where an interaction with Wnt is possible, we examined the intracellular distribution of endogenous CPZ in the PC12 cell line, a rat pheochromocytoma that expresses relatively high levels of CPZ, and in several human tissues. We also examined the distribution of exogenous CPZ in a cell line that does not normally produce detectable levels of CPZ. Our findings that CPZ is present in the secretory pathway and is associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) are consistent with a role for CPZ as a Wnt-binding protein. CPZ was detected using rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins. One fusion protein contained the C-terminal 73 amino acids of rat CPZ. This region has 62% amino acid identity between rat and human CPZ, although the C-terminal 32 residues of this region has 81% amino acid identity (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another fusion protein contained 50 amino acids of rat CPZ corresponding to positions 163–212 (13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This region has 78% amino acid identity between rat and human CPZ. AtT-20 cells were stably transfected with human CPZ under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and single colonies of stably transfected cells were identified by Western blot analysis, as described previously (14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Wild type and CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells were cultured on growth-supporting glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific). PC12 cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine coverslips (Becton Dickinson). Cells were washed twice with DMEM, once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were rinsed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and then blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After blocking, the cells were immunostained for 1 h with antisera raised against the CPZ C-terminal region (1:2000 dilution), and then washed three times for 5 min with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS and once with PBS alone. To detect the antisera to CPZ, fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution) was added and the cells were incubated in the dark for 1 h. The cells were washed as described above, and the coverslips were mounted on the glass slides in 50% glycerol in PBS and examined using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. AtT-20 cells (wild type and CPZ-expressing clones) were grown in 35-mm plates, washed twice with PBS, and once with serum-free DMEM. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 500 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.2 μg/ml tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, 10 μm forskolin, or control medium. After 30 min, the media were removed and collected on ice, and aliquots were tested for enzyme activity and analyzed by Western blotting (see below). AtT-20 and PC12 cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and were harvested when 90% confluent. After removal of the culture medium, cells were washed with PBS three times and then detached from the dishes with 1 mm EDTA in PBS. The dishes were then rinsed twice with EDTA. All washes were combined, and cells were collected after centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 4% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). The extracellular material remaining on the dishes after removal of the cells was extracted with 90 °C sample buffer (this fraction was designated ECM). Aliquots of the cell medium were also combined with sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Samples were fractionated on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with 1:1000 dilution of antiserum, and the bound antiserum was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells cultured in 60-mm dishes (90% confluent) were incubated for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM. This medium was then removed and replaced with 1.5 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 300 μCi/ml [35S]Met. The cells were labeled for 20 min (“pulse”), the radioactive medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM (“chase”) for the indicated time. At each time point, the medium was collected, cells were washed with PBS, and lysed in 0.4 ml of 2% SDS in Buffer A (2.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). ECM fractions were extracted in 0.4 ml of the same buffer at 90 °C. Cells and ECM samples were sonicated, boiled for 10 min, diluted with 1.6 ml of Buffer A to reduce the SDS concentration to 0.4%, centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant subjected to immunoprecipitation. Media samples were diluted 1:1 with 5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, and 0.8% SDS. Cells, ECM, and media fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1:10 dilution of the antiserum directed against the N- or C-terminal regions of CPZ. For the analysis of the effect of glycosidases on the electrophoretic mobility of the CPZ, the labeling with [35S]Met was performed for 1 h. Following immunoprecipitation, the protein A-agarose pellets were boiled in 100 μl of denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs) for 10 min, and then 33-μl aliquots were mixed with endoglycosidase H or peptidyl-N-glycosidase F in G5 buffer (New England Biolabs), or with control buffer alone. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and then fractionated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Tissue sections taken from both the fetal and maternal sides of the central portion of placentae were retrieved from the human placental tissue bank, which stores liquid nitrogen snap-frozen placental tissues at −80 °C from over 2000 patients who delivered at Georgetown University Hospital. Tissue from five patients with normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries at 40 weeks' gestation, with no significant past medical or obstetrical history, were examined for CPZ immunoreactivity. Tissue sections of human adenocarcinoma were retrieved from the tumor bank, which stores liquid nitrogen snap-frozen cancer tissues at −80 °C from patients undergoing surgical resections of cancers at Jack D. Weiler Hospital. Studies involving human tissue were conducted with IRB approval (IRB protocol 1199707276.) Tissue blocks were warmed to −20 °C, mounted on a microtome chuck with optimal cutting compound, and sectioned at 4 μm. After air-drying for at least 1 h and desiccating for at least 24 h, sections were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After extensive washing in PBS, sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After subsequent washing in PBS, sections were incubated in a humidified chamber with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding. Excess buffer was blotted off and the primary antiserum directed against the C-terminal region of CPZ, or preimmune serum for negative controls, was added, diluted 1:500 for placental staining and 1:200 for cancer tissue staining in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. For extracellular matrix marker studies, a monoclonal antibody directed against fibronectin (Sigma, clone FN-15) was used at the recommended dilution (1:10). After a 1-h incubation, the sections were washed in 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. For the immunohistochemistry of human placental basal plate and adenocarcinoma, immunostaining was achieved using an avidin-biotin complex developer kit (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate. Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence microscopy of human amnion, sections of fetal chorionic plate were incubated with anti-CPZ antiserum as described above and staining was developed with fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Vector; Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissue sections were examined with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Wild type AtT-20 cells do not show detectable levels of CPZ mRNA (not shown) and show only background staining with an antiserum directed against the C-terminal region of CPZ (Fig.1). When four separate clonal lines of AtT-20 cells expressing high levels of CPZ were analyzed, only 20% of the cells in each line stained with the antiserum to CPZ (data not shown). Recloning the CPZ-expressing cells did not substantially change the fraction of cells that stained positively for CPZ protein. The CPZ staining is strongest in the tips of the cells, a result that resembles the localization of mature secretory vesicles (Fig. 1). In addition, punctate staining is seen throughout the cell body (Fig. 1). CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells were examined by Western blot analysis. Cell extracts show two major bands of immunoreactive CPZ with apparent molecular masses of 68 and 72 kDa (Fig.2). Media from the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells showed only the smaller of these two forms (Fig. 2). The ECM fraction of the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells, defined as the material remaining on the cell culture plate following removal of the cells from the plate, contained the 72-kDa form of CPZ (Fig. 2). As a control, CPE was only detected in the cells and media, consistent with the localization of this protein to the regulated secretory pathway and not the ECM. The endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin was detected only in the cellular fraction, further indicating that the ECM fraction is not contaminated by unremoved cells. In some experiments, the addition of heparin to the medium appeared to slightly decrease the amount of CPZ in the ECM fraction and increase the amount in the medium (Fig. 2). However, this effect was small and variable, with some experiments showing no effect of heparin on the distribution of CPZ (data not shown). Either forskolin or tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate stimulate the secretion of immunoreactive CPZ from the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells (Fig. 3 A). Quantitation of Western blots from six experiments shows approximately 3-fold stimulation of the secretion of immunoreactive CPZ (Fig.3 B). Duplicate Western blot analysis with an antiserum to CPE showed an increase upon treatment with secretagogue (Fig.3 A), consistent with previous reports (24.Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25.Klein R.S. Das B. Fricker L.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays of the media with dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg at pH 7.4 showed 5–10-fold more activity in medium from the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells than medium from wild type cells (Fig. 3 C). As found using Western blot analysis, treatment with secretagogues increased the levels of enzymatic activity at neutral pH from four different CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cell lines (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the medium from wild type AtT-20 cells had very low levels of carboxypeptidase activity, which did not increase upon secretagogue treatment (Fig. 3 C); these assay conditions are not expected to detect CPE, which is maximally active at pH 5.5 and virtually inactive at neutral pH (26.Greene D. Das B. Fricker L.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Pulse/chase analysis with [35S]Met was used to follow the biosynthesis of CPZ in the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells. Following a 20-min incubation with [35S]Met, a strong band of 72 kDa is detected upon immunoprecipitation with a CPZ-directed antiserum (Fig. 4 A). After a 30-min chase in unlabeled Met, the CPZ appeared as a slightly broader band in the cell extracts, and as a very faint signal in the ECM fraction (Fig.4 A). Following 3 or 6 h of chase, less of the CPZ was associated with the cell fraction and more was detected in the ECM and media fractions. The cellular form after 3 or 6 h of chase existed as 72- and 68-kDa forms, whereas the ECM form was predominantly 72 kDa and the media predominantly 68 kDa (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of the immunoprecipitate with glycosidases reduced the size of the cellular 72-kDa form of CPZ to 66 kDa (Fig. 4 B). After 0 or 0.5 h of chase, the cellular 72-kDa form was largely endoglycosidase H-sensitive, whereas after 3 h of chase a portion of the CPZ was endoglycosidase H-resistant (Fig. 4 B). The forms of CPZ in the ECM and media were also endoglycosidase H-resistant following 3 h of chase. The 68-kDa band seen in cells and media following 3 h of chase is reduced to 64 kDa upon removal of all N-linked sugars by peptidyl-N-glycosidase F. Of the various cell lines previously examined, PC12 cells showed the highest expression of CPZ mRNA (13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Within wild type PC12 cells, CPZ immunoreactivity is diffuse with accumulation near the cell surface in a subset of the cells (Fig. 5). The staining near the cell surface is consistent with the typical staining of secretory granules in the PC12 cell line (27.Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to the punctate staining near the cell surface, staining is also detected at the junctions of some cells (Fig. 5). As with the transfected AtT-20 cells, the endogenous CPZ in PC12 cells is detected in only a subset of cells, representing approximately 20% of the cells. The majority of the PC12 cells show only a diffuse background staining that is similar to the level of staining observed with preimmune antiserum. To test whether CPZ is also present in the ECM fraction of PC12 cells, Western blot analysis was performed. As found for AtT-20 cells expressing CPZ, the endogenous CPZ is detected in the ECM fraction from PC12 cells (Fig. 6). The apparent molecular mass of the ECM CPZ (72 kDa) is similar to the size of the cellular CPZ. In contrast, immunoreactive CPZ in the PC12 medium is 53 kDa (Fig. 6). Since the antiserum used to detect the medium CPZ was raised against the C-terminal region, this media form presumably represents an N-terminally truncated form. Relatively large amounts of the 53-kDa form of CPZ were consistently observed in multiple experiments with PC12 medium. (In comparing Figs. 2 and 6, note the different amounts of each fraction analyzed on the Western blot; see figure legend.) The distribution of CPZ was examined in human tissues. Of the various human tissues previously examined by Northern blot analysis, placenta showed the highest expression of CPZ mRNA (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two placental cell types show CPZ immunoreactivity (Fig. 7). In the maternal basal plate, nearly all of the invasive trophoblasts identified show intense CPZ immunostaining, with a subset of basal plate trophoblasts showing immunostaining in the ECM around the periphery of the cells (Fig. 7 A). In the fetal chorionic plate, the amnionic epithelial cells consistently show CPZ immunoreactivity. Although no definite staining is seen in the amnionic ECM, the CPZ immunostaining in the amnion cells is polarized, with CPZ staining on the apical side of the cells, which is normally adjacent to amnionic fluid (Fig. 7 C). The distribution of CPZ was also examined in a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. Scattered foci of CPZ immunoreactivity were seen throughout the tissue sections (Fig. 7 E). In stained areas, CPZ immunoreactivity is present in the ECM surrounding and coursing between a subpopulation of malignant cells. A similar pattern of immunostaining was observed when parallel sections were reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed against fibronectin, an ECM marker (Fig. 7 G). Co-localization studies, using fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit Ig secondary antibodies and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies, show nearly complete overlap of CPZ and fibronectin immunoreactivity in some areas of human colon cancer tissue sections (data not shown). One major finding of the present study is that, when CPZ is expressed in AtT-20 cells, it is routed to the regulated secretory pathway. Regulated secretion of CPZ suggests that this enzyme either plays a role in the regulated pathway (as with CPE), or else functions after secretion (as with neuropeptides). Of these two possibilities, the latter is more consistent with the non-neuroendocrine distribution of CPZ (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and with the enzyme properties (14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on the neutral pH optimum of CPZ, and its relative inactivity at the acidic pH of the secretory vesicles, it is most likely that CPZ functions outside the cell. Additionally, many cells that express CPZ (leptomeningeal cells, amnion cells, trophoblasts) are not known to contain a regulated secretory pathway and in these cell types CPZ would presumably be secreted via the constitutive pathway. The finding that a subpopulation of the PC12 cells expressed CPZ protein was unexpected. A similar result was found when CPZ was expressed in AtT-20 cells and clonal cell lines isolated. It is unlikely that this is due to a mixed population of cells, since a second round of cloning did not alter the fraction of cells expressing CPZ. It is possible that levels of CPZ are regulated by the cell cycle. Since the cytomegalovirus promoter was used for the stable expression of CPZ in AtT-20 cells, and not the endogenous promoter, it is unlikely that the variation in levels among cells is due to transcriptional control. Instead, regulation at the levels of translation, stability, or cellular binding are more likely to account for the variable levels of CPZ in the different cells. Similar to the results with cultured cells, CPZ immunoreactivity was detected at the junctions between a subpopulation of the cells in a human carcinoma. However, in the placenta the majority of invasive trophoblasts and amnion cells expressed CPZ. Thus, some but not all systems show large variability in levels of CPZ within a homogeneous population of cells. Another major finding of the present study is that CPZ is associated with the ECM. Previously, CPZ was found to bind heparin, as do other components of the ECM. However, heparin alone does not substantially alter the relative ratio of CPZ in the media and ECM of cells, suggesting that binding of CPZ to the ECM involves multiple domains. The observation that the media form of CPZ is approximately 4 kDa smaller than the ECM form in CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells suggests that the ECM binding domain is within this 4-kDa region. Since the 4-kDa difference is not due to N-linked carbohydrates, the likely explanation is proteolysis at the N and/or C termini. A comparison of rat and human CPZ shows a highly conserved C-terminal 35 amino acids (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The degree of amino acid identity over the C-terminal 35 residues (78%) is considerably higher than an adjacent region (36%) or the N-terminal 30 residues following removal of the signal sequence (25%). The degree of sequence identity within the C-terminal region is comparable to the sequence identity within the Cys-rich domain that is predicted to bind Wnts (77%), suggesting a function for the C-terminal region. It is possible that the C-terminal region functions in the binding of CPZ to the ECM. There are 8 basic residues and no acidic residues within the C-terminal 32 residues, and these are conserved in human and rat (6.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A consensus site for furin and related prohormone convertases (RARR-Q, with cleavage predicted to occur between the R and Q) is located 29 residues from the C terminus. Cleavage by furin would shorten the CPZ by 3.6 kDa, consistent with the observed size shift. Although furin is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network, this endopeptidase also cycles to the cell surface and has been shown to function in the cleavage of several proteins in the extracellular environment (28.Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 29.Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, cleavage of CPZ by furin could occur either during transport to the cell surface, or following expression on the cell surface. Alternatively, prohormone convertase 1 could cleave the RARR site within CPZ; this endopeptidase is enriched in the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells (30.Hornby P.J. Rosenthal S.D. Mathis J.P. Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Neuroendocrinology. 1993; 58: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the size of CPZ in the cells and ECM fractions of the PC12 cell line is similar to the size in the corresponding fractions of the CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells, the form of CPZ in the medium of the PC12 cells is much smaller. It is not clear if this form is produced within the cells or after secretion. Based on the size of the form secreted from PC12 cells and on the binding of the antisera directed against the C-terminal region, this form presumably lacks the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. Further studies to identify the cleavage site are difficult due to the low levels of secreted protein. Although CPZ has been previously purified from CPZ-expressing AtT-20 cells (14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the amount of protein was undetectable on polyacrylamide gels and so it is not possible to perform N-terminal sequence analysis. The finding that CPZ is present in the ECM raises a number of possible functions for this enzyme. It is possible that the cysteine-rich domain of CPZ interacts with Wnts, based on homology between CPZ and other Wnt-binding proteins such as the frizzled receptors and the frizzled-related proteins. Since CPZ is not a transmembrane spanning protein, it would more likely function as a frizzled-related protein rather than a receptor. The carboxypeptidase domain of CPZ may also be involved with Wnt proteins; many of these proteins are predicted to contain a C-terminal lysine or arginine based on their nucleotide sequences. It is not known whether the forms of the Wnt proteins that exist in the ECM contain these C-terminal basic residues, or whether removal of this basic group would alter their function. It is also possible that the carboxypeptidase domain of CPZ is important for other pathways. There are a number of endopeptidases that cleave extracellular matrix and which are involved in tissue remodeling during development (31.Werb Z. Chin J.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 857: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32.Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). CPZ may play a role in the cleavage of extracellular matrix following the action of an endopeptidase. This is supported by the localization of CPZ to the invasive trophoblasts in the placenta (Fig. 7). However, the limited distribution and narrow substrate specificity of CPZ (13.Xin X. Day R. Dong W. Lei Y. Fricker L.D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14.Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) would argue against a general degradative role for this enzyme. Further studies are needed to establish the precise function of CPZ within the ECM. Confocal microscopy was performed in the Analytical Imaging Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine."

RIPs site-specifically recognize and depurinate an adenosine at position 4324 in rat 28 S rRNA, rendering the ribosome incapable of interacting with essential elongation factors. Aptamers that target pepocin were isolated from a degenerate RNA pool by in vitro selection. A conserved hairpin motif, quite different from the sequence of the toxin-substrate domain in rat 28 S rRNA, was identified in the aptamer sequences. The aptamers selectively bind to pepocin with dissociation constants between 20 and 30 nm and inhibit theN-glycosidase activity of pepocin on rat liver 28 S rRNA. Competitive binding experiments using aptamer variants suggest that the conserved hairpin region in the anti-pepocin aptamer binds near the catalytic site on pepocin and prevents the interaction of pepocin and 28 S rRNA. Anti-RIP aptamers have potential use in diagnostic systems for the detection of pepocin or could be used as therapy to prevent the action of pepocin in mammalian cells.

Anti-RIP aptamers have potential use in diagnostic systems for the detection of pepocin or could be used as therapy to prevent the action of pepocin in mammalian cells. ribosome-inactivating protein(s) Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs)1 are widely distributed throughout nature (for review, see Ref. 1.Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Stirpe F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 237-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). They inhibit protein synthesis in mammalian cells by disabling the ribosome. Type II RIPs (e.g. ricin) are heterodimeric proteins; an A-chain catalyzes the depurination of a specific adenosine in rRNA, and a disulfide linked B-chain binds cell surface galactosides (for review, see Ref. 2.Wool I.G. Glück A. Endo Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 266-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Binding of the B-chain to the cell surface results in translocation of the A-chain to the cytosol, where it hydrolyzes theN-glycosidic bond of a universally conserved adenosine in the large subunit of rRNA. Cleavage of the adenine residue disrupts the binding of elongation factors, inactivating the ribosome. Type I RIPs, of which pepocin is a member, are considerably more numerous in nature but much less cytotoxic because they lack the B-chain required for cell entry (3.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Ebert R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 224-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The depurination site in the large subunit of rRNA is highly conserved in many eukaryotes and is located in a hairpin loop of 17-mer containing a GAGA tetraloop, in which the second A is removed (4.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies using RNA variants of the toxin-substrate domain have shown that small hairpin fragments containing a GAGA tetraloop are also able to act as substrates for ricin (6.Glück A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction is remarkably specific, and the GAGA sequence is essential for toxin recognition. For instance, the A-chain of ricin does not recognize hairpin variants with all of the possible transitions and transversions of each nucleotide in the GAGA tetraloop sequence (6.Glück A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that RNA fragments corresponding to the toxin-substrate domain of rRNAs form the GAGA tetraloop hairpin (7.Orita M. Nishikawa F. Shimayama T. Taira K. Endo Y. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8.Szewczak A.A. Moore P.B. Chan Y. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kohno T. Senda T. Mitsui Y. Endo Y. Taira K. Nishikawa S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The structure of the GAGA tetraloop is similar to those of stable GAAA and GCAA (GNRA) loops, whereas these are not recognized by the toxins (6.Glück A. Endo Y. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results illustrate the importance of both sequence and structure for recognition in RNA-protein complexes; studies of the contacts between RNA hairpins and RIPs are informative as a model system for scrutinizing RNA-protein interactions. In vitro selection can be used to generate nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) that bind to target proteins and thus can answer questions regarding which components of an RNA molecule are essential for binding to its target protein (11.Baskerville S. Frank D. Ellington A.D. Simons R. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 203-251Google Scholar, 12.Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 13.Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Nagai K. Mattaj I. RNA-Protein Interaction. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 248-268Google Scholar). For instance, crystal structures of RNA aptamers that bind MS2 coat protein shed light on the nature of specific interactions between coat protein and operator (14.Convery M.A. Rowsell S. Stonehouse N.J. Ellington A.D. Hirao I. Murray J.B. Peabody D.S. Phillips S.E.V. Stockley P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,15.Rowsell S. Stonehouse N.J. Convery M.A. Adams C.J. Ellington A.D. Hirao I. Murray J.B. Peabody D.S. Stockley P. Phillips S.E.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite the structural differences between the aptamers and the wild type operator, the aptamers bind in the same location on the coat protein as the wild type RNA and maintain many of the same contacts with the protein compared with the wild type RNA. In a similar example, RNA aptamers that bind elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) were isolated byin vitro selection (16.Hornung V. Hofmann H. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EF-Tu is known to interact with an RIP recognition domain in rRNA. A consensus sequence identified within the aptamers was found in the toxin-substrate domain of Thermus thermophilus 23 S rRNA. To identify novel anti-RIP compounds, we used in vitroselection to produce RNA ligands that bind the toxin, pepocin, which is a type I RIP isolated from the sarcocarp of Cuburbita pepo(17.Yoshinari S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Koresawa S. Tamura M. Endo Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because the single A-chain of pepocin containsN-glycosidic cleavage activity against the large subunit of rRNA but is not highly toxic, it was considered to be a suitable model system for the study of RIP recognition and inhibition. Pepocin and gypsophilin were isolated from the sarcocarp of C. pepo. (17.Yoshinari S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Koresawa S. Tamura M. Endo Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and from Gypsophila elegans (18.Yoshinari S. Koresawa S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Tamura M. Endo Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), respectively. The purity of proteins was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry on a DNA synthesizer (392, Perkin-Elmer). [α-32P]UTP and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). RNase T1 and RNase V1 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, nuclease S1 was from Takara (Tokyo, Japan), and RNase I was from Promega (Madison, WI). In vitro selection was carried out using an RNA pool that contained 30 randomized nucleotide positions (19.Conrad R.C. Brück F.M. Bell S. Ellington A.D. Nucleic Acid-Protein Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, London1995: 285-315Google Scholar). The RNA pool was transcribed from the DNA template using an Ampliscribe T7 in vitro transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). RNA was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and then heated at 75 °C for 3 min and cooled to room temperature. To exclude filter-binding RNA sequences from the pool, the RNA was passed over a 0.45-μm HAWP filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) two or three times before incubation with target. The RNA was mixed with a pepocin preparation (10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol). The final solution contained 3 mm sodium phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, 45 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 mm dithiothreitol, and 12% glycerol. TableI summarizes the conditions used in each round of the selection. The binding was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. After 1 h, the solution was vacuum filtered over a HAWP filter at 5 p.s.i. and washed five times with 0.2 ml of the selection buffer. The RNA on the filter was eluted twice with 0.2 ml of 7 m urea, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.0), and 3 mm EDTA for 5 min at 100 °C, and the eluted RNAs were precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. In the fifth through eighth rounds, an additional filtration step was carried out on the eluted RNA pool to further exclude filter-binding species (20.Hirao, I., Peabody, D. S., and Ellington, A. D. (1999) Mol. Diversity, in pressGoogle Scholar). Collected RNA was reverse transcribed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 4 μm primer, and 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku, St. Petersburg, FL) for 45 min at 42 °C. The reverse transcription was then added to a polymerase chain reaction amplification mix containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 5% acetamide, 0.05% Nonidet-P-40, 0.5 μm primers, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega) and thermally cycled. Amplified DNA was used for the next round of selection.Table IIn vitro selection of RNAs that bind to pepocinRoundPool RNAPepocinTotal volumeFiltration (pre-post)aTimes of pre- and postfiltration.PCRFilter binding assayPepocin bindingFilter bindingμmμmμlcycles%%00.03NDbND, not detected.11.50.63003–01521.20.63003–0100.07ND30.60.62003–01540.60.62003–0716.617.450.60.62003–21415.46.460.60.62002–2770.60.32002–21224.30.280.60.32002–21324.20.09The binding was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h.a Times of pre- and postfiltration.b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The binding was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The polymerase chain reaction products of the eighth round pool were ligated into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cloned into Escherichia coliInvαF′ (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNAs were isolated and sequenced using an AutoRead sequencing kit and a DNA sequencer (ALF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA pools from each round and individual clones from the eighth round were internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) during T7 transcription. The labeled RNA (0.3 μm final concentration) was mixed with pepocin (0.3 μm final concentration) in 0.1 ml of the selection buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The solution was then filtered and washed three times with selection buffer. The filter was exposed to a PhosphorImager plate, and the amount of retained radioactivity was determined using a PhosphorImager (Fuji Photo Film, Kanagawa, Japan). The fraction of bound RNA was calculated by comparing the radioactivity on the filter with the total radioactivity of the input RNA. For the determination of dissociation constants, individual RNA clones were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP after 5′-dephosphorylation of the T7 transcript. The labeled RNA (0.6 nm final concentration) was incubated with increasing concentrations of pepocin (1.2–450 nm) in 0.1 ml of the selection buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was filtered on a vacuum manifold (Schleicher & Schuell) loaded with a piece of pure nitrocelluolse membrane (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad) over a piece of Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) (19.Conrad R.C. Brück F.M. Bell S. Ellington A.D. Nucleic Acid-Protein Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, London1995: 285-315Google Scholar, 21.Weeks K.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7728-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The radioactivity on both filters was quantified, and dissociation constants (K d) were determined by curve fitting with the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software, Reading, PA). The binding activity of each aptamer variant was determined by competition experiments between a 5′-labeled aptamer variant and 5′-labeled clone 8-09. Both RNAs (each at 0.45 μm final concentration) were mixed with pepocin (0.3 μm final concentration) in 100 μl of the selection buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was passed over a HAWP filter and washed three times with 0.2 ml of the selection buffer. The RNAs on the filter were eluted with 0.1 ml of 0.025% of bromphenol blue, 7 m urea, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.0), and 3 mm EDTA for 5 min at 100 °C. The solution was applied directly to a gel containing 7 m urea. The radioactivity in each band on the gel was quantified using a PhosphorImager. Binding ratios were calculated by comparing the counts in the retained and input RNA. For Tm measurements, each aptamer (0.7 A 260 final concentration) was dissolved in 0.25 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Before measurement, the aptamer solution was heated at 75 °C for 3 min and then cooled to room temperature. Melting profiles were obtained at 260 nm using a spectrophotometer (DU650, Beckman) at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min with 1-cm cuvettes.Tm values were calculated from the first derivatives of the melting curves. The end-labeled 9-41 and 9-41U20 (3 pmol) were used for digestion experiments. Alkaline digestion was performed in 50 mm sodium carbonate (pH 9.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 ng of E. coli tRNAs for 10 min at 90 °C. RNase T1 digestion (0.01 unit) was performed in 20 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.0), 7 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 5 ng of E. coli tRNAs for 5 min at 50 °C. RNase V1 digestion (0.05 and 0.1 unit) was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 ng of E. coli tRNAs for 10 min at 37 °C. S1 nuclease digestion (1 unit) was performed in 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 280 mm NaCl, 10 mm ZnSO4, and 5 ng of E. coli tRNAs for 30 min at 37 °C. RNase I digestion (0.3 unit) was performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm sodium acetate, and 5 ng of E. coli tRNAs for 10 min at 37 °C. The digested samples were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea at 50 °C. Pepocin (308 pm final concentration) was incubated with increasing concentrations of anti-pepocin aptamers (0.308–7.7 μm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. Into the premixed solution, rat liver ribosome (180 nm final concentration) was added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The RIP reaction was stopped with 10% SDS (0.5% final concentration) and 1m KCl (0.1 m final concentration). After phenol extraction, rRNA was precipitated and dissolved in 5 μl of water. Subsequently, 25 μl of a solution of acetic acid and aniline was added to the rRNA, and the cleavage reaction was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cleavage reactions were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, and RNAs were detected by staining with ethidium bromide. We carried out selection experiments using an RNA pool that contained a region of 30 randomized nucleotides flanked by constant regions. The relatively short length of the randomized region was chosen because several plant toxins recognize and hydrolyze a specific adenine in small synthetic hairpin fragments (4.Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Endo Y. Glück A. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA pools containing relatively short randomized regions have frequently proven sufficient to identify aptamers that bind tightly to a target protein. For example, the same 21-residue motif was found in anti-tyrosine phosphatase aptamers isolated from two pools that contained random regions that were either 30 or 71 nucleotides in length (23.Bell S.D. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Ellington A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14309-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Selection experiments were initiated with an RNA pool containing 2 × 1013 different sequences. Table I shows the conditions used throughout the selection. After eight rounds of selection, the fraction of the pool which bound pepocin had increased from 0.03 to 24%. Although some filter-binding species accumulated during the middle rounds of the selection, postfiltration of selected RNAs successfully removed the filter-binding species. Twenty-six clones were isolated from the eighth round of selection (Fig. 1). Twenty-three of these aptamers had a similar sequence and bound specifically to pepocin. Aptamers that were closer to a consensus sequence tended to exhibit higher binding activity, and the proportion of a variant in the selected population correlated well with its affinity for pepocin (Figs.2 and 3). The other three RNAs, 8-24, 8-25, and 8-26, do not exhibit specific binding to pepocin; 8-24 has no affinity for the protein, and 8-25 and 8-26 bind to the filter rather than the protein.Figure 2Conserved hairpin structure between two classes of anti-pepocin aptamers.

The binding ratios are indicated inparentheses and were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence variations observed among the 23 similar clones are consistent with the formation of a stem-loop structure. For example, although 7 ligands have a CAG/CUG sequence in stem 2, 12 ligands change this stem sequence to GGA/UUC, 2 ligands to AGG/CUU, and one ligand to AAG/CUU. Therefore, most ligands have an NUAU loop and two bulged cytidines, one between stems 1L and 2L, and one between stems 2L and 3L (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the sequence of the anti-pepocin aptamer hairpin motif is quite different from the toxin-substrate domain GAGA in rRNAs. Based on sequence differences in stem 1L, the anti-pepocin aptamers can be classified into two groups, class 1 and class 2. Class 1 ligands have a UAG or a UCG sequence and a mismatched base pair in stem 1L. In contrast, class 2 ligands have a UUG sequence in this region and form an uninterrupted stem 1 structure. Thus, class 1 aptamers may form a similar but slightly different hairpin structure than class 2 aptamers. Fig. 2 summarizes the structural variations in each class and the results of binding assays with pepocin. It was observed that a G-U base pair in stem 2 of both class 1 and class 2 aptamers produced better binding than canonical base pairs. The fact that class 1 and class 2 aptamers, and individual aptamers within class 1 and class 2, were likely derived from different initial molecules further emphasizes the importance of the non-canonical loop structure for pepocin binding. To determine the minimal sequence necessary for anti-pepocin aptamer binding, we prepared various mutant fragments of the class 1 aptamer 8-09, which bound the best in our initial assays. To quantify the binding abilities of each fragment better, competition experiments were carried out. Selected small RNA fragments were competed with 8-18, an aptamer that bound specifically but poorly to pepocin. A 45-mer fragment of aptamer 8-09 (termed 9-45), which contained the AUAU loop, stems 1–4, and the two bulged cytidines competed roughly twice as well with 8-18 for binding to pepocin (Fig. 3 a). The binding activity of aptamer 9-45 was improved slightly by introducing substitutions (UAA to AAG) that closed the apparent internal loop of aptamer 8-09, generating aptamer 9-45b. The fully paired stem was observed in many other class 1 aptamers such as 8-08 and 8-01. A 41-mer fragment, 9-41, had binding activity similar to that of 9-45b, but binding activity decreased after additional truncation (9-37 (37-mer) and 9-33 (33-mer)) (Fig.3 b). These results are consistent with the predicted secondary structure, which shows 10 base pairs between stems 3 and 4. Most of the aptamers isolated from the eighth round pool were also predicted to contain approximately 10 base pairs in stems 3 and 4. It should be noted that all of the aptamers bound much better to pepocin than the isolated toxin-substrate domain of rRNA; for example, aptamer 9-45b binds roughly 100-fold better than the isolated toxin-substrate domain. There is some sequence degeneracy at specific positions in the loop and stem regions of the aptamers. Four different bases appeared at the first position of the loop, although the UAU motif was highly conserved at the remaining three positions in the loop. We examined the binding abilities of these variants by introducing substitutions into the minimal aptamer 9-41. The binding activities of these variants are shown in Fig. 4. As has been observed in other selection experiments (11.Baskerville S. Frank D. Ellington A.D. Simons R. Grunberg-Manago M. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 203-251Google Scholar), sequence variations between the aptamers provided valuable information about the function. The order of the binding activity of the class 1 loop sequence variants was UUAU > CUAU > AUAU > GUAU. Similarly, 6ix of 13 class 1 NUAU loops are UUAU, 3 are CUAU, 4 are AUAU, and no GUAU loops appear. The tightest binding aptamer was the class 1 aptamer (9-41U22) containing a UUAU sequence in the loop. The K d of 9-41U22 was 17.9 ± 2.2 nm, which was similar to that of the full-length aptamers 8-09 (21.0 ± 2.0 nm) and 8-14 (23.4 ± 2.3 nm) (Fig.5 a).Figure 5Binding curves for anti-pepocin aptamers with pepocin or gypsophilin.

The second base pair in stem 1L was predicted to be A-A or C-A in class 1 aptamers but U-A in class 2 aptamers. The substitution of the class 1 C-A base pair to a class 2 U-A (9-41U20) decreased binding activity slightly. Interestingly, the class 1 aptamer, 9-41 (Tm = 82.5 °C) was found to be more thermally stable than the class 2 aptamer, 9-41U20 (Tm = 80.0 °C). Finally, both bulged cytidines located in the stem region appear to be important for binding. Substitution of the bulged C to either U or A reduced the binding activity significantly. Overall, it appeared that the sequences in and around stems 1 and 2 contributed to interactions with pepocin. Although all sequence and binding data were consistent with the predicted secondary structures, we enzymatically probed the structures of both class 1 (9-41) and class 2 (9-41U20) aptamers. Labeled 9-41 and 9-41U20 were treated with RNase V1, S1 nuclease, and RNase I (Fig.6). RNase V1 digests double-stranded regions in the RNA specifically. S1 nuclease and small amounts of RNase I preferentially digest single-stranded regions in RNAs. Both 9-41 and 9-41U20 gave similar digestion patterns, with the exception of RNase V1 digestion in the stem 1 region (positions 18–20 and 26–28 in Fig. 6) and RNase I digestion throughout stem 1 and the loop regions (position 17–27). The digestion pattern of 9-41U20 was consistent with the predicted tetra loop (the NUAU loop) hairpin structure. However, 9-41 may have a structure different from that of 9-41U20 at positions 18–28, including the loop and stems 1 and 2. RNase V1 digestion of 9-41 did not give strong bands at position 18–20 in the stem 1L region compared with 9-41U20. In contrast, RNase I extensively digested 9-41 throughout the loop and the stem 1 regions, although S1 nuclease treatment gave similar digestion patterns for 9-41 and 9-41U20. Under the conditions that we used, the RNase I activity was expected to be slightly stronger than nuclease S1 activity. Therefore, although enzymatic probing confirms that class 1 and class 2 aptamers form secondary structures similar to those predicted, the class 1 aptamers seem to have more flexible stem 1 and loop regions. To determine whether the anti-pepocin aptamers could inhibit ribosome inactivation by pepocin, we examined the depurination of the specific adenosine in rat liver 28 S rRNA. Rat liver ribosomes and pepocin were incubated together in the presence of increasing concentrations of aptamers. The 28 S rRNA was extracted from the ribosome and treated with aniline to cleave the rRNA at the depurination site. The aniline-treated rRNA was analyzed on a denaturing gel (Fig. 7), and the expected cleavage product of 28 S rRNA was observed (Fig. 7, lane 2). The addition of a class 1 aptamer, 8-09, in 10,000-fold excess over pepocin inhibited the depurination of 28 S rRNA (Fig. 7 a,lane 9). The inhibitory effect of a class 2 aptamer, 8-14, was weaker than that of class 1 and was observed at around a 25,000-fold excess (Fig. 7 a, lane 6). Although the small fragments 9-41U22 and 9-41U20U22 bound tightly to pepocin, they showed no inhibitory effect when present in ten-thousand fold excess (Fig. 7 b). The simplest explanation of anti-pepocin aptamer inhibition of rRNA depurination is that the aptamer competes with rRNA for binding to pepocin. However, to account for the large excess of aptamer needed for inhibition, we considered the possibility that the aptamer might also be a substrate for pepocin. To determine if pepocin depurinated one or more positions in the aptamers, resulting in a loss of activity, the aptamers were incubated with pepocin for 1 day at 37 °C followed by treatment with aniline. No depurination or cleavage products were observed (data not shown). Because the sequence of the toxin-substrate domain in 28 S rRNA is highly conserved in many eukaryotes, if the anti-pepocin aptamers mimicked the rRNA domain then it seemed possible that the anti-pepocin aptamers might bind and inhibit other RIPs. We examined the ability of these aptamers to bind to and inhibit another RIP, gypsophilin, isolated from G. elegans (18.Yoshinari S. Koresawa S. Yokota S. Sawamoto H. Tamura M. Endo Y. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Aptamers 8-09, 8-14, and 9-41U20 did not bind to gypsophilin (Fig. 5 b), and gypsophilin activity was not inhibited by the addition of the aptamers in up to a 25,000-fold excess over protein (data not shown). Thus, anti-pepocin aptamers are remarkably selective for pepocin. Thus, although the anti-pepocin aptamers compete with rRNA for binding to pepocin, they do not appear to do so by mimicking universal features of rRNAs. In concert with our other results, two additional features of the mechanism of binding and inhibition are suggested. First, the fact that the class 1 aptamers form a semistable stem-loop structure that nonetheless binds tightly and specifically to pepocin suggests that the conformation of the aptamers may change on binding pepocin. This hypothesis is also consistent with the observed specificity of the aptamers for pepocin. Second, it is possible that the anti-pepocin aptamers bind adjacent to but do not necessarily fill the pepocin active site. This assumption is supported by the fact that the full-length class 1 aptamer, 8-09, inhibits pepocin activity, whereas the small fragment, 9-41U22, of the class 1 aptamer is not effective even though its K dis smaller than that of 8-09. Partial occlusion of a protein active site by an aptamer has been observed previously for protein tyrosine phosphatases (23.Bell S.D. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Ellington A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14309-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Along these lines, it is also possible that two RNA recognition sites exist in pepocin; one site could bind efficiently to a portion of a RNA substrate, and the other is the catalytic site that hydrolyzes the adenine residue in rRNA. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that small synthetic RNA hairpins bind poorly and are not hydrolyzed by pepocin. This model would be similar to the two-site recognition known to occur with other ribosome-associating proteins such as elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu (24.Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 344: 362-364Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). EF-Tu and EF-G interact with both the thiostrepton binding site in the 1067 region and the toxin recognition site in the 2660 region of 23 S rRNA. From this vantage, the selected aptamers might block the hypothesized substrate binding site but not necessarily the catalytic site. The identification of anti-RIP aptamers may suggest new approaches to the development of therapeutics or diagnostics for toxic agents. To the extent that the anti-pepocin aptamer has been shown to inhibit RIP activity, it provides proof of principle for the development of prophylactic or therapeutic aptamers to other cytotoxins, such as the Vero toxin produced by E. coli O157 (25.Karmali M.A. Petric M.

Such aptamers could be introduced as expression constructs into exposed or at-risk individuals to minimize toxin pathology. Moreover, anti-toxin diagnostics using aptamers might be powerful tools for detecting trace amounts of toxins. For example, anti-pepocin aptamers might be used in biosensors that would detect the presence of pepocin in foods made from pumpkin."

Dynactin is characterized by a 37-nm-long actin-like filament that forms the base of the complex and a 24-nm lateral projection from this filament. The filament is formed from the limited polymerization of 8–13 mol of Arp1 (actin-related protein1), an actin-related protein, whereas the lateral projection is formed from a probable dimer of p150Glued(11.Schafer D.A.

One end of the short Arp1 filament is thought to be capped by the α and β subunits of capping protein (CapZ), which are found in a 1:1 stoichiometry in dynactin (11.Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Capping protein has been shown to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments and by analogy is thought to cap the barbed end of the Arp1 filament. Pointed end capping of actin is less well understood, and within the dynactin complex no analog of a pointed end capper has been identified. However, immuno-electron microscopic studies (11.Schafer D.A. Gill S.R. Cooper J.A. Heuser J.E. Schroer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) suggested that a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa, present in dynactin at a stoichiometry of one subunit/complex, localizes to the end of the Arp1 filament opposite to that bound to CapZ. To address the role of p62 within the dynactin complex, we isolated this polypeptide using a dynein affinity column. Microsequencing of two tryptic peptides allowed us to isolate human cDNA clones encoding p62. The predicted product of these clones is a protein of 53 kDa that co-migrates through SDS-PAGE1with the endogenous p62 polypeptide. Data base comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed that human p62 has significant homology to the predicted product of the ropy-2 gene ofNeurospora crassa. Of particular interest is a highly conserved N-terminal cysteine-rich domain. We have characterized p62 as a bona fide subunit of dynactin by affinity chromatography, immunochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. We have used affinity chromatography to demonstrate that p62 binds directly to Arp1, suggesting that p62 may indeed serve as a pointed end capper for the Arp1 minifilament of dynactin and that this interaction may be mediated by the highly conserved RING domain of p62. Dynactin was purified essentially as described in Karki and Holzbaur (2.Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) by constructing an affinity column of bacterially expressed dynein intermediate chain. A 150,000 ×g cytosol prepared from 10 frozen rat brains (Pel-Freez) in PHEM buffer (50 mm Na-PIPES, 50 mm Na-HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) was loaded onto the column and washed with 50 column volumes of PHEM and 5 column volumes of PHEM containing 50 mm NaCl. Dynactin was eluted from the column with 1 m NaCl in PHEM, dialyzed, and then concentrated using polyethylene glycol 20,000 (Fisher). The concentrated eluate was fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient, and the peak fraction corresponding to 20 S was methanol precipitated. Purified dynactin was resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P, and the polypeptide band corresponding to p62 was excised and subjected toin situ proteolysis and microsequencing. Two nonoverlapping peptide sequences were obtained: LIEYYQQLAQK and LVAVNYIPEV. These two peptide sequences were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) data bases in a BLAST search (15.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68293) Google Scholar) to identify overlapping human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (16.Adams M.D. Bento Soares M. Kerlavage A.R. Fields C. Ventor J.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). One of these ESTs (AA223368 from NT2 neuronal precursor cells) was obtained, and the sequence was further extended by PCR using a retinoic acid-induced human NT2 cell cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequence derived from PCR clones was verified through comparison of at least six independent clones. The longest clones obtained by PCR or by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends appear to have short 5′-untranslated regions that lack stop codons upstream of the putative initiator codon. Extensive screening of the EST data base revealed no mammalian clones extending further 5′ to our longest clone, suggesting difficult secondary structure in this region. High temperature reverse transcription-PCR or genomic library screening did not extend the cDNA sequence. All DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase T7 DNA Polymerase, version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A 32P-labeled p62-specific probe was made from the putative full-length coding region of the cDNA clone with the Prime-It II Random Primer Kit (Stratagene). It was used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and manufacturer's protocols. cDNA clones corresponding to amino acids residues 1–149 (N-terminal fragment) and 151–460 (C-terminal fragment) were subcloned into pET15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), expressed in BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli, and purified on a Ni2+affinity column. The purified proteins were used as immunogens to inoculate rabbits, and p62-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified from serum on antigen columns. Immunoprecipitation of rat brain cytosol in PHEM buffer was carried out using a monoclonal antibody to dynamitin (p50; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) according to the protocol previously described (17.Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cytosol was preadsorbed with protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C to eliminate any nonspecific adsorption. The preadsorbed cytosol was then incubated with antibody-bound beads for 3 h at 4 °C. As a control for nonspecific precipitation, beads without antibody were incubated with equal amounts of cytosol in parallel. Both antibody-loaded and control beads were washed extensively with 1× RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate), and then were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). The eluted samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies to p62, Arp1, and p150Glued. Two affinity columns of purified recombinant dynein intermediate chain, each with a bed volume of 0.5 ml, were constructed as described previously (19.Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5887-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One column was preblocked with excess recombinant p150Glued, the other with equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The columns were washed with 5 ml of PHEM, and rat brain cytosol was loaded. The columns were washed extensively with 25 ml of PHEM buffer followed by 2 ml of HEM buffer (PHEM without PIPES) and then eluted in 1 ml of 1m NaCl in HEM. The eluates were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and dissolved in 50 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Immobilon-P, and probed with antibodies to p150Glued, Arp1, and p62. For Arp1-p62 binding analysis, an affinity column was made from recombinant p62 in the same manner as dynein intermediate chain columns above but with a bed volume of 0.2 ml. As a control, a BSA column was also prepared. Human Arp1, previously subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), was translatedin vitro using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The translated product was diluted in HEM buffer, and equal amounts were loaded onto both the p62 and BSA columns. The columns were washed and eluted as described above, and the resulting precipitates were dissolved in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Mammalian cells (PtK2 or COS-7) were maintained in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mmGlutamax, (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and were split regularly immediately after reaching confluency using trypsin-EDTA. For overexpression studies, cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.40Google Scholar) with the p62 construct in pcDNA3, and 24-h transfection was followed by 24-h washout before fixation. Cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol with 1 mm EGTA for 10 min. The coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The fixed cells were assayed by immunofluorescence with primary antibodies as noted with incubation at 4 °C overnight. Fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse and Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-mouse or anti-rat secondary antibodies were used for detection. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), viewed with an epifluorescence microscope (model DMRB; Leica, Deerfield, IL) fitted with a 100× objective (1.4 NA) and appropriate dichromatic filters, and photographed using a Wild Leitz Photoautomat system. For size analysis of recombinant p62 encoded by the cloned cDNA, PtK2 cells were transfected in a 100-mm dish with p62 construct fused to a FLAG tag, washed after 24 h, and grown in fresh medium for additional 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples from in vitrotranslated recombinant p62, human brain, and rat brain microtubule extract were also prepared. Each of these samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, probed with anti-p62 polyclonal antibody (UP1188). Dynactin was purified using a dynein affinity column and SDS-PAGE, and a band corresponding to a molecular mass of 62 kDa was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion and microsequencing. Two tryptic peptides from the p62 polypeptide were obtained and used to identify EST clones in a BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base. An EST clone encoding the partial sequence of p62 was obtained, and the remainder of the coding sequence was determined from clones obtained from an NT2-N library using PCR with a p62-specific primer (Fig.1 a). The open reading frame predicted by these human cDNAs encodes a protein of 460 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 52.3 kDa (Fig. 1 a). Because this is somewhat smaller than the apparent size of the native polypeptide, we overexpressed this protein by transient transfection of PtK2 cells and examined the migration of this protein through SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.2 , the product of the human cDNAs (lanes 1 and 3) we have isolated migrates more slowly than expected based on predicted size, co-migrating with endogenous p62 from human (lane 2) and rat brain (lane 5) and untransfected PtK2 cells (lane 4). To examine the possibility that post-translational modification of the p62 polypeptide is responsible for the difference between the predicted and apparent size, we also expressed the p62 cDNA in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system. However, the protein expressed in vitro (lanes 1 in panels a and b of Fig. 2), as well as protein expressed in E. coli (data not shown), both co-migrate with endogenous p62 from human brain, suggesting that the clones we have isolated encompass the open reading frame of this gene and that post-translational modifications are not likely to account for the difference between the predicted size and actual size of this polypeptide. Further, treatment of purified dynactin with a broad spectrum phosphatase did not result in any shift in the mobility of the p62 polypeptide (data not shown). Data base searches using the predicted amino acid sequence for human p62 revealed significant sequence identity to the product of theropy-2 gene. This gene from N. crassa is required for proper nuclear migration and hyphal elongation and was suggested to encode a dynein or dynactin subunit (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Other N. crassagenes encoding subunits of either cytoplasmic dynein or dynactin have also been shown to produce similar phenotypes when disrupted (reviewed in Ref. 10.Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A schematic of the predicted human and N. crassa polypeptide sequences are shown in Fig. 1 b. TheN. crassa gene product is significantly larger, with a predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa. Although the N-terminal residues of these proteins show some homology (black bars in Fig.1 b), the N. crassa polypeptide has an insertion of about 200 residues within this homologous domain. This insert accounts for the larger size of the fungal homolog. Data base searches also identified ESTs with predicted coding sequences for p62 homologs from mouse and Drosophila, as well as a predicted protein sequence for a Caenorhabditis eleganshomolog generated through the genome project (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The predicted sequences for human, mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, andN. crassa are aligned in Fig. 1 c for the regions of highest homology. This alignment reveals a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal domain of human p62 (amino acids 30–114). This domain is characterized by the highly conserved spacing of 11 cysteine residues. The last eight of these cysteine residues fit well to a consensus RING domain that is predicted to bind two zinc atoms in a characteristic cross brace structure (22.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). RING domains have been identified in a number of diverse proteins, many of which are members of multi-subunit complexes where the RING motif is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions. We speculate that this domain in p62 may be involved in interaction with other subunits of dynactin such as the binding to Arp1 described below. In contrast, the first three cysteine residues in this highly conserved motif do not fit into either a LIM or an additional RING motif and are unlikely to bind Zn2+ in the absence of a fourth ligand. Although there is an additional cysteine residue in this region in the sequences fromN. crassa and C. elegans, this residue is not conserved in the sequences from human or mouse. A multiple tissue Northern blot was probed with a cDNA encoding p62 to determine the tissue distribution of p62-encoding mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3, we observed a single band of ∼4.2 kilobases in length. Although immunoblots of brain extract from human and rat brain suggest that two similarly sized isoforms may be expressed in these tissues (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and5), the Northern blot did not resolve any alternatively spliced products of the p62 gene. Comparisons of p62 expression in various human tissues suggests that mRNAs encoding p62 are apparently ubiquitously transcribed but that transcription levels are highest in heart and skeletal muscle. Somewhat lower levels of mRNA were detected in brain, although dynactin is thought to be enriched in neurons (17.Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and on immunoblots we see relatively high levels of p62 expression in this tissue (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Although a previous comparison of the similarity of the ropy-2 phenotype to those resulting from mutations in dynein or dynactin subunits led to the suggestion that ro-2 encoded a subunit of either protein complex (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the absence of genetic interactions or biochemical data precluded a more definitive identification. Therefore, to characterize the 62-kDa vertebrate polypeptide as a dynactin subunit, we performed several biochemical and immunocytochemical assays. To test whether p62 exists exclusively as a 20 S component, like most dynactin subunits, or is also free in the cytosol, such as CapZ, a high speed cytosol was prepared from a rat brain homogenized in PHEM buffer. The cytosol was fractionated by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using antibodies to p62 and Arp1. As shown in Fig.4 a, p62 is found exclusively in a single peak corresponding to 20 S, co-migrating with Arp1. We also performed an immunoprecipitation experiment using a monoclonal anti-dynamitin (p50) antibody (Transduction Laboratories) to precipitate dynactin from rat brain cytosol. A panel of dynactin subunit antibodies (p150Glued, p50, and p22) was used in addition to anti-p62 antibodies to probe the immunoprecipitated proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 b, p62 was co-precipitated by the anti-dynamitin antibody, along with other dynactin subunits. We have previously demonstrated that dynactin is retained on an affinity column of dynein intermediate chain and that this binding can be specifically blocked with excess recombinant p150Glued(19.Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5887-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two identical dynein intermediate chain affinity columns were constructed and preblocked either with BSA or with a fragment of recombinant p150Glued expressed and purified from E. coli. As shown in Fig. 4 c, p62 bound to the dynein affinity column in the absence of excess p150Glued (BSA block), but this binding was significantly inhibited by excess p150Glued in parallel with the behavior of the dynactin subunit Arp1. Using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p62 (UP1188), we examined the distribution of this polypeptide in cultured PtK2 cells. Fig. 5 shows that p62 has a punctate perinuclear distribution along with a prominent localization to the centrosomes in interphase cells and is localized to the spindle poles and midbody of dividing cells. This distribution is indistinguishable from that previously demonstrated for other dynactin subunits such as p150Glued and p22 (reviewed in Ref. 10.Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Together, these biochemical and immunocytochemical results demonstrate that p62 is a bona fide subunit of dynactin complex. Using recombinant p62, we tested for a direct interaction between p62 and Arp1 using affinity chromatography. An affinity column of recombinant human p62 covalently bound to a Sepharose matrix was constructed and loaded with in vitro translated full-length human Arp1. A control BSA column was also loaded with in vitro translated Arp1. The columns were extensively washed and eluted with 1 m NaCl. Analysis of the resulting fractions, shown in Fig. 6, indicates that the p62 affinity column retained significantly more Arp1 (compare the flow-through fractions from the p62 and BSA affinity columns); the retained Arp1 was subsequently eluted from the p62 column with high salt buffer. This result is consistent with the previous immuno-electron microscopic data and establishes that p62 binds directly to the Arp1 subunit of dynactin. Direct interaction with p62 may either stabilize or cap the Arp1 filament, thereby contributing to the overall stability of dynactin in the cell. Overexpression of the dynactin subunit dynamitin (p50) has been shown to cause mitotic arrest, irregular spindle morphology, and disrupted morphology of the Golgi (6.Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 14.Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the Arp1 subunit has also been shown to disrupt the Golgi (23.Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of other dynactin subunits such as p22 was observed to have no clear effects on either microtubule organization or Golgi morphology (24.Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of p62 overexpression, a human cDNA encoding p62 was expressed in PtK2 and COS7 cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The most striking feature observed in transfected cells overexpressing p62 was the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localization of the protein (Fig. 7, a and b). This nuclear localization phenotype was observed both in COS7 and PtK2 cell lines. Whether the nuclear localization of overexpressed p62 is an artifact because of very high levels of protein expression induced by transfection or whether it instead has some physiological significance remains to be determined. When the cytoskeleton of transfected cells were compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 7 a), we observed no clear effect on either the focusing or the radial distribution of the microtubules, similar to our observations on the overexpression of the p22 subunit of dynactin (24.Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). No noticeable effects on the actin cytoskeleton because of p62 overexpression were observed (data not shown). When we compared the Golgi morphology of transfected and control cells, we failed to see any significant difference, implying that neither the microtubule organization nor the Golgi morphology was affected as a result of p62 overexpression, in contrast to observations made following the overexpression of either the Arp1 (23.Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or dynamitin (6.Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) subunits of dynactin. The functional interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin is critical to disparate cell processes such as vesicle transport into the Golgi, mitotic spindle assembly and orientation, and both fast and slow axonal transport. Although cytoplasmic dynein clearly provides motor function for these processes, the role of dynactin has been less clear. The identification of an independent microtubule-binding site on dynactin suggested that this complex might contribute to the processivity of the motor complex (13.Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Dynactin has also been proposed to be required to link the motor to its cargo, either to vesicles via an Arp1-spectrin interaction (23.Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or to kinetochores via an interaction between dynamitin and ZW10 (25.Starr D.A. Williams B.C. Hays T.S. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To further investigate the cellular role of dynactin, we cloned and characterized human cDNAs encoding the p62 subunit of dynactin. The 53-kDa predicted protein we identified showed substantial similarity to the predicted 80-kDa product of the ropy-2 gene fromN. crassa (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the ro-2 mutant, disrupted nuclear distribution along the fungal hyphae, led Vierula and Mais (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to propose that this gene encoded a subunit of either dynein or dynactin. The strong sequence conservation we have detected between the human and fungal genes, and the biochemical data presented here clearly identify the human and fungal polypeptides as subunits of dynactin. These biochemical data, including immunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient fractionation, affinity chromatography, and immunocytochemistry, also indicate that in vertebrate cells p62 is apparently found exclusively as a subunit of the 20 S dynactin complex. This observation is in contrast to the behavior of the capping protein CapZ, which is found both in dynactin and in association with the cellular actin cytoskeleton. The known ability of capping protein to cap the barbed end of actin filaments and its localization within dynactin to a single end of the Arp1 minifilament have suggested that this dimer also caps the analogous barbed end of Arp1. p62 has been localized to the opposite end of the Arp1 filament and therefore has been proposed to bind to and potentially to cap the analogous pointed end of the Arp1 filament. Here we report data describing the direct binding of p62 and Arp1, supporting this model. The question still remains of how the polymerization of Arp1 is regulated to produce short filaments of defined length. Further studies investigating the in vitroassembly of filaments of Arp1, p62, and the α and β subunits of capping protein may shed light on this issue. However, the difficulty in expressing active recombinant Arp1 and the very low abundance of native Arp1 compared with actin significantly hinders this type of analysis. The most striking feature of the p62 polypeptide is a very highly conserved pattern of cysteine residues. Comparisons of the sequences of p62 from human, mouse, Drosophila, C. elegans, and N. crassa indicate a pattern of 11 highly conserved cysteine residues. The last eight of these closely fit to the consensus RING motif, indicating that p62 is likely to include this core cross-brace structural element (22.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), in which two zinc atoms are ligated tetrahedrally by four cysteine residues. The strong conservation of the first three cysteine residues is more puzzling, because these residues are not sufficient to bind to another zinc atom. One possibility is that the serine located at position 38 in the human and murine sequences may serve as a fourth ligand; in the Drosophila, C. elegans, and N. crassa sequences there is a conserved cysteine residue at this position. Although histidine is the more common replacement for cysteine in Zn2+ binding motifs, mutagenesis studies performed in another RING protein have demonstrated that a replacement of serine for cysteine does not abrogate function under some conditions (26.Burd C.G. Petersen M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mammalian forms may employ either of the conserved His residues found at positions 44 or 49 to complex a third zinc atom. In either model, the possible Zn2+ binding motif formed in human p62 from three cysteine residues and either a serine or a histidine residue is not predicted to conform to a consensus LIM/RING motif but could still form a zinc binding finger, meaning that overall p62 would be predicted to bind up to three zinc atoms. It is not unusual to find additional zinc finger-like domains adjacent to RING motifs (22.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The RING finger proteins that have been characterized to date differ widely in function, although they can be grouped in general categories of function such as oncogenesis (e.g. BRCA1) and signal transduction (TRAF2) (22.Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The putative cellular roles of p62 and dynactin do not fit easily into these categories. The RING domain is thought to participate in or to facilitate protein-protein interactions, and therefore this motif may allow an effective interaction between p62 and Arp1. More interestingly, perhaps, is the observation that FYVE finger proteins have been shown to bind directly to membrane-associated phospholipids (27.Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although there clearly exists a soluble pool of dynactin in the cell, at least half of the complex is associated with cellular membranes (17.Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and dynactin is clearly involved in dynein-mediated vesicle motility. It would be of particular interest if the zinc-mediated structure of p62 allowed this polypeptide to interact both with Arp1, as shown above, and directly with membranes. Although a direct association of p62 with phospholipids on the surface of vesicles may not in itself be sufficient to link both dynein and dynactin to its vesicular cargo, this type of interaction might contribute to the association. We are currently investigating this hypothesis. One surprising observation we have made is the nuclear distribution of p62 in transfected cells, in contrast to the cytosolic and centrosomal distribution of p62 observed in control cells. None of the previous transfections with other dynactin subunits have given such a phenotype. Although we did not detect any obvious nuclear localization signal in the predicted primary sequence of p62, we speculate that because its homolog, ro-2, has a nuclear distribution function (possibly associating with the nuclei during dynein/dynactin-based transport), overexpression of human p62 may exaggerate its association with the nuclei. Further, with the cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif it is not unlikely that p62 may associate with DNA at nonphysiological expression levels. Finally we note that unlike p50 or Arp1 overexpression, which yielded a clear phenotype of disrupted Golgi morphology, we do not observe any clear changes in the structure of the Golgi, nor in the underlying organization of cellular microtubules. These differences in effects of overexpression are more likely to reflect the results of biochemical differences in the polypeptides rather than significant distinctions in dynactin function within the cell. In summary, the molecular characterization of p62 from a range of species from human to Drosophila as reported here and previously in fungi by Vierula and Mais (21.Vierula P.J. Mais J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have provided insight into the biochemical properties of this polypeptide and its role within the dynactin complex. Specifically, we have demonstrated the direct binding of p62 to Arp1, supporting the hypothesis that this polypeptide may cap the pointed end of the Arp1 filament. The nature of the RING domain structure that is at the core of the human p62 polypeptide also suggests that this dynactin subunit may have further binding interactions, such as a direct interaction with membrane phospholipids, which will be the focus of further investigations. We thank Christopher Burd for insightful discussion on the cysteine-rich LIM/RING motifs, Dr. J. Leszyk of the Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research for p62 microsequencing, and the members of the lab for helpful discussion of the manuscript."

In this series of experiments, we use a cell surface biotinylation protocol to directly quantitate apoE on the macrophage cell surface and evaluate its transport to and from this cell surface pool. In human monocyte-derived macrophages labeled to equilibrium and in a mouse macrophage cell line transfected to constitutively express human apoE3, approximately 8% of total cellular apoE was present on the surface, but only a portion of this surface pool served as a direct precursor to secreted apoE. The half-life of apoE on the macrophage cell surface was calculated to be approximately 12 min. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the apoE isolated from the surface fraction of cells labeled to equilibrium migrated in an isoform pattern distinct from that observed from the intracellular fraction, with the surface fraction migrating predominantly in a higher molecular weight isoform. Pulse labeling experiments demonstrated that newly synthesized apoE reached the cell surface by 10 min but was predominantly in a low molecular weight isoform. There was also a lag between appearance of apoE on the cell surface and its appearance in the medium. Biotinylated apoE, which accumulated in the medium, even from pulse labeled cells, was predominantly in the high molecular weight isoform. Additional experiments demonstrated that low molecular weight apoE present on the cell surface was modified to higher molecular weight apoE by the addition of sialic acid residues prior to secretion and that this conversion was inhibited by brefeldin A.

Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The production of apoE by macrophages appears to be regulated at transcriptional and post-translational loci (6.Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J.

In addition to its well established fate as a secretory product of macrophages, it has also been noted that a substantial portion of newly synthesized apoE is degraded prior to secretion by macrophages (8.Mazzone T.

In addition, we have previously reported that macrophages retain a fraction of apoE on their cell surface (10.Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13454-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Such plasma membrane-associated surface pools of apoE have also been reported in other cells types, including hepatocytes and steroidogenic cells (11.Lilly-Stauderman M. Brown T.L. Balasubramaniam A.

In macrophages, it appears that cell surface proteoglycans, as well as the LDL1 receptor, are involved in maintenance in the cell surface fraction of apoE (10.Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1029-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential fates for cell surface apoE in the macrophage can be considered. The first would be that this pool serves as the immediate precursor for secreted apoE. Alternatively, the cell surface pool could be static and sequestered separate from the secretory pathway. Additionally, cell surface apoE could be reinternalized prior to its release from the cell layer. Once internalized, this apoE could be degraded (thereby contributing to the large fraction of newly synthesized apoE, which is degraded) or could be recycled to the cell membrane surface pool or to the secretory pathway. In this series of studies, we investigated aspects of the distribution, transport, and metabolism of endogenously synthesized apoE on the macrophage plasma membrane surface.

These cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml geneticin. One week prior to initiation of experiments, this selection medium was replaced by DMEM containing only 10% fetal bovine serum. Freshly isolated human monocytes used in this study were purified by elutriation (15.Duan H. Li Z. Mazzone T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Greater than 95% of the elutriated cells used for experiments were monocytes, as determined by differential counts of Wright-stained smears. Human monocytes were cultured and allowed to differentiate into macrophages in medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 10% pooled human serum. J774-E cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 million cells/well and incubated at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h, when cells reached 95% confluence. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine. For equilibrium labeling, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with methionine-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and 10 μm cold methionine. For short term labeling, the cells were first preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with methionine-free medium and then incubated in the same medium containing varying amounts of [35S]methionine and cold methionine for the times indicated in each experiment. Human monocytes were seeded at a density of 6 million/well and cultured at 37 °C for 5 days in DMEM containing 10% pooled human serum and 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for a short term or to equilibrium, as described above. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using the water soluble biotinylation reagent, ss-biotin, following a previously published procedure (16.Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.-P. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were rapidly cooled on ice for 5 min and then washed with PBS at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with freshly prepared sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin/PBS solution (1.0 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 45 min. After washing twice with PBS at 4 °C, the cells were immediately harvested for analysis or were incubated in chase medium. As a control for the biotinylation procedure done in this way, a separate set of cells were labeled to equilibrium, and the degree of biotinylation of β-tubulin (an intracellular cytoskeletal protein) was measured as <0.5% of total cellular β-tubulin. Cell lysate was prepared by extracting cells with 100 μl of 2% SDS and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The extract was then diluted with 0.9 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mmNa2HPO4, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm methionine, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% deoxylcholate. The cell lysate was sheared three times through a 25-gauge needle and then transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation. ApoE in cell lysates and in media (selected experiments) was isolated by immunoprecipitation with goat apo E anti-serum. The samples were first cleared by incubating for 2 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of nonimmune goat serum and then with 60 μl of r-protein G-agarose beads for another 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 18 μl of apoE anti-serum and then with 60 μl of additional protein G-agarose. Iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 10 mm was included in all incubations to prevent rearrangement of disulfide bonds. After washing the protein G-agarose beads three times with IP buffer (lysis buffer + 0.2% SDS), 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline containing 1% SDS and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride is added to the tubes and heated for 3 min at 90 °C to release apoE-IgG complexes from the protein G-agarose beads (17.Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thereafter, 900 μl of IP buffer containing 10 mm iodoacetimide is added to the tubes, which are mixed and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant. 900 μl of the supernatant is transferred to tubes that contain 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads that have been washed twice with IP buffer and pelleted to the bottom. The samples are incubated for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected for determination of unbiotinylated (intracellular fraction) apoE. The streptavidin-agarose beads were then washed three times with IP buffer, and then a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptethanol, 50 mm dithiothreitol was used to release biotinylated (surface fraction) apoE from the beads. For analysis of intracellular apoE, 800 μl of supernatant collected after incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads was mixed with 4 ml (5 volumes) of acetone, incubated for 30 min at −20 °C (dry ice in ethanol), and then centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. 15 μl of the resuspended sample was mixed with 15 μl of sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and then applied to 10% SDS-PAGE. For analysis of cell surface apoE, biotinylated apoE released from streptavidin-agarose beads was boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and then mixed with a density buffer containing 40% glycerol and 5% bromphenol blue. The samples were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE. ApoE signals on SDS-PAGE were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantitated using the ImageQuant software program. Results are expressed in scanning cpm. Titration experiments utilizing a range of antiserum concentrations and a range of labeled apoE indicated that the polyclonal antiserum used for these experiments immunoprecipitated asialo and sialated apoE with equal efficacy. ApoE from cell fractions or human VLDL was digested with neuraminidase as follows. Proteinase inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 IU/ml appotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Neuraminidase to a final concentration of 1.5 milliunits/ml was added in a digestion buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 4 mm Ca Cl2 (pH 5.8). Control samples received digestion buffer alone. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above. Visualization of labeled cell-derived apoE migration pattern was accomplished using a PhosphorImager. Visualization of VLDL apoE was accomplished by Western transfer as described previously in detail (9.Duan H. Lin C.-Y. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31156-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by immunoisolation of cellular apoE and separation of biotinylated from unbiotinylated apoE was conducted in human monocytes/macrophages and J774-E cells labeled to equilibrium. In Fig.1, we present results of a representative human macrophage experiment along with a control in which a similar isolation protocol was used in cells that were labeled but not biotinylated. As shown in the first four lanes of Fig. 1, derived from biotinylated cells, biotinylated apoE isolated from streptavidin beads (lanes 1 and 2) was easily detectable and displayed a different banding pattern on SDS-PAGE compared with unbiotinylated apoE in the streptavidin supernatant (lanes 3 and 4), with the biotinylated fraction having a more prominent high molecular weight band. After correction for dilution factors used during the isolation, we calculated that 8.3 ± 0.5% of total cellular apoE was accessible to biotinylation and therefore present on the cell surface. Fractionation of a cell lysate derived from unbiotinylated cells (lanes 5–8) demonstrated two additional points of interest. First, there was no streptavidin-bound fraction detectable (lanes 5 and6), confirming no background for this method of analysis. Second, the total cellular fraction (IC + S) present in the streptavidin supernatant from unbiotinylated cells (lanes 7and 8), displayed a banding pattern that was similar to a combination of the isoform pattern from the surface and intracellular fractions obtained from biotinylated cells, i.e. prominent high and low molecular weight apoE bands. Fig. 2 A shows the results of a similar experiment conducted in J774-E cells except that cells were chased for the indicated times prior to biotinylation and harvest. For the time 0 chase, comparable with human monocyte macrophages, approximately 8% of total cellular apoE is present on the cell surface after equilibrium labeling (Fig. 2 B). Also, as previously seen with human macrophages, the surface fraction displays a different molecular weight banding pattern with a predominant higher molecular weight band, as compared with the intracellular fraction. In cells chased for 30 min prior to biotinylation and harvest, the intracellular fraction of apoE fell substantially; however, the percentage of apoE on the cell surface remained stable because of a comparable fall in the cell surface fraction. As the chase time is prolonged to 60 and 120 min prior to biotinylation and harvest; however, there is an increase in the percentage of total cellular labeled apoE present in the cell surface fractions, rising to 12%. It is also of interest to note that the lower molecular weight band of apoE disappears from the IC fraction prior to its disappearance from the surface fraction. Specifically, the low molecular weight band of apoE is almost undetectable at the 60- and 120-min time points from the IC fraction but remained easily distinguishable in the surface fraction. In Fig. 3, we present quantitative data from an experiment in which we measured the time course for the fall (during a chase) of cellular labeled biotinylated apoE and the rise of medium labeled biotinylated apoE, in cells labeled to equilibrium. Different from the experiments presented above, all cells were biotinylated immediately after the labeling period and chased for the indicated time prior to harvest. In this way we could follow the apoE present on the cell surface at chase time 0. A substantial portion of the labeled apoE present on the cell surface at time 0, after equilibrium labeling, rapidly disappears from the cell layer (Fig.3 A) and appears in the medium (Fig. 3 B). The most rapid fall of biotinylated cell-associated labeled apoE occurs prior to 30–40 min, approximately the time course for the rapid phase of accumulation of biotinylated labeled apoE in the medium. From the data in Fig. 3 A the half-life of apoE on the cell surface is calculated to be approximately 12 min. Interestingly, the rate of fall of cellular biotinylated apoE slows substantially after 60 min when the rate of accumulation of biotinylated apoE in the medium also flattens. This suggests that a portion of the apoE present on the cell surface at time 0 does not serve as an immediate precursor for secreted apoE. It should be noted that with this sequence of labeling, i.e.immediate biotinylation and then chase, the subcellular location of the biotinylated apoE remaining associated with the cell at the chase times beyond 0 min can no longer be assigned to the cell surface. In this series of experiments we assessed the time course for the movement of newly synthesized apoE to the cell surface using pulse-labeled cells. For the experiments shown in Fig.4, J774-E cells were pulse labeled for 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, or 90 min. A cell surface fraction for apoE could not be identified in cells pulse-labeled for 2 or 5 min (not shown); however, as early as 10 min, apoE was detectable at the cell surface, representing approximately 3% of total cellular apoE. The percentage of total cell apoE at the cell surface gradually increased with increased labeling times. In these experiments, even though apoE could be detected in the surface fraction at 10 min, no apoE was detected in the medium fraction until 30–60 min (not shown). In Fig. 5 we show the SDS-PAGE pattern for apoE isolated from J774-E cells after short term labeling. Cells were pulse labeled for 30 min, biotinylated, and harvested. Different from the equilibrium-labeled cells, the lower molecular weight band of apoE is prominent in the cell surface fraction (lanes 3 and4), as well as in the intracellular fraction lanes 1 and 2. A similar but somewhat expanded experiment was conducted in human macrophages to further evaluate the apoE migration pattern from pulse-labeled cells. For the experiment shown in Fig.6, human macrophages were pulse labeled for 30 min, biotinylated, and harvested or pulse-labeled for 30 min and chased for 30 or 60 min prior to biotinylation and harvesting. For cells biotinylated and harvested immediately after labeling, IC and surface fraction are presented (Fig. 6, upper panel). For the cells chased for 30 or 60 min, surface and medium fractions are presented (Fig. 6, lower panel). Immediately after the 30-min pulse (at 0 chase time) a prominent lower molecular weight apoE band is apparent in both cell surface and intracellular apoE. At this time, after correction for dilution factors, quantitation indicated that 2.9 ± 0.3% of total cellular apoE was present on the cell surface, which is similar to that observed in J774-E cells, as shown in Fig. 4 (at the 30-min pulse time). With increased chase time prior to biotinylation (Fig. 6, lower panel), the lower molecular weight band is observed to diminish in intensity in the surface fraction, and high molecular weight apoE appears in the medium. No biotinylated low molecular weight apoE is detected in the medium fraction.Figure 6Pulse/chase analysis of surface apoE in human macrophages after short term labeling. Human macrophages were labeled for 30 min with methionine-free DMEM containing 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were then chased at 37 °C with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 500 μm unlabeled methionine for 0, 30, or 60 min (as indicated) and then biotinylated and harvested. ApoE in the IC fraction and surface (S) fraction was measured for the 0-min chase (upper panel). ApoE in the medium and in cell surface fractions was determined at the 30- and 60-min chase (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of the above experiments suggested to us that a small portion of newly synthesized apoE escapes immediate post-translational modification to a high molecular weight form and appears on the cell surface very rapidly after synthesis. Further, it appears that this unmodified apoE is not released from the cell surface into the medium fraction but undergoes modification to a high molecular weight form prior to its release into the medium. This issue was further examined in the next series of experiments. For this series of experiments cells were biotinylated immediately after the pulse labeling period, prior to being chased. In this way, we could follow the processing of apoE present on the cell surface at time 0 of the chase in pulse-labeled cells. For the experiments shown in Fig.7, J774-E cells were pulse-labeled for 25 min. They were then biotinylated and chased for the indicated times. At time 0, a predominantly lower molecular weight band of apoE is observed on the cell surface. At 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min of chase time, however, it can be observed that the apoE biotinylated at time 0 is now distributed into higher molecular weight apoE isoforms in the cell layer. With increasing chase time, the accumulation of biotinylated high molecular weight apoE can also be observed in the medium. This result indicates that low molecular weight apoE present at the cell surface at time 0 is modified to high molecular weight apoE isoforms prior to its release into the medium. The nature of the cellular processing of the surface fraction (Fig. 7) of apoE, which resulted in its maturation from a low molecular weight to a high molecular weight form, was further investigated. These investigations utilized two complementary approaches. Based on previous reports (18.Mazzone T. Papagiannes E. Magner J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19.Zannis V.I. vanderSpek J. Silverman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13415-13421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Zannis V.I. McPherson J. Goldberger G. Karathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the modification that accounted for the increased apparent molecular weight for the apoE during the chase incubation in Fig. 7 was due to the addition of sialic acid residues. As a first approach, we utilized BFA. This agent has been shown to disrupt Golgi function and inhibit Golgi-mediated post-translational glycosylation of proteins (21.Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Miller S.G. Carnell L. Moore H.-P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For the experiments shown in Fig. 8, cells were pulse-labeled for 25 min and immediately biotinylated, as was done for the experiment shown in Fig. 7. Cells were then chased for 30 or 60 min prior to harvest; BFA was included in half of the cultures. Cell surface apoE (Fig. 8, upper panel) at time 0 is, again, predominantly in lower molecular weight apoE. With increasing times of chase in the absence of BFA there is an increase in high molecular weight isoforms of apoE relative to low molecular weight form; and an overall loss of apoE signal intensity with the accumulation of biotinylated apoE in the medium (Fig. 8, lower panel). In the presence of BFA, however, there is no release of biotinylated apoE into the medium, and further, the apoE present at the cell surface at time 0 remains in the low molecular weight unmodified isoform. As a second approach we specifically evaluated the nature of the modification accounting for the change in molecular weight of cell surface apoE, and the results of these experiments are shown in Figs.9 and 10. In Fig. 9, we first document the effect of neuraminidase digestion on the mobility of apoE from J774-E cells. As shown, digestion of total cell-derived apoE with neuraminidase resulted in the appearance of a single isoform with mobility identical to that of similarly digested apoE isolated from human VLDL. Thus, the presence of sialic acid residues accounted for the high molecular weight isoforms present in cell-derived apoE. For the experiment shown in Fig. 10, we used neuraminidase digestion to evaluate the modification of cell surface apoE, which occurred during the chase incubations for the experiment shown in Fig. 7. Cells were pulse-labeled and immediately biotinylated and then harvested immediately or chased for 20 min prior to harvest, exactly as described in Fig. 7. For the harvest, total cellular biotinylated apoE was isolated for the 0- and 20-min chase times, and medium biotinylated apoE was isolated from the 20-min chase time. Half of the isolates were then subjected to neuraminidase digestion. As shown, the neuraminidase digestion resulted in the disappearance of high molecular weight apoE isoforms from the cell, as well as from the medium fractions; indicating that the maturation from the low to high molecular weight biotinylated isoform was due to the addition of sialic acid during the chase period. This provides additional evidence for the role of the Golgi in this maturation in that addition of sialic acid residues to endogenously synthesized protein is a marker for movement of proteins through the trans-Golgi network (16.Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.-P. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Figure 10Analysis of the modification of biotinylated labeled cell surface apoE. J774-E cells were pulse-labeled for 25 min and immediately biotinylated exactly as described in the legend to Fig. 7. Half of the cells were harvested immediately for analysis. The balance were chased for 20 min. Biotinylated apoE remaining associated with the cell at time 0 and after the 20-min chase, and biotinylated apoE in the medium after the 20-min chase was isolated and subjected to digestion with neuraminidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of our studies indicate an unexpected complexity in the transport of the cell surface fraction of apoE in the macrophage. Under equilibrium conditions, approximately 8% of total cellular apoE is present in the cell surface fraction. Cell surface apoE, in equilibrium-labeled cells, is distributed in high molecular weight and low molecular weight isoforms, with the high molecular weight form predominating (Figs. 1 and 2). In cells labeled to equilibrium, as the apoE is allowed to mature during a chase prior to cell surface biotinylation, the amount of apoE remaining in the intracellular fraction falls. The amount of labeled apoE on the cell surface also falls during the chase period but more slowly so that the percentage of total labeled apoE in the surface fraction increases (Fig. 2). The fall in cell surface apoE is mirrored by the accumulation of biotinylated apoE in the medium of equilibrium-labeled cells, and the half-life of apoE on the macrophage cell surface is 12 min (Fig. 3). These results suggest a model in which intracellular apoE is the precursor for cell surface apoE, and cell surface apoE is the precursor for secreted apoE. Further analysis of our experimental results, however, requires modification of this relatively straightforward model for apoE transport from the intracellular compartment to the medium. A small portion of newly synthesized apoE reaches the plasma membrane very rapidly, and there is a lag between the time when newly synthesized apoE can be identified in the cell surface fraction, and when it can be detected in the medium. These studies also demonstrate that the apoE isoform, which accumulates in the surface fraction in cells that are pulse-labeled, is mostly in the low molecular weight isoform, not the high molecular weight isoform that is detected on the surface in equilibrium-labeled cells. Further, the apoE that accumulates in the medium is predominantly the high molecular weight isoform (Fig. 6). Because low molecular weight isoform apoE does not accumulate in the medium, its disappearance from the cell surface must be due to degradation or its conversion to the high molecular weight isoform. Fig. 7 clearly indicates that some portion of the low molecular weight isoform on the cell surface does, in fact, serve as precursor to high molecular weight isoform cellular apoE and secreted apoE. The results of experiments utilizing neuraminidase digestion and BFA indicate that cell transport through the Golgi is required for the conversion of low molecular weight apoE on the cell surface to a high molecular weight isoform. It also is of interest that cell surface apoE, after falling rapidly in the first 30–40 min, falls more slowly (Fig. 3) and that there is a persistent low molecular weight isoform on the surface at least 60 min after the lower molecular weight isoform has virtually disappeared from the intracellular compartment (Fig. 2). The results in Fig. 7 also demonstrate the persistence of a low molecular weight isoform of apoE, biotinylated at time 0, for at least 90 min. These observations support the notion that there is a fraction of cell surface apoE that has a longer residence time on the cell surface or that undergoes repeated recycling. This issue, along with a number of others raised by our observations will require additional investigation. For example, does only low molecular weight isoform apoE get recycled, or can high molecular weight isoform also be recycled from the cell surface for eventual secretion? What proportion of apoE reinternalized from the cell surface is degraded instead of recycled? The mechanism by which a portion of newly synthesized apoE reaches the macrophage cell surface before complete sialation is not clear. Completion of post-translational glycosylation likely requires sequential and ordered movement through the Golgi compartments (23.Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Cell. 1998; 95: 883-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The affinity of apoE for lipid membranes or for plasma membrane receptor proteins that are transported to the cell surface (for example, proteoglycans or LDL receptor) could be involved in interrupting such orderly movement. The biologic importance of the sialation of apoE is also not clearly established. It has been shown in Chinese hamster ovary cells that are defective in post-translational glycosylation, for example, that such modification is not required for efficient apoE secretion (24.Zanni E.E. Kouvatsi A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fazio et al. have recently reported that apoE present on the surface of lipoproteins and injected into intact mice is spared degradation after uptake by hepatocytes and is recycled through the Golgi for resecretion (25.Fazio S. Linton M. Hasty A.H. Swift L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Whether factors involved in recycling of apoE taken up in a lipoprotein particle by hepatocytes and those factors involved in recycling of newly synthesized apoE in the macrophage are the same or different will require additional investigation. They may, in fact, be different given the different role of apoE synthesized by each of these cell types, the unique complement of cell surface proteoglycans and cell surface receptors for each cell type, and the divergent function of these cell types. Recycling of other endogenously synthesized cell surface proteins through the Golgi has been demonstrated (16.Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Hauri H.-P. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In summary, our data indicate a dynamic role for the cell surface apoE fraction in the macrophage. The major implications of our findings are as follows. First, there appears to be segregation of cell surface apoE, such that predominantly modified forms are released even when unmodified forms are predominant at the cell surface. There also appears to be a difference in cell surface retention times between asialo and sialated forms of apoE. Second, the observation that unmodified apoE appears at the cell surface provided a tool with which we were able to establish that recycling of this asialo form of cell surface apoE occurs, and the addition of sialic acid indicates that recycling occurs through the Golgi. Third, our observations raise the possibility that alterations in cell surface binding sites (for example differential expression of receptors or amount or type of proteoglycan) can alter the characteristics of the cell surface pool with respect to recycling. Based on our observations we formulate the following model/hypothesis for the distribution and transport of macrophage cell surface apoE. After synthesis, a portion of apoE can be rapidly transported to the cell surface where it appears as a low molecular weight unglycosylated isoform. At this time the majority of this apoE is reinternalized, and at least a portion is recycled through the Golgi to be converted to a high molecular weight glycosylated form that is eventually secreted into the medium. A portion of cell surface apoE is also reinternalized for degradation (10.Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13454-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on the persistence of an unglycosylated form of apoE associated with the cell in both equilibrium-labeled and pulse-labeled cells, it appears that there may be a subfraction of apoE that either has a prolonged cell surface residence time or undergoes repeated recycling. At least a portion of the high molecular weight form of apoE can be secreted, but a fraction of the high molecular weight apoE at the cell surface has a prolonged residence time or undergoes repeated recycling prior to release or degradation. Factors that modulate the size and movement of the cell surface apoE fraction in macrophages remain to be identified and investigated.

More than 20 blood complement proteins control microbial invasion of the host by two different mechanisms: (i) C3-mediated opsonization of cells and (ii) direct killing as a result of C5b-9 complex formation on the target (1.Tomlinson S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Much is known about the strategies used by pathogens to avoid opsonization because the basic molecular details of the process are recognized (1.Tomlinson S. Curr. Opin.

In contrast, the mechanisms of direct complement-mediated killing of Gram-negative bacteria have remained elusive, and the means used by bacteria to become resistant to its effects are largely unknown (4.Taylor P.W.

However, epidemiological studies of complement-resistant bacteria in systemic infections, as well as studies on individuals with genetically determined complement deficiencies, have indicated that (C5b-9)-mediated mechanisms play an important role in the control of Gram-negative infections. Most striking is the observation by Lassiter et al. (5.Lassiter H.A. Wilson J.L. Feldhoff R.C. Hoffpauir J.M. Klueber K.M. Pediatr. Res. 1994; 35: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) thatEscherichia coli strains that are normally killed by adult serum (“serum-sensitive” strains) pose a severe threat to survival of premature or newborn infants because of diminished serum C9 concentrations in neonates. Microbes escape complement destruction by inhibiting the three pathways of activation by synthesizing surface proteins that mimic complement control proteins or by capturing such proteins (1.Tomlinson S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3.Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 4.Taylor P.W. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 49-64Google Scholar). Resistance to the action of C5b-9, also referred to as the membrane attack complex (MAC),1 is frequently achieved by changes from a rough to a smooth phenotype. Extension of surface carbohydrate structures causes an increase in the envelope hydrophilicity and weakens the anchoring of the MAC. Some strains escape killing by shedding of the MAC. Nevertheless, it is also known that not all smooth strains are serum-resistant and that some resistant strains do not shed the MAC but carry it in a stably bound form. Thus, strains that are truly resistant to complement, in that they are able to replicate in 50% serum (4.Taylor P.W. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 49-64Google Scholar), have acquired virulence factors in addition to those that change the chemical nature of the OM. Some molecular details of the processes by which the MAC, once assembled on a bacterium, elicits death are currently understood. Death of sensitive strains following exposure to serum is extremely rapid, and it is thought to occur by dissipation of cellular energy (4.Taylor P.W. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 49-64Google Scholar, 6.Taylor P.W. Kroll H.P. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 122-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Killing can be prevented by incubation with membrane potential uncouplers or with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation indicating that ATP generated by the target bacterial cell is required. Efficient killing requires stable deposition of the C5b-9 complex on the OM but no other serum components in addition to the terminal complement proteins. Furthermore, it has been shown that formation of poly(C9), a tubular polymerization product of C9, is only incidental to hemolysis and not required for bacterial killing (7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2128-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9.Esser A.F. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 229-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, whereas the (C5b-8)1C91 complex is sufficient to lyse erythrocytes fully, it has no bactericidal activity (10.Bhakdi S. Kuller G. Muhly M. Fromm S. Seibert G. Parrisius J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 206-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has been extended to show that a (C5b-8)1C94 complex is strongly bactericidal but that incorporation of additional C9 molecules to form poly(C9) does not improve killing significantly (11.MacKay S.L. Dankert J.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3367-3371PubMed Google Scholar). A further important conceptual advance was provided by Tomlinson et al. (12.Tomlinson S. Taylor P.W. Luzio J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that transfer of preassembled C5b-9 complexes into the OM by fusion techniques did not elicit cell killing despite the fact that small molecules now had access to the periplasm. Finally, Dankert and Esser (7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that the C-terminal half of C9, the C9b fragment, dissipated the membrane potential across respiring inner membrane (IM) vesicles, although the complete molecule had no effect. In addition, the requirement for a C9 receptor (that is, C5b-8 assembly) on the OM could be bypassed if the C9 molecule was osmotically shocked into the periplasmic space (13.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This report firmly established that the bactericidal activity of complement is dependent upon C9 because none of the other terminal proteins when shocked into the periplasm elicited any cytotoxic effects. What is currently not understood is how C9, after its binding to the C5b-8 complex on the OM, translocates across the periplasm and dissipates the potential across the IM, whether bacterial envelope proteins are needed for these processes, and, most importantly, where the active (bactericidal) center is located in the C9 molecule. Here we show that periplasmic conditions in sensitive cells are important for C9-mediated killing and that the C5b-8 receptor complex plays no role in the final stages of this process. Complement proteins C8 and C9 were purified and assayed for hemolytic activity according to standard procedures (14.Esser A.F. Sodetz J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 162: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and α-thrombin-cleaved C9 (C9 n) was prepared as published (7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All strains used here are listed in Table I. Serum or C9-mediated bacterial killing of bacteria was measured as published (13.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Viable spheroplasts were prepared by the method of Marvin and Witholt (22.Marvin H.J. Witholt B. Anal.

Open table in a new tab The previously characterized eukaryotic C9 expression vector pSVLHuC9 (23.Tomlinson S. Wang Y. Ueda E. Esser A.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 436-444PubMed Google Scholar) and a derivative (pYW29) with two amino acid mutations, L532S and K538R, and a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end were used as the starting plasmids for the generation of the prokaryotic expression vectors shown in TableII. The gene for mature C9 was transferred in two steps into pET12b. First, a SalI restriction site was introduced into pSVLHuC9 at the end of the C9 signal peptide using the “altered sites mutagenesis system” from Promega (Madison, WI) and then aSalI(66)-BamHI(495) fragment was excised and inserted behind the OmpT signal sequence in pET12b to generate pYW49. Second, a BamHI(495–1703) fragment excised from pSVLHuC9, containing C9[144–538] was inserted in frame and in the correct orientation into BamHI-digested pET12b producing pYW50. To introduce the hexahistidine tag, pYW51 was generated by digesting pYW50 and pYW29 with NsiI and SacI and replacing theNsiI-SacI fragment in pYW50 with theNsiI(1307)-SacI(1700) fragment in pYW29. The secretion plasmid for full-length C9, pYW52, was made by cutting pYW49 with BamHI and inserting a BamHI(495–1703) fragment excised from pSVLHuC9 in frame and in the correct orientation. For the expression of cytoplasmic C9 first aNdeI(58)-BamHI(495) polymerase chain reaction fragment starting at the beginning of mature C9 was generated using pSVLHuC9 as a template. This fragment was inserted into pET12b to generate pYW53 and then a BamHI(495–1703) fragment from pSVLHuC9 was inserted in frame and in the correct orientation to generate pYW54. Because these pET12b-derived plasmids could not be used for protein expression (see below) various complete C9 genes together with ribosomal binding sites and signal sequences (if any) were transferred as XbaI-SacI fragments into pET22b and pASK75, respectively, to provide better control of transcription. This resulted in the replacement of the pelB and ompA signal peptides in pET22b and pASK75, respectively, with the ompT signal peptide in the secretion vectors, and neither the intrinsic hexahistidine tag in pET22b nor the Strep TM tag in pASK75 were fused to the C9 constructs. All nucleotide changes were verified by sequencing.Table IIExpression plasmidsPlasmid nameParent plasmidaThe parent plasmids pET12b and pET22b are from Novagen; pASK75 is from Biometra (Tampa, FL)./signal sequenceInsertTagN-terminal sequencebSequence differences from mature human C9 are indicated in bold italics.C-terminal sequencebSequence differences from mature human C9 are indicated in bold italics.pYW49pET12b/ompTC9[1–144]- S TTS……DP AANKARKEAELAAAEATAEQpYW50pET12b/ompTC9[145–538]DPLS..…LEFPNEKpYW51pET12b/ompTC9[145–538]HisDPLS..… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW52pET12b/ompTmature C9- S TTS……LEFPNEKpYW53pET12b/noneC9[1–144]M QYTTS……DP AANKARKEAELAAAEATAEQpYW54pET12b/nonemature C9M QYTTS……LEFPNEKpYW55pET22b/ompTC9[1–144]His- S TTS……DP NSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHHpYW56pET22b/ompTC9[145–538]His- S TTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW57pET22b/ompTmature C9His- S TTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW58pET22b/nonemature C9HisM QYTTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW59pASK75/ompTC9[145–538]His- S TTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW60pASK75/ompTmature C9His- S TTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpYW61pASK75/nonemature C9HisM QYTTS…… S EFPNE RHHHHHHpDnaK/JA.

Open table in a new tab Transformed cells were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic. Fresh cultures (20 ml) in LB or M63 medium (supplemented with amino acids, thiamine at 1 mg/ml, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm sodium citrate, and 0.4% glucose as carbon source and the appropriate antibiotic) (16.Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) were inoculated at 1:100 dilution and incubated at the desired temperature under constant shaking. After reaching mid-exponential growth, phase cultures were split in two, and one half was induced with either 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside or 50 ng/ml anhydrotetracycline depending on the expression vector, and the other half served as uninduced control. After about 1 h of induction, strains lacking functional dsbA or dsbB received 5 mm N-acetylcysteine (NaC) to promote disulfide pairing (24.Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24547-24550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Viability of all cultures was assayed by removing small aliquots at predetermined time points and counting colonies on agar plates prepared with M63 medium supplemented with casamino acids, glucose, and the appropriate antibiotic and incubation at 37 °C. Strains lacking functional thioredoxin reductase (trxB) were cultured and induced as described (19.Schneider E.L. Thomas J.G. Bassuk J.A. Sage E.H. Baneyx F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Complement-resistant strains (LP1395 and 25922) were transformed with pYW60, and ampicillin-resistant colonies were picked and cultured. After induction with anhydrotetracycline (100 ng/ml), cell viability was assayed by colony counting as described above. Published procedures were used to prepare total cell lysates and periplasmic shock fluids (25.Thom J.R. Randall L.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Martin J.L. Waksman G. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for SDS-PAGE analysis and blotting. A polyclonal anti-C9 serum adsorbed on immobilized cell extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) or a monoclonal antibody (mAb216) against human C9 was used to detect recombinant C9 by Western blotting as described previously (23.Tomlinson S. Wang Y. Ueda E. Esser A.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 436-444PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins carrying the hexahistidine tag were also visualized using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid alkaline phosphatase conjugate detection system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). NLM100 cells were induced for 3 h to express secretable C9 (pYW60) or cytoplasmic C9 (pYW61), collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Tris-EDTA-sucrose buffer and lysozyme at about 1 × 109 cells/ml to produce spheroplasts as described (17.Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The spheroplasts were then incubated at 37 °C with trypsin (1 μg/ml) for up to 60 min, aliquots were withdrawn, and proteolysis was stopped by addition of SBTI (5 μg/ml). The cells were homogenized by sonication and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ligand blotting. These experiments were carried out as described by Thom and Randall (25.Thom J.R. Randall L.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, spheroplasts were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication, and total lysates were centrifuged for 16 h in a metrizamide gradient (1.27–1.29 g/ml) at 80,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA120.2 rotor to separate protein aggregates and membranes. Gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and ligand blotting. We previously discovered that when C9 was shocked into the periplasm it killed sensitive E. coli, whereas it had no effect on respiring IM vesicles in contrast to the C9b fragment (7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This prompted us to ask whether periplasmic processing was required for cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig. 1, neither native C9 nor C9 cleaved with thrombin (to produce C9a and C9b) had a significant effect on spheroplast viability. This strongly suggested that periplasmic factors are required for toxicity and indicated that proteolytic cleavage alone is inadequate to convert C9 from a protoxin to a toxin. To gain further information on required periplasmic factors, we introduced C9 into the periplasm from the insideof the cell by secretion of recombinant C9, rather than from theoutside by osmotic shock. The gene for mature C9 was cloned into the pET12 vector, which provides an OmpT signal peptide for export of recombinant proteins into the periplasm to generate pYW52. However, because of promoter leakiness it was impossible to transform cells efficiently. When very large amounts of pYW52 DNA were used for transformation, a few colonies could be recovered. Sequencing of the plasmid isolated from four different colonies indicated that in each case the C9 gene was inactivated by insertion of bacterial IS elements (data not shown). Using vectors derived from pET22b or pASK75 that are more tightly controlled (pYW55-pYW61), transformation was possible, and recombinant cells could be cultured. Expression of C9 caused an immediate loss of viability of the cells harboring these plasmids (Fig.2, A and B). A secreted, N-terminal fragment, C9[1–144], was not toxic, but the C-terminal fragment C9[145–538] was as toxic as the complete molecule (Fig. 2 C). Significantly, when C9 was cloned into either vector without any signal peptide (pYW53, pYW54, pYW58, and pYW61), no toxic effects were observed after induction, and C9 accumulated as soluble and insoluble forms in the cytoplasm that were hemolytically inactive (data not shown). Of significance is the fact that expression of secretable C9 in two complement-resistant strains ofE. coli (LP1395 and 29025) from pYW60 had no effect on viability (data not shown). Although these results suggested that C9 was exported into the periplasm and exhibited its toxic effects in a manner similar to external C9 shocked into the periplasm, we could not exclude the possibility that loss of viability was caused by merely expressing a foreign gene in E. coli. Many gene products are known to express such general cytopathic effects. To test for this possibility we took advantage of the fact that C9 is a heavily disulfide-linked protein (Fig. 3 A), which is inactive when reduced. Disulfide bond formation in the periplasm ofE. coli is controlled by the dsbA,dsbB, dsbC, dsbD, dsbE, anddsbG genes (28.Rietsch A. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 163-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The DsbA protein is a protein disulfide isomerase in the periplasm that introduces cystines into secreted proteins and thereby becomes reduced. The DsbB protein is an IM protein that reoxidizes reduced DsbA. In contrast to wild type cells, E. coli mutants with defective dsbA or dsbBgenes harboring pASK75-derived plasmids were not killed by induction of C9 expression (Fig. 3, B and C), nor were λDE3 lysogenized dsb mutants (YW10-YW13) transformed with pET22b-derived vectors (Fig. 3 D). This lack of cytotoxicity is probably related to absence of disulfide bond formation in secreted C9 and, therefore, proper folding of the molecule because when NaC was added to the culture medium an immediate viability loss was observed. Importantly, single and double dsb mutants are not complement-resistant per se because they were killed in a C9-dependent process by serum (Table I). Cells harboring plasmids (pYW58 and pYW61) that express C9 in the cytoplasm were not affected by NaC addition, suggesting that the effect is specific for periplasmic C9 and was not caused by NaC directly. To provide direct evidence for the cellular location of the protein expressed from plasmids coding for exported C9, we performed protease sensitivity assays. In this assay, the trypsin sensitivity of C9 is assayed in cells that have been stripped of their outer cell wall (spheroplasts) exposing periplasmic but not cytoplasmic contents to the protease. Immunoblots (Fig.4 A) specific for C9 or ligand blots specific for the His6 tag (Fig. 4 B) show almost complete degradation of periplasmic C9 but complete protection of cytoplasmic C9, indicating that >90% of the exported C9 reached the periplasmic compartment. Flotation gradient centrifugation of spheroplast lysates can provide further evidence for the localization of expressed proteins and their physical state. As shown in Fig. 4(C and D), C9 secreted by a dsbBstrain (NML100) was mostly located at the bottom of the metrizamide gradient, providing evidence that it is either aggregated or associated with another insoluble protein, and the remainder floated to the top of the gradient, indicating that some of it is membrane-bound. When we tested periplasmic shock fluids produced from cells expressing secreted C9 none could be detected (Fig. 5), nor was C9[145–538] detectable. In contrast, a N-terminal fragment (C9[1–144]) was detected easily as was cytoplasmic C9.Figure 5Western blotting of periplasmic C9 and fragments. Periplasmic shock fluid of BL21(DE3) cells expressing C9[1–144] (lane 2), signal-sequenceless C9 (lane 3), and full-length C9 (lane 4) were assayed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for the presence of C9. In lane 1 purified, reduced, and carboxymethylated C9 was applied. Molecular weight markers are shown in lane 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our observations that isolated C9 has no effect on spheroplast viability but is toxic when shocked into the periplasm of whole cells suggested that periplasmic constituents may be required for toxicity. This situation is reminiscent of the action of membrane-active colicins (9.Esser A.F. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 229-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which require either Tol or Ton proteins for translocation across the cell envelope, insertion into the IM, and cell killing (29.Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, E. coli strains K17A1 and KP1032, which are defective in TolA or TonB, respectively, were killed by serum complement (Table I), indicating that these proteins are not involved in the translocation of C9 across the periplasmic space. The fact that accumulation of C9 in the cytoplasm of wild type cell is not toxic to the host is not surprising. First, the protein is mostly in inclusion bodies and second, because it contains 12 disulfide bonds, it is highly unlikely that many native conformers will be formed under such circumstances. Recent advances in understanding the genetics of disulfide bond metabolism in E. coli led to the creation of thioredoxin reductase mutants (trxB) in which disulfide bond formation in proteins localized to the cytoplasm takes place (18.Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). When signal sequenceless C9 was expressed in E. coli AD494, it accumulated in the cytoplasm, but its production had no effect on viability (data not shown). Several additional conditions were examined that are known to promote disulfide bond formation in trxBcells, such as growing cells in minimal medium and at lower temperatures (e.g. 23 °C or 30 °C) and then holding them on ice for a few hours after they are grown, but none impaired cell viability. Another approach to increase disulfide bond formation in a cytoplasmic protein has been used by Schneider et al. (19.Schneider E.L. Thomas J.G. Bassuk J.A. Sage E.H. Baneyx F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These investigators co-expressed the chaperons DnaK and DnaJ together with SPARC, a protein containing seven disulfide bonds, intrxB cells and demonstrated that 15–20% soluble monomeric protein with an electrophoretic mobility characteristic of correctly disulfide-bonded and biologically active SPARC was formed. When signal sequenceless C9 was expressed in FC1 cells from the pYW58 plasmid together with DnaK/J from the pDnaK/J plasmid, it still had no effect on viability of such cells (data not shown), suggesting that cytoplasmically located C9 is not toxic to E. colicells. Native complement protein C9 is a soluble glycoprotein devoid of cellular toxicity; yet when it enters the periplasmic space of anE. coli cell it is converted from a protoxin to a toxin. This conversion is independent of the pathway by which C9 enters the periplasm. Both, C9 shocked into the periplasmic space and C9 synthesized by expression from a plasmid and targeted to the periplasmvia a signal sequence are toxic to the host cell. The toxic effects of plasmid-derived C9 were not caused simply by overexpressing a foreign gene because expression of C9 localized to the cytoplasm was not toxic. The lethal effects were also not due to jamming of the export pathway because of overexpression because the protein remained nontoxic when it was targeted to the periplasm of cells with impaired disulfide-bond catalysis (dsb mutants). In such cells the protein is translocated across the IM and becomes accessible in spheroplasts to externally added trypsin verifying its periplasmic location. The protein, however, is not present in a soluble form in the periplasm but is mostly aggregated, perhaps in so-called periplasmic inclusion bodies (30.Betton J.M. Boscus D. Missiakas D. Raina S. Hofnung M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A small percentage of translocated C9 is also still associated with the membrane. Wunderlich and Glockshuber (24.Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24547-24550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that folding of a disulfide-bonded protein in the oxidative environment of the periplasm in well oxygenated cell cultures is influenced by addition of a thiol reagent such as NaC. When this catalyst was added to dsb mutants harboring C9 in their periplasm, it elicited an immediate loss of cell viability. We interpret this result to indicate that some cystine formation and therefore at least partial folding of the translocated C9 is necessary for toxicity. Because C9-mediated killing of bacteria is thought to occur by a single or dual hit process (31.Wright S.D. Levine R.P. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1146-1151PubMed Google Scholar), the number ofeffective molecules is extremely low, and it is not surprising that NaC is useful in this process because very few C9 molecules need to form disulfide bonds and fold appropriately to evoke killing. The effectiveness of a few correctly folded C9 molecules is also demonstrated by the fact that transformation of wild type cells was not possible with plasmids in which expression is driven by promoters that are not tightly controlled. Truncation of C9 indicated that the N-terminal 144 amino acids are not required for cytotoxicity and a fragment comprised of these residues accumulated in soluble form in the periplasm. The remainder, C9[145–538], however, is as toxic as the complete molecule when targeted to the periplasm. It contains the C9b fragment and, as shown earlier (7.Dankert J.R. Esser A.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this fragment by itself is able to de-energize IM vesicles and to kill spheroplasts (32.Gu X. Dankert J.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 189: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Within this fragment are four disulfide bonds, three in the epidermal growth factor domain located between Lys487 and Glu518, and one in the so-called membrane attack complex/perforin region, connecting Cys359with Cys384. Experiments are planned to test which of these cystines are required to fold C9 into a conformer that will elicit killing of dsb mutants with the help of NaC. When native C9 enters the periplasm from the outside, either by binding first to its receptor, through a C5b-8 complex on the OM, or by being shocked into the periplasm, it is converted to a toxin. Experimental data are currently missing to distinguish whether this conversion involves only a refolding of the molecule or the interaction with an intrinsic periplasmic constituent or both. From our previous work (33.Laine R.O. Esser A.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) it is known that membrane insertion of C9 is accompanied by the transient appearance of refolding conformers that can be trapped by C9 sequence-specific anti-peptide antibodies. In the context of complement-mediated hemolysis, it is assumed that the interaction of C9 with C5b-8 on the erythrocyte membrane triggers these conformational changes. However, because C9 can kill in the absence of C5b-8 when shocked into the periplasm such a (C5b-8)-mediated trigger mechanism cannot be involved here. One possibility is that the molecule is proteolytically cleaved in the periplasm and a toxic fragment is liberated that inserts into the IM. The basis for this hypothesis is that the C9b fragment can dissipate the membrane potential across IM vesicles, whereas C9 n, in which the C9a and C9b fragments are still noncovalently associated, cannot and that it is not toxic to spheroplasts (Fig. 1). It is tempting to speculate that a helper factor in the cell envelope may interact with the C9b portion of C9 and convert it to a toxin. This hypothesis is consistent with fact that cytoplasmic C9 is not toxic even when it is produced under conditions most favorable to formation of disulfide bonds. One would expect that under such conditions at least as many properly folded C9 molecules are created in the cytoplasm as are created by NaC in the periplasm ofdsb mutants and that they should be toxic if no other helper factors were required. Such a helper-dependent mechanism is similar to the events that prevail during the killing of E. coli by membrane-inserting colicins. These colicins have a receptor binding domain, a translocation domain, and a membrane insertion domain (29.Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The requirement for receptor binding can be bypassed by shocking colicins into the periplasm. The translocation domain interacts in an energy-dependent manner with either Tol or Ton proteins. Because of the similar requirement for a membrane potential and the inhibitory effects of uncouplers for C9-mediated killing, we tested whether Tol or Ton proteins play a role in C9 killing. However, two mutants with defective ton or tol genes, which are refractory to killing by their respective colicins, are sensitive to C9-mediated killing, indicating that other periplasmic constituents are necessary. Considering the tendency of native C9 to undergo disulfide shuffling 2V. Rossi and A. F. Esser, unpublished observations. and the effect of dsb mutations on the activity of expressed C9, it was conceivable that the DsbA and DsbB proteins themselves are involved in serum C9 toxicity. However, this is not the case becausedsb mutants were killed even without NaC by serum complement, that is, when C9 enters the periplasm from the outside. Of interest in this context is the fact that E. coli strains that are resistant to serum complement killing are also resistant to killing by C9 when it is shocked into the periplasm or when it is overexpressed in the cytoplasm and targeted to the periplasm. Previous attempts to generate serum complement-resistant mutants from sensitive strains have led to the generation of smooth phenotypes, that is, capsule producing mutants or mutants with increased LPS densities and/or longer O-saccharide chains (34.Tee G.L. Scott G.K. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Kubens B.S. Opferkuch W. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. A. 1988; 270: 52-65PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike patient-derived resistant strains such mutants can frequently be killed by complement when their OM integrity is impaired. In the future it may be possible to design genetic screens to search for helper factors that are required for C9 toxicity by using the targeting of C9 to the periplasm as described here.

E., Apicella, M. A., and Spinola, S. M. (1991) Mol. Microbiol.5, 2475–2480). In this current study, we have analyzed theO-deacylated LPS and free oligosaccharides from three transformants (designated pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, and pGEMLOS-7) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry techniques, along with composition and linkage analyses. These data show that the chimeric LPS consist of the complete E. coli LPS core structure glycosylated on the 7-position of the non-reducing terminal branch heptose with oligosaccharides from H. influenzae. In pGEMLOS-7, the disaccharide Gal1→ 3GlcNAc1→ is added, and in pGEMLOS-5, the structure is extended to Gal1→4GlcNAc1→3Gal1→3GlcNAc1→. PGEMLOS-5 LPS reacts positively with monoclonal antibody 3F11, an antibody that recognizes the terminal disaccharide of lacto-N-neotetraose. In pGEMLOS-4 LPS, the 3F11 epitope is apparently blocked by glycosylation on the 6-position of the terminal Gal with either Gal or GlcNAc. The biosynthesis of these chimeric LPS was found to be dependent on a functional wecA (formerlyrfe) gene in E. coli. By using this carbohydrate expression system, we have been able to examine the functions of the lsg genes independent of the effects of other endogenous Haemophilus genes and expressed proteins.

However, efforts to correlate defined LOS structures with specific biological functions have been hindered by the high degree of microheterogeneity and antigenic variability of Hib LOS. Additionally, some Hib LOS epitopes phase vary at high frequencies due to slip-strand mispairing (9.Weiser J.N. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), adding a further level of structural complexity to wild-type Hib LOS populations. To facilitate the elucidation of LOS biosynthesis and to determine the relationship of LOS structures to the biology and pathophysiology ofHaemophilus infections, our laboratory has cloned a gene cluster from Hib strain A2 containing LOS synthesis genes (lsg) (10.Spinola S.M. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lsg loci are contained within a 7.4-kb DNA fragment, consisting of seven complete open reading frames (ORFs) (11.McLaughlin R. Lee N.-G. Abu Kwaik Y. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 165-174Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This region is one of several distinct loci found in the genome sequence of Hib strain Rd (12.Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O.

Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, a series of isogenic mutants of Hib A2 was generated by transposon mutagenesis of the lsg region using minitransposon m-Tn3(Cm) (14.McLaughlin R. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the transposon mutants produced much simpler LOS mixtures than the wild-type Hib A2 LOS and no longer reacted with one or more of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing phase-varying or stable Hib epitopes (14.McLaughlin R. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural characterization of the LOS from two transposon mutants with m-Tn3(Cm) insertions inlsgD and lsgE has suggested that mutation of these ORFs prevents the organism from synthesizing many of the higher molecular weight structures found in wild-type Hib A2 LOS (6.Phillips N.J. McLaughlin R. Miller T.J. Apicella M.A. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5937-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Strain 281.25, whose mutation was in lsgD, produced only the basal Hib A2 LOS structures containing glucose (Glc), heptose (Hep), and 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo). This strain did not express the Kdo-related 6E4 epitope characteristic of Hib LOS, or the 3F11 epitope, which consists of a terminalN-acetyllactosamine that is common to many strains ofHaemophilus and neisserial LOS and has furthermore been implicated in host mimicry (15.Mandrell R.E. McLaughlin R. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A. Yamasaki R. Gibson B. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain 276.4, whose mutation was inlsgE, produced similar low molecular weight LOS components that failed to react with mAbs 6E4 and 3F11, and one high molecular weight species that terminated in sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine. When strain 276.4 was treated with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid from the sialylated LOS glycoform(s), the strain could now be recognized by mAb 3F11. Since both strains failed to produce any of the high molecular weight wild-type LOS structures containing galactose (Gal) or to express the Pk epitope (Galα1→4Galβ1→4Glc1→) associated with wild-type H. influenzae LOS (4.Masoud H. Moxon E.R. Martin A. Krajcarski D. Richards J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2091-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15.Mandrell R.E. McLaughlin R. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A. Yamasaki R. Gibson B. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these studies suggested that lsgD and lsgE are most probably involved in the transfer of galactose to the LOS. In a related set of experiments, DNA from the lsg region of Hib strain A2 was used to construct a genomic library in the lambda bacteriophage EMBL3 (10.Spinola S.M. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty six phage clones were prepared that expressed Hib LOS oligosaccharide epitopes in Escherichia coli strain LE392. The phage transformant designated EMBLOS-1 produced a chimeric LPS with an ∼1.4-kDa oligosaccharide added to the ∼4.1-kDa LPS of E. coli LE392 (10.Spinola S.M. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 6E4, which recognizes a component in the Hib A2 LOS mixture, also recognized the novel 5.5-kDa component in the chimeric LPS. Restriction fragments of EMBLOS-1 were used to make a series of plasmids that modified E. coli strain JM109 to give clones that produced a proposed chimeric series of higher mass LPS species (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The transformants pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, and pGEMLOS-7 generated modified or chimeric LPS of ∼5.5, 5.1, and 4.5 kDa, respectively (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All three apparently modified the ∼4.1-kDa LPS species from E. coli, although only the LPS from pGEMLOS-4 expressed the 6E4 epitope. The LPS from strain pGEMLOS-5 was found to react positively with mAb 3F11, suggesting the presence of terminal N-acetyllactosamine. The epitope recognized by mAb 6E4 is also present in the LOS ofH. influenzae nontypable strain 2019 (17.Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as the LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re mutant. Binding of this monoclonal antibody to H. influenzae LOS can be inhibited by Kdo and the Kdo trisaccharide from the Re mutant of S. minnesota (10.Spinola S.M. Abu Kwaik Y. Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the 6E4 epitope has been associated with the core of Haemophilus LOS, it was originally proposed that the chimeric structures expressed in E. coli might arise from the addition of a Haemophilus core structure to an acceptor residue of the E. coli ∼4.1-kDa LPS species. Recently, a revised structure of the E. coli K-12 core region was reported that contains a heptose trisaccharide inner core and a fourth heptose present on the terminus of the main oligosaccharide branch (18.Holst O.

H. influenzaestrain A2 was originally isolated from the spinal fluid of a child with meningitis. Hib A2 was grown on chocolate agar supplemented with IsoVitaleX or brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% Fildes reagent (Difco) at 35 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. E. coli strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C using LB agar or broth with appropriate antibiotics (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol.

This strain was originally described by Meier-Dieter and co-workers (19.Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains JM109 and 21548 were transformed with the plasmid pGEM3Zf+ into which different DNA restriction fragments from the H. influenzae strain A2 lsglocus had been ligated (see Table I and Fig. 1) (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEMLOS-4 contained a 7.4-kbBamHI-PstI fragment of DNA that contained all seven open reading frames (A–G) comprising the lsg locus (11.McLaughlin R. Lee N.-G. Abu Kwaik Y. Spinola S.M.

The plasmid pGEMLOS-5 contained a 5.5 kbHindIII-PstI fragment of DNA comprising five open reading frames (C–G) of the lsg locus. The plasmid pGEMLOS-7 contained a 2.8-kb SphI-PstI fragment of DNA comprising two open reading frames (F and G) of thelsg locus. In addition, both strains were transformed with pGEMG and pGEMF.

Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 831-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS were separated by SDS-PAGE in resolving gels containing 15% acrylamide and visualized by silver staining (22.Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). The nomenclature for the various LPS preparations is as follows: pGEM, pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, pGEMLOS-7, pGEMG, and pGEMF were all isolated from strain JM109 transformed with plasmids pGEM3zf+, pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, pGEMLOS-7, pGEMG, and pGEMF, respectively (see Table I). The LPS preparations isolated from the wecA- strain 21548 transformed with the same set of plasmids were designated pGEMrfe, pGEMLOS-4rfe, pGEMLOS-5rfe, pGEMLOS-7rfe, pGEMGrfe, and pGEMFrfe. A few milligrams of LPS from each sample were treated with anhydrous hydrazine at 37 °C for 20 min (23.Helander I.M. Lindner B. Brade H. Altmann K. Lindberg A.A. Rietschel E.T. Zähringer U. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The LPS from pGEM (31 mg), pGEMLOS-4 (25 mg), pGEMLOS-5 (15 mg), and pGEMLOS-7 (4.4 mg) was hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid (2 mg of LPS/ml) for 2 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysates were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatants removed. The pellets were washed with 2 ml of H2O and centrifuged again (5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatants and washings were pooled and lyophilized to give the oligosaccharide fractions. As a standard, 10 mg of LPS fromSalmonella typhimurium TV119 Ra mutant (Sigma) was treated in the same fashion. To prepare desalted oligosaccharide pools for ESI-MS analysis, small aliquots of the crude oligosaccharide fractions (<2 mg) were chromatographed on two Bio-Select SEC 125–5 HPLC columns (Bio-Rad) connected in series, using 0.05 m pyridinium acetate (pH 5.2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A refractive index detector (Knauer) was used to monitor column effluent, and chromatograms were recorded and stored with a Shimadzu C-R3A Chromatopac integrator. For large scale separations, the oligosaccharide fractions from pGEM (10.2 mg), pGEMLOS-4 (9.3 mg), and pGEMLOS-5 (7.0 mg) were dissolved in 0.3 ml of 0.05 m pyridinium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) and centrifuge-filtered through a 0.45-μm Nylon-66 membrane (Microfilterfuge tube, Rainin). The pGEM and pGEMLOS-4 samples were applied to a single Bio-Gel P-4 column (1.6 × 84 cm, <400 mesh; Bio-Rad), and the pGEMLOS-5 sample was applied to two Bio-Gel P-4 columns connected in series (1.6 × 79 cm and 1.6 × 76.5 cm). The columns were equipped with water jackets maintained at 30 °C. Upward elution at a flow rate of 10 ml/h was achieved with a P-1 peristaltic pump (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Effluent was monitored with refractive index, and fractions were collected at 10-min intervals and evaporated to dryness in a Speed-Vac concentrator. Oligosaccharide fractions were placed in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes and treated with cold 48% aqueous HF (Mallinckrodt) to make 5–10 μg/μl solutions. Samples were kept for 18 h at 4 °C and then aqueous HF was evaporated as described previously (17.Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated samples were then rechromatographed on two Bio-Select SEC 125–5 HPLC columns connected in series using 0.05 m pyridinium acetate (pH 5.2) as described above. Dephosphorylated oligosaccharide fractions were dissolved in 400 μl of 2 mtrifluoroacetic acid and heated for 4 h at 100 °C. The hydrolysates were evaporated to dryness in a Speed-Vac concentrator, redissolved in 20 μl H2O, and dried again. Hydrolysates were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (24.Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) using a Dionex BioLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) with a CarboPac PA1 column as described previously (17.Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Linkage analysis was performed on dephosphorylated oligosaccharide fractions using the microscale method (25.Levery S.B. Hakomori S.-I. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) modified for use with powdered NaOH (26.Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Details of this procedure have been reported elsewhere (17.Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Gibson B.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4515-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography/MS in the EI and CI modes on a VG70SE mass spectrometer as described previously (27.Phillips N.J. John C.M. Reinders L.G. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Griffiss J.M. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 19: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LSIMS was performed using a Kratos MS50S mass spectrometer with a cesium ion source (28.Falick A.M. Wang G.H. Walls F.C. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide samples (in 1 μl of H2O) were added to 1 μl of glycerol/thioglycerol (1:1) on a stainless steel probe tip. A Cs+ ion primary beam energy of 10 keV was used, and the secondary sample ions were accelerated to 8 keV. Scans were taken in the negative ion mode at 300 s/decade and recorded with a Gould ES-1000 electrostatic recorder. The spectra were mass calibrated manually with Ultramark 1621 (PCR Research Chemicals, Inc., Gainesville, FL) to an accuracy of better than ±0.2 Da. Oligosaccharides and O-deacylated LPS were analyzed on either a VG Platform mass spectrometer (VG Instruments, Manchester, UK) or a Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source operating in the negative ion mode. Oligosaccharide samples were dissolved in H2O, mixed with running solvent (1 μl in 4 μl), and injected via a Rheodyne injector into a stream of H2O/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid, at a flow rate of ∼20 μl/min. Mass calibration was carried out with CsI in the negative ion mode. In some cases, selected oligosaccharide fractions were analyzed at higher resolving power (M/ΔM = 2000) using a Micromass Autospec sector-orthogonal time of flight (TOF) instrument with an array detector (29.Bateman R.H. Green M.R. Scott G. Clayton E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1227Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) operating under ESI conditions in the negative ion mode. In this case, the solvent system and flow rate were essentially the same as described above for the quadrupole ESI experiments. A scan speed of 5 s/decade was used for all samples over the m/z range of 500–3000 with a accelerating voltage of 4 kV and an ESI needle voltage of between 3.5 and 4 kV higher. Mass calibration was carried out with an external reference consisting of CsI taken under liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry conditions, followed by a one-point correction of the doubly charged deprotonated molecular ion of the oligosaccharide from the LPS of S. typhimurium Ra mutant ((M − 2H)2− exact = 973.2) in the negative ion ESI-MS mode. O-Deacylated LPS samples were analyzed on a Voyager or an Elite MALDI-TOF instrument (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). All spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode using delayed extraction conditions as described in detail elsewhere (30.Gibson B.W. Engstrom J.J. John C.M. Hines W. Falick A.M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 645-658Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in H2O (∼250 pmol/μl) and mixed 1:1 with the matrix solution (a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetone) and allowed to dry at room temperature on a gold-plated MALDI plate. Approximately 100 laser shots were recorded for each sample, averaged, and then mass calibrated using an external mass calibrant consisting of renin substrate tetradecapeptide, insulin chain B, oxidized, and bovine insulin (all from Sigma). For external calibrations under these conditions, a mass accuracy of ≤0.1% was obtained. For comparison purposes, a single point correction was made to the spectra of the O-deacylated LPS from pGEM using the expected lipid A fragment ion (average (M − H)− atm/z 952.009), and then the spectra for the three chimeric strains were recalibrated using this lipid A fragment ion and an additional ion from pGEM (m/z 2835.7) present in all four samples. Dephosphorylated oligosaccharides were analyzed in the positive ion mode on a PE Sciex (Concorde, Ontario, Canada) QSTAR mass spectrometer equipped with a Protana nanospray ion source. The QSTAR analyzer consists of a high pressure RF-only ion guide followed by a quadrupole mass filter. A high pressure quadrupole collision cell follows the first mass filter. The TOF mass analyzer is comprised of a reflectron with an effective flight path of 2.5 meters. Samples were dissolved in H2O/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid, and 2 μl of each was injected into a Protana nanospray tip. The nanospray needle voltage was typically 800–1000 V. One sample loading usually gave an analysis time of 30–40 min, which allowed a conventional mass spectrum to be obtained prior to the selection of several individual ions for CID MS/MS. In MS mode the high resolution capability (8,000 FWHM) allowed unambiguous determination of the charge state for each ion. For CID-MS/MS operation the quadrupole mass analyzer with a mass window of 1 m/z unit was used to select precursor ions for fragmentation, which in most cases were doubly charged (M + 2H)2+. The selected ions were fragmented in a collision cell with air as the collision gas and analyzed in the orthogonal TOF operating at an accelerating potential of 20 kV. Fragment ion spectra were accumulated under computer control for periods of between 10 s and 1 min. Mass assignments based on external calibration were generally within 50 ppm of calculated monoisotopic values, whereas internal calibration gave masses accurate to ±5 ppm. We have previously reported the transformation of E. coli strain JM109 (a K-12 strain that produces rough LPS (r-LPS) that lack the O side chain) with a series of plasmids containing overlapping restriction fragments of DNA from thelsg region of H. influenzae type b strain A2 (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As diagrammed in Fig. 1, the pGEMLOS-4 clone contains all of the complete ORFs (lsgA-lsgG) in the lsg region, whereas pGEMLOS-5 contains lsgC-lsgG, and pGEMLOS-7 containslsgF-lsgG. The clones pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, and pGEMLOS-7 were originally shown by SDS-PAGE to produce modified LPS structures which added ∼1.4, 1.0, and 0.4-kDa moieties, respectively, to the ∼4.1-kDa E. coli core (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In more recent SDS-PAGE gels, the modified LPS was further resolved and no longer appears as a dominant single band (Fig. 2,top). Rather, the LPS appear to consist of several bands whose estimated sizes differ slightly from those reported originally (see legend, Fig. 2). When tested against two mAbs that recognizeH. influenzae epitopes, pGEMLOS-4 LPS reacted positively with mAb 6E4 (which recognizes a Kdo-related epitope in H. influenzae), and pGEMLOS-5 LPS reacted positively with mAb 3F11 (which recognizes the terminal disaccharide of lacto-N-neotetraose, Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc1→). The LPS from pGEMLOS-7, which contains the smallest modification, did not react with either antibody. Thus, the antibody recognition data and LPS size differences suggested that the lsg region contains a cluster of at least three genetic loci whose products sequentially modify H. influenzae LOS (16.Abu Kwaik Y. McLaughlin R.E. Apicella M.A. Spinola S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To confirm the chimeric nature of the pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, and pGEMLOS-7 LPS and identify H. influenzae epitopes being expressed, LPS from these clones and from the parent E. coli strain transformed with a plasmid lacking an insert (designated pGEM) were analyzed by various chemical and mass spectrometric methods as described below. In order to define better the molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of the chimeric LPS, we cloned the same plasmids as above plus plasmids containing only ORF lsgG and lsgF into strain 21548 which contains a Tn10 insertion in wecA(formerly rfe).

This enzyme complex catalyzes the reversible oxidation of CO to CO2 (Reaction 1). It also catalyzes the cleavage (or synthesis) of acetyl-CoA to (or from) a methyl group (methyltetrahydromethanopterin (CH3-H4MPT)), carbon monoxide, and Coenzyme A (Reaction 2). During acetyl-CoA cleavage, a methylcob(III)amide intermediate is formed on a corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (CFeSP), which is a component of the complex. Two related activities that the complex catalyzes are exchange reactions between free CO and the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA (Reaction 3) and between CoA and the CoA moiety of acetyl-CoA (Reaction 4).

It does not require a corrinoid protein or a methyltransferase, like Reaction 2. Furthermore, this exchange reaction does not involve net redox chemistry, since CO is at the same redox state as the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA. Reactions 2 and 3 include an intermediate metal-carbonyl species that is paramagnetic and has been called the NiFeC species (4.Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. Antholine W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6811-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Studies of this EPR signal led to the first discovery of a metal cluster in biology containing nickel and iron (4.Ragsdale S.W.

The acetyltransferase reaction between acetyl-CoA and free CoASH (Reaction 4) measures the ability of the enzyme to cleave and re-synthesize only the C–S bond.

The αε dimer contains one [Fe4S4] cluster (Cluster B) and a center called Cluster C, which appears to be a Ni-X-[Fe4S4] cluster (whereX is an unknown bridging ligand) and serves as the site of CO oxidation (13.Lu W.-P. Jablonski P.E. Rasche M. Ferry J.G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9736-9742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These clusters have very similar properties to those of Clusters B and C in the clostridial CODH subunit (14.Seravalli J. Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W.

The γδ dimer with one corrinoid and one [Fe4S4] cluster is involved in transfer of the methyl group of acetyl-CoA to H4MPT to form methyl-H4MPT (1.Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of the β subunit is controversial. Evidence suggests that the β subunit contains the molecular machinery to catalyze the first steps in acetyl-CoA utilization, the disassembly of acetyl-CoA to bound methyl, carbonyl, and CoA groups. The M. thermophila β subunit shares 42% sequence identity with the large α subunit (acsB) of the C. thermoaceticumenzyme (18.Maupin-Furlow J.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6849-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which harbors Cluster A, the site of acetyl-CoA synthesis (19.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11646-11647Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Xia J.Q. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, there is only 16% identity between the β subunit and the small subunit (acsA) of the acetogenic enzyme (18.Maupin-Furlow J.A. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6849-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the CODH/ACS complex is subjected to limited proteolysis, acetyl-CoA synthesis activity declines in parallel with loss of the intact β subunit; yet the truncated β subunit retains the ability to catalyze the CoA/acetyl-CoA exchange reaction (7.Bhaskar B. DeMoll E. Grahame D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14491-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, spectroscopic studies of an apparently purified αε dimer indicated that Cluster A is a component of this complex (13.Lu W.-P. Jablonski P.E. Rasche M. Ferry J.G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9736-9742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As reported here, the location of the acetyl-CoA cleavage site was investigated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and kinetic methods. Our results indicate that acetyl-CoA cleavage/synthesis site is located in the β subunit and that interaction between the αε dimer and the β subunit is necessary for breaking and forming the C–C bond of acetyl-CoA. Radioisotopes (63NiCl2and [1-14C]acetyl-CoA) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. M. thermophila TM1 cells were grown, harvested, and lysed as described (21.Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CODH/ACS complex was purified essentially as outlined by following the oxidation of CO to CO2 (21.Simianu M. Murakami E. Brewer J.M. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10027-10039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).M. thermophila cells were suspended into Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.6% Triton X-100, and 2 mm DTT) and were lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 did not affect the CODH/ACS activities and was needed for purification of heterodisulfide reductase from the same batch of cells. After ultracentrifuging at 32,000 rpm for 2 h, the cell-free extract was loaded on a Q-Sepharose high performance column (2.5 × 40 cm) and washed with Buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The CODH/ACS complex was eluted with a 0.1–0.8 m KCl linear gradient. The CODH/ACS complex fractions were pooled, diluted 3-fold with Buffer B (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT), and applied to a second Q-Sepharose HP column (2.5 × 15 cm). After washing the column with Buffer B containing 0.2 m KCl, the CODH/ACS complex was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.4m KCl. Fractions containing CODH activity were pooled, concentrated on a YM-30 membrane, and loaded on a Superose 6 column (2.5 × 60 cm). The CODH/ACS complex appeared to be homogeneous based on analysis by SDS-PAGE (11.25% polyacrylamide). The purified enzyme exhibited specific activities of CO oxidation and CO/acetyl-CoA exchange of 286 and 0.206 μmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. The CODH/ACS complex was labeled with radioactive nickel by adding 50 μCi of 63Ni (NiCl2) to 5 liters of media containing a total nickel concentration of 20 μm. Protein concentration was determined colorimetrically using a Rose Bengal dye-binding method (22.Elliott J.I. Brewer J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. CO oxidation activity was measured using methyl viologen as the electron acceptor (23.Clark J.E. Ragsdale S.W. Ljungdahl L.G. Wiegel J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 507-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity was assayed using [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (24.Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3970-3977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the components of the CODH/ACS complex, a cationic detergent, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), and Triton X-100 were added to the purified CODH/ACS complex to give final concentrations of 1.0 and 0.3%, respectively. After incubating at room temperature for 10 min and at 4 °C, the solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (2.5 × 15 cm). After washing with Buffer B containing 0.1% DTAB and 0.2 mKCl, the components were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.8m KCl in the same buffer. Limited proteolysis was performed by mixing purified CODH/ACS complex (final concentration of 25 mg/ml) with bromelain from pineapple stem (90% purity, Sigma catalog number B-5144, 8.8 units/mg protein, final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) in a solution containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 0.2m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mml-cysteine, and 10% glycerol. The ratio of the CODH/ACS complex to bromelain was 250:1 (w/w). To examine the effect of bromelain on the NiFeC EPR signal, both the CODH/ACS complex and bromelain solutions were preincubated with 1 atm CO. CODH/ACS complex (800 μl of 20 mg/ml) in Buffer B was mixed with α-chymotrypsin (Sigma catalog number C-3142) from bovine pancreas (37.5 μl of 10 mg/ml at 60 units/mg protein) at a ratio of the complex to chymotrypsin of 43:1 (w/w). The proteolysis reaction was quenched by adding 42.5 μl of 2 mg/ml soybean chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma catalog number T-9777) into 150 μl of the mixture at different times. The chymotrypsin inhibitor did not affect the NiFeC EPR signal, CO oxidation, or CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller (Oxford ITC4) and automatic frequency counter (Hewlett-Packard Co., model 5340A). Homology searches were performed using BLAST and PSI-BLAST (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58645) Google Scholar). CODH/ACS complex was isolated from M. thermophila cells grown with 63Ni. The purified complex contains 2.1 g atm of nickel per mol, assuming an αβγδε stoichiometry, in agreement with earlier measurements (2.Abbanat D.R. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3272-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine which subunit(s) contains nickel, the complex was treated with 1% DTAB and 0.3% Triton X-100 (conditions that dissociate the multiprotein complex (2.Abbanat D.R. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3272-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) and chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose HP column. Two radioactive peaks were observed (Fig.1). The first peak was highly enriched in the α and ε subunits, whereas the second peak contained a mixture of the β, γ, and δ subunits with traces of the α and ε subunits (Fig. 1, inset). The first peak contained 1.2 g atm of nickel per mol of the αε dimeric unit. Since the ε subunit does not contain metals, the nickel must be associated with the α subunit, as concluded earlier (2.Abbanat D.R. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3272-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The β subunit was further purified by pooling the fractions in the second peak and treating again with 1% DTAB and 0.3% Triton X-100. After diluting 5-fold, the enzyme solution was loaded on the Q-Sepharose HP column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.8 m KCl. The protein and63Ni radioactivity profiles obtained from SDS-PAGE analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Nickel was clearly associated with the pure β subunit; for example, fraction 16 contains highly purified β subunit with no apparent traces of the α subunit and 0.4 g atm of nickel per mol of β subunit. Apparently, some nickel was lost during the purification. Both Clusters A (4.Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. Antholine W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This spectrum has been assigned to a metal-carbonyl species at Cluster A, the active site of acetyl-CoA synthesis (19.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11646-11647Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, our objective was to identify the subunit that elicits this EPR signal. This would provide strong evidence that Cluster A and the acetyl-CoA cleavage activity are present on that subunit. When the salt concentration of the DTAB-treated CODH/ACS complex is decreased below 0.1 m KCl, the β, γ, and δ subunits precipitate (Fig. 3). Densitometric analysis of the intensities of the stained protein bands on the SDS-PAGE gel show that 95% of the β subunit and 60% of the γ and δ subunits had precipitated. EPR spectra were obtained at 80 K of the DTAB-treated samples that were incubated with CO. The NiFeC signal was observed for the DTAB-treated sample; however, the spin quantitation only yielded 0.01 spins/mol. In comparison, the CO-incubated complex that had not been treated with DTAB elicited 0.3 spins/mol. The congruence between the proportion of β subunit and NiFeC EPR signal indicates that Cluster A is located on this subunit. For the detergent-treated as-isolated sample in the absence of CO, a characteristic low spin Co2+ EPR signal of the CFeSP (31.Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was observed with a signal intensity amounting to 40% of that from the intact enzyme complex. These results agree with earlier studies demonstrating that the corrinoid is present in the δ subunit (31.Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32.Maupin-Furlow J. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 340-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Limited protease digestion dissociates the components of the M. barkeri CODH/ACS complex and cleaves the β subunit into two fragments (1.Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The isolated truncated β subunit retains the ability to catalyze an exchange reaction between CoA and acetyl-CoA but is unable to synthesize acetyl-CoA (1.Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CODH/ACS complex was treated with chymotrypsin at a ratio of 43:1 (CODH/chymotrypsin, w/w) to dissociate the complex and truncate the β subunit. The protease reaction was quenched at different times by adding chymotrypsin inhibitor, which we found to quench rapidly the protease reaction without adversely affecting the NiFeC EPR signal, CO oxidation, or the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity. The NiFeC EPR signal (Fig. 4), SDS-PAGE-stained protein patterns (Fig.5), and CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity of samples quenched at different times after chymotrypsin treatment were measured (Fig. 6). The CO oxidation activity was not affected by the chymotrypsin treatment over the time course followed. The shape of the NiFeC signal underwent a marked change in morphology. The peak at g = 2.08 decreased, and the peak at g = 2.05 increased at the same rate constant of 0.16 min−1 (Figs. 4 and 6). This modified signal was first observed in N-bromosuccinimide-inhibited ACS (33.Shanmugasundaram T. Ragsdale S.W. Wood H.G. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and has been called the “pseudo NiFeC signal” (34.Xia J.Q. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 483-484Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Essentially all of the NiFeC signal was converted to the “pseudo” form within 1 h of reaction with chymotrypsin, but the total spin concentration did not change significantly, even after 24 h. At approximately the same rate that the EPR signal changed, the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity decayed (0.11 min−1) and the β subunit underwent degradation (0.08 min−1) (Fig.6 B).Figure 5Effects of chymotrypsin on the CODH/ACS complex. The CODH/ACS complex was treated with chymotrypsin.Lane 1, native CODH/ACS complex; lanes 2–6 show samples quenched 1, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min after chymotrypsin addition, respectively. 7 μg of protein was loaded in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Comparison among NiFeC EPR signal, CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity, and SDS-PAGE band intensity.

B,CO/acetyl-CoA exchange rates (●) and relative SDS-band intensities of the β subunit to the α subunit (β/α) in Fig. 8 (▴) were plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western hybridization analysis was performed using an antibody specific to the β subunit. The decrease in band intensity at the position of the β subunit matches the SDS-PAGE results described above. This band disappeared at the same rate as the NiFeC EPR signal intensity and the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity (data not shown). Western analysis allowed us to follow degradation of the β subunit. These results are fully consistent with those reported earlier (1.Grahame D.A. DeMoll E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8352-8358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the peptides produced overlaps with the δ subunit (58 kDa), which explains why the intensity at the position of the δ subunit increases with time of chymotrypsin treatment (see Fig. 5). A smaller fragment (26 kDa) also was observed. The first 10 amino acids of the 26-kDa cleavage product were sequenced and perfectly matched the N-terminal sequence of the β subunit. These results strongly support the concept that the acetyl-CoA cleavage/synthesis site is associated with the β subunit. We examined the effect of bromelain, another protease, on the integrity of Cluster A. The CODH/ACS enzyme complex was digested with bromelain in the presence of CO, and aliquots of the reaction were freeze-quenched in liquid nitrogen at different times. Unfortunately, we were unable to use bromelain inhibitor to quench the reaction because it alone degraded the β subunit (data not shown). For each time point, the NiFeC EPR signal was measured; SDS-PAGE was performed, and the EPR and SDS-PAGE band patterns were compared (Fig.7). Whereas the chymotrypsin treatment converted the EPR signal from the NiFeC to the pseudo form, bromelain treatment led to the disappearance of the EPR signal. The degradation of the β subunit and the loss of NiFeC signal intensity followed the same time course, indicating that the EPR signal arose from the β subunit. Since it is known that the NiFeC signal derives from a CO adduct of Cluster A (34.Xia J.Q. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 483-484Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35.Ragsdale S.W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results bolster the hypothesis that the acetyl-CoA cleavage/synthesis site is associated with the β subunit. In C. thermoaceticum, Clusters A and C and their related acetyl-CoA synthase and CO oxidation activities are also located on separate subunits (19.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11646-11647Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Xia J.Q. Lindahl P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37.Anderson M.E. DeRose V.J. Hoffman B.M. Lindahl P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12204-12205Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As described above, limited proteolysis of the CODH/ACS complex leads to alteration or loss of the EPR signal derived from Cluster A and to loss of acetyl-CoA synthesis activity. To determine if the activity loss results from damage to the β subunit or to separation of the components, the enzyme complex was treated with DTAB in the presence of 0.2 m KCl. At higher salt concentrations, the components of the complex do not precipitate. DTAB treatment has no effect on the CO oxidation activity, demonstrating that Cluster C is unaffected by the DTAB treatment. On the other hand, DTAB treatment results in loss of the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity and conversion of the NiFeC EPR signal to the pseudo form. Surprisingly, more than 40% of the CO/acetyl-CoA exchange activity recovers, and the standard NiFeC signal returns after removing the detergent from the solution by extensive ultrafiltration (Fig. 8). Thus, the DTAB treatment is reversible. These results suggest that an association between the β subunit and another component of the complex is required for CO/acetyl-CoA exchange and, therefore, for acetyl-CoA cleavage or synthesis. It has been clear since 1984, when the first methanogenic CODH was isolated from M. barkeri (38.Krzycki J.A. Zeikus J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that CO oxidation activity resides in a complex of the α and ε subunits. In the acetogenic system, this activity is located in the β subunit (acsA) (19.Kumar M. Lu W.-P. Liu L. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11646-11647Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39.Anderson M.E. DeRose V.J. Hoffman B.M. Lindahl P.A. J. Inorgan. Biochem. 1993; 51 (Abstract B149)Google Scholar), which has high sequence homology to the methanogenic α subunit (cdhA) (18.Maupin-Furlow J.A. Ferry J.G. J.

More important, 200 μm trifluoperazine, a concentration 10-fold less than that required for light-chain removal, resulted in the reversible elimination of actin-activated and intrinsic ATPase activities. Unlike desensitization induced by metal ion chelation, which leads to an elevation of activity in the absence of calcium concurrent with regulatory light-chain removal, trifluoperazine caused a decline in actin-activated MgATPase activity both in the presence and absence of calcium.

Increased α-helicity could be induced in the isolated essential light chain through addition of 100–200 μm trifluoperazine.

The structure of the TFP·calmodulin complex in the presence of calcium has been determined at 2.45-Å resolution (4.Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R.

Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). This effect was accomplished when a single TFP molecule bound to the predominant binding site, a hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal domain (4.Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15259-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additional TFP-binding sites are apparent when the TFP concentration is raised (5.Vandonselaar M. Hickie R.A. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Recently, TFP-binding sites on the related calcium-binding protein troponin C have also been identified (8.Kleererkoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Myosin light chains belong to the same large family of calcium-binding proteins as calmodulin, to which they display a similar overall structure (9.Persechini A.

A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There are two types of light chain, termed regulatory (R-LC) and essential (E-LC); one member of each type binds to each of the two heads of conventional myosin II. In those regulatory myosins that are activated directly by calcium binding (for review, see Ref. 11.Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Chantler P.D. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. II. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1994: 506-528Google Scholar), the exact relationship of the heavy chain to the light chains, in the presence of calcium, is now known in detail, the structure of the regulatory domain of scallop myosin having first been established at 2.8-Å resolution (12.Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and then refined to 2.0-Å resolution (13.Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Solution studies (14.Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicate that TFP can bind to the isolated light chains: measurements of the circular dichroism indicated half-maximal binding of TFP with a dissociation constant in the range of 14–50 μm, the binding of which resulted in a significant change in secondary structure consistent with an increase in α-helical content, whereas EPR spectroscopy detected binding at sites of lower affinity with half-maximal effects yielding dissociation constants in the range of 370–800 μm.The removal of R-LCs from scallop myosin through chelation of metal ions is a well known phenomenon (15.Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Szentkiralyi E.M. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 16.Kendrick-Jones J. Szentkiralyi E.M. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 747-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), complete dissociation being achieved in a reversible manner at elevated temperatures (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18.Chantler P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the same treatment has proven ineffective when applied to smooth muscle and other myosins (11.Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Chantler P.D. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. II. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1994: 506-528Google Scholar). Recently, TFP was shown to facilitate both R-LC exchange and R-LC dissociation from smooth muscle myosin (19.Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20.Yang Z. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to see whether or not TFP would prove effective at R-LC removal from scallop myosin. Here, we demonstrate that TFP in the millimolar range can remove R-LCs from scallop myosin. However, unlike the ensuing loss of regulation that accompanies metal ion chelation, brought about through anelevation of actin-activated MgATPase in the absence of calcium (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), TFP binding results in a monotonous decline in actin-activated MgATPase both in the presence and absence of calcium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the loss of regulation brought about by TFP occurs at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those required to effect R-LC dissociation. These results are discussed in the light of current structural knowledge: we formulate a hypothesis suggesting that TFP may act by interfering with the conformational relay mechanism operating through the interface between the C-terminal lobe of E-LC and regions of the heavy chain, thereby fixing the “off-state” of scallop myosin.DISCUSSIONThe selective and total dissociation of R-LC from scallop myosin by TFP treatment (Fig. 1) is reminiscent of R-LC removal from scallop myosin as a consequence of 10 mm EDTA treatment at elevated temperatures (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing concentrations of TFP gave rise to a decline in actin-activated MgATPase in the presence of calcium (Figs. 2 and 3), superficially also similar to the effect of R-LC loss through metal ion chelation (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the effects of TFP and EDTA on scallop myosin are not the same and differ from each other in several ways, as described below.Of fundamental importance are our observations of the effect of TFP on actin-activated MgATPase in the absence of calcium: the inhibited state of intact scallop myosin. In the case of R-LC removal through divalent cation chelation, a biphasic rise in this ATPase activity as a function of R-LC loss was observed (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18.Chantler P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), providing insight into the cooperative nature of regulatory myosins. By contrast, TFP treatment of scallop myosin or myofibrils led to a monotonic decline in actin-activated MgATPase (−Ca2+) (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, the sensitivity of actin-activated MgATPase activity to TFP took place over a concentration range an order of magnitude lower than that required to elicit R-LC removal (compare Figs. 1 cand 2). In both the presence and absence of calcium, 50% inactivation of actin-activated myosin MgATPase occurred at 100–150 μm TFP, and full inactivation was achieved at 300 μm TFP (Fig. 2), whereas R-LC removal began only at TFP concentrations >500 μm, with full dissociation being achieved at 3.0 mm TFP (Fig. 1). These effects were reversible at 200 μm TFP (Table I).TFP-induced removal of R-LC was specific, with no E-LC being lost during treatment (Fig. 1). When scallop R-LC was removed totally by EDTA treatment prior to TFP addition, E-LC removal remained refractory to TFP treatment, although some small losses (<5%) did occur (data not shown). Such losses are consistent with data suggesting that prior R-LC removal destabilizes E-LC attachment to the myosin heavy chain (21.Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29.Ashiba G. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6618-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For smooth muscle myosin, a combined treatment of 5–10 mm TFP and 4.5 m ammonium chloride facilitates E-LC exchange and even complete removal of both R-LCs and E-LCs (21.Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,30.Katoh T. Numata T. Konishi K. Furuya K. Yazawa M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). E-LC exchange, in the absence of R-LC removal, has been shown to occur through the action of 1 mm TFP on permeabilized smooth muscle cells (31.Matthew J.D. Khromov A.S. Trybus K.M. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31289-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).It is significant that the incremental addition of TFP to EDTA-desensitized myofibrils was just as effective at attenuating actin-activated MgATPase as the addition of TFP to intact myofibrils (Fig. 3). TFP also inactivated actin-activated S-1 MgATPase (Table II), analogous to its effect on myosin (Fig. 2) and myofibrils (Fig. 3). Whereas complete removal of R-LCs by EDTA treatment does not impair the K+EDTA-ATPase of scallop myosin (17.Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), TFP treatment does cause a significant decline in this indicator of active-site function, with <35% activity remaining at 250 μm TFP (Fig. 4), a concentration where inhibition of actin-activated MgATPase was complete. It is not clear as to why these profound effects of TFP on activity and regulation were not apparent in earlier studies (32.Kerrick W.G.L. Hoar P.E. Cassidy P.S. Bolles L. Malencik D.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) measuring tension development in chemically skinned scallop muscle fibers in the presence of TFP.Although calcium binding was impaired somewhat by TFP treatment (Fig.5), >75% calcium-specific binding remained at 150 μmTFP, a concentration where actin-activated MgATPase was >50% inactivated and where no loss of R-LC had occurred. Although this relationship between calcium binding and actin activation is expected for heavy meromyosin, myosin should exhibit nearly 100% activity at this level of calcium binding (26.Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); that it does not do so is indicative of an inhibitory effect by TFP above and beyond its effect on calcium binding. At 500 μm TFP, only 40–50% calcium-specific binding remained in the case of scallop myosin, whereas calcium-specific binding to Ca·Mg·S-1 remained unimpaired (Fig. 5). This result emphasizes the functional dislocation of regulation from activity in scallop Ca·Mg·S-1, a molecule in which regulatory capability is completely impaired (15.Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Szentkiralyi E.M. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 179-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 33.Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15834-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Scallop Ca·Mg·S-1 is also known to be more refractory to EDTA-induced dissociation of R-LC as compared with the two-headed myosin structure (24.Stafford W.F. Szentkiralyi E.M. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5273-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).From the above results, it is clear that the effects of TFP binding are manifest over two distinct concentration ranges, indicative of at least two different sets of binding sites. Whereas 300 μm TFP is required to eliminate actin activation and regulation (50% inactivation at 100–150 μm TFP), 3000 μmTFP is required to remove R-LCs (50% inactivation at 1300–1600 μm TFP). Spectroscopic studies on TFP binding to skeletal muscle myosin light chains in solution have demonstrated the presence of two types of TFP-binding site, differing in affinity by at least an order of magnitude. Measurements of the far-UV CD spectra indicated that TFP elicited increases in helical content with half-maximal effects at ∼20–50 μm TFP for LC1 and LC3 and ∼14 μm for LC2 (14.Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By contrast, paramagnetic spin probes attached to the same light chains exhibited a change in rotational correlation time upon TFP addition, the effect being half-maximal at ∼370–809 μm TFP, an order of magnitude higher than the CD results (14.Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, through far-UV CD analysis (Fig. 6), we have confirmed that micromolar concentrations of TFP have a direct effect in inducing an increase in α-helicity in isolated scallop E-LC; the effect is maximal by ∼100 μm. The higher affinities of the two sets of TFP-dependent transitions determined from spectroscopic data on isolated light chains as compared with the two ranges of TFP concentration required for the two different functional results obtained here on scallop myosin may reflect the fact that functional effects can be assessed on only the multichain structure.TFP binding to the hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal lobe of E-LC would appear to be the most likely cause of ATPase inactivation. There is a monotonic decline in actin-activated MgATPase (±Ca2+) that is complete at 300 μm TFP, and prior removal of R-LC by EDTA still permits TFP inactivation of the desensitized myosin and exhibits the same concentration dependence (Fig. 3), suggesting that the heavy chain·E-LC complex can be induced to attain this extreme inhibited state. Also, TFP can induce, directly, a conformational change in isolated E-LC (Fig. 6). In the stoichiometric TFP·calmodulin complex, the hydrophobic tricyclic ring of TFP localizes to a hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin, entrapping TFP·calmodulin in the same conformation as that seen when calmodulin binds to a target peptide substrate (4.Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15259-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6.Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal lobes of scallop R-LC and E-LC exhibit semi-open conformations, in contrast to the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin, which displays a fully open conformation (10.Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the required hydrophobic pocket remains available, albeit less deeply placed (Fig.7, a and b). Of the 12 residues directly involved in TFP binding within the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin (4.Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15259-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), 7 are identical to sequences found within eitherArgopecten irradians (27.Goodwin E.B. Leinwand L.A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or Pecten maximus (34.Janes D. Patel H. Chantler P.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 80Google Scholar) E-LC, and another two represent conservative replacements; furthermore, the spatial configuration of these residues appears to be conserved (Fig. 7, a and b). This places TFP within the hydrophobic pocket located between the two domains of the C-terminal lobe of E-LC (Fig. 7 b).Currently, crystal structures of myosin heads from two regulatory myosins are available: the chicken smooth muscle myosin motor domain·E-LC complex, crystallized in the presence of MgADP·AlF4− or MgADP·BeFxto 3.5- and 3.6-Å resolution, respectively (35.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar); and scallop (A. irradians) S-1, crystallized in the presence of MgADP to 2.5-Å resolution (36.Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These are very different structures (Fig. 7,c and d). With respect to the chicken smooth muscle myosin structure (35.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), the G-helix within the TFP-binding lobe of E-LC abuts the motor domain close to the 25/50-kDa loop (Ala198–Lys204) (Fig. 7 c), a region of the heavy chain implicated as a major determinant in the rate of ADP release (37.Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38.Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Additionally, other surface loop structures (Met140–His147, Ser163–Asp170, and Phe256–Tyr261 in the chicken smooth muscle myosin structure (35.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar)) are capable of interaction with this TFP-binding lobe of E-LC. By contrast, within the scallop MgADP·S-1 structure (36.Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the TFP-binding lobe of E-LC abuts the motor domain close to the N terminus (especially Ala45–Lys60) (Fig.7 d) within the so-called SH3 domain, which has been suggested to limit the potential swing of the lever arm (35.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This region of contact is close to the heavy-chain region (Glu21–Asn29) found in the nucleotide-free skeletal myosin structure (42.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar), where it abuts the F-helix within the C-terminal domain of E-LC (as described (35.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar)). Although crystallized in the presence of MgADP, the point is well made (36.Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) that scallop MgADP·S-1 may be considered to be in an ”ATP-like“ or pre-power stroke state; consequently, this structure is classified as being in the weak binding state. Here, too, the F-helix of E-LC makes contact with heavy-chain residues, located within an α-helix close to the N terminus (Fig. 7 d) (36.Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). If the conformational off-state locked by TFP corresponds to either of the above structures (Fig. 7,c and d), it can be seen that TFP will bind at a key location along alternative sequential conformational relays that carry information from the triggering site within the N-terminal domain of E-LC, via the C-terminal lobe of E-LC, to the ATP-binding pocket. We speculate that the interface between the 25/50-kDa loop and E-LC is most likely to participate in the off-state (as seen in Fig.7 c) because the 25/50-kDa loop is known to be a major determinant of the rate of ADP release (37.Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38.Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7517-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the rate-limiting state in the absence of calcium is likely to be a weak binding ADP·Pi intermediate (45.Marston S.B. Lehman W. Nature. 1974; 252: 38-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 46.Jackson A.P. Bagshaw C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), not an ATP-like structure. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis through both structural and functional means. However, it is unlikely that either structure, alone, can account for all features of regulation, two heads being required (26.Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43.Kalabokis V.N. Vibert P. York M.L. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Our results may also suggest that different mechanisms for the control of the off-state exist in regulatory myosins controlled either by direct calcium binding or through phosphorylation. Although the triggers are very different (calcium binds to scallop myosin E-LC (12.Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,47.Fromherz S. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7652-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) whereas phosphorylation occurs on smooth muscle myosin R-LC (48.Sellers J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)), conventional wisdom has been that the conformational sequelae of the two triggering mechanisms rapidly converge toward a common pathway in these conserved structures to facilitate full activation at the active site. However, smooth muscle heavy meromyosin lacking E-LC (LC17), produced through overexpression of recombinant baculovirus, exhibited a 75% reduction in the rate of displacement of actin filaments, yet this movement remained phosphorylation-dependent (49.Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, smooth muscle myosin lacking LC17, produced through R-LC (LC20) readdition to light chain-depleted myosin, had reduced rates of superprecipitation and actin-activated MgATPase, yet these activities remained phosphorylation-dependent (21.Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If, as our results suggest, E-LC is vital for maintenance of the off-state, it is unlikely that regulated activity could remain in the absence of E-LC. Consequently, in addition to distinct triggering mechanisms, these two forms of myosin-linked regulation may also exhibit different conformational relays between their respective triggering sites and the active site.In summary, we have shown that TFP has a dual effect on scallop myosin. Application of millimolar concentrations of TFP leads to dissociation of R-LC from scallop myosin. However, concentrations of TFP an order of magnitude lower than those required to displace R-LCs can eliminate the actin-activated MgATPase activity of scallop myosin, irrespective of the presence and absence of calcium. This occurs in a manner that is independent of the presence or absence of R-LC. Furthermore, TFP can directly affect the conformation of E-LC; comparison with calmodulin indicates that the putative binding site is conserved. The exact manner by which this inhibited state is maintained remains to be determined, but we hypothesize that this structure closely mimics the off-state of a regulatory myosin, which has, so far, eluded structural analysis. Trifluoperazine (TFP),1a member of the phenothiazine class of drugs, is one of the strongest antagonists of calmodulin action known, capable of binding to calmodulin in the presence of calcium and preventing its stimulatory effects (1.Levin R.M. Weiss B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 581-589PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Prozialeck W.C. Weiss B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1982; 222: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Roufogalis B.D. Minocherhomjee A.M.

The structure of the TFP·calmodulin complex in the presence of calcium has been determined at 2.45-Å resolution (4.Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R.

The AS oligos were covalently closed to avoid exonuclease activities by enzymatic ligation of two identical molecules. The AS oligos of a ribbon type (RiAS oligos) consist of two loops containing multiple antisense sequences and a stem connecting the two loops. Three antisense sequences targeting different binding sites were placed in a loop that was designed to form a minimal secondary structure by itself. RiAS oligos were found to be stable because they largely preserved their structural integrity after 24 h incubation in the presence of either exonuclease III or serums. When a human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, was treated with RiAS oligos to c-myb, c-mybexpression was effectively ablated. Cell growth was inhibited by >90% determined by both the 3-[4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and [3H]thymidine incorporation.

Synthetic AS oligos have been widely utilized for the ease of design and synthesis as well as for potential specificity to genes that cause disease. Inhibition of gene expression is believed to be achieved through either RNaseH activity following formation of DNA-mRNA duplex or steric hindrance of binding of a ribosomal complex (11.Dolnick B.J. Cancer Invest. 1991; 9: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There has also been an effort to inhibit gene expression by employing oligos forming triple helix or duplex oligo decoy aimed at or competing with the promoter region of genomic DNA (12.Young S.L.

Efficacy of AS oligos has been validated in animal models as well as several recent clinical studies (13.Offensperger W.B. Offensperger S. Walter E. Teubner K. Igloi G. Blum H.E. Gero W.

It is also encouraging that the first antisense drug was recently approved for cytomegalovirus retinitis in the United States and Europe. Expectation for AS oligos has, however, frequently met with disappointment because results have not always been unambiguous. Salient problems for AS oligos have been inaccessibility to a target site (17.Flanagan W.M. Wagner R.W. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 172: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Matsuda M.

Stability of AS oligos has been improved to a certain extent by either using modified oligos or adopting a structure resistant to exonucleases (19.Akhtar S. Kole R. Juliano L. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20.Wagner R.W. Matteucci M.D. Lewis J.G. Gutierrez A.J. Moulds C. Froehler B.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Modified oligos such as phosphorothioate and methylphosphonate oligos were utilized to augment stability against nucleases. However, each of the modified oligonucleotides exhibited problems of its own,i.e. lack of sequence specificity and insensitivity to RNaseH. Further, there is apprehension for recycling of hydrolyzed modified nucleotides. In another effort to enhance stability of AS oligos, a stem-loop structure was reported to be effective in targetting mRNA of Syk kinase (18.Matsuda M. Park J.G. Wang D. Hunter S. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protooncogene c-myb plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic cells exhibit differential expression of c-myb and show little expression of the gene when differentiated to term (5.Melotti P. Calabretta B. Blood. 1996; 87: 2221-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ferrai S. Donelli A. Manfredini R. Sarti M. Roncaglia R. Tagliafico E. Rossi E. Torelli G. Torelli U. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). c-myb has often been found to be overexpressed in leukemic cells. Blockage of c-myb expression by AS oligos inhibited growth of a promyelocytic cancer cell line HL-60 and a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 (2.Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1992; 79: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the AS oligos used in the experiments were reported to be partially effective, inhibiting tumor cell growth by about 50–60%. c-myb AS oligos employed for the experiments were either phosphodiester oligos or phosphorothioate capped oligos (2.Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These AS oligos were not truly stable, especially the phosphodiester oligos, possibly explaining the partial antisense effect. In the present study, we devised AS oligos with enhanced stability and antisense effect without problems associated with modified AS oligos. A combination of three antisense sequences to c-myb was adopted to construct a large antisense molecule with a loop and stem. Two of the AS oligos were enzymatically joined to form ribbon-type antisense (RiAS) oligos. c-myb RiAS oligos were studied for stability and for growth inhibition of leukemic cell lines. Leukemic cell lines, HL-60 (promyelocyte leukemic cell line) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemic cell line), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin (100 unit/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Routine cell culture practices were strictly followed to maintain proper cell density and to avoid culturing cells more than five generations after thawing stock vials. Culture media were exchanged a day before treating with AS oligos. Target sites for AS oligos were selected for eight different regions of c-mybmRNA. The method for rational target site search was described previously by us (18.Matsuda M. Park J.G. Wang D. Hunter S. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Simulation of secondary structures was carried out with the DNAsis program (Hitach Software, San Bruno, CA). The entire c-myb sequence was scanned sequentially for secondary structure formation in contiguous frames of 100 bases. Frames for the simulation of secondary structures were then staggered down by 30 bases, resulting in an overlap of 60 bases on the 5′ side of the next set of downstream frames. Therefore, any given sequence was scanned for its potential secondary structure in three different frames. Eight sequences with a minimal secondary structure (duplex formation) were selected (Fig. 1). Among the eight selected target sites, three sites were further chosen as antisense sequences to the selected site form a minimal intramolecular secondary structure when placed in a single molecule. Three antisense sequences in the AS oligos are as follows: 5′-GCTTTGCGATTTCTG-3′ (c-myb site; 613–627), 5′-CTTCATCATTATAGT-3′ (961–977), and 5′-ACCGTATTTAATTTC-3′ (1545–1559). Oligos were either made by us or purchased from the Life Technologies, Inc. c-myb AS oligos (MIJ-78) and control scrambled oligos were phosphorylated at the 5′ end. Sequences of the 58-mer MIJ-78 and scrambled oligos are 5′-(p)GATCCGCGCTTCATCATTATAGTACCGTATTTAATTTCGCTTTGCGATTTCTGGCGCG-3′ and 5′-(p)GATCCGCGTCTTACACTATTGATGCACTTATATATGTTTCTGCTATGTGTCTGCGCG-3′, respectively. Both MIJ-78 and scrambled (SC) oligos were anticipated to form a stem-loop structure. The stem is formed by complementary sequences at both ends of each oligo. The 5′ terminus of the stem has 4 bases of a single-stranded sequence of 5′-GATC-3′. Two MIJ-78 molecules were joined by the complementary 4 base sequences at both 5′ ends. MIJ-78 molecules were mixed and heated to 85 °C for 2 min followed by gradual cooling to the room temperature. One unit of T4 DNA ligase was added and incubated for 24 h at 16 °C to generate a covalently ligated molecule with diad symmetry. RiAS oligos consist of two loops and one stem connecting the two loops. Each loop contains three different antisense sequences. A combination of three antisense sequences with the least possible secondary structure was chosen, because the AS oligos were expected to bind to target sites more readily. RiAS oligos were electrophoresed on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and examined for their resistance to exonuclease III as well as for gel retardation. Two of the linear scrambled oligos were also covalently combined to form a ribbon type control oligo, which was denoted SC oligo for convenience. Thermal denaturation of AS oligos was performed in a solution of 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm sodium PIPES (Sigma). AS oligos of 0.2 μmwere heated to 95 °C and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature prior to denaturation experiments. Melting studies were carried out in 1-cm-pathlength quartz cells on a Varian Cary 5G UV-visible NIR spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia) equipped with a thermo-programmer. Absorbance at 260 nm was monitored at every 2 °C increment, whereas temperature was raised from 10 to 96 °C. To test stability of AS oligos, 1 μg each of the nonligated phosphodiester oligos (MIJ-78) and c-myb RiAS oligos were incubated with either human serum, FBS, calf serum, exonuclease III, or S1 nuclease. All serums were used without heat inactivation to preserve DNase activity. Each serum was added to oligos to 50% in a 100-μl reaction volume and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Exonuclease III (Takara, Otsu, Japan) at 160 units/μg oligos was added to oligos and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. S1 nuclease (Takara) at 10 units/μg oligos was added to oligos and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The oligos were then extracted with phenol and chloroform and were examined on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cells (HL-60 and K562) were fed with fresh culture medium without antibiotics (RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS) 1 day prior to adding oligos and washed twice with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) prior to an experiment. Cell density was adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/ml, and the cell suspension was aliquoted in 100 μl each in a 48-well plate (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ). Cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of AS oligos combined with 0.8 μg of LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Lipofectin was added to a tube containing 30 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. Oligos (0.2 μg of oligos in 30 μl of Opti-MEM) were added to a tube containing liposomes and mixed to form the oligo-liposome complex for 15 min. 60 μl of oligo-liposome complex was added to cells. Cells treated with oligos were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 h. Cells were then added with 100 μl of Opti-MEM with 10% FBS and incubated further at 37 °C for 24 h before assay. Total RNA was isolated with TripureTM Isolation Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells harvested were added with 0.4 ml of Tripure reagent, 10 μg of glycogen, and 80 μl of chloroform to obtain total RNA. RT-PCR was performed in a single reaction tube with AccessTM RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI). In a PCR tube were added RNA, PCR primers, avian myeloblast virus reverse transcriptase (5 units/μl),Tfl DNA polymerase (5 units/μl), dNTP (10 mm, 1 μl), and MgSO4 (25 mm, 2.5 μl). Synthesis of the first strand cDNA was done at 48 °C for 45 min in a DNA thermal cycler (Hybaid, Teddinton, United Kingdom). Twenty cycles of PCR amplification were subsequently carried out with the recommended conditions by the manufacturer. Amplified PCR product was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel, and quantification was done with a gel documentation program (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. DNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (New England Biolabs) for 4 h in 0.4 mNaOH. The membrane was hybridized with a 30-mer internal primer (5′-TGTAACGCTACAGGGT ATGGAACATGACTG-3′) labeled with the ECL 3′ end oligo-labeling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out at 62 °C for 60 min in 6 ml of buffer containing 5× SSC, 0.02% SDS. The membrane was washed twice in 5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and washed again twice with 1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 58 °C for 15 min. The membrane was blocked with a blocking solution and then treated with anti-fluorescein horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 30 min before autoradiography. Total cellular proteins prepared from cells were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with a mouse monoclonal IgG2aκ antibody specific for mouse and human Myb (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was used in the secondary incubation, followed by detection of reactive bands by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Growth inhibition of leukemic cells was measured with three methods, MTT assay, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and colony formation on soft agarose. For the MTT assay, HL-60 cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM and aliquoted in a 96-well plate (5 × 103 cells/well) in a 50-μl volume. Cells were treated with preformed complex of oligos (0.2 μg/15 μl) and Lipofectin (0.6 μg/15 μl) for 5 h and cultured for 5 days. Cells were then harvested in a 100-μl volume and added with 20 μl (100 μg) of the MTT reagent (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma), followed by 4 h incubation at 37 °C. An equal volume of isopropanol containing 0.1 nHCl was added to the cells and incubated for one more hour at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader to score the amount of cells that survived. The percentage of growth inhibition was calculated by the following formula: percentage of growth inhibition = [1 − (absorbance of an experimental well/absorbance of a sham-treated control well)] × 100. For [3H]thymidine incorporation, HL-60 cells were treated with AS oligos as described above. Cells were added with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (2.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 16 h in triplicate. Cells were then harvested on a glass microfiber filter (GF/C Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK). The filter was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then 5% trichloroacetic acid and absolute ethanol. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured by a liquid scintillation counter in a mixture solution containing toluene, Triton X-100, 2,5-diphenyloxazole, and 1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazoly)]benzene (percentage of growth inhibition = [1 − (cpm of an experimental well/cpm of a sham-treated control well)] × 100). Colony formation on soft agarose was determined as follows. An equal volume of 0.8% low melting agarose (in double distilled H2O) and 2× RPMI 1640 containing 20% FBS were added to transfected cells. The mixture was then placed in a 6-well plate to solidify. The plate was cooled to 4 °C for 5 min and incubated for 15 days. Colonies containing more than 20 cells were scored as positive. All determinations were made in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by using the Student'st test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be of statistical significance. Oligos modified with phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate exhibit improved stability, but the gain in stability is only partial and bears the potential hazard of misincorporation of hydrolyzed modified nucleotides during DNA replication or repair. We previously reported stem-loop oligos combined with cationic liposomes with partial improvement of stability (18.Matsuda M. Park J.G. Wang D. Hunter S. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because stability of AS oligos still remains a major concern, our goal was to develop improved AS oligos with better stability. It has been reported that exonuclease activity constitutes most of the nuclease activity in the cytoplasm and serum (19.Akhtar S. Kole R. Juliano L. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To avoid exonuclease activity, two identical AS oligos of stem-loop structure (MIJ-78) were enzymatically ligated to form a ribbon-typed molecule termed RiAS oligo. The RiAS oligos (116-mer) consist of two loops containing antisense sequences and one stem connecting the two loops. The stem was designed to harbor a restriction site for BamHI in the middle junction to help confirm covalent ligation of two antisense molecules (Fig. 2). Three antisense sequences were placed in tandem to increase the length of the loop. Consequently, two sets of three different antisense sequences (total of six antisense sequences) were placed in a RiAS oligo. This enlarged length (45 nucleotides) of the loop in RiAS oligos was necessary to have effective antisense activity as a loop with less than 30 nucleotides was not active (result not shown). RiAS oligos were found to be slowed markedly compared with MIJ-78 (linear precusor) on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. BamHI was able to cut RiAS oligos, generating two 58-mer oligos (Fig.3 A). RiAS oligos were, as expected, resistant to exonuclease III and were observed as a major band (116-mer) on gel electrophoresis. In contrast to RiAS oligos, MIJ-78 was completely degraded after 2 h of incubation with exonuclease III (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate the covalent closure of RiAS oligos. We further examined molecular characteristics of RiAS oligos employing two different approaches to confirm the stem loop structure of RiAS oligos. The oligos were incubated with S1 nuclease, which digests a single-stranded loop region in a DNA molecule. The stem of RiAS oligos was the only region found to be protected from S1 nuclease, shown as a DNA band of 12–14 bases on a denaturing gel (Fig. 3 C). The presence of a stem in RiAS oligos was examined again by measuring the melting temperature. When absorbance at 260 nm was monitored for RiAS oligos while temperature was raised, a typical chromatic change was detected around 84 °C, indicating the denaturation of a duplexed stem region. When the melting temperature of RiAS oligos was compared with that of MIJ-78, RiAS oligos showed a higher melting temperature than MIJ-78, 84 °Cversus 68 °C (Fig. 4). These results support the concept that RiAS oligos are indeed a ribbon-shaped molecule with a stem and two loops.Figure 3Electrophoretic mobility patterns of RiAS oligos. A, oligos were analyzed on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Lane 1, 58-mer MIJ-78 molecules;lane 2, 116-mer RiAS oligos were formed by ligation of two MIJ-78 molecules; lane 3, RiAS oligos were restriction digested by BamHI.

Oligos were treated with 50% human serum, FBS, or calf serum for 24 h. Linear 58-mers were completely hydrolyzed after 24 h of incubation in the presence of each serum (Fig.5 A). RiAS oligos, however, remained largely intact after 24 h of incubation with these different serums, exhibiting significantly improved stability compared with the linear AS oligos (Fig. 5 B). We next examined whether RiAS oligos function well in eliminating target mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. HL-60 cells were transfected with c-myb RiAS oligos and SC oligos, as well as Lipofectin alone. c-myb RiAS oligos were delivered into cells after forming a complex with Lipofectin. The RiAS oligos (0.1 or 0.2 μg) were combined with 0.8 μg of Lipofectin for transfection into HL-60 cells. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells and c-myb message was amplified by RT-PCR. RiAS oligos at 0.2 μg (28 nm) were able to completely ablate c-myb mRNA. In addition, 0.1 μg (14 nm) of c-myb RiAS oligos decreased about 70% of c-mybmRNA (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, SC oligos exhibited only a mild reduction of c-mybmRNA when compared with Lipofectin treatment alone. However, β-actin expression shown in the bottom panel was not affected by the treatment of c-myb RiAS oligos. The antisense effect of c-myb RiAS oligos was examined again by Southern blotting of the PCR product. c-myb message amplified by RT-PCR was detected with a labeled internal hybridization oligos (30-mer) (Fig. 6 B). The results confirmed that the amplified message was indeed c-myb-derived, with the total elimination of the message by treatment with 0.2 μg (28 nm) of c-myb RiAS oligos. Myb proteins were also shown to be largely eliminated by c-myb RiAS oligos. In contrast, Myb proteins were only slightly reduced when cells were treated with the control SC oligos (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that RiAS oligos are effective in ablating target mRNA even when used in lesser doses. c-myb plays an important role in the proliferation of leukocytes. AS oligos to c-myb have been reported to block leukemic cell growth preferentially (2.Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). c-myb RiAS oligos were tested for their ability to inhibit leukemic cell growth. A leukemic cell line, HL-60, was treated with 0.2 μg of c-myb RiAS oligos or SC oligos combined with 0.6 μg of Lipofectin or with Lipofectin alone. Cells were incubated for 5 days and subjected to an MTT assay to determine the index of cell growth. Cell growth was observed to be inhibited by 91 ± 4% with c-myb RiAS oligos (p < 0.001) (Fig.7 A). In contrast, SC oligos and Lipofectin alone did not significantly inhibit cell growth when compared with that of the sham-treated control. These results indicate that c-myb RiAS oligos are an effective antisense agent for inhibition of leukemic cell growth. Growth inhibition of leukemic cells was also measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. c-myb RiAS oligos (0.2 μg) inhibited cell growth by 93 ± 2% (p< 0.001) compared with the sham-treated control, whereas SC oligos and the liposome control did not significantly inhibit cell growth (Fig.7 B). On a microscopic observation, after treatment with c-myb RiAS oligos, HL-60 cell growth was markedly inhibited when compared with cells treated with SC oligos and Lipofectin alone (Fig. 8). Inhibition of tumor cell growth was also examined for colony formation on soft agarose. K562 was employed for colony formation on soft agarose because the cells form colonies readily and distinctively. Cells transfected with c-myb RiAS oligos were seeded in 0.4% agarose and incubated for 15 days before scoring for colonies formed. c-myb RiAS oligos were able to reduce the number of colonies formed by 92 ± 2% (p < 0.001) when compared with sham-treated controls (TableI). In contrast, SC oligos and Lipofectin alone failed to demonstrate any significant reduction of colonies.Table IEffects of c-myb RiAS-oligos on colony formation of K562 cellsOligosSizeNumber of coloniesColonies formedanumber of colonies (oligo­treated)number of colonies (sham­treated control)×100mer%RiAS oligos1167.6 ± 1.5bmean ± standard deviation of three experiments.,cp < 0.001 versus sham-treated control.7.8SC oligos11690.5 ± 2.192.1Lipofectin™ alone91.3 ± 4.192.9Sham-treated control98.3 ± 4.0100.0K562 cells were treated with different oligos for 24 h, and the cells were seeded on a 0.4% LMP-agarose gel.

Colonies in controls (Lipofectin alone or sham-treated) are shown in the bottom two lines. In the present study, we devised novel RiAS oligos to improve stability against nucleases. RiAS oligos contain two sets of three antisense sequences without an open end, allowing multiple targeting of a target mRNA or targeting more than one mRNA. RiAS oligos were observed to be exceptionally stable in the presence of serum. c-myb RiAS oligos were also noted to be effective in ablating c-myb mRNA and in blocking leukemic cell growth. In many antisense studies, a region encompassing the translational start site has been adopted for a target site (2.Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Ratajczak M.Z. Hijiya N. Catani L. DeRiel K. Luger S.M. McGlave P. Gewirtz A.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a quartet of G residues is found in the 3′ side of the translational start codon of c-myb mRNA. Because there has been some controversy over the nonspecific effect of these G residues (24.Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), this region was avoided as a target site. To date, antisense to c-myb have been studied in phosphodiester or phosphorothioate oligo forms as well as in expressed antisense molecules (25.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). That RiAS oligos contain a covalently closed molecule with loops is supported by both resistance of the whole molecule to exonuclease III and resistance of the stem region to S1 nuclease. The data from the S1 nuclease assay also showed the presence of a stem in RiAS oligos, and the result was reinforced by the detection of a typical melting temperature curve obtained with RiAS oligos. That the melting temperature of RiAS oligos at 84 °C was 16 °C higher than that of MIJ-78 (68 °C) demonstrates the enhanced thermal stability of RiAS oligos and is in agreement with similar data obtained with nicked or closed duplex molecules (26.Rubin E. Rumney S. Wang S. Kool E.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3547-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The merits of RiAS oligos other than their exceptional stability include the following: 1) RiAS oligos have a better chance to find a target site because they contain three different antisense sequences, 2) RiAS oligos can bind to multiple targets, either many sites on the same molecule or multiple molecules, and 3) RiAS oligos may be used in a smaller quantity because the molecule is much more stable and can avoid sequence independent side effects. In a RiAS oligo, two AS oligo molecules are joined together in a fashion of diad symmetry, negating the need for a ligation primer. When c-myb RiAS oligos were added to HL-60 and K562 cells at a concentration of 0.2 μg/ml (28 nm), the level of c-myb mRNA as well as colony formation was markedly reduced. In other reports, much greater amounts of AS oligos ranging from 20 to 200 μg/ml have been used to obtain biological effects that might not be entirely sequence-dependent (2.Melani C. Rivoltini L. Parmiani G. Calabretta B. Colombo M.P. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2897-2901PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 4499-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). AS oligos have been modified to enhance stability against nucleases. Two modified oligos that have been frequently used are phosphorothioate and methylphosphonate oligos. These oligos were shown to be more stable than regular phosphodiester oligos but had only a partial gain in stability (29.Akhtar S. Kole R. Juliano L. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorothioate oligos have nonspecific activity, and methylphosphonate oligos have low solubility and show poor sensitivity to RNaseH (30.Furdon P.J. Dominski Z. Kole R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9193-9204Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). RiAS oligos would be expected to have normal sequence-specificity and susceptibility to RNaseH activity because the oligos bear no modified oligo at the present structure. Additional potential merit of RiAS oligos is that it is unlikely to introduce undesired mutations in the genomic DNA during DNA replication or repair upon recycling of hydrolyzed nucleotides. We used cationic liposomes to enhance the cellular uptake of RiAS oligos. From the experience of our own and other groups, a meaningful level of AS oligo uptake should be consistently obtainable when carried into cells by liposomes, regardless of the size of AS oligos (31.Capaccioli S. Pasquale G.D. Mini E. Mazzei T. Quattrone A. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 818-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32.Williams S.A. Chang L. Buzby J.S. Suen Y. Cairo M.S. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1980-1989PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the relatively large size of RiAS oligos should not pose a problem for efficient cellular uptake. In conclusion, RiAS oligos are found to have a markedly enhanced stability and excellent sequence-specific antisense effect. We have some desirable preliminary data from other RiAS oligos against other gene targets and are also examining synergistic effects of RiAS oligos targeted oncogenes with anti-neoplastic chemical drugs. RiAS oligos require studies on biological effects, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in vivo. They may provide a novel therapeutic modality for human disorders in which inhibition of gene expression would be advantageous."

Amines are analogs of substrate water and inhibitors of oxygen evolution. Recently, the covalent incorporation of 14C from [14C]methylamine and benzylamine into PSII subunits has been demonstrated (Ouellette, A. J. A., Anderson, L. B., and Barry, B. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2204–2209). To obtain more information concerning these labeling reactions, t-[14C]butylamine and phenylhydrazine were employed as probes. Neither compound can be oxidized by a transamination or addition/elimination mechanism, but both can react with activated carbonyl groups, produced as a result of posttranslational modification of amino acid residues, to give amine-derived adducts. 14C incorporation into the PSII subunits D2/D1 and CP47 was obtained upon treatment of PSII with eithert-[14C]butylamine or [14C]phenylhydrazine. For t-butylamine and methylamine, the amount of labeling increased when PSII was treated with denaturing agents. Labeling of CP47, D2, and D1 with methylamine and phenylhydrazine approached a one-to-one stoichiometry, assuming that D2 and D1 each have one binding site. Evidence was obtained suggesting that reductive stabilization and/or access are modulated by PSII light reactions. These results support the proposal that PSII subunits D2, D1, and CP47 contain quinocofactors and that access to these sites is sterically limited.

PSII consists of hydrophobic and extrinsic subunits and contains chlorophyll, plastoquinone, manganese, and several other bound cofactors. Water oxidation occurs at a manganese-containing catalytic site located on the lumenal side of the membrane. After photoexcitation, the primary chlorophyll donor, P680, transfers an electron from its excited state to a pheophytin molecule. Pheophytin transfers the electron to a quinone acceptor molecule, QA, which in turn reduces a second quinone acceptor, QB (reviewed in Refs. 1.Barry B.A. Boerner R.J. de Paula J.C. Bryant D.

Recently, the covalent incorporation of14C-labeled primary amines into PSII subunits has been observed under reducing conditions (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Evidence for oxidation of [14C]benzylamine by PSII was obtained by detection and quantitation of [14C]benzaldehyde (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because PSII exhibits this amine oxidation activity and an aldehyde product has been observed, covalent incorporation of 14C from labeled primary amines into PSII subunits could be caused by two possible reactions (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the first possible reaction, addition of reductant traps a Schiff base complex of substrate (14C-labeled amine) and an amino acid side chain that has been posttranslationally modified to contain an activated carbonyl group (13.Ouellette A.J.A.

In the second possible reaction, addition of reductant traps a Schiff base complex of product (14C-labeled aldehyde) and the amino group of a lysine side chain (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When formaldehyde is produced, this reaction produces mono- and dimethylated lysines under reducing conditions (Ref. 16.Means G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and references therein). Other types of modification reactions with formaldehyde are also possible (16.Means G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we have employed14C-labeled compounds, which would not be expected to form a [14C]aldehyde product through a transamination reaction but can bind to posttranslationally modified amino acid residues, containing activated carbonyl groups.

Fatty acid-free BSA was purchased from Sigma. [14C]Methylamine (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and [14C]BSA (specific activity, 12.5 μCi/mg) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [14C]Phenylhydrazine (specific activity, 2.65 mCi/mmol) was obtained from California Bionuclear Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). t-[14C]Butylamine (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Morevek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). A monoclonal antibody against spinach CP47 was a generous gift from Prof. T. Bricker (18.Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll assays and O2evolution assays were performed by methods described previously (19.Barry B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PSII membranes (PSII-1) were isolated from spinach by the method of Berthold et al. (20.Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) with the following modifications (as suggested by Refs. 21.Ghanotakis D.F. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Spinach was homogenized at 4 °C in a medium containing 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 2 mg/ml BSA. After filtration through four layers of cheesecloth, the homogenate was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then resuspended in Triton buffer (15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0). A Triton X-100 stock solution was made up at 25% (w/v) in Triton buffer. This stock solution was added dropwise to the resuspended pellet during shaking on ice in the dark. The final chlorophyll concentration was 2 mg of chl/ml, and the ratio of Triton X-100 to chl was 2.5 mg of Triton/mg of chl. Shaking on ice was continued in the dark for 30 min. The suspension was immediately centrifuged at 47,800 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in SMN buffer (400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0) and centrifuged at 47,800 ×g for 30 min. Finally, PSII membranes were resuspended in SMN buffer to a final concentration of 3–5 mg chl/ml and stored at −70 °C. The steady-state rate of oxygen evolution was in the range of 800–1000 μmol of O2/mg of chl-h. PSII-2 samples were generated by salt washing to remove the 24- and 18-kDa proteins and other extrinsic subunits (23.Miyao M. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 725: 87-93Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PSII-3 samples were generated by depletion of manganese, MSP, and other extrinsic subunits (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All PSII samples were chloride-depleted by resuspending three times in a buffer containing 400 mm sucrose and 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. Binding experiments were performed under room light as described previously (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The incubation time, prior to protein denaturation, was 4 h for t-butylamine, 4 h or 30 min for methylamine, and 30 min for phenylhydrazine. In some experiments, methylamine was added during or after protein denaturation. The protein sample was denatured by the addition of denaturing buffer, giving final concentrations of 2.7 m urea, 2.1% SDS, and 52 mmNa2CO3. In some experiments, DTT was added as an exogenous reductant to give a final concentration of 62 mm. The order of addition of buffer components was varied in some experiments; each addition was followed by incubation at room temperature as shown in Fig. 1. Experiments carried out in the light were performed under 4 μE/m2-s of fluorescent bulb-derived room illumination. Some experiments were carried out in the dark; in this case, incubations, additions, and SDS-PAGE were all performed in light intensities less than or equal to 0.7 μE/m2-s, and the available illumination was green-filtered. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the modified Neville method (24.Piccioni R. Bellemare G. Chua N. Edelman H. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier, Amsterdam1982: 985-1014Google Scholar). Gels were run in duplicate. One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (25.Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: 114-116Google Scholar). The contents of the other gel were transferred to Immobilon PSQ transfer membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) using a TE70 Semi Phor semidry transfer unit (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Transfer buffer, pH 8.8, contained 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS, and 20% methanol. The amount of protein remaining in each gel lane after the transfer procedure was visualized by Coomassie staining. The percent protein transferred ranged from 63 to 95%. There was no observed, statistical correlation between the percentage protein transferred and the amount of 14C detected (data not shown). Phosphorimages were obtained by scanning phosphor screens with a Storm 840 scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immobilon membranes were exposed to the phosphor screens for 3–27 days. Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics) was used to scan Coomassie-stained gels. Images were quantitated using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). To correct for variations in background, the number of counts/pixel in the background was averaged from several positions in the image. This average background was subtracted from the number of counts/pixel retained by 14C-labeled protein subunits. The number of counts/pixel, retained by protein subunits, was found to be linearly related to exposure time (data not shown). Data were then normalized to the number of counts/pixel for fatty acid-free BSA, which was run on each gel as a negative control. The number of counts/pixel retained by BSA, treated by methods 2 and 4 (Fig. 1), was averaged. Ratioing to BSA corrects for variation in background caused by nonspecific binding of 14C-labeled compounds to proteins and for variations in exposure time. Finally, values were averaged over multiple experiments, and standard errors were calculated. For Western analysis, Immobilon membranes were blocked with TBS (20 mm Trizma-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 137 mm NaCl) containing 5% low-fat dried milk for 2.5 h and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody to CP47. The incubation time was 1 h. The membrane was rinsed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), three times with 15-min incubations, and then twice with 5-min incubations. The incubation time in TBS-T with the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, Bar Harbor, ME) was 1 h. The membrane was washed again as described above. Chemilumenescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and x-ray film (Kodak) were used for detection. We have previously shown that PSII-3, which lacks manganese, MSP, and other extrinsic subunits, incorporates14C from [14C]benzylamine and [14C]methylamine into the PSII subunits CP47 and D2/D1 (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PSII-1, which retains manganese and these subunits, did not carry out these reactions. This difference was attributed to increased access to posttranslationally modified amino acids at the active site, which are normally inaccessible. This interpretation was supported by data showing that removal of the 18- and 24-kDa extrinsic subunits alone (generating PSII-2), is sufficient to allow 14C labeling to occur, in the absence of Cl− (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These subunits are known to influence the access of reductants to the catalytic site (for example, see Ref. 26.Tamura N. Radner R. Lantz S. Cammarata K. Cheniae G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 369-379Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these experiments, SDS-PAGE and fluorography were used to visualize the labeled subunits (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results of a similar experiment employing the more sensitive phosphorimaging method are presented in Fig. 2. In this binding assay, PSII-1, PSII-2, and PSII-3 were incubated for 4 h in the presence of [14C]methylamine. Urea, SDS, and DTT were added simultaneously (method 4, Fig. 1) to the samples; these are the conditions employed in our previous studies (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred from the gel to Immobilon PSQ. The resulting phosphorimage (Fig.2) confirms that significant14C labeling of CP47 and D2/D1 subunits occurred in PSII-2 and PSII-3 samples under these conditions (lanes 2 and3). 14C incorporation into PSII-3 is increased by a factor of 2 when compared with the amount of 14C incorporated into PSII-2 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and3) and increased by a factor of 12 when compared with the background amount of 14C retained by PSII-1 (comparelanes 1 and 3). As a positive control, AO, which is known to contain a topaquinone quinocofactor (27.Janes S.M. Mu D. Wemmer D. Smith A.J. Kaus S. Maltby D. Burlingame A.L. Klinman J.P. Science. 1990; 248: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), was also included in the experiment (Fig. 2, lane 4). The expected incorporation of 14C into monomeric AO subunits was observed (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14.Hartmann C. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 962-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control, fatty acid-free BSA was employed (Fig. 2, lane 5). As expected, there was no significant incorporation of 14C label into BSA. In Fig. 3,A–C, we present the results of an order of addition experiment (Fig. 1) employing methylamine. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on PSII-3, which was treated by each of the four methods shown in Fig. 1. In each method, methylamine was added to PSII-3, and the sample was incubated for 30 min under room illumination. In Fig. 3,A–C, lane 1, urea and SDS (denaturants) were added to the methylamine-containing PSII-3 sample. The PSII-3 sample was then incubated. No exogenous, chemical reductant (DTT) was added (method 1, R-NO). In Fig. 3, A–C, lane 2, urea and SDS were added to the methylamine-containing PSII-3 sample, the sample was incubated, and the reductant, DTT, was added second (method 2, R-2nd). In Fig. 3, A–C, lane 3, DTT was addedfirst, the methylamine-containing PSII-3 sample was incubated, and urea and SDS were added (method 3, R-1st). In Fig. 3,A–C, lane 4, urea, SDS, and DTT were addedsimultaneously (method 4, SIM), and the PSII-3 sample was incubated. In Fig. 3, A and C, lane 5,as a negative control, a PSII-1 sample was treated by method 4 (SIM). AO and fatty acid-free BSA were also included in the SDS-PAGE experiment (Fig. 3, A and C, lanes 6–9). In lanes 6 and 8, AO and BSA were treated by method 2 (R-2nd); in lanes 7 and 9, AO and BSA were treated by method 4 (SIM). The total treatment time for each method was 90 min (Fig. 1). As shown in a Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 3 A), this difference in the order of addition had no effect on the electrophoretic migration of AO and BSA (lanes 6–9). Most major PSII subunits were identifiable by their R Fvalues and molecular mass (see annotation, Fig. 3 A) and were unaffected as well (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–5). However, minor alterations in the R F values of some subunits were observed, especially when the PSII sample was not treated with DTT or treated with DTT following denaturation (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3–5). Many of these changes were observed between 40 and 50 kDa, which is the expected, apparent molecular mass for the CP47 subunit. Therefore, in order to identify the location of CP47 in Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2, Western analysis was performed. This assay employed a monoclonal antibody that had been raised against CP47. The results demonstrate, that despite minor alterations in the pattern of Coomassie labeling (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2), the R F of CP47 was not appreciably affected by the four different treatment methods (Fig.3 B). In Fig. 3 C, we present the results obtained when PSII-3 was treated with [14C]methylamine through the use of the four methods shown in Fig. 1. These data are representative of multiple SDS-PAGE experiments performed. Numerical data averaged from these experiments are also summarized in TableI. Overall, the amount of 14C labeling of PSII-3 was 8–240-fold the extent of 14C retained by the negative control, BSA (Table I), depending on the conditions employed. There was no significant difference in14C labeling when method 1 (Fig. 3 C, lane 1, R-NO) was compared with method 2 (lane 2, R-2nd) or when method 3 (lane 3, R-1st) was compared with method 4 (lane 4, SIM). Observed 14C labeling, when no chemical reductant was added, suggests that there may be another “endogenous” reductant produced by PSII under illumination, which competes effectively with DTT; this point is discussed in more detail below.Table I14 C labeling of PSII subunits and AOSubunitsMethylaminet-ButylaminePhenylhydrazineCP47 R-NO90.4 ± 27.110.7 ± 1.86.0 ± 4.2 R-2nd87.9 ± 15.815.8 ± 7.9 NDaND, not determined.

Treatment by method 3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 3) and method 4 (lane 4) caused an approximately 8–11-fold decrease (TableI) in the amount of 14C incorporated into CP47, when compared with methods 1 and 2. A 12–18-fold decrease in14C incorporation into D2/D1 subunits was also observed (Table I). This result suggests that DTT may slowly reduce a potential amine or aldehyde binding site and that this reduction may prevent binding of methylamine. In the 30-min, method 4 treatment, the extent of 14C incorporated into PSII-3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 4, SIM), was increased 6–8-fold when compared with 14C labeling of the negative control, PSII-1 (lane 5, SIM). This result was in qualitative agreement with the results of the experiment employing a 4-h incubation time with methylamine (Fig. 2), in which a 12-fold increase over PSII-1 was observed. Finally (Table I), the amount of14C incorporated into PSII-3 when method 3 (Fig. 3 C, lane 3, R-1st) or method 4 (lane 4, SIM) was employed was comparable to the amount of 14C incorporated into the positive control, AO (lanes 6 and 7). Although the order of addition had a dramatic effect on 14C labeling of PSII-3, no significant effect was observed on 14C incorporation into AO (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6 and 7) or BSA (lanes 8 and 9). Therefore, data from the BSA lanes were averaged in numerical analyses. Control experiments were performed to vary the time of incubation with methylamine before addition of denaturants (urea and SDS). No significant change in 14C labeling of PSII-3 subunits was observed when the incubation time was varied between 60 and 15 min (data not shown). PSII-2 treated by method 4 has been shown previously to give a different result (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Purified plastoquinone migrates at the dye front in this gel system (13.Ouellette A.J.A. Anderson L.B. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Increased 14C labeling near the dye front in Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2, may result from the interaction of plastoquinone and methylamine. Comparison of Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2, with lanes 3 and4 may imply that DTT slowly reduces plastoquinone and that plastoquinone reduction prevents methylamine binding. To assess whether an observed, slight increased retention of pigments in Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2, influenced the number of 14C counts retained, blots were washed with methanol. Methanol washing removed retained chlorophyll or carotenoid but did not reproducibly decrease the number of counts retained by PSII subunits (data not shown). To obtain more information about the conditions under which methylamine binding to PSII occurs, experiments were performed in which the amount of 14C binding was measured when methylamine was added before (R-NO), during (DEN+MA), and after (DEN//MA) protein denaturation (TableII). Experiments were conducted under room lights (Table II, light). In the first experiment, methylamine was added 30 min before denaturation, denaturant (urea-SDS) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min (Table II, R-NO, light). This is the same treatment as employed in method 1 (Table I, R-NO) except that the incubation time in the presence of denaturant was a total of 30 min instead of 1 h. Compared with the longer incubation times, this 30-min incubation decreased 14C labeling by a factor of approximately 1.8 (compare Table I, R-NO, and Table II, R-NO, light). This difference is attributable to the difference in denaturation time. In control experiments, the amount of14C labeling was shown to be linearly related to the time of incubation in the presence of denaturant, in the time range of 15–60 min (data not shown).Table II14 C labeling of PSII subunits from methylamineSubunitsLightDarkLight/darkCP47 R-NO50.0 ± 23.02.5 ± 0.4 NDaND, not determined.
