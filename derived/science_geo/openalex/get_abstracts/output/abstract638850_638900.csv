https://openalex.org/W2970280482,"Adipose tissue-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNAs (miRNAs) convey intercellular message signaling. The biogenesis of EV-miRNAs from perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and their roles in intercellular communication in response to obesity-associated inflammation have not yet been fully explored. By feeding mice a high-fat diet for 16 wk, we established obesity-associated, chronic low-grade inflammation in PVAT, characterized as hypertrophy of perivascular adipocytes, decreased adipogenesis, and proinflammatory macrophage infiltration. We show that PVAT-derived EVs and their encapsulated miRNAs can be taken up into vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vivo and in vitro. miR-221-3p is one of the highly enriched miRNAs in obese PVAT and PVAT-derived EVs. Transfer and direct overexpression of miR-221-3p dramatically enhances VSMC proliferation and migration. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α is identified as a miR-221-3p target in VSMC phenotypic modulation. Obese mice secrete abundant miRNA-containing EVs, evoking inflammatory responses in PVAT and vascular phenotypic switching in abdominal aorta of lean mice. Local delivery of miR-221-3p mimic in femoral artery causes vascular dysfunction by suppressing the contractile genes in the arterial wall. Our findings provide an EV-miR-221-3p-mediated mechanism by which PVAT triggers an early-stage vascular remodeling in the context of obesity-associated inflammation.-Li, X., Ballantyne, L. L., Yu, Y., Funk, C. D. Perivascular adipose tissue-derived extracellular vesicle miR-221-3p mediates vascular remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2971230697,"Genetic mutations in BRCA1, which is crucial for the process of DNA repair and maintenance of genomic integrity, are known to increase markedly the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Clinical genetic testing has been used to identify new BRCA1 variants; however, functional assessment and determination of their pathogenicity still poses challenges for clinical management. Here, we describe that CRISPR-mediated cytosine base editor, known as BE3, can be used for the functional analysis of BRCA1 variants. We performed CRISPR-mediated base-editing screening using 745 gRNAs targeting all exons in BRCA1 to identify loss-of-function variants and identified variants whose function has heretofore remained unknown, such as c.-97C>T, c.154C>T, c.3847C>T, c.5056C>T, and c.4986+5G>A. Our results show that CRISPR-mediated base editor is a powerful tool for the reclassification of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in BRCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2970786893,"Our aim was to study Brazilian consumer attitudes towards cell-based meat and related issues. From 408 respondents from Curitiba and 218 from Joinville, the majority was women with higher level of education; 65.2% and 70.2% frequently consumed meat and 50.7% and 50.9% would not stop eating meat; 81.6% and 82.6% had little or no knowledge about cell-based meat. After watching an explanatory video, 41.9% and 34.4% stated they would eat cell-based meat without restrictions; 24.5% and 23.9% stated they would try depending on conditionals. Overall, 63.6% declared they would eat cell-based meat; among vegetarians and vegans, 24% and 8% stated they would eat cell-based meat, with additional 25.0% and 27.0% stating “it depends”; thus, the major public for cell-based meat seems to be meat eaters. Animal welfare was the principal reason for considering not eating meat and a major benefit of cell-based meat. In conclusion, the majority of respondents would not stop eating meat; additionally, they would eat cell-based meat."
https://openalex.org/W2970622806,"Background This study aims to assess the decline in telomere length (TL) with age and evaluate effect modification by gender, chronic stress, and comorbidity in a representative sample of the US population. Methods Cross-sectional data on 7826 adults with a TL measurement, were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, years 1999–2002. The population rate of decline in TL across 10-year age categories was estimated using crude and adjusted regression. Results In an adjusted model, the population rate of decline in TL with age was consistent and linear for only three age categories: 20–29 (β = -0.0172, 95% CI: -0.0342, -0.0002), 50–59 (β = -0.0182, 95% CI: -0.0311, -0.0054) and 70–79 (β = -0.0170, 95% CI: -0.0329, -0.0011) years. The population rate of decline in TL with age was significantly greater for males and those with high allostatic load and a history of comorbidities. When the population rate of decline in TL was analyzed by gender in 10-year age bins, a fairly consistent yet statistically non-significant decline for males was observed; however, a trough in the rate was observed for females in the age categories 20–29 years (β = -0.0284, 95% CI: -0.0464, -0.0103) and 50–59 years (β = -0.0211, 95% CI: -0.0391, -0.0032). To further elucidate the gender difference observed in the primary analyses, secondary analyses were conducted with reproductive and hormonal status; a significant inverse association was found between TL and parity, menopause, and age at menopause. Conclusions TL was shorter with increasing age and this decline was modified by gender, chronic stress and comorbidities; individuals with chronic morbidity and/or chronic stress and females in their twenties and fifties experienced greater decline. Female reproductive factors, i.e., parity and menopause, were associated with TL."
https://openalex.org/W2970774692,"Vaccines remain one of the main tools to control infectious diseases in domestic livestock. Although a plethora of veterinary vaccines are on the market and routinely applied to protect animals against infection with particular pathogens, the disease in question often continues to persist, sometimes at high prevalence. The limited effectiveness of certain vaccines in the field leaves open questions regarding the required properties that an effective vaccine should have, as well as the most efficient vaccination strategy for achieving the intended goal of vaccination programmes. To date a systematic approach for studying the combined effects of different types of vaccines and vaccination strategies is lacking. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for modelling the epidemiological consequences of vaccination with imperfect vaccines of various types, administered using different strategies to herds with different replacement rates and heterogeneity in vaccine responsiveness. Applying the model to the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), which despite routine vaccination remains one of the most significant endemic swine diseases worldwide, we then examine the influence of these diverse factors alone and in combination, on within-herd virus transmission. We derive threshold conditions for preventing infection invasion in the case of imperfect vaccines inducing limited sterilizing immunity. The model developed in this study has practical implications for the development of vaccines and vaccination programmes in livestock populations not only for PRRS, but also for other viral infections primarily transmitted by direct contact."
https://openalex.org/W2971235103,"Radiotherapy induces immune-related responses in cancer patients by various mechanisms. Here, we investigate the immunomodulatory role of tumor-derived microparticles (TMPs)-extracellular vesicles shed from tumor cells-following radiotherapy. We demonstrate that breast carcinoma cells exposed to radiation shed TMPs containing elevated levels of immune-modulating proteins, one of which is programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). These TMPs inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity both in vitro and in vivo, and thus promote tumor growth. Evidently, adoptive transfer of CTLs pre-cultured with TMPs from irradiated breast carcinoma cells increases tumor growth rates in mice recipients in comparison with control mice receiving CTLs pre-cultured with TMPs from untreated tumor cells. In addition, blocking the PD-1-PD-L1 axis, either genetically or pharmacologically, partially alleviates TMP-mediated inhibition of CTL activity, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effects of TMPs in response to radiotherapy is mediated, in part, by PD-L1. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the tumor immune surveillance state in response to radiotherapy and suggest a therapeutic synergy between radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2971333480,"We investigated the effects of resolvin E (RvE) 1, RvE2, and RvE3 on IL-4- and IL-33-stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from house dust mite (HDM)-sensitized mice. We also investigated the role of RvE3 in a murine model of HDM-induced airway inflammation. In vitro, BMDCs from HDM-sensitized mice were stimulated with IL-4 and IL-33 and then treated with RvE1, RvE2, RvE3, or vehicle. RvE1, RvE2, and RvE3 suppressed IL-23 release from BMDCs. In vivo, RvE3 administrated to HDM-sensitized and challenged mice in the resolution phase promoted a decline in total numbers of inflammatory cells and eosinophils, reduced levels of IL-23 and IL-17 in lavage fluid, and suppressed IL-23 and IL-17A mRNA expression in lung and peribronchial lymph nodes. RvE3 also reduced resistance in the lungs of HDM-sensitized mice. A NanoBiT β-arrestin recruitment assay using human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed that pretreatment with RvE3 suppressed the leukotriene B4 (LTB4)-induced β-arrestin 2 binding to LTB4 receptor 1 (BLT1R), indicating that RvE3 antagonistically interacts with BLT1R. Collectively, these findings indicate that RvE3 facilitates the resolution of allergic airway inflammation, partly by regulating BLT1R activity and selective cytokine release by dendritic cells. Our results accordingly identify RvE3 as a potential therapeutic target for the management of asthma.-Sato, M., Aoki-Saito, H., Fukuda, H., Ikeda, H., Koga, Y., Yatomi, M., Tsurumaki, H., Maeno, T., Saito, T., Nakakura, T., Mori, T., Yanagawa, M., Abe, M., Sako, Y., Dobashi, K., Ishizuka, T., Yamada, M., Shuto, S., Hisada, T.

https://openalex.org/W2970051875,"Colorectal cancer is recognized as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Thus, there is ongoing search for potential new biomarkers allowing quicker and less invasive detection of the disease and prediction of the treatment outcome. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify colorectal cancer specific miRNAs expressed in cancerous and healthy tissue from the same patient and to further correlate the presence of the same miRNAs in the circulation as potential biomarkers for diagnosis. In the current study we detected a set of 40 miRNAs differentially regulated in tumor tissue when comparing with healthy tissue. Additionally, we found 8 miRNAs differentially regulated in serum of colorectal cancer patients. Interestingly, there was no overlap in miRNAs regulated in tissue and serum, suggesting that serum regulated miRNAs may be not actively secreted from colorectal tumor cells. However, four of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-21, miR-17, miR-20a and miR-32 represent the miRNAs characteristic for different tumor types, including breast, colon, lung, pancreas, prostate and stomach cancer. This finding suggests important groups of miRNAs which can be further validated as markers for diagnosis of tumor tissue and regulation of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2970261303,"Background Mobile accelerometry is a powerful and promising option to capture long-term changes in gait in both clinical and real-world scenarios. Increasingly, gait parameters have demonstrated their value as clinical outcome parameters, but validation of these parameters in elderly patients is still limited. Objective The aim of this study was to implement a validation framework appropriate for elderly patients and representative of real-world settings, and to use this framework to test and improve algorithms for mobile accelerometry data in an orthogeriatric population. Methods Twenty elderly subjects wearing a 3D-accelerometer completed a parcours imitating a real-world scenario. High-definition video and mobile reference speed capture served to validate different algorithms. Results Particularly at slow gait speeds, relevant improvements in accuracy have been achieved. Compared to the reference the deviation was less than 1% in step detection and less than 0.05 m/s in gait speed measurements, even for slow walking subjects (< 0.8 m/s). Conclusion With the described setup, algorithms for step and gait speed detection have successfully been validated in an elderly population and demonstrated to have improved performance versus previously published algorithms. These results are promising that long-term and/or real-world measurements are possible with an acceptable accuracy even in elderly frail patients with slow gait speeds."
https://openalex.org/W2969738398,"Background Lynch syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by constitutional pathogenic variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, leading to increased risk of colorectal, endometrial and other cancers. The study aimed to identify the incremental costs and consequences of strategies to identify Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer. Methods A decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of reflex testing strategies for identifying Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer taking the NHS perspective and a lifetime horizon. Model input parameters were sourced from various published sources. Consequences were measured using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000/QALY was used. Results Reflex testing for Lynch syndrome using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing was cost-effective versus no testing, costing £14 200 per QALY gained. There was uncertainty due to parameter imprecision, with an estimated 42% chance this strategy is not cost-effective compared with no testing. Age had a significant impact on cost-effectiveness, with testing not predicted to be cost-effective in patients aged 65 years and over. Conclusions Testing for Lynch syndrome in younger women with endometrial cancer using MMR immunohistochemistry and MLH1 methylation testing may be cost-effective. Age cut-offs may be controversial and adversely affect implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2971242247,"Prostate cancer metastases primarily localize in the bone where they induce a unique osteoblastic response. Elevated Notch activity is associated with high-grade disease and metastasis. To address how Notch affects prostate cancer bone lesions, we manipulated Notch expression in mouse tibia xenografts and monitored tumor growth, lesion phenotype, and the bone microenvironment. Prostate cancer cell lines that induce mixed osteoblastic lesions in bone expressed 5-6 times more Notch3, than tumor cells that produce osteolytic lesions. Expression of active Notch3 (NICD3) in osteolytic tumors reduced osteolytic lesion area and enhanced osteoblastogenesis, while loss of Notch3 in osteoblastic tumors enhanced osteolytic lesion area and decreased osteoblastogensis. This was accompanied by a respective decrease and increase in the number of active osteoclasts and osteoblasts at the tumor-bone interface, without any effect on tumor proliferation. Conditioned medium from NICD3-expressing cells enhanced osteoblast differentiation and proliferation in vitro, while simultaneously inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. MMP-3 was specifically elevated and secreted by NICD3-expressing tumors, and inhibition of MMP-3 rescued the NICD3-induced osteoblastic phenotypes. Clinical osteoblastic bone metastasis samples had higher levels of Notch3 and MMP-3 compared with patient matched visceral metastases or osteolytic metastasis samples. We identified a Notch3-MMP-3 axis in human prostate cancer bone metastases that contributes to osteoblastic lesion formation by blocking osteoclast differentiation, while also contributing to osteoblastogenesis. These studies define a new role for Notch3 in manipulating the tumor microenvironment in bone metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2970384297,"Introduction Eating breakfast has been proved to positively influence human health. However, evidence for the association between breakfast consumption and depressive symptoms is lacking, especially among young adults. The aim of this study was to determine whether breakfast consumption is associated with depressive symptoms among Chinese university students. Methods A cross-sectional study involving 10,174 undergraduate students (6,287 males and 3,887 females) was conducted in 2015. Breakfast consumption was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Zung self-rating depression scale (SDS) score. Three cut-off values of the SDS score (40, 45, and 50) were used to assess the severity of the depressive symptoms. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between the frequency of breakfast consumption and depressive symptoms. Results The mean SDS score was 37.1±8.0 in present study. In crude model, a higher frequency of breakfast consumption was primarily associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in all three SDS groups (p = 0.001, < 0.001, = 0.009 for SDS cut-off value 40, 45, and 50 points, respectively). These associations remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions A higher frequency of breakfast consumption was strongly associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese university students. These results corroborate the evidence that the habit of eating breakfast may be beneficial to mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2970810457,"Housing affordability (HA) is considered an important determinant of a country’s socioeconomic development and stability. However, its optimal measurement has remained a major concern worldwide. In recent decades, methodological development and researches on housing affordability measurement approaches (HAMA) have accelerated and continue to grow exponentially. Despite this intensive global development, very few attempts have been made to present the theoretical bases and track the developmental trends of these approaches. Thus, this study attempts to fill this literature gap and extend prior studies by exploring several alternatives of HAMA; with a focus on their methodological weaknesses. This paper highlights three emerging novel methodologies, which complement the relative strength of the conventional approaches. Findings suggest that the main research evidence which summarizes the weaknesses in the conventional measures is; their inability to incorporate sustainability features and over reliance on economic dimension. While the complexity of emerging methodologies, though deepen the overall understanding of multiple concerns that breed HA problems. But are less transparent, more data intensive, and their computation is very demanding, with a high tendency that their complex nature could weaken their uptake by researchers. This study raises concern over the nearly sole reliance on the conventional approaches in the reformations of policy instrument, despite their overwhelming weaknesses. It reiterates the need for reconsideration and offers new insight, but not conclusive information on better ways to conceptualize and measure HA."
https://openalex.org/W2899192297,"Water-quality monitoring in rivers often focuses on the concentrations of sediments and nutrients, constituents that can smother biota and cause eutrophication. However, the physical and economic constraints of manual sampling prohibit data collection at the frequency required to adequately capture the variation in concentrations through time. Here, we developed models to predict total suspended solids (TSS) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) concentrations based on high-frequency time series of turbidity, conductivity and river level data from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. We fit generalized-linear mixed-effects models with continuous first-order autoregressive correlation structures to water-quality data collected by manual sampling at two freshwater sites and one estuarine site and used the fitted models to predict TSS and NOx from the in situ sensor data. These models described the temporal autocorrelation in the data and handled observations collected at irregular frequencies, characteristics typical of water-quality monitoring data. Turbidity proved a useful and generalizable surrogate of TSS, with high predictive ability in the estuarine and fresh water sites. Turbidity, conductivity and river level served as combined surrogates of NOx. However, the relationship between NOx and the covariates was more complex than that between TSS and turbidity, and consequently the ability to predict NOx was lower and less generalizable across sites than for TSS. Furthermore, prediction intervals tended to increase during events, for both TSS and NOx models, highlighting the need to include measures of uncertainty routinely in water-quality reporting. Our study also highlights that surrogate-based models used to predict sediments and nutrients need to better incorporate temporal components if variance estimates are to be unbiased and model inference meaningful. The transferability of models across sites, and potentially regions, will become increasingly important as organizations move to automated sensing for water-quality monitoring throughout catchments."
https://openalex.org/W2970452662,"Although many studies have confirmed that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs: PBD-mI and LUC-n) can be used as feed additives, there are few reports of their use in ruminants. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of AMPs on ameliorating rumen fermentation function and rumen microorganisms in goats. Eighteen 4-month-old Chuanzhong black goats were used in a 60-day experiment (6 goats per group). Group I was used as the control and was fed a basal diet, the group II were fed the basal diet supplemented with 2 g of AMPs [per goat/day] and group III were fed the basal diet supplemented 3 g of AMPs [per goat/day], respectively. Rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 20 and 60 days. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes and ciliate protozoal 18S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from rumen samples. The amplicons were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Rumen fermentation parameters and digestive enzyme activities were also examined. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with AMPs increased the levels of the bacterial genera Fibrobacter, Anaerovibrio and Succiniclasticum and also increased the ciliates genus Ophryoscolex, but reduced the levels of the bacterial genera Selenomonas, Succinivibrio and Treponema, and the ciliate genera Polyplastron, Entodinium, Enoploplastron and Isotricha. Supplementation with AMPs increased the activities of xylanase, pectinase and lipase in the rumen, and also increased the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and total volatile fatty acids. These changes were associated with improved growth performance in the goats. The results revealed that the goats fed AMPs showed improved rumen microbiota structures, altered ruminal fermentation, and improved efficiency regarding the utilization of feed; thereby indicating that AMPs can improve growth performance. AMPs are therefore suitable as feed additives in juvenile goats."
https://openalex.org/W2971224528,"In this paper, from the practical point of view, we focus on modeling traumatic brain injury data considering different stages of hospitalization, related to patients’ survival rates following traumatic brain injury caused by traffic accidents. From the statistical point of view, the primary objective is related to overcoming the limited number of traumatic brain injury patients available for studying by considering different estimation methods to obtain improved estimators of the model parameters, which can be recommended to be used in the presence of small samples. To have a general methodology, at least in principle, we consider the very flexible Generalized Gamma distribution. We compare various estimation methods using extensive numerical simulations. The results reveal that the penalized maximum likelihood estimators have the smallest mean square errors and biases, proving to be the most efficient method among the investigated ones, mainly to be used in the presence of small samples. The Simulated Annealing technique is used to avoid numerical problems during the optimization process, as well as the need for good initial values. Overall, we considered an amount of three real data sets related to traumatic brain injury caused by traffic accidents to demonstrate that the Generalized Gamma distribution is a simple alternative to be used in this type of applications for different occurrence rates and risks, and in the presence of small samples."
https://openalex.org/W2971305263,"In people, colonization with Clostridioides difficile, the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, has been shown to be associated with distinct gut microbial features, including reduced bacterial community diversity and depletion of key taxa. In dogs, the gut microbiota features that define C. difficile colonization are less well understood. We sought to define the gut microbiota features associated with C. difficile colonization in puppies, a population where the prevalence of C. difficile has been shown to be elevated, and to define the effect of puppy age and litter upon these features and C. difficile risk. We collected fecal samples from weaned (n = 27) and unweaned (n = 74) puppies from 13 litters and analyzed the effects of colonization status, age and litter on microbial diversity using linear mixed effects models. Colonization with C. difficile was significantly associated with younger age, and colonized puppies had significantly decreased bacterial community diversity and differentially abundant taxa compared to non-colonized puppies, even when adjusting for age. C. difficile colonization remained associated with decreased bacterial community diversity, but the association did not reach statistical significance in a mixed effects model incorporating litter as a random effect. Even though litter explained a greater proportion (67%) of the variability in microbial diversity than colonization status, we nevertheless observed heterogeneity in gut microbial community diversity and colonization status within more than half of the litters, suggesting that the gut microbiota contributes to colonization resistance against C. difficile. The colonization of puppies with C. difficile has important implications for the potential zoonotic transfer of this organism to people. The identified associations point to mechanisms by which C. difficile colonization may be reduced."

Secondary prevention to reduce mortality through improved clinical case management has substantially lowered the mortality rate for severe dengue during the past two decades. Gallbladder wall thickening (GBWT) is a nonspecific finding often associated with more severe cases of dengue infection. This study had the aim to describe the ultrasonographic findings in hospitalized patients with dengue infection from Manaus (in the Western Brazilian Amazon) and to correlate the GBWT with dengue severity, symptoms and laboratorial analysis. Patients from 13–84 years admitted to the emergency department at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) were enrolled in this study. Patients’ selection occurred during the most recent and huge dengue outbreak within the first semester of 2011. All enrolled subjects were systematically tested in order to rule out other possible etiologies for gallbladder inflammation. Abdominal ultrasound was performed by a single physician through bedside portable equipment and all other clinical and laboratorial information were retrieved from patients’ electronic files. 54 subjects were considered for analysis, with confirmed dengue infection by NS1 and/or RT-PCR positivity. From all enrolled patients, 50 (42.4%) presented GBWT. GBWT was significantly and independently related to: age under 31 years, pregnancy, presence of bleeding, presence of any cavitary effusion, DHF classification and severe dengue classifications. During dengue outbreaks, the GBWT identification through a non-invasive and bedside procedure is a confident marker for prompt recognition of potential severe cases."
https://openalex.org/W2971291990,"Leaf senescence plays an important role in the improvement of maize kernel yields. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of leaf senescence in maize are largely unknown. We isolated ZmVQ52 and studied the function of ZmVQ52 which encoded, a VQ family transcription factor. ZmVQ52 is constitutively expressed in maize tissues, and mainly expressed in the leaf; it is located in the nucleus of maize protoplasts. Four WRKY family proteins—ZmWRKY20, ZmWRKY36, ZmWRKY50, and ZmWRKY71—were identified as interacting with ZmVQ52. The overexpression of ZmVQ52 in Arabidopsis accelerated premature leaf senescence. The leaf of the ZmVQ52-overexpression line showed a lower chlorophyll content and higher senescence rate than the WT. A number of leaf senescence regulating genes were up-regulated in the ZmVQ52-overexpression line. Additionally, hormone treatments revealed that the leaf of the ZmVQ52-overexpressed line was more sensitive to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), and had an enhanced tolerance to abscisic acid (ABA). Moreover, a transcriptome analysis of the ZmVQ52-overexpression line revealed that ZmVQ52 is mainly involved in the circadian pathway and photosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2971152814,"Chronic atherosclerosis may cause cerebral hypoperfusion and inadequate brain oxygenation, contributing to the progression of cognitive decline. In this study, we exploited two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy to measure the absolute partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in cortical tissue in both young and old LDLR-/-, hApoB100+/+ mice, spontaneously developing atherosclerosis with age. Capillary red-blood-cell (RBC) speed, flux, hematocrit and capillary diameter were also measured by two-photon imaging of FITC-labelled blood plasma. Our results show positive correlations between RBC speed, flux, diameter and capillary-adjacent tissue PO2. When compared to the young mice, we observed lower tissue PO2, lower RBC speed and flux, and smaller capillary diameter in the old atherosclerotic mice. The old mice also exhibited a higher spatial heterogeneity of tissue PO2, and RBC speed and flux, suggesting a less efficient oxygen extraction."
https://openalex.org/W2970151399,"Kidneys are composed of numerous ciliated epithelial tubules called nephrons. Each nephron functions to reabsorb nutrients and concentrate waste products into urine. Defects in primary cilia are associated with abnormal formation of nephrons and cyst formation in a wide range of kidney disorders. Previous work in Xenopus laevis and zebrafish embryos established that loss of components that make up the Wnt/PCP pathway, Daam1 and ArhGEF19 (wGEF) perturb kidney tubulogenesis. Dishevelled, which activates both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway, affect cilia formation in multiciliated cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the noncanoncial Wnt/PCP components Daam1 and ArhGEF19 (wGEF) in renal ciliogenesis utilizing polarized mammalian kidney epithelia cells (MDCKII and IMCD3) and Xenopus laevis embryonic kidney. We demonstrate that knockdown of Daam1 and ArhGEF19 in MDCKII and IMCD3 cells leads to loss of cilia, and Daam1’s effect on ciliogenesis is mediated by the formin-activity of Daam1. Moreover, Daam1 co-localizes with the ciliary transport protein Ift88 and is present in cilia. Interestingly, knocking down Daam1 in Xenopus kidney does not lead to loss of cilia. These data suggests a new role for Daam1 in the formation of primary cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2970283456,"Objective Aseptic loosening (AL) is the most frequent long-term reason for revision of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) affecting about 15–20% patients within 20 years after the surgery. Although there is a solid body of evidence about the crucial role of inflammation in the AL pathogenesis, scared information on inflammation signature and its time-axis in tissues around TKA exists. Design The inflammation protein signatures in pseudosynovial tissues collected at revision surgery from patients with AL (AL, n = 12) and those with no clinical/radiographic signs of AL (non-AL, n = 9) were investigated by Proximity Extension Assay (PEA)-Immunoassay and immunohistochemistry. Results AL tissues had elevated levels of TNF-family members sTNFR2, TNFSF14, sFasL, sBAFF, cytokines/chemokines IL8, CCL2, IL1RA/IL36, sIL6R, and growth factors sAREG, CSF1, comparing to non-AL. High interindividual variability in protein levels was evident particularly in non-AL. Levels of sTNFR2, sBAFF, IL8, sIL6R, and MPO discriminated between AL and non-AL and were associated with the time from index surgery, suggesting the cumulative character of inflammatory osteolytic response to prosthetic byproducts. The source of elevated inflammatory molecules was macrophages and multinucleated osteoclast-like cells in AL and histiocytes and osteoclast-like cells in non-AL tissues, respectively. All proteins were present in higher levels in osteoclast-like cells than in macrophages. Conclusions Our study revealed a differential inflammation signature between AL and non-AL stages of TKA. It also highlighted the unique patient’s response to TKA in non-AL stages. Further confirmation of our preliminary results on a larger cohort is needed. Analysis of the time-axis of processes ongoing around TKA implantation may help to understand the mechanisms driving periprosthetic bone resorption needed for diagnostic/preventative strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2970340545,"Treatment guidelines differ in their recommendation to determine baseline resistance associated substitutions (RAS) before starting a first-line treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Here we analyze the efficacy of DAA treatment with baseline RAS information. We conducted a prospective study involving 23 centers collaborating in the GEHEP-004 DAA resistance cohort. Baseline NS5A and NS3 RASs were studied by Sanger sequencing. After issuing a comprehensive resistance report, the treating physician decided the therapy, duration and ribavirin use. Sustained virological response (SVR12) data are available in 275 patients. Baseline NS5A RAS prevalence was between 4.3% and 26.8% according to genotype, and NS3 RASs prevalence (GT1a) was 6.3%. Overall, SVR12 was 97.8%. Amongst HCV-GT1a patients, 75.0% had >800,000 IU/ml and most of those that started grazoprevir/elbasvir were treated for 12 weeks. In genotype 3, NS5A Y93H was detected in 9 patients. 42.8% of the HCV-GT3 patients that started sofosbuvir/velpatasvir included ribavirin, although only 14.7% carried Y93H. The efficacy of baseline resistance-guided treatment in our cohort has been high across the most prevalent HCV genotypes in Spain. The duration of the grazoprevir/elbasvir treatment adhered mostly to AASLD/IDSA recommendations. In cirrhotic patients infected with GT-3 there has been a high use of ribavirin."

Exposure was noise defined as the occurrence of sound level pressures (SPL) above 90 dB. The outcome was high clinical performance assessed through expert ratings using the TeamOBS-PPH tool. Results The 23 teams unexposed to noise had a significantly higher chance of high clinical performance than the 73 teams exposed to noise: 91.3% (95% CI; 72.0–98.9) versus 58.9% (95% CI; 46.8–70.3) (p < 0.001). The results remained significant when adjusting for the following possible confounders: team size, non-technical performance, bleeding velocity, hospital type, etiology of bleeding, event duration and time of day. Typical sources of noise above 90 dB SPL were mother or baby crying, dropping of instruments, and slamming of cupboard doors. Conclusion Noise in delivery rooms may be an independent source of impaired clinical performance."
https://openalex.org/W2970703110,"Background Sleep duration affects health in various ways. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships among sleep duration, daytime napping and kidney function in a middle-aged apparently healthy Chinese population. Methods According to self-reported total sleep and daytime napping durations, 33,850 participants who were 38–90 years old and recruited from eight regional centers were divided into subgroups. Height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, blood pressure, biochemical indexes, fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG), HbA1c, creatinine and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured and recorded for each subject. Microalbuminuria was defined as UACR ≥30 mg/g, chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as eGFR <60 ml/min, and hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR ≥135 ml/min. Multiple logistic regression was applied to investigate the association between sleep and kidney function. Results Compared to sleeping for 7–8 h/day, the ORs for microalbuminuria for sleeping for >9 h/day, 8–9 h/day 6–7 h/day and <6 h/day were 1.343 (1.228–1.470, P<0.001), 1.223 (1.134–1.320, P<0.001), 1.130 (1.003–1.273, P = 0.045) and 1.140 (0.908–1.431, P = 0.259), respectively. The eGFR levels exhibited a U-shaped association with sleep duration among subjects with an eGFR ≥90 ml/min and an N-shaped association with sleep duration among subjects with an eGFR <90 ml/min. The OR for hyperfiltration for >9 h/day of sleep was 1.400 (1.123–1.745, P = 0.003) among participants with an eGFR ≥90 ml/min. Daytime napping had a negative effect on renal health. Compared to the absence of a napping habit, the ORs for microalbuminuria for 0–1 h/day, 1–1.5 h/day and >1.5 h/day of daytime napping were 1.552 (1.444–1.668, P<0.001), 1.301 (1.135–1.491, P<0.001) and 1.567 (1.353–1.814, P<0.001), respectively. Conclusion The association of total sleep duration with renal health outcomes is U-shaped. Daytime napping has a negative effect on renal health."
https://openalex.org/W2970946582,"Leigh syndrome embodies degenerative disorders with a collection of symptoms secondary to inborn errors of metabolism. Combinations of hypomorphic and loss‐of‐function alleles in many genes have been shown to result in Leigh syndrome. Interestingly, deficiency for the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) can lead to Leigh‐like syndrome in some circumstances and to cancer (paraganglioma, renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor) in others. In our experiments originally intended to create an inducible whole‐body SDH‐loss mouse model of tumorigenesis, we generated a condition reminiscent of Leigh‐like syndrome that is lethal to mice within 4 wk. Remarkably, as has been shown for other mitochondrial diseases, chronic hypoxia offers substantial protection to mice from this condition after systemic SDH loss, allowing survival in the context of profoundly impaired oxidative metabolism.—Al Khazal, F., Holte, M.

https://openalex.org/W2970172256,"The contribution of neurons to growth and refinement of the microvasculature during postnatal brain development is only partially understood. Tissue hypoxia is the physiologic stimulus for angiogenesis by enhancing angiogenic mediators partly through activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Hence, we investigated the HIF oxygen-sensing pathway in postmitotic neurons for physiologic angiogenesis in the murine forebrain during postnatal development by using mice lacking the HIF suppressing enzyme prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD)2 and/or HIF-1/2α in postmitotic neurons. Perinatal activation or inactivation of the HIF pathway in neurons inversely modulated brain vascularization, including endothelial cell number and proliferation, density of total and perfused microvessels, and vascular branching. Accordingly, several angiogenesis-related genes were up-regulated in vivo and in primary neurons derived from PHD2-deficient mice. Among them, only VEGF and adrenomedullin (Adm) promoted angiogenic sprouting of brain endothelial cells. VEGF and Adm additively enhanced endothelial sprouting through activation of multiple pathways. PHD2 deficiency in neurons caused HIF-α stabilization and increased VEGF mRNA levels not only in neurons but unexpectedly also in astrocytes, suggesting a new mechanism of neuron-to-astrocyte signaling. Collectively, our results identify the PHD-HIF pathway in neurons as an important determinant for vascularization of the brain during postnatal development.-Nasyrov, E., Nolan, K. A., Wenger, R. H., Marti, H. H., Kunze, R. The neuronal oxygen-sensing pathway controls postnatal vascularization of the murine brain."
https://openalex.org/W2971285088,"This article proposes the coupling of the recombinant protein avidin to the polysaccharide gellan gum to create a modular hydrogel substrate for 3D cell culture and tissue engineering. Avidin is capable of binding biotin, and thus biotinylated compounds can be tethered to the polymer network to improve cell response. The avidin is successfully conjugated to gellan gum and remains functional as shown with fluorescence titration and electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Self-standing hydrogels were formed using bioamines and calcium chloride, yielding long-term stability and adequate stiffness for 3D cell culture, as confirmed with compression testing. Human fibroblasts were successfully cultured within the hydrogel treated with biotinylated RGD or biotinylated fibronectin. Moreover, human bone marrow stromal cells were cultured with hydrogel treated with biotinylated RGD over 3 weeks. We demonstrate a modular and inexpensive hydrogel scaffold for cell encapsulation that can be equipped with any desired biotinylated cell ligand to accommodate a wide range of cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2970368026,"Objective To conduct a secondary data analysis detailing the associations between sociodemographic and behavioral factors and nutrition-related chronic disease. Methods These analyses utilized 2014 data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, a home-based survey that collected socioeconomic, dietary intake, physical activity, and biological data among adults. We explored four outcomes in relation to sociodemographic and behavioral determinants: 1) hypertension, 2) elevated high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and 3) central obesity, as these are critical metabolic determinants in the progression to cardiovascular disease, and 4) type 2 diabetes. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mm or current use of antihypertensive medication. Elevated hs-CRP was defined as hs-CRP >3 mg/dL. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference ≥ 90 cm if male and waist circumference ≥ 80 cm if female, which are specific to South Asia. Type 2 diabetes was defined as glycated hemoglobin ≥ 6.5%. We employed separate gender-stratified multivariate logistic regression models to test the associations between sociodemographic and behavioral determinants and each nutrition-related chronic disease outcome. All analyses employed sampling weights, which account for the survey design. Results In 2014, about 30% of adults were hypertensive and one-fifth had elevated hs-CRP. Approximately 70% of women had central obesity and 11.6% of women and 8.9% of men had diabetes. Older-age was consistently associated with nutrition-related chronic disease and being overweight was associated with hypertension, elevated hs-CRP, and type 2 diabetes. Regularly consuming instant noodles (women) and soda (men) were associated with elevated hs-CRP and soda consumption was associated with central obesity among men. Conclusions Large segments of the adult population in Indonesia now have or are at risk for non-communicable disease. Our analyses provide preliminary empirical evidence that interventions that target healthful food intake (e.g. reduce the intake of ultra-processed foods) should be considered and that the reduction of overweight is critical for preventing chronic diseases in Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W2970433524,"In April 2016, an emergency vaccination campaign using one dose of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) was organized in response to a cholera outbreak that started in Lusaka in February 2016. In December 2016, a second round of vaccination was conducted, with the objective of increasing the duration of protection, before the high-risk period for cholera transmission. We assessed vaccination coverage for the first and second rounds of the OCV campaign.Vaccination coverage was estimated after each round from a sample selected from targeted-areas for vaccination using a cross-sectional survey in to establish the vaccination status of the individuals recruited. The study population included all individuals older than 12 months residing in the areas targeted for vaccination. We interviewed 505 randomly selected individuals after the first round and 442 after the second round. Vaccination status was ascertained either by vaccination card or verbal reporting. Households were selected using spatial random sampling.The vaccination coverage with two doses was 58.1% (25/43; 95%CI: 42.1-72.9) in children 1-5 years old, 59.5% (69/116; 95%CI: 49.9-68.5) in children 5-15 years old and 19.9% (56/281; 95%CI: 15.4-25.1) in adults above 15 years old. The overall dropout rate was 10.9% (95%CI: 8.1-14.1). Overall, 69.9% (n = 309/442; 95%CI: 65.4-74.1) reported to have received at least one OCV dose.The areas at highest risk of suffering cholera outbreaks were targeted for vaccination obtaining relatively high vaccine coverage after each round. However, the long delay between doses in areas subject to considerable population movement resulted in many individuals receiving only one OCV dose. Additional vaccination campaigns may be required to sustain protection over time in case of persistence of risk. Further evidence is needed to establish a maximum optimal interval time of a delayed second dose and variations in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W2970708605,"Background Iron deficiency is associated with decreased cellular immunity, which may predispose patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study investigated the relationship between newly diagnosed IDA and TB infection in Taiwan. Methods The study included data on 21,946 patients with incident IDA and 87,555 non-IDA controls from a national database covering the period 2000–2012. IDA and non-IDA subjects were matched 1:4 on age, gender, and index year. The follow-up period was defined as the time from the initial IDA diagnosis to the date of developing TB or 31 December 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with the control group as the reference. Results The adjusted hazard ratio of TB for the IDA group was 1.99 (95% confidence interval, 1.77–2.25) compared with the control group. The subgroup analysis showed that for both genders, all age groups, and patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hepatitis B virus infection, the IDA group had significantly higher TB incidence. The association was significantly stronger within the 5 years after new IDA diagnosis for both genders and all age groups. Conclusions Higher TB incidence was discovered in the IDA group, especially for patients with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2971264194,"This study aims to explore the contribution of implicit attitudes and associations towards conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), alongside explicit measures, on medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In this observational study, implicit attitudes (positive-negative) and health-related associations (health-sickness) were measured with Single Category Implicit Association Tests, whereas explicit outcomes were measured with a bipolar evaluative adjective scale and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire Specific. The primary outcome of this study was medication-taking behaviour subjectively measured by self-report (i.e. validated Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology) and objectively measured with electronic drug monitors over a 3 month period. Spearman rank correlations were used to describe correlations between implicit and explicit outcomes. Nested linear regression models were used to assess the additional value of implicit measures over explicit measures and patient-, clinical-, and treatment-related characteristics.Of the 1659 initially-invited patients, 254 patients with RA agreed to participate in this study. Implicit attitudes correlated significantly with necessity-concerns differential (NCD) scores (ρ = 0.13, P = 0.05) and disease activity scores (ρ = -0.17, P = 0.04), whereas implicit health-related associations correlated significantly with mean scores for explicitly reported health-related associations (ρ = 0.18, P = 0.004). Significant differences in age, number of DMARDs, biologic DMARD use, NCD-scores, and self-reported correct dosing were found between the four attitudinal profiles. Nested linear regression models revealed no additional value of implicit measures in explaining self-reported medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes, over and above all other variables.Implicit attitudes and associations had no additional value in explaining medication-taking behaviour and clinical outcomes over and above often used explicitly measured characteristics, attitudes and outcomes in the studied population. Only age and NCD scores contributed significantly when the dependent variable was correct dosing measured with self-report."
https://openalex.org/W2970028583,"Background and purpose Few data are available concerning the safety of bevacizumab (B) in combination with locoregional radiation therapy (RT). The objective of this study was to evaluate the 5-year late toxicity of concurrent B and RT in non-metastatic breast cancer. Materials and methods This multicentre prospective study included non-metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials evaluating B with concurrent RT versus RT alone. All patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and normofractionated breast or chest wall RT, with or without regional lymph node RT. B was administered at an equivalent dose of 5 mg/kg once a week for 1 year. The safety profile was evaluated 1, 3 and 5 years after completion of radiotherapy. Results A total of 64 patients were included between November 2007 and April 2010. Median follow-up was 60 months (12–73) and 5-year late toxicity data were available for 46 patients. The majority of tumours were triple-negative (68.8%), tumour size <2cm (41.3%) with negative nodal status (50.8%). Median total dose of B was 15,000mg and median duration was 11.2 months. No grade ≥3 toxicity was observed. Only 8 patients experienced grade 1–2 toxicities: n = 3 (6.5%) grade 1 lymphedema, n = 2 (4.3%) grade 1 pain, n = 1 (2.2%) grade 2 lymphedema, n = 1 (2.2%) grade 1 fibrosis. Five-year overall survival was 93.8%, disease-free survival was 89% and locoregional recurrence-free survival was 93.1%. Conclusion Concurrent B and locoregional RT are associated with acceptable 5-year toxicity in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer. No grade ≥3 toxicity was observed."

The procedure combines cumulative logit regression with a cumulative extension to the ROC curve and performs as expected with ternary (three-level) ordinal outcomes under a variety of simulated conditions (unbalanced data, proportional and non-proportional odds, areas under the ROC curve [AUCs] from 0.70 to 0.95). Simulations also compared several criteria for selecting cutpoints to discriminate outcome levels: the Youden Index, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Total Accuracy, and Markedness. Total Accuracy demonstrated the least absolute percent-bias. Cutpoints computed from maximum likelihood regression parameters demonstrated bias that was often negligible. The procedure was also applied to publicly available data related to computer imaging and biomarker exposure science, yielding good to excellent AUCs, as well as cutpoints with sensitivities and specificities of commensurate quality. Implementation of cumulative ROC curve analysis and extension to more than three outcome levels are straightforward. The author’s programs for ternary ordinal outcomes are publicly available."

We conducted this study to describe the phylogenetic analysis of the 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA) gene of Orientia tsutsugamushi associated with PCR positive cases of scrub typhus. Of 116 positive samples, 65 type-specific antigen gene sequences were obtained and classified into 3 genogroups: Karp, Kato and Gilliam. The Karp genogroup was the most frequently detected phylogenetic cluster in the study with 30 samples (46%), followed by Kato and Gilliam with 20 (31%) and 15 (23%), respectively. All sequences showed 94–100% nucleotide similarity to reference sequences collected in the central part of Vietnam in 2017. Patients infected with Karp genogroup were more likely to have significant thrombocytopenia than the other genogroups. These results suggest that any scrub typhus vaccine considered for use in Vietnam should provide protection against each of these 3 genogroups."

The present study sought to geospatially analyze morbidities among children (0-23 months of age) using five different survey datasets (1993-2014) from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey.Logistic regression was used to examine childhood morbidity within a place of residence. Then three spatial statistical tools were applied to analyze morbidities among children (0-23 months of age). These tools were: spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I)-used to examine clustering or dispersion patterns; cluster and outlier analysis (Anselin's local Moran's I)-to ascertain geographic composition of childhood morbidity clusters and outliers; and hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord G)-to identify clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots).Children in rural areas were much burdened with the occurrence of childhood morbidity. The study revealed positive spatial autocorrelation for childhood morbidity in Ghana. Childhood morbidity (diarrhoea, ARI, anaemia, and fever) clusters were identified within districts in the country. Children in rural areas were more likely to be morbid with diarrhoea, anaemia, and fever compared to those in urban areas. Hot spot districts for diarrhoea, anaemia and fever were mainly situated in semi-arid areas and those with ARI were located both at the semi-arid areas and coastal portions of Ghana.Rural children are much exposed to have higher burden of a childhood morbidity compared to their urban counterparts. Most semi-arid districts in Ghana are burdened with diarrhoea, ARI, anaemia, and fever. To minimize the occurrence of childhood morbidity in Ghana, designing of more context-based interventions to target hot spots districts of these morbidities are required in order to use scarce resources judiciously."
https://openalex.org/W2971317487,"The protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) performs diverse cellular functions through 2 distinct multiprotein complexes, mTOR complex (mTORC)1 and 2. Numerous studies using rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, have implicated a role for mTORC1 in several types of heart disease. People with diabetes are more susceptible to heart failure. mTORC1 activity is increased in the diabetic heart, but its functional significance remains controversial. To investigate the role of mTORC1 in the diabetic heart, we crossed OVE26 type 1 diabetic mice with transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active mTOR (mTORca) or kinase-dead mTOR (mTORkd) in the heart. The expression of mTORca or mTORkd affected only mTORC1 but not mTORC2 activities, with corresponding changes in the activities of autophagy, a cellular degradation pathway negatively regulated by mTORC1. Diabetic cardiac damage in OVE26 mice was dramatically reduced by mTORca but exacerbated by mTORkd expression as assessed by changes in cardiac function, oxidative stress, and myocyte apoptosis. These findings demonstrated that the enhanced mTORC1 signaling in the OVE26 diabetic heart was an adaptive response that limited cardiac dysfunction, suggesting that manipulations that enhance mTORC1 activity may reduce diabetic cardiac injury, in sharp contrast to the results previously obtained with rapamycin.-Xu, X., Kobayashi, S., Timm, D., Huang, Y., Zhao, F., Shou, W., Liang, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2970373669,"Background In Fetal Growth Restriction ‘fetal programming’ may take place via DNA methylation, which has implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Small-for-gestational age fetuses are considered fetal growth restricted, characterized by brain-sparing when fetal Doppler hemodynamics are abnormal, expressed as a cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) <1. We aimed to determine whether brain-sparing is associated with altered DNA methylation of selected genes. Methods We compared DNA methylation of six genes in 41 small-for-gestational age placentas with a normal or abnormal CPR. We selected EPO, HIF1A, VEGFA, LEP, PHLDA2, and DHCR24 for their role in angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and placental and fetal growth. DNA methylation was analyzed by pyrosequencing. Results Growth restricted fetuses with an abnormal CPR showed hypermethylation of the VEGFA gene at one CpG (VEGFA-309, p = .001) and an overall hypomethylation of the LEP gene, being significant at two CpGs (LEP-123, p = .049; LEP-51, p = .020). No differences in methylation were observed for the other genes. Conclusions VEGFA and LEP genes are differentially methylated in placentas of small-for-gestational age fetuses with brain-sparing. Hypermethylation of VEGFA-309 in abnormal CPR-placentas could indicate successful compensatory mechanisms. Methylation of LEP-51 is known to suppress LEP expression. Hypomethylation in small-for-gestational age placentas with abnormal CPR may result in hyperleptinemia and predispose to leptin-resistance later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2970606970,"Stroke is a major public health concern due to the morbidity and mortality associated with it. Identifying geographic areas with high stroke prevalence is important for informing public health interventions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate geographic disparities and identify geographic hotspots of stroke prevalence in Florida.County-level stroke prevalence data for 2013 were obtained from the Florida Department of Health's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Geographic clusters of stroke prevalence were investigated using the Kulldorff's circular spatial scan statistics (CSSS) and Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics (FSSS) under Poisson model assumption. Exact McNemar's test was used to compare the proportion of cluster counties identified by each of the two methods. Both Cohen's Kappa and bias adjusted Kappa were computed to assess the level of agreement between CSSS and FSSS methods of cluster detection. Goodness-of-fit of the models were compared using Cluster Information Criterion. Identified clusters and selected stroke risk factors were mapped.Overall, 3.7% of adults in Florida reported that they had been told by a healthcare professional that they had suffered a stroke. Both CSSS and FSSS methods identified significant high prevalence stroke spatial clusters. However, clusters identified using CSSS tended to be larger than those identified using FSSS. The FSSS had a better fit than the CSSS. Most of the identified clusters are explainable by the prevalence distributions of the known risk factors assessed.Geographic disparities of stroke risk exists in Florida with some counties having significant hotspots of high stroke prevalence. This information is important in guiding future research and control efforts to address the problem. Kulldorff's CSSS and Tango's FSSS are complementary to each other and should be used together to provide a more complete picture of the distributions of spatial clusters of health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2971067926,"It is extremely important to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Some TFBSs are proposed to be bipartite motifs known as two-block motifs separated by gap sequences with variable lengths. While position weight matrix (PWM) is commonly used for the representation and prediction of TFBSs, dinucleotide weight matrix (DWM) enables expression of the interdependencies of neighboring bases. By incorporating DWM into the detection of bipartite motifs, we have developed a novel tool for ab initio motif detection, DIpartite (bipartite motif detection tool based on dinucleotide weight matrix) using a Gibbs sampling strategy and the minimization of Shannon's entropy. DIpartite predicts the bipartite motifs by considering the interdependencies of neighboring positions, that is, DWM. We compared DIpartite with other available alternatives by using test datasets, namely, of CRP in E. coli, sigma factors in B. subtilis, and promoter sequences in humans. We have developed DIpartite for the detection of TFBSs, particularly bipartite motifs. DIpartite enables ab initio prediction of conserved motifs based on not only PWM, but also DWM. We evaluated the performance of DIpartite by comparing it with freely available tools, such as MEME, BioProspector, BiPad, and AMD. Taken the obtained findings together, DIpartite performs equivalently to or better than these other tools, especially for detecting bipartite motifs with variable gaps. DIpartite requires users to specify the motif lengths, gap length, and PWM or DWM. DIpartite is available for use at https://github.com/Mohammad-Vahed/DIpartite."
https://openalex.org/W2971071953,"Colorectal cancer is one of the top three causes of cancer-related mortality globally, but no predictive molecular biomarkers are currently available for identifying the disease stage of colorectal cancer patients. Common molecular patterns in the disease, beyond superficial manifestations, can be significant in determining treatment choices. In this study, we used microarray data from colorectal cancer and adjacent normal tissue from the GEO database. These data were categorized into four consensus molecular subtypes based on distinct gene expression signatures. Weighted gene-based protein–protein interaction network analysis was performed for each subtype. NUSAP1, CD44, and COL4A1 modules were found to be statistically significant and present among all the subtypes and displayed though similar but not identical functional enrichment results. Reference of the characteristics of the subtypes to functional modules is necessary since the latter can stay resistant to platform changes and technique noise when compared with other analyses. The CMS4-mesenchymal group, which currently has a poor prognosis, was examined in the study. It is composed mainly of genes involved in immune and stromal expression, with modules focused on ECM dysregulation and chemokine biological processes. Hub genes detection and its’ mapping into the protein–protein interaction network can be indicative of possible targets against specific modules. This approach identified subtypes using enrichment-oriented analysis in functional modules. Proper annotation of functional analysis of modules from different subtypes of CRC might be directive for finding extra options for treatment targets and guiding clinical routines."

Novel 2DE layer strain software automatically provides LV contour in 3 myocardial layers and performs layer specific speckle tracking analysis, which calculates LV volumes, ejection fraction (LVEF), and global longitudinal strain (GLS) in each layer. These values were compared with reference values from CMR disk-area summation and feature tracking methods. Coverage probability (CP) was determined using predefined cut-off values and absolute differences in LV volumes of 30 mL, those in LVEF of 10%, and those in GLS of 4%. The software did not work in 3 patients (feasibility: 96%). Different layers resulted in different degrees of under- or over-estimation of LV volumes. Epicardial tracking significantly overestimated the LV volumes and significantly underestimated LVEF and GLS. Mid-myocardial tracking had less underestimation of LV volumes and equivalent CP values of LVEF (0.77 vs. 0.75 using the disk-area summation method and 0.90 vs. 0.94 using the feature tracking method) and GLS (0.95 vs. 0.92) compared with endocardial tracking. The new software showed excellent reproducibility, especially endocardial and mid-myocardial tracking.Mid-myocardial tracking with the novel 2DE strain software provided less bias of LV volumes with high CP values of LVEF and GLS, which suggests that mid-myocardial layer speckle tracking analysis approximates CMR derived LV functional parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2971065898,"Rats are highly social creatures that produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during social interactions. Brattleboro rats, a Long-Evans derived rat that lacks vasopressin (AVP) due to a mutation in the Avp gene, exhibit atypical social behavior, including fewer USVs with altered spectrotemporal characteristics during social interactions. It is unclear why Brattleboro rats produce atypical USVs, but one factor could be differences in auditory acuity between them and wild-type Long Evans rats with functional vasopressin. Previous studies have suggested a link between increased levels of AVP and auditory processing. Additionally, few studies have investigated sex differences in auditory perception by Long-Evans rats. Sex differences in auditory acuity have been found throughout the animal kingdom, but have not yet been demonstrated in rat audiograms. This study aimed to measure auditory brainstem response (ABR) derived audiograms for frequencies ranging from 1 to 64 kHz in male and female homozygous Brattleboro (Hom), heterozygous Brattleboro (Het), and wild-type (WT) Long-Evans rats to better understand the role of AVP and sex differences in auditory processing by these rats. We failed to detect significant differences between the ABR audiograms of Hom, Het, and WT Long-Evans rats, suggesting that varying levels of AVP do not affect auditory processing. Interestingly, males and females of all genotypes did differ in their ABR thresholds, with males exhibiting higher thresholds than females. The sex differences in auditory acuity were significant at the lowest and highest frequencies, possibly affecting the perception of USVs. These are the first known sex differences in rat audiograms."

In Ethiopia, despite the high burden report, data on CLD is limited. The objective of this study was to assess short-term clinical outcomes in patients admitted with chronic liver disease to three tertiary teaching hospitals in Ethiopia and to identify predictors of mortality.A cohort of 109 patients admitted with CLD to three tertiary teaching hospitals in Ethiopia, were prospectively followed from the time of admission to 30-days of hospital discharge. The study was conducted from April 1, 2018, to October 5, 2018. Kaplan-Maier curve was used to estimate survival and cox-regression analysis to identify predictors of mortality.A total of 109 patients (80% male) diagnosed with CLD were included. Median age of the participants was 38(IQR, 30-48). The overall median length of hospital stay was 7(IQR, 4-11) days. Of the total, 39(35.8%) patients were HBsAg positive, and 12(11%) patients were anti-HCV positive. The 30-day mortality was 38(34.9%), and most of the deaths, 31(81.6%) occurred before hospital discharge. Hepatic encephalopathy at admission; being with unidentified risk factor/etiologies of CLD and total bilirubin level were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy at admission had approximately 11 times increased risk of death as compared to patients without hepatic encephalopathy at admission. Similarly, the hazard of mortality was 5.8 times higher in those patients with unidentified risk factor/etiology as compared to others. The risk of dying had also increased with an increase in bilirubin (1.188[95% CI, 1.0719-1.316]) level.Approximately one-quarter of patients with CLD died during their hospital stay, and the risk of death continued after hospital discharge. Hepatic encephalopathy at admission, unidentified risk factor/etiology and increased level of total bilirubin are poor prognostic factors. Given that more than one third the patients had HBV-infection, access to antiviral drugs could help improve the prognosis of patients with end-stage liver disease in Ethiopia, as well as prevent the progression of the disease if initiated earlier."
https://openalex.org/W2970415110,"Rationale Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) exerts a variety of effects through metabolites and these play an important role in regulation of hemodynamics in the body. A detailed investigation into the generation of these metabolites has been overlooked. Objectives We investigated the kinetics of nitrite and S-nitrosothiol-hemoglobin (SNO-Hb) in plasma derived from inhaled NO subjects and how this modifies the cutaneous microvascular response. Findings We enrolled 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma nitrite levels at baseline and during NO inhalation (15 minutes at 40 ppm) were 102 (86–118) and 114 (87–129) nM, respectively. The nitrite peak occurred at 5 minutes of discontinuing NO (131 (104–170) nM). Plasma nitrate levels were not significantly different during the study. SNO-Hb molar ratio levels at baseline and during NO inhalation were 4.7E-3 (2.5E-3–5.8E-3) and 7.8E-3 (4.1E-3-13.0E-3), respectively. Levels of SNO-Hb continued to climb up to the last study time point (30 min: 10.6E-3 (5.3E-3-15.5E-3)). The response to acetylcholine iontophoresis both before and during NO inhalation was inversely associated with the SNO-Hb level (r: -0.57, p = 0.03, and r: -0.54, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions Both nitrite and SNO-Hb increase during NO inhalation. Nitrite increases first, followed by a more sustained increase in Hb-SNO. Nitrite and Hb-SNO could be a mobile reservoir of NO with potential implications on the systemic microvasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2970461433,"Flavodoxins are small electron transfer proteins containing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a prosthetic group, which play an important role during oxidative stress or iron limitation. The aims of this study were the identification and characterization of flavodoxins in the model aromatic-degrader Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 and the analyses of their protective effects during oxidative stress induced by paraquat and H2O2. Two genes (BxeA0278 and BxeB0391) encoding flavodoxins (hereafter referred to as fldX for flavodoxin from P. xenovorans), were identified at the LB400 major and minor chromosome. Genomic context of the flavodoxin-encoding genes showed genes encoding membrane proteins, transporters, and proteins involved in redox processes and biosynthesis of macromolecules. A secondary structure prediction of both LB400 flavodoxins showed the characteristic flavodoxin structure of five ß-sheets intercalated with five α-helices. FldX1 contains a loop intercalated in the fifth β-strand, which indicates that it belongs to the long-chain flavodoxins, whereas FldX2 is a short-chain flavodoxin. A phylogenetic analysis of 73 flavodoxins from 43 bacterial genera revealed eight clusters (I-VIII), while FldX1 and FldX2 grouped separately within a long-chain and a short-chain flavodoxin clades. FldX1 and FldX2 were overexpressed in P. xenovorans. Interestingly, the strain overexpressing the long-chain flavodoxin FldX1 (p2-fldX1) showed a faster growth in glucose than the control strain. The recombinant strain overexpressing the long-chain flavodoxin FldX1 (p2-fldx1) exposed to paraquat (20 mM) possessed lower susceptibility to growth inhibition on plates and higher survival in liquid medium than the control strain. The strains overexpressing the flavodoxins FldX1 and FldX2 showed higher survival during exposure to 1 mM paraquat (>95%) than the control strain (68%). Compared to the control strain, strains overexpressing FldX1 and FldX2 showed lower lipid peroxidation (>20%) after exposure to 1 mM paraquat and a lower protein carbonylation (~30%) after exposure to 1 mM H2O2 was observed. During exposure to paraquat, strain p2-fldx1 downregulated the katG4, hpf, trxB1 and ohr genes (> 2-fold), whereas strain p2-fldx2 upregulated the oxyR and ahpC1 genes (> 2-fold). In conclusion, the flavodoxins FldX1 and FldX2 of P. xenovorans LB400 conferred protection to cells exposed to the oxidizing agents paraquat and H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W2971322479,"Dysregulation of the complement system is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, and its inhibition has been shown to be a feasible therapeutic option. Therefore, there is an interest in the development of complement modulators to treat complement activation-related inflammatory pathologies. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL)/ficolin/collectin-associated protein-1 (MAP-1) is a regulatory molecule of the lectin pathway (LP), whereas complement receptor 1 (CD35) and decay-accelerating factor (CD55) are membrane-anchored regulators with effects on the central effector molecule C3. In this study, we developed 2 novel soluble chimeric inhibitors by fusing MAP-1 to the 3 first domains of CD35 (CD351-3) or the 4 domains of CD55 (CD551-4) to modulate the complement cascade at 2 different stages. The constructs showed biologic properties similar to those of the parent molecules. In functional complement activation assays, the constructs were very efficient in inhibiting LP activation at the level of C3 and in the formation of terminal complement complex. This activity was enhanced when coincubated with recombinant LP recognition molecules MBL and ficolin-3. Recombinant MAP-1 fusion proteins, combined with recombinant LP recognition molecules to target sites of inflammation, represent a novel and effective therapeutic approach involving the initiation and the central and terminal effector functions of the complement cascade.-Pérez-Alós, L., Bayarri-Olmos, R., Skjoedt, M.-O., Garred, P. Combining MAP-1:CD35 or MAP-1:CD55 fusion proteins with pattern-recognition molecules as novel targeted modulators of the complement cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2970360261,"Background Children with atopic disease may have reduced health-related quality of life (QoL) and morning cortisol. Possible links between QoL, morning cortisol and atopic disease are unclear. We aimed to determine if QoL was associated with morning salivary cortisol at two years of age, and if asthma, atopic dermatitis and/or allergic sensitisation influenced this association. Secondarily, we aimed to determine if QoL at one year of age was associated with salivary cortisol one year later. Methods and findings The Bronchiolitis All SE-Norway study included infants during hospitalisation for acute bronchiolitis in infancy (bronchiolitis group) and population-based control infants (controls). The present study included all 358 subjects with available Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQOL) from parents, consisting of 13 domains and morning salivary cortisol at two years of age. Answers from the same 0–100 score questionnaire, with optimal score 100 nine months after enrolment, was also available for 289 of these children at about one year of age. Recurrent bronchial obstruction was used as an asthma proxy. Atopic dermatitis was defined by Hanifin and Rajka criteria and allergic sensitisation by a positive skin prick test. Due to different inclusion criteria, we tested possible interactions with affiliation groups. Associations between QoL and cortisol were analysed by multivariate analyses, stratified by bronchiolitis and control groups due to interaction from affiliation grouping on results. At two years of age, QoL decreased significantly with decreasing cortisol in 8/13 QoL domains in the bronchiolitis group, but only with General health in the controls. The associations in the bronchiolitis group showed 0.06–0.19 percentage points changes per nmol/L cortisol for each of the eight domains (p-values 0.0001–0.034). The associations remained significant but diminished by independently including recurrent bronchial obstruction and atopic dermatitis, but remained unchanged by allergic sensitisation. In the bronchiolitis group only, 7/13 age and gender adjusted QoL domains in one-year old children were lower with lower cortisol levels at two years of age (p = 0.0005–0.04). Conclusions At two years, most QoL domains decreased with lower salivary cortisol among children who had been hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis in infancy, but for one domain only among controls. Recurrent bronchial obstruction and to a lesser extent atopic dermatitis, weakened these associations that nevertheless remained significant. After bronchiolitis, lower QoL in one-year old children was associated with lower salivary cortisol at two years."
https://openalex.org/W2970258913,"To evaluate virological breakthrough (VBT) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital and a total of 228 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with ETV for more than 48 weeks were enrolled. Clinical outcome measures included HBeAg seroclearance, maintained virological response and the development of HCC.During a median follow-up period of 197 weeks, VBT developed in 26 (11.4%) patients (VBT group), and the other 202 patients without VBT (non-VBT group). The overall cumulative rate of HBeAg seroclearance in the VBT group and non-VBT group were 23.1% and 23.8%, 27.1% and 37.9%, 27.1% and 55.1%, 27.1% and 74.1%, 27.1% and 76.7% from week 48 to 240, respectively(p = 0.013). The cumulative probability of maintained virological responses from week 48 to 240 were 7.69% and 21.78%, 7.69% in the VBT groups and 36.85%, 7.69% and 51.68%, 7.69% and 64.97%, 7.69% and 72.1% in the non-VBT groups, respectively (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, age (p<0.001) and virological response at week 24 (p = 0.005) were independently associated with VBT. Cox regression analysis showed that cirrhosis had carried the highest risk for HCC (HR = 4.99, CI = 1.14-21.81, p = 0.033). Subgroup survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier method showed that patients with VBT had higher incidence of developing HCC than without VBT in cirrhotic patients (50% (95%CI = 1-99%) vs 9% (95% CI = 1-9%); p = 0.048).VBT was associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including a low probability of HBeAg seroclearance, failure to achieve maintained virological responses, and a risk of developing HCC. Patients, particularly with cirrhosis, who had experienced VBT during ETV treatment, more likely developed HCC."
