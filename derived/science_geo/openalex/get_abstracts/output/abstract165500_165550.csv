Films and powders of TiO(2-x)N(x) have revealed an improvement over titanium dioxide (TiO2) under visible light (wavelength < 500 nanometers) in optical absorption and photocatalytic activity such as photodegradations of methylene blue and gaseous acetaldehyde and hydrophilicity of the film surface. Nitrogen doped into substitutional sites of TiO2 has proven to be indispensable for band-gap narrowing and photocatalytic activity, as assessed by first-principles calculations and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy."

We present in vivo and in vitro evidence that in Drosophila melanogaster a developmentally regulated precursor RNA is cleaved by an RNA interference-like mechanism to produce mature let-7 stRNA. Targeted destruction in cultured human cells of the messenger RNA encoding the enzyme Dicer, which acts in the RNA interference pathway, leads to accumulation of the let-7 precursor. Thus, the RNA interference and stRNA pathways intersect. Both pathways require the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer to produce the active small-RNA component that represses gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2044351980,"Gastrointestinal (GI) tract damage by chemotherapy or radiation limits their efficacy in cancer treatment. Radiation has been postulated to target epithelial stem cells within the crypts of Lieberkühn to initiate the lethal GI syndrome. Here, we show in mouse models that microvascular endothelial apoptosis is the primary lesion leading to stem cell dysfunction. Radiation-induced crypt damage, organ failure, and death from the GI syndrome were prevented when endothelial apoptosis was inhibited pharmacologically by intravenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or genetically by deletion of the acid sphingomyelinase gene. Endothelial, but not crypt, cells express FGF receptor transcripts, suggesting that the endothelial lesion occurs before crypt stem cell damage in the evolution of the GI syndrome. This study provides a basis for new approaches to prevent radiation damage to the bowel."
https://openalex.org/W2136748963,"According to contemporary learning theories, the discrepancy, or error, between the actual and predicted reward determines whether learning occurs when a stimulus is paired with a reward. The role of prediction errors is directly demonstrated by the observation that learning is blocked when the stimulus is paired with a fully predicted reward. By using this blocking procedure, we show that the responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli was governed differentially by the occurrence of reward prediction errors rather than stimulus–reward associations alone, as was the learning of behavioural reactions. Both behavioural and neuronal learning occurred predominantly when dopamine neurons registered a reward prediction error at the time of the reward. Our data indicate that the use of analytical tests derived from formal behavioural learning theory provides a powerful approach for studying the role of single neurons in learning."
https://openalex.org/W2157737392,"The endogenous opioid system is involved in stress responses, in the regulation of the experience of pain, and in the action of analgesic opiate drugs. We examined the function of the opioid system and mu-opioid receptors in the brains of healthy human subjects undergoing sustained pain. Sustained pain induced the regional release of endogenous opioids interacting with mu-opioid receptors in a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions. The activation of the mu-opioid receptor system was associated with reductions in the sensory and affective ratings of the pain experience, with distinct neuroanatomical involvements. These data demonstrate the central role of the mu-opioid receptors and their endogenous ligands in the regulation of sensory and affective components of the pain experience."

https://openalex.org/W2132200710,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential membrane components in higher eukaryotes and are the precursors of many lipid-derived signaling molecules. Here, pathways for PUFA synthesis are described that do not require desaturation and elongation of saturated fatty acids. These pathways are catalyzed by polyketide synthases (PKSs) that are distinct from previously recognized PKSs in both structure and mechanism. Generation of cis double bonds probably involves position-specific isomerases; such enzymes might be useful in the production of new families of antibiotics. It is likely that PUFA synthesis in cold marine ecosystems is accomplished in part by these PKS enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2145178271,"Microwave atomic clocks have been the de facto standards for precision time and frequency metrology over the past 50 years, finding widespread use in basic scientific studies, communications, and navigation. However, with its higher operating frequency, an atomic clock based on an optical transition can be much more stable. We demonstrate an all-optical atomic clock referenced to the 1.064-petahertz transition of a single trapped 199 Hg + ion. A clockwork based on a mode-locked femtosecond laser provides output pulses at a 1-gigahertz rate that are phase-coherently locked to the optical frequency. By comparison to a laser-cooled calcium optical standard, an upper limit for the fractional frequency instability of 7 × 10 −15 is measured in 1 second of averaging—a value substantially better than that of the world's best microwave atomic clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2056010443,"Receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands mediate cell-cell communication and interaction in many organ systems, but have not been known to act in this capacity in the mature immune system. We now provide genetic evidence that three closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, Tyro 3, Axl, and Mer, play an essential immunoregulatory role. Mutant mice that lack these receptors develop a severe lymphoproliferative disorder accompanied by broad-spectrum autoimmunity. These phenotypes are cell nonautonomous with respect to lymphocytes and result from the hyperactivation of antigen-presenting cells in which the three receptors are normally expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2043677046,"Large millennial-scale fluctuations of the southern margin of the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet occurred during the last deglaciation, when the margin was located between about 43 degrees and 49 degrees N. Fluctuations of the ice margin triggered episodic increases in the flux of freshwater to the North Atlantic by rerouting continental runoff from the Mississippi River drainage to the Hudson or St. Lawrence Rivers. We found that periods of increased freshwater flow to the North Atlantic occurred at the same time as reductions in the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water, thus providing a mechanism for observed climate variability that may be generally characteristic of times of intermediate global ice volume."

https://openalex.org/W1710780480,"Recent observations have revealed streams of gas and stars in the halo of the Milky Way that are the debris from interactions between our Galaxy and some of its dwarf companion galaxies; the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the Magellanic clouds. Analysis of the material has shown that much of the halo is made up of cannibalized satellite galaxies, and that dark matter is distributed nearly spherically in the Milky Way. It remains unclear, however, whether cannibalized substructures are as common in the haloes of galaxies as predicted by galaxy-formation theory. Here we report the discovery of a giant stream of metal-rich stars within the halo of the nearest large galaxy, M31 (the Andromeda galaxy). The source of this stream could be the dwarf galaxies M32 and NGC205, which are close companions of M31 and which may have lost a substantial number of stars owing to tidal interactions. The results demonstrate that the epoch of galaxy building still continues, albeit at a modest rate, and that tidal streams may be a generic feature of galaxy haloes."

We report a natural heterozygous germline STAT1 mutation associated with susceptibility to mycobacterial but not viral disease. This mutation causes a loss of GAF and ISGF3 activation but is dominant for one cellular phenotype and recessive for the other. It impairs the nuclear accumulation of GAF but not of ISGF3 in heterozygous cells stimulated by IFNs. Thus, the antimycobacterial, but not the antiviral, effects of human IFNs are principally mediated by GAF."

Grafting experiments with a naturally occurring dominant gain-of-function leaf mutation in tomato were used to demonstrate long-distance movement of mutant messenger RNA (mRNA) into wild-type scions. The stock-specific pattern of mRNA expression was graft transmissible, indicating that the mRNA accumulation pattern is inherent to the transcript and not attributable to the promoter. The translocated mRNA caused changes in leaf morphology of the wild-type scions, suggesting that the translocated RNA is functional."
https://openalex.org/W1999116701,"We report an atomic-resolution structure for a sensory member of the microbial rhodopsin family, the phototaxis receptor sensory rhodopsin II (NpSRII), which mediates blue-light avoidance by the haloarchaeon Natronobacterium pharaonis. The 2.4 angstrom structure reveals features responsible for the 70- to 80-nanometer blue shift of its absorption maximum relative to those of haloarchaeal transport rhodopsins, as well as structural differences due to its sensory, as opposed to transport, function. Multiple factors appear to account for the spectral tuning difference with respect to bacteriorhodopsin: (i) repositioning of the guanidinium group of arginine 72, a residue that interacts with the counterion to the retinylidene protonated Schiff base; (ii) rearrangement of the protein near the retinal ring; and (iii) changes in tilt and slant of the retinal polyene chain. Inspection of the surface topography reveals an exposed polar residue, tyrosine 199, not present in bacteriorhodopsin, in the middle of the membrane bilayer. We propose that this residue interacts with the adjacent helices of the cognate NpSRII transducer NpHtrII."

https://openalex.org/W1997588573,"Metals formed from light elements are predicted to exhibit intriguing states of electronic order. Of these materials, those containing boron are of considerable current interest because of their relatively high superconducting temperatures. We have investigated elemental boron to very high pressure using diamond anvil cell electrical conductivity techniques. We find that boron transforms from a nonmetal to a superconductor at about 160 gigapascals (GPa). The critical temperature of the transition increases from 6 kelvin (K) at 175 GPa to 11.2 K at 250 GPa, giving a positive pressure derivative of 0.05 K/GPa. Although the observed metallization pressure is compatible with the predictions of first-principles calculations, superconductivity in boron remains to be explored theoretically. The present results constitute a record pressure for both electrical conductivity studies and investigations of superconductivity in dense matter."
https://openalex.org/W1964992965,"The cell density-dependent growth inhibition of human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells is initiated by increased ganglioside sialidase activity leading to elevated cell surface presentation of ganglioside GM1, a ligand of galectin-1. We herein show that the extent of the cell surface expression of the galectin coincides with marked increases of the sialidase activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis excludes a regulation at the transcriptional level. Exposure of cells to purified galectin-1 reveals its carbohydrate-dependent activity to reduce cell proliferation. Assays to detect DNA fragmentation biochemically and cytometrically and to block caspases render it unlikely that galectin-1 acts as a classical proapoptotic factor on these cells. Because the chimeric galectin-3 shares binding sites and binding parameters with galectin-1 for these cells, we tested whether this galectin will elicit the same response as the homodimeric cross-linking galectin-1. Evidently, galectin-3 fails to affect cell growth by itself but interferes with galectin-1 upon coincubation. Its proteolytically truncated variant, the C-terminal lectin domain with impaired capacity to form aggregates when surface bound, has only weak binding properties. Thus, the way in which the galectin-1 interacts topologically with an apparently common set of ligands relative to galectin-3 is crucial for eliciting post-binding events.

Understanding the pathways to limit cell growth and to induce cell differentiation will not only contribute salient pieces to the puzzle to eventually depict cell reactivity completely. This knowledge could also have potential clinical relevance. Based on the spatially prominent position of glycan chains of cellular glycoconjugates at the cell surface and the growing body of evidence that oligosaccharides are biological coding units (glycocode) (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar, 2Hakomori S.-I. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem.

Naturwissenschaften. 2000; 87: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume an active role for these compounds in this respect. In fact, the glycan part of two negative growth control elements, i.e. the glycoprotein contactinhibin and the glycosphingolipid-like neurostatin, is involved in triggering a cytostatic response in fibroblasts or astrocytes/glioma cells (6Wieser R.J.

When the ganglioside GM1 was added exogenously to astroglial cells, a bimodal effect on proliferation had been documented with a threshold concentration of 60 μm(15Pettmann B. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 20: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, association with the high affinity tyrosine kinase-type receptor for the nerve growth factor (trkA receptor) has been implicated in part in the signal cascade, which, among other responses, leads to accumulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (11Kopitz J. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences: Status and Perspectives. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 163-189Google Scholar, 13Nagai Y. Pure Appl.

In addition to adding glycosphingolipids as effectors to cultures, suggestions emerged to target cell surface glycolipids with carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) such as verotoxin to turn the antineoplastic potential of this interaction in situ into clinical benefit (14Lingwood C.A. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Hakomori S.-I. Acta Anat. 1998; 161: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this context, the elucidation of how a defined change in cell surface presentation of glycolipids translates into an effective density-dependent control system via protein (lectin)-carbohydrate interactions with an endogenous lectin may even describe a perspective for programming growth inhibition in responsive malignant cells. Our report is a step toward figuring out the validity of this hypothesis. Previous work on human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells demonstrated the activity increase of a cell surface ganglioside sialidase and the following shift from higher gangliosides toward ganglioside GM1 and lactosylceramide as pivotal control elements to switch cell behavior from proliferation to differentiation (18Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Mühl C. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Sinz K. Cantz M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Kopitz J. Mühl C. Ehemann V. Lehmann C. Cantz M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kopitz J. Oehler C. Cantz M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the search for receptor molecules of these glycolipids at the neuroblastoma surface in cell culture, we collected evidence that the endogenous lectin galectin-1 is a major binding partner of ganglioside GM1 (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Several issues to be addressed arose from this result. First of all, it is essential for the given hypothesis to monitor regulation of galectin-1 expression and to test whether galectin-1 will act as negative growth regulator on these cells by carbohydrate binding. Considering the formation of a death signaling pair including galectin-1 and the T-cell marker CD7 for induction of apoptosis in thymocytes and activated T cells (23Pace K.E. Hahn H.P. Pang M. Nguyen J.T. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2331-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the principal route for a measurable galectin-1 effect on this neuroblastoma cell type will require clarification. Because galectin-3 exhibited very similar binding properties to the neuroblastoma cell surface relative to galectin-1 (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), these two members of the galectin family of endogenous lectins thus shared reactivity to the ganglioside as did the B-subunit of cholera toxin. Because the topological presentation of the homologous carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs)1is different for the two galectins, functional assays in this system could teach us an important lesson concerning the relationship of CRD presentation and cellular effect. Whereas the homodimeric proto-type galectin-1 is a potent cross-linker with its two CRDs at opposite ends of the protein, the chimera-type galectin-3 is monomeric in solution with tendency for aggregate assembly primarily via the collagenase-cleavable N-terminal part upon surface binding (24Hsu D.K Zuberi R.I.

The question of whether native or proteolytically trimmed galectin-3 is active or, if negative, might interfere with galectin-1-mediated effects is thus to be answered. The results of our experiments to infer galectin participation in this growth control system and the extent of functional overlap are expected to have relevance beyond this cell type, because human tumor cells often express more than one galectin (33Gabius H.-J.

The C-terminal domain of galectin-3 comprising its CRD was prepared by digestion of recombinant galectin-3 with collagenase D and purified by affinity chromatography as described (37Agrwal N. Sun Q. Wang S.Y. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14932-14939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

For assessment of parameters of galectin binding to (neo)glycoproteins (lactosylated albumin, asialofetuin, and Mac-2-binding protein, which was kindly provided by R.

Gabius H.J. Bioconj. Chem. 1997; 8: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Iodination of galectins and antibodies was performed as outlined previously (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma cells (strain SK-N-MC) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) as described (20Kopitz J. Mühl C.

Carbohydrate-dependent binding of 125I-labeled galectins or specific binding of the polyclonal antibodies to the cultured cells were assessed by a previously published procedure (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C.

For 3H labeling of cellular DNA, 83 nm[methyl-3H]thymidine (specific radioactivity, 2.22 MBq/nmol) and 83 μm “cold” thymidine were included in the culture medium. For staining of actin filaments the cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 15 units/ml Alexa FluorTM 488 according to the manufacturer's description (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell number after galectin treatment was determined by a cell proliferation kit (CellTiter 96; Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was isolated from neuroblastoma cultures using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of the obtained RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript II, RAseOut (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) priming. The PCR was carried out in a Genius thermocycler (Techne, Cambridge, UK) using a hot start protocol and 5′-AACCTGGAGAGTGCCTTCGA-3′ and 5′-GTAGTTGATGGCCTCCAGGT-3′ as specific primers for galectin-1 with annealing at 60 °C in 24 cycles. As control, a β-actin amplimer with 5′-GAGGAGCACCCCGTGCTGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCTGTGGACGATGGAGGGGCC-3′ amplified with annealing at 60 °C in 19 cycles was used. After elephoretic separation (2% agarose gel), the PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide (0.1%) and detected with a camera-linked UV transilluminator system (Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany). The ratios of galectin-1 to β-actin samples were obtained densitometrically using LabImage 2.51 (LabSoft, Halle, Germany). For detection and quantification of apoptotic cell death by flow cytometry, two independent methods were applied. Dual parameter plot TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling analysis was carried using a commercial test kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, fluorescein; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of fluorescence-stained DNA for detection of late apoptotic cells by appearance of a characteristic sub-G0/G1 peak was applied (40Douglas R.S.

Then the nuclei were stained with 5 μm4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride for 5 min and analyzed using a PAS II flow cytometer (Partec, Münster, Germany) equipped with a mercury vapor lamp of 100 W and a filter combination for 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-stained single cells (42Ehemann V. Hashemi B. Lange A. Otto H.F. Cancer Lett. 1999; 138: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For histogram analysis the Multicycle program (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) was applied. In experiments where the effect of caspase inhibitors on galectin-1-induced growth inhibition was tested, either 200 μm Z-VAD(OMe)-FMF (Bachem, Bubendorf/Switzerland), 100 μm Z-DEVD-FMK, or 100 μm Z-YVAD-FMK was added to the culture medium concomitantly with galectin-1, and the cell number was determined as described above. The protein was measured according to the Lowry procedure (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) applying bovine serum albumin as standard. In the first set of experiments, we addressed the question of whether galectin-1 expression and surface presentation are subject to regulatory mechanisms that are temporally related to the up-regulation of enzymatic activity of the cell surface ganglioside sialidase and hence increased ganglioside GM1 generation. Total mRNA was extracted from aliquots of SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells at different days after seeding. Using specific primers for human galectin-1 and β-actin as a control, RT-PCR analyses were carried out to determine the presence of galectin-1-specific mRNA. The positive signal at the expected position in the electrophoresis gel (Fig.1 A) corroborated the previous immunocytochemical detection of galectin-1 in these cells (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nature of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. As a negative control, to exclude erroneous amplification, we used a specific primer set for galectin-3 and could not pick up any message for this galectin, which is in line with the previous immunocytochemical data (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Examination of the signal intensity of galectin-1 relative to β-actin mRNA by densitometry yielded no evidence for any marked up-regulation during cell growth (Fig.1 B). Having thus excluded transcription as a target for potential regulation, we next examined the biologically relevant cell surface presentation of galectin-1 under identical experimental conditions. With an iodinated polyclonal anti-galectin-1 antibody rigorously tested for lack of cross-reactivity to other galectins, we detected a more than 15-fold increase in cell surface binding of the galectin-1-specific probe from day 1 to day 7 (Fig.2). The maximum was reached when the growth kinetics of the cell population normally undergoes the transition to density-dependent inhibition of proliferation. The time course of the surface presentation of galectin-1 thus closely matched that of the specific activity of the plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase activity that likewise increased ∼15-fold during this period (18Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Mühl C. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The observed evidence for a regulated presentation of galectin-1 is suggestive of a functional role of the endogenous lectin. To further examine this hypothesis, we tested neuroblastoma cell behavior in response to exposure of exogenously added galectin-1. To determine whether galectin-1 would trigger cellular responses, it was added exogenously to the cultures 16 h after plating and the cells observed by phase contrast microscopy. In untreated controls, regular cell spreading with establishment of extensive intercellular spaces was invariably seen (Fig. 3 A). In the galectin-1-treated cells, on the other hand, both morphology and density of the cells were drastically different. Thus, cell numbers were consistently much lower than in controls, and cell spreading was less frequent with a predominance of rounded cells or loose cell clusters, suggesting adhesion between cells to be stronger than adhesion between cells and substratum (Fig. 3 B). On the level of the individual cell, phalloidin staining was employed to assess the different ways of intracellular actin organization as a further indicator of the response to galectin-1. Normally, cell spreading observed 64 h after plating goes along with formation of actin bundles (Fig. 3 E). Galectin-1 treatment significantly disturbed this regular pattern, resulting in depolymerization of the fine filamentous actin network (Fig. 3 F). To quantify the galectin-1-dependent growth inhibition, we monitored cell number after incubation under standard culture conditions with different galectin-1 concentrations. As shown in Fig.4, increasing amounts of the lectin led to an ever stronger decrease of the cell number. Regarding the lectin concentrations, it should be noted that supplementation of the medium with fetal calf serum containing a variety of glycoproteins is likely to block a considerable share of lectin CRDs. To exclude the activity of a hypothetical minor contaminant with potent toxicity (the purity of the galectin had been verified by electrophoretic analysis), we performed control experiments in the presence of a mixture of lactose (10 mm) and asialofetuin (5 mg/ml) to block binding of galectin-1 to the cells via its CRD. Although the sugar substances did not affect cell morphology and growth pattern under these conditions in controls, their presence abolished lectin binding (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and lectin-dependent growth inhibition (Fig.5). Clearly, the measured biological activity was dependent on carbohydrate binding.Figure 5Effect of galectins on cell proliferation. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at an initial density of 104 cells/well. After 16 h galectins (125 μg/ml) were included in the medium for 48 h. Then the cell number was determined using a commercial cell proliferation assay.

The results are the means ± S.D. of eight independent experimental series.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To infer the nature of the inhibitory process on the cultured cells we performed two routine assays to detect apoptotic cells. Firstly, we looked for internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using the TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling test kit. Additionally, we recorded DNA cytograms by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, where apoptotic cells were expected to show up in the clearly defined sub-G0/G1 peak. Cell populations were monitored at various time points between 2 and 72 h after addition of galectin-1. No clear indication for a positive signal was obtained in any experiment, with positive controls ascertaining the validity of both tests (results not shown). To exclude the possibility that this cell type might undergo atypical DNA fragmentation (41Loo D.T. Rillema J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 57: 251-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bortner C. Oldenburg N. Cidlowski J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 21-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), we used an alternative method for apoptosis detection, which does not depend on nucleolytic DNA breakdown. Availability of efficient caspase inhibitors with cell permeability enabled blocking of the caspase-initiated cascade, thereby at least hampering transition of cells into apoptosis by an elicitor. Staurosporine-induced programmed cell death served as positive control. However, neither Z-VAD(OMe)-FMF, a peptide inhibitor of caspases-1 and -3 family enzymes, at concentrations of up to 200 μm, nor Z-DEVD-FMK, targeting caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, and -10, nor Z-YVAD-FMK, mainly acting on caspase-1 (both tested at concentrations up to 100 μm), had any influence on the galectin-1-dependent decrease of cell number (results not shown). Galectin-3 had very similar binding properties to the SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells relative to galectin-1 as analyzed by Scatchard plots, and it also shared the sensitivity of galectin-1 to the presence of cholera toxin B-subunit (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Burchert M. Cantz M. Gabius H.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11205-11211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine whether it would likewise elicit a cellular response, galectin-3 was tested under the same conditions as galectin-1, and the morphology of treated cells and the cell number were monitored. In contrast to galectin-1, however, galectin-3 was ineffective with regard to the chosen parameters (Figs.3 C and 5 C). To exclude any influence of the collagenase-sensitive tandem-repeat domain and the N-terminal stalk region of galectin-3, which are unique in the galectin family, they were removed by extensive proteolytic treatment leaving the C-terminal CRD fully intact, as ascertained by repurification by affinity chromatography and solid phase assays with three (neo)glycoproteins as matrix. The resulting active lectin domain was, however, likewise ineffective in yielding growth inhibition (Fig. 5 D). Yet, presumably as a consequence of the proteolytic truncation, the extent of cell binding was drastically decreased, supporting a role for homophilic interactions between the N-terminal sections of galectin-3 when surface-bound (Fig. 6). In Scatchard analyses using three (neo)glycoproteins as model matrices, theK D values of the truncated molecule were increased 1.4–1.8-fold relative to complete galectin-3 (not shown). Having shown that the two galectins harbored similar binding properties to the cell surface with apparently different effects on cell growth, we next performed experiments to answer the question of whether the homologous galectins would compete for the same set of binding sites on the cell surface. Competition experiments in the two possible settings proved that this was indeed the case (Fig. 7). Not unexpectedly, because of the low level of cell binding (Fig. 6), the C-terminal domain of galectin-3 was only a weak inhibitor. The experiments measuring the extent of cell binding with an iodinated marker in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled inhibitor intimate that galectin-3 might interfere with galectin-1-mediated cell biological effects by competitive inhibition of binding. Added in 10-fold excess relative to galectin-1, the presence of galectin-3 indeed led to normal morphology and unimpaired cell growth (Figs. 3,A and D, and8 C). Coincubation with equal quantities of both lectins expectedly brought about a partial response (Fig. 8 B). Equally expected, the truncated galectin-3, which displayed reduced cell binding (Fig. 6), failed to influence the galectin-1 activity even at a ratio of 10:1 (Fig. 8 E). In addition to the relative lectin amounts we also tested the influence of the timing of inhibitor addition. The cells after preincubation with galectin-1 for 24 h were clearly less sensitive to subsequent galectin-3 addition than those having been preincubated with galectin-1 for only 1 h. Again, the truncated galectin-3 was at best marginally effective as inhibitor of the galectin-1-dependent reduction of neuroblastoma cell proliferation (not shown).Figure 8Evaluation of capacity of galectin-3 and C-terminal domain of galectin-3 to block the effect of galectin-1 on proliferation of cultured neuroblastoma cells. Effect of 125 μg/ml galectin-1 on cell proliferation was assessed as described in the legend of Fig. 6 in the absence of two other galectins and after simultaneous addition of the test substances. A, galectin-1 given alone; B, galectin-1/galectin-3-ratio: 1:1;C, galectin-1/galectin-3-ratio: 1:10; D, galectin-1/galectin-3 C-terminal domain-ratio: 1:1; E, galectin-1/galectin-3 C-terminal domain-ratio: 1:10.

In alphavirus encephalomyelitis, antibody clears infectious virus from neurons in all regions of the central nervous system (CNS), but CD8 T cells contribute to elimination of viral RNA. To understand the role of T cells in clearance, we infected antibody knockout mice with Sindbis virus. Virus was cleared from spinal cord and brain stem neurons, but not from cortical neurons, and required both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Infection with cytokine-expressing recombinant viruses suggested that T cells used interferon-gamma, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha, in clearing virus and that populations of neurons differ in responsiveness to this effector pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1632677476,"Nitrogen is an essential element for life and is often the limiting nutrient for terrestrial ecosystems. As most nitrogen is locked in the kinetically stable form, N2, in the Earth's atmosphere, processes that can fix N2 into biologically available forms-such as nitrate and ammonia-control the supply of nitrogen for organisms. On the early Earth, nitrogen is thought to have been fixed abiotically, as nitric oxide formed during lightning discharge. The advent of biological nitrogen fixation suggests that at some point the demand for fixed nitrogen exceeded the supply from abiotic sources, but the timing and causes of the onset of biological nitrogen fixation remain unclear. Here we report an experimental simulation of nitrogen fixation by lightning over a range of Hadean (4.5-3.8 Gyr ago) and Archaean (3.8-2.5 Gyr ago) atmospheric compositions, from predominantly carbon dioxide to predominantly dinitrogen (but always without oxygen). We infer that, as atmospheric CO2 decreased over the Archaean period, the production of nitric oxide from lightning discharge decreased by two orders of magnitude until about 2.2 Gyr. After this time, the rise in oxygen (or methane) concentrations probably initiated other abiotic sources of nitrogen. Although the temporary reduction in nitric oxide production may have lasted for only 100 Myr or less, this was potentially long enough to cause an ecological crisis that triggered the development of biological nitrogen fixation."

https://openalex.org/W1992709087,"Most arc magmas are thought to be generated by partial melting of the mantle wedge induced by infiltration of slab-derived fluids. However, partial melting of subducting oceanic crust has also been proposed to contribute to the melt generation process, especially when young and hot lithosphere is being subducted. The isotopic composition of boron measured in situ in olivine-hosted primitive melt inclusions in a basaltic andesite from Mt. Shasta, California, is characterized by large negative values that are also highly variable (delta(11)B = -21.3 to -0.9 per mil). The boron concentrations, from 0.7 to 1.6 parts per million, are lower than in most other arc lavas. The relation between concentration and isotopic composition of boron observed here supports a hypothesis that materials left after dehydration of the subducting slab may have contributed to the generation of basaltic andesite lavas at Mt.

https://openalex.org/W1999833414,"The mechanism of action of F1F0-ATP synthase is controversial. Some favor a tri-site mechanism, where substrate must fill all three catalytic sites for activity, others a bi-site mechanism, where one of the three sites is always unoccupied. New approaches were applied to examine this question. First, ITP was used as hydrolysis substrate; lower binding affinities of ITP versus ATP enable more accurate assessment of sites occupancy. Second, distributions of all eight possible enzyme species (with zero, one, two or three sites filled) as fraction of total enzyme population at each ITP concentration were calculated, and compared with measured ITPase activity. Confirming data were obtained with ATP as substrate. Third, we performed a theoretical analysis of possible bi-site mechanisms. The results argue convincingly that bi-site hydrolysis activity is negligible, and may not even exist. Effectively, tri-site hydrolysis is the only mechanism. We argue that only tri-site hydrolysis drives subunit rotation. Theoretical analyses of possible bi-site mechanisms reveal serious flaws, not previously recognized. One is that, in bi-site catalysis, the predicted direction of subunit rotation is the same for both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis; a second is that infrequently occurring enzyme species are required."

In this study, we asked if leukotriene A4 hydrolase co-localizes with 5-lipoxygenase in different types of leukocytes. Examination of rat basophilic leukemia cells by both immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed that leukotriene A4 hydrolase, like 5-lipoxygenase, was most abundant in the nucleus, with only minor occurrences in the cytoplasm. The finding of abundant leukotriene A4 hydrolase in the soluble nuclear fraction was substantiated by two different cell fractionation techniques. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase was also found to accumulate together with 5-lipoxygenase in the nucleus of alveolar macrophages. This result was obtained using both in situand ex vivo techniques. In contrast to these results, peripheral blood neutrophils contained both leukotriene A4hydrolase and 5-lipoxygenase exclusively in the cytoplasm. After adherence of neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase was rapidly imported into the nucleus, whereas leukotriene A4 hydrolase remained cytosolic.

The overproduction of LTB4 plays a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory diseases, including glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, acute lung injury, and interstitial lung disease (9Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 10Henderson W.J. Ann. Intern.

The first step in the synthesis of LTB4 from arachidonic acid is mediated by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which catalyzes the insertion of molecular oxygen into arachidonic acid to form 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid as well as its subsequent dehydration to LTA4 (12Samuelsson B. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19469-19472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTA4 is then modified by the epoxide hydrolase activity of the enzyme LTA4 hydrolase to generate LTB4 (14Haeggstrom J.Z. Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Samuelsson B. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 6: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). Independent of its epoxide hydrolase activity, LTA4hydrolase also has an aminopeptidase activity (15Orning L.

Commun. 1990; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrate that 5-LO is present in the cytoplasm of some cell types and in the nucleoplasm of others (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen X.-S. Naumann T.A. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but predominantly in the nucleoplasm of alveolar macrophages and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and mast cells (17Brock T.G.

Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-LO can be induced to move into the nucleus after various stimuli. For example, 5-LO moves into the nucleus of PMNs after adherence to surfaces or recruitment from the blood into sites of inflammation (20Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, 5-LO moves into the nucleus of eosinophils after adherence (21Brock T.G. Anderson J.A. Fries F.P. Peters-Golden M. Sporn P.H.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1669-1676PubMed Google Scholar) or in response to treatment with cytokines (22Cowburn A.S. Holgate S.T. Sampson A.P. J.

None of the above phenomena are associated with enzyme activation. However, after cell stimulation, 5-LO moves from its site in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to become reversibly associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (24Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The process of membrane association is calcium-dependent (26Rouzer C.A. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7393-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is thought to be essential for the catalytic action of 5-LO. Our current understanding of the enzyme LTA4 hydrolase holds that it is a soluble protein, presumably located within the cytoplasm. Since 5-LO can accumulate in the nucleus of leukocytes, we hypothesized that LTA4 hydrolase might likewise be found within the nucleoplasm. In this study, we demonstrate that the subcellular distribution of LTA4 hydrolase is cell-specific, co-localizing with 5-LO in the nucleoplasm of resting AMs and RBL cells but in the cytoplasm of resting blood PMNs. However, the regulation of nuclear import of LTA4 hydrolase is distinct from that of 5-LO, since only the latter moves into the nucleus after adherence or recruitment of PMNs. F1 male F-344xBN rats at 6 months of age were obtained from the National Institute on Aging. The rats were housed individually in specific pathogen-free conditions for 2 weeks before experimentation. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as approved by the Council of the American Physiological Society and the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1, American Type Culture Collection) were seeded at 1 × 10−5 cell ml−1 in minimal essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were fed 2 days after seeding and harvested on the third day for experimentation. In some experiments, RBL cells were pelleted and resuspended in medium without serum at 2 × 105 cells ml−1.

Purification involved the sequential steps of centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (20Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were >95% neutrophils. For adherence, PMNs were placed on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in Hanks' balanced salts with calcium and magnesium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES for 30 min at 37 °C. Suspension cultured PMNs were maintained in identical conditions in Teflon tubes. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board for Approval of Research Involving Human Subjects. Appendix tissues were obtained from anonymous human subjects undergoing surgery for purposes unrelated to this study. Tissues were supplied by the Tissue Procurement Core of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. For immunocytochemistry, RBL cells were diluted to 1 × 105 cells ml−1 with serum-free media, mounted on slides by cytospin, and fixed immediately in −20 °C methanol for 30 min. Mounts were then permeabilized in −20 °C acetone for 3 min and air-dried. For immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed in Americlear and rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol. All materials were then quenched of endogenous peroxidase activity by treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, washed, and blocked with Powerblock (InnoGenex, San Ramon, CA). Primary antibodies, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human 5-LO and LTA4 hydrolase, were a generous gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst Center for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada. Antibodies were prepared in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (5-LO 1:750, LTA4 hydrolase 1:1000) and applied overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, slides were probed with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, 1:250) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed again, then treated with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as peroxidase substrate; some preparations were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (28Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and after fixation and permeabilization, cells were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and probed with primary antibodies (5-LO, 1:250; LTA4hydrolase, 1:500; tubulin, 1:1000) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed and reprobed with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (titer 1:200), washed, and mounted. In some preparations, nucleic acids were fluorescently labeled using diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Samples were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and imaged with a SPOT Slider digital camera using SPOT Advanced software. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope equipped with LSM software. Enucleation was performed essentially as described (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PBS-washed RBL cells (1 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 15% Ficoll in minimal essential medium-α containing 20 μg ml−1 cytochalasin B and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. This was layered atop a discontinuous gradient of 15, 16, 17, 20, and 25% Ficoll in minimal essential medium-α containing 20 μg ml−1 cytochalasin B and 1 μm EGTA and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 24 °C. Microscopic examination revealed cytoplasts at the 20–25% interface and nucleoplasts in the pellet at the bottom of the Ficoll gradient. Cytoplasts and nucleoplasts were harvested from the gradient, diluted in an equal volume of minimal essential medium-α, centrifuged at 1,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C, and resuspended in TKM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) with protease inhibitors (1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin). An aliquot of the nucleoplasts was sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain nuclear-soluble and nuclear-pelletable fractions. Aliquots of cytoplasts and nucleoplasts were also examined for trypan blue exclusion, counted, and stained for tubulin by indirect immunofluorescence and for DNA with DAPI. Nitrogen cavitation was as described (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with PBS-washed cells suspended in ice-cold TKM buffer with protease inhibitors at 107 cells ml−1 and subjected to nitrogen at 350 p.s.i. for 5 min at 4 °C. Total cell breakage was confirmed by the absence of trypan blue exclusion throughout a broad field of cavitate sample. Cavitate was then centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. The low speed supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to produce cytosolic (supernatant) and non-nuclear membrane (pellet) fractions. The low speed pellet (nuclei) was resuspended in TKM buffer with 0.25 m sucrose, sonicated with 10 brief bursts at a 20% cycle with a Branson sonicator, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to produce nuclear-soluble and -pelletable fractions. In some experiments, 1 mm calcium chloride was included in the TKM buffer throughout the fractionation procedure. A protein assay and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (29Peters-Golden M. McNish R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein concentration was determined by a modified Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce), and 10 μg of each sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, probed with primary antibody (5-LO, 1:3000; LTA4H, 1:5000), washed, and reprobed with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody, 1:5,000). Detection was by ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Hyperfilm chemiluminescent film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The subcellular distribution of LTA4 hydrolase as well as 5-LO was determined first in the RBL-1 cell line, which can generate significant amounts of LTB4 (30Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Piper P.J. Samhoun M.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 76: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By immunocytochemistry, positive staining for LTA4 hydrolase was evident in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, with the nucleus staining more intensely than the cytoplasm (Fig.1). Essentially identical results were obtained for 5-LO; weak positive staining was present in the cytoplasm, whereas the nucleus showed much stronger staining. Cells probed in parallel with non-immune serum did not demonstrate any staining. Indirect immunofluorescent microscopy was used as a second approach to localize LTA4 hydrolase and 5-LO in individual cells; it avoids potential artifacts due to endogenous peroxidase activity, as may occur with immunocytochemistry, and it allows dual staining for DNA. By this method, the cytoplasm stained poorly for LTA4hydrolase and 5-LO, whereas the nucleus stained strongly for both (Fig.1). Nuclear staining with DAPI supported localization of both LTA4 hydrolase and 5-LO to the nucleus. Curiously, the overlay of rhodamine and DAPI signals showed both overlapping and distinct signals for both enzymes, suggesting that the distribution of either enzyme was identical neither to the DNA distribution nor to that of the other enzyme. Although 5-LO has been shown to be soluble within the nucleoplasm of resting cells (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it was not clear from the above analysis whether LTA4 hydrolase was also within the nucleoplasm of RBL cells or simply associated with the nuclear envelope. To address this question, RBL cells dual-stained for LTA4 hydrolase and DNA were imaged by confocal microscopy. When serial optical sections for both stains were collected simultaneously, LTA4 hydrolase was found to co-localize with DNA within the nucleus (Fig. 2). However, as described above, the two signals were not absolutely identical, indicating that the distribution of LTA4 hydrolase did not completely match that of the DNA. In separate experiments involving confocal imaging of 5-LO and DNA distribution in RBL cells, 5-LO was also found to be intranuclear but not identical in distribution to that of DNA (data not shown). Although the above techniques indicate immunodetectable protein within nuclei, they cannot determine if the nuclear protein is soluble and the same molecular weight as the cytosolic protein. As one approach to assess these issues, RBL cells were treated with cytochalasin b and centrifuged through a discontinuous Ficoll gradient. By this technique, >90% nucleus-free cytoplasts were obtained at the 20–25% Ficoll interface, as indicated by positive staining for the cytosolic marker α-tubulin (Fig. 3 B), negative staining for DAPI (not shown), and positive trypan blue exclusion (not shown). Nucleoplasts, characterized as α-tubulin negative (Fig. 3 B), DAPI positive (not shown), and trypan blue staining (not shown) were obtained in the pellet. By immunoblot analysis, both cytoplasts and nucleoplasts contained the 78-kDa 5-LO protein and the 69-kDa LTA4 hydrolase protein (Fig.3 A). As shown previously (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nucleoplasts from RBL cells contain 5-LO in both soluble and pelletable fractions. In contrast, LTA4 hydrolase is restricted to the soluble phase of RBL nucleoplasts (Fig. 3 A). We have previously demonstrated that, under proper conditions, nitrogen cavitation can effectively disrupt cells while maintaining nuclear integrity (17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When this is done in the absence of calcium, 5-LO protein is most abundant in the cytosolic- and nuclear-soluble fractions, although it is also detectable in membrane and nuclear pelletable fractions (Fig. 4 Aand Refs. 17Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 28Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By this technique (and in the same fractions), LTA4 hydrolase is also predominantly in the cytosolic- and nuclear-soluble fractions, although minor amounts can also be detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4A). Because 5-LO can undergo calcium-dependent membrane association after cell stimulation (24Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kargman S. Prasit P. Evans J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23745-23752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because 5-LO and LTA4 hydrolase function sequentially in LTB4synthesis, it was of interest to determine if LTA4hydrolase could demonstrate either calcium-dependent membrane association or membrane association after cell stimulation. As expected, when cells were fractionated in the presence of calcium, the majority of 5-LO protein was found to be associated with the membrane and nuclear-pelletable fractions (Fig. 4 A). However, in the same samples, LTA4 hydrolase remained predominantly soluble, with a distribution among fractions which matched that found in cells not given calcium. When intact RBL cells were stimulated with 1 μmA23187 for 5 min, immunofluorescent detection showed that 5-LO appeared to translocate to nuclear membranes, whereas no change in intranuclear distribution of LTA4 hydrolase was found (Fig. 4 B). To determine if nuclear co-localization of LTA4hydrolase with 5-LO extended to primary leukocytes, we examined rat AMs, which like RBL cells, can synthesize abundant LTB4(27Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Hyzy R. Shelly C. Toews G.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Lung tissue was harvested from normal, untreated rats, inflated and fixed overnight with formalin. Tissue slices were then stained to compare the subcellular localization of LTA4 hydrolase with that of 5-LO in AMs in situ. Positive staining for LTA4 hydrolase, indicated by the brown color developed from the peroxidase substrate DAB, was apparent in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of AMs, with the nucleus staining being consistently darker (Fig. 5, large arrowhead). This contrasts with the staining of alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5,small arrowheads), in which brown staining for hydrolase was present in the cytoplasm but absent from the nuclei, which were light blue due to counterstaining with hematoxylin. Staining for 5-LO in AMs within a serial section was, like that for hydrolase, heaviest within the nucleus but also evident within the cytoplasm. In serial sections probed with non-immune serum, brown staining was negligible. The subcellular distribution of LTA4 hydrolase was also assessed in AMs isolated from the lung by lavage. By indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, LTA4 hydrolase, like 5-LO, was accumulated within the nucleus, although light staining for both enzymes was also detectable within the cytoplasm (Fig.6). Nuclear localization within given fields was confirmed by positive staining with DAPI. Previously, we have shown that 5-LO is found predominantly in the cytosolic- and nuclear-soluble fractions of AMs broken by nitrogen cavitation (28Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, LTA4 hydrolase was most abundant in the same fractions of rat AMs broken and fractionated in the same way (Fig.7).Figure 7Distribution of LTA4 hydrolase in rat AM subcellular fractions. Freshly isolated AMs were subjected to nitrogen cavitation, with subsequent fractionation by differential centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions were then probed for LTA4 hydrolase by immunoblot analysis. Fractions are cytosolic (C), non-nuclear membrane (M), nuclear soluble (Ns), and nuclear pelletable (Np).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to RBL cells and AMs, PMNs synthesize abundant LTB4. However, unlike RBL cells and AMs, PMNs from peripheral blood have 5-LO solely in the cytoplasm, and the import of 5-LO into the nucleus occurs after adherence of PMNs to surfaces or recruitment of PMNs into sites of inflammation (20Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When peripheral blood PMNs were maintained in suspension and probed for LTA4 hydrolase as well as 5-LO protein by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, both proteins were found to be exclusively cytosolic (Fig.8). When PMNs were allowed to adhere to a fibronectin-coated surface for 30 min, 5-LO accumulated strongly within the multi-lobed nuclei, whereas LTA4 hydrolase remained outside the nucleus (Fig. 8). The subcellular distributions of LTA4 hydrolase and 5-LO in PMNs were also determined in situ using immunohistochemistry applied to tissue sections. In PMNs situated in vessels in healthy rat lung, positive staining for 5-LO (Fig.9 A) and LTA4hydrolase (Fig. 9 B) was restricted to the cytoplasm. When sections of tissue from inflamed appendix were probed for 5-LO, strong nuclear staining of recruited polymorphonuclear cells was evident (Fig.9 C), as expected. Serial sections from the same inflamed tissue probed for LTA4 hydrolase showed the darkest staining associated with polymorphonuclear cells, with lighter positive staining associated with mesenchymal tissue and epithelial cells (Fig.9, D and E). In recruited polymorphonuclear cells as well as other tissue cells, hydrolase staining was predominantly cytosolic. Thus, LTA4 hydrolase can co-localize with 5-LO in the cytoplasm, as in peripheral blood PMNs, or it can segregate from 5-LO, as when it is cytosolic and 5-LO is intranuclear in recruited PMNs. In the present study, we have used multiple techniques to compare the subcellular distribution of two enzymes, 5-LO and LTA4hydrolase, which work sequentially to synthesize LTB4 from arachidonic acid. We have shown for the first time that LTA4 hydrolase can be found in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with 5-LO in resting AMs and RBL cells. In both cell types, lesser amounts of LTA4 hydrolase and 5-LO were also present in the cytoplasm. We also have found that LTA4hydrolase co-localizes with 5-LO in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood PMNs. However, in this cell type, LTA4 hydrolase does not move into the nucleus with 5-LO after adherence or recruitment of these cells. Finally, we have demonstrated that, unlike 5-LO, LTA4 hydrolase does not show calcium-dependent membrane association or translocation after cell stimulation. The finding that LTA4 hydrolase can accumulate in the nucleus of AMs and RBL cells is particularly surprising, since the current thought is that this enzyme is exclusively cytoplasmic. Indeed, the current characterization for this protein in the Swiss-Prot data bank gives its subcellular distribution as “cytoplasmic.” Consistent with this characterization, epithelial and mesenchymal cells in Figs. 5 and 9 lack nuclear staining for LTA4 hydrolase. This suggests that only certain cell types may show nuclear import of LTA4 hydrolase. Nuclear import of small molecules may proceed by diffusion, whereas nuclear import of larger molecules, like the 69-kDa LTA4hydrolase, requires the presence of a nuclear import sequence, which typically consists of a cluster of basic amino acids (32Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, LTA4 hydrolase has several such clusters, most notably at (human) 186RKIYK. Interestingly, one of the structural domains of LTA4 hydrolase, noted by Haeggstrom and co-workers (33Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), features armadillo repeats. These structural elements are also found on the nuclear import-mediating importin proteins, suggesting the possibility that LTA4 hydrolase could instead directly interact with importin-β or the nuclear pore complex. Activation of a nuclear import sequence typically involves a phosphorylation step (34Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) as a second requirement for nuclear import. Although there is evidence that LTA4 hydrolase can be phosphorylated at serine 415 (35Rybina I.V. Liu H. Gor Y. Feinmark S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31865-31871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether this specific phosphorylation event has any effect on subcellular distribution. Clearly, much work is necessary to better understand the mechanism of nuclear import of LTA4 hydrolase. The regulation of the subcellular distribution of LTA4hydrolase can be important in many ways. Most obviously, it may affect LTB4 synthesis. Both AMs and RBL cells, which co-localize 5-LO with LTA4 hydrolase, efficiently metabolize LTA4 to LTB4, as indicated by their ability to secrete large amounts of LTB4 with negligible amounts of LTA4. In contrast, PMNs, which can readily segregate 5-LO from LTA4 hydrolase, secrete significant amounts of LTA4 as well as LTB4 (36Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is possible that part of the explanation for the inefficient conversion of LTA4 to LTB4 in PMNs lies in the spatial separation of 5-LO and LTA4 hydrolase. Another intriguing role for nuclear import of LTA4hydrolase may relate to regulating the levels of LTA4within the nucleus. Since 5-LO can accumulate in the nucleus, significant amounts of its end product, LTA4, will be generated within that compartment. LTA4 apparently has a striking capacity to bind to constituents of DNA (37Reiber D.C. Murphy R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This in turn may have the potential to affect transcriptional events. By facilitating the conversion of LTA4 to LTB4, the co-localization of LTA4 hydrolase with 5-LO in the nucleus might reduce the amount of intranuclear LTA4 available to bind to DNA. Finally, nuclear import of LTA4 hydrolase might be relevant to the aminopeptidase function of this enzyme. Although mice that were deficient for LTA4 hydrolase revealed no evidence for an aminopeptidase role for the enzyme (38Byrum R.S. Goulet J.L. Snouwaert J.N. Griffiths R.J. Koller B.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6810-6819PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that such a function only becomes apparent when the enzyme is in a particular subcellular locale. This possibility will require additional investigation. In summary, we have shown that LTA4 hydrolase can reside, with 5-LO, within the nucleoplasm of AMs and RBL cells. Moreover, the import of LTA4 hydrolase into the nucleus does not necessarily coincide with that of 5-LO, as can be seen in adherent and recruited PMNs. These results indicate that the nuclear import of LTA4 hydrolase is a regulated event that only occurs in some cell types under specific conditions. LTA4 hydrolase is ubiquitously expressed in non-leukocytic cell types as well, and its import in such cell types remains to be evaluated. Furthermore, failure to correctly regulate the subcellular distribution of LTA4hydrolase may play a role in disease. These possibilities will be the subject of future investigations."

In the study we found evidence for the molecular basis of gating the cloned KATP by intracellular protons. Systematic constructions of chimerical Kir6.2-Kir1.1 channels indicated that full pH sensitivity required the N terminus, C terminus, and M2 region. Three amino acid residues were identified in these protein domains, which are Thr-71 in the N terminus, Cys-166 in the M2 region, and His-175 in the C terminus. Mutation of any of them to their counterpart residues in Kir1.1 was sufficient to completely eliminate the pH sensitivity. Creation of these residues rendered the mutant channels clear pH-dependent activation. Thus, critical players in gating KATP by protons are demonstrated. The pH sensitivity enables the KATP to regulate cell excitability in a number of physiological and pathophysiological conditions when pH is low but ATP concentration is normal."

The SR proteins contain a unique RS domain at the C-terminal region and one or two RNA recognition motifs at the N-terminal region (reviewed in Ref.15Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). The SR proteins appear to be involved in the selection of both 3′- and 5′-splice sites. It has been shown that SR proteins recruit U2AF65 to the upstream 3′-splice site through direct interaction with U2AF35 (17Wang Z. Hoffman H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 19Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). SR proteins also mediate the recognition of a downstream 5′-splice site by U1 snRNP in certain pre-mRNAs (12Staknis D.

Grabowski P.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been shown that SR proteins, such as SC35 and SF2/ASF, can simultaneously interact with the U170k and U2AF35 protein subunits to stabilize the association of the 5′- and 3′-splice sites in the early spliceosome (18Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In most studies, the exonic splicing enhancers are identified as purine-rich sequences present in cellular pre-mRNAs (e.g. Refs. 3Lavigueur A. Branche H.L. Kornblihtt A.R. Chabot B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2405-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Sun Q. Mayeda A. Hampson R.K. Krainer A.R. Rottman F.M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), whereas in recent years certain non-purine-rich splicing enhancers are also found through cycled selection (SELEX) from pre-mRNAs containing random sequences (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,25Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Specific RNA sequences with high affinity for purified SR proteins have been identified as a short consensus selected from pools of random sequences and shown to serve as splicing enhancers (7Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L. Cell. 1998; 93: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,28Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In these studies, the RNA consensus for binding each SR protein ranges from 6 to 10 nucleotides in length (reviewed in Ref. 16Tacke R. Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, when assayed for splicing enhancer activity, both the selected consensus and its flanking sequences or multiple copies of the consensus must be inserted in pre-mRNAs. This raises the question of whether each selected consensus alone is the complete binding motif for the SR protein and is sufficient as a splicing enhancer. Our previous study has obtained very efficient yet extremely diverse splicing enhancers that stimulate exon inclusion in a two intron/three exon pre-mRNA, DUP184 (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such diversity was likely because of the fact that no consensus sequences could be derived from limited sequencing data of highly complex pool of enhancers enriched through various mechanisms of action. We have attempted to specifically isolate individual motifs through selectively enriching subpopulations of the whole pool. We hope that such subpopulations with greatly reduced sequence complexity would yield one or more enhancer motifs. In the present investigation, we have developed a unique method to directly isolate and identify minimum enhancer motifs from particular subpopulations of enhancers containing variable number of random nucleotides. We have identified RNA motifs that have strong enhancer activity and specifically interact with SRp30. The materials and methods used for selection of exon inclusion enhancers were essentially as previously described (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that a newly designed primer (primer 7, 5′-GCCATTCGTAATGTCTGCCCATTCTGCT-3′) replaced the previously used primer 6. The positions of both primers are shown in Fig.1 B. For this study, the pool of sequences obtained by five cycles of in vitro splicing and reverse transcriptase-PCR1 from the previous study was initially used as the starting material for PCR with primers 7 and 5 to generate fragment R'. The full-length DNA template was obtained by overlapping extension with two overlapping halves of the template obtained by PCR with primers 1 and 2, fragment R′, and primer 4, respectively. After an additional four cycles of selection the reconstructed DNA template was ligated into pSP64 vector throughHindIII-BamHI restriction sites (Promega). The plasmid DNA was used to transform DH5α Escherichia colicells, and individual clones were sequenced. Templates of LP4.19R, 4.7R, 4.7RA, 4.7RB, 4.7RC, and 4.7RD for transcription were constructed via site-directed mutagenesis from two halves. To construct the 5′-halves of the templates, DUP184REV plasmid 2Z. Dominski and R. Kole, unpublished data. was subjected to PCR with primer 1 (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the primers 5′ 4.19 (CTGCTGCTCCTCGTCGTCTTATCCGCCAAGTACAA), 5′ 4.7 (CAGTTCTGCTGAGTCGTCTTATCCGCCAAGTACAA), 5′ 4.7A (CAGTTCTGCTGACTGCTGTTATCCGCCAAGTACAA), 5′ 4.7B (CAGTTCTGGTGAGTGGTCTTATCCGCCAAGTACAA), 5′ 4.7C (CAGTTCTGGTGACTGGTGTTATCCGCCAAGTACAA), 5′ 4.7D (GGAGGGCACAGTTAGTCGTCTTATCCGCCAAGTAC), respectively. The 3′-halves of the templates containing an overlapping sequence with the 5′-half were obtained by PCR with primer 4 and the primers 3′ 4.19 (GACGACGAGGAGCAGCAGACTGTGCCCTCCATGC), 3′ 4.7 (GACGACTCAGCAGAACTGTGCCCTCCATGC), 3′ 4.7A (CAGCAGTCAGCAGAACTGTGCCCTCCATGC), 3′ 4.7B (GACCACTCACCAGAACTGTGCCCTCCATGC), 3′ 4.7C (CACCAGTCACCAGAACTGTGCCCTCCATGC), 3′ 4.7D (GACGACTAACTGTGCCCTCCATGC). The full-length templates were obtained by overlapping extension of the two halves through PCR, digested with HindIII andBamHI and were cloned into the pSP64 vector. To prepare pre-mRNAs for in vitro splicing, the plasmids were linearized with BamHI and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Konarska M.M. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1984; 38: 731-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The HeLa nuclear extract was prepared as described (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar). RNA splicing was carried out in a mixture of around 10 μg/μl HeLa nuclear extract, 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled pre-mRNA and splicing buffer containing 1.3% polyvinyl alcohol, 1.5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 3 mm MgCl2 (31Krainer A.R.T. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The splicing products were extracted with phenol and precipitated in ethanol and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA. The 32P-labeled RNA probes used for filter binding and UV cross-linking assays were transcribedin vitro by T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) from synthesized DNA templates and four different [α-32P]NTP following the manufacturer's instructions and purified on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. For the binding reaction, 3 μg/μl of HeLa nuclear extract, 0.2 μg/μl of tRNA, and splicing buffer were incubated on ice for 20 min with 30,000 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA probes in a total volume of 10 μl. The mixtures were added with 40 μl of splicing buffer before loaded onto a set of stacking nitrocellulose and Nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) pre-equilibrated with splicing buffer and mounted on a 96-well manifold (Schleicher & Schuell). After passed through the filters by vacuum, the membranes were washed once with 50 μl of splicing buffer. The membranes were separated and autoradiographed on a phosphorimager. For UV cross-linking, protein/RNA mixtures in a volume of 10 μl as above were irradiated with UV (short wave range) at about 7 milliwatts/cm2 on ice with a UV transilluminator (Fotodyne) for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the samples from UV cross-linking were diluted with 40 μl of IP buffer (20 mm pH 7.9 Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and precipitated with 4.8 μg of monoclonal antibody 1H4 specific for SR proteins (BAbCO) and 4 μl of flurry protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for overnight. The beads were washed twice with 50 μl of IP buffer. The precipitated proteins were treated with 5 μg of RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C, dissolved in SDS loading buffer, and resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide/SDS gel. The gel was dried before autoradiography. Equal amounts of HeLa nuclear extract were loaded onto columns containing streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) without RNA or tagged with RNA containing the enhancer LP4.7 (5′-GACGACUCAGCAGCCAGAGGUCGAUGUACU-3′), LP4.19 (5′-GACGACGAGGAGCAGCAGCCAGAGGUCGAUGUACU-3′), or the equivalent DUP184 sequence (5′-GUAUACAGAAUAGCAGAAUGCCAGAGGUCGAUGUACU-3′). The RNA tags were appended to the beads by hybridizing them to a biotinylated 2′-O-methyl-RNA oligonucleotide (5′-biotin-AGUACAUCGACCUCUGG-3′) that is complementary to the extended 3′ common sequence of the RNA tags. The flow-through extract samples were collected and adjusted to equal volumes with Buffer D (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) and tested for splicing activities. Autoradiography was either processed with Fuji x-ray film or by a Storm 840 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). The efficiency of internal exon inclusion was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograms using the NIH Image 1.47 software or directly quantitated on a phosphorimager. The percentage of products with an included internal exon relative to the sum of the total mRNA products was calculated. Through an iterated enrichment process, we have obtained largely diverse exonic splicing enhancers that promote exon inclusion during splicing of a human β-globin-based pre-mRNA (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have then attempted to isolate particular splicing enhancer motifs by selectively amplifying homologous sequences from the complex pool of enhancers. As the starting material for the experiments described in this study, we used the previously obtained pre-mRNA library containing a 20-nt random sequence in an internal exon (DUP184 cycle 5 in Ref. 9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to generate a less diverse pre-mRNA library. Different from the previous primer 6, which was completely complementary to the exon sequence flanking the random 20 nt, we extended the 3′-end of primer 6 by adding a 10-nt leader of the original DUP184 sequence, which showed no splicing enhancer activity. When annealed to the exon, this 10-nt leader of the modified primer (primer 7, Fig.1 B) would overhang from the adjacent flank into the random 20 nt and freely hybridize with any short complementary sequence present within or outside the random 20 nt of pre-mRNAs (Fig. 1 B). If the DUP184 cycle 5 pool contains sequences complementary to the 3′-end of primer 7, they would be amplified through PCR and therefore become templates for the new pre-mRNA library. To test this concept, the DNA template of DUP184 cycle 5 was subjected to PCR with primers 5 and 7, and the amplified fragment (R′ in Fig.1 A) was used to reconstruct the full-length DNA template for pre-mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Sequencing of 30 individual clones isolated from the reconstructed pool (Pool LP0) showed that primers 5 and 7 have indeed amplified sequences from the DUP184 cycle 5 pool. In these clones, the random sequences were greatly varied in length with a roughly even distribution from 0 to 18 nt (Fig. 1 C), although the “in-frame” random sequences should have been 10 nt in length. Only 5 clones contained random 10 nt (clones LP0.4, LP0.8, LP0.11, LP0.28, LP0.29) while three clones contained random sequences longer than 10 nt, and the majority had shorter or no random sequences. Surprisingly, no clones with truncations outside the random region were found through the preliminary sequencing. We conclude that the variable number of random nucleotides in different clones resulted from annealing of the 3′-leader of primer 7 at variable positions within the random region of the internal exon during PCR. The pool of LP0 pre-mRNAs was subjected to four cycles of selection with previously described methods (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Individual pre-mRNAs from the pool LP0 and final pool LP4 were tested for splicing activity. Nearly all LP0 pre-mRNAs showed less than 40% inclusion of the internal exon in splicing probably because of the disruption of previously selected splicing enhancers during reconstruction of the pre-mRNA pool (data not shown). In contrast, the majority of the LP4 pre-mRNAs showed much greater exon inclusion (Fig.2 A), indicating that the reconstruction had isolated and further enriched a subpopulation of splicing enhancers from the pool of extremely diverse pre-mRNAs. Analysis on the sequences of 45 LP4 clones showed that the selection had narrowed down the length distribution of the random sequences. Clones with fewer than 6 randomized nt were eliminated from the pool LP4 during selection, and thirty-five of the clones (78%) contained 10 ± 2 random nt (Table I). We had divided the sequences into three groups based on homology. In Group I, 5 clones (Fig. 2 B, clones LP4.17, LP4.19, LP4.27, LP4.37, LP4.44) contained an identical 12 nt sequence, ACGACGAGGAGC. Unexpectedly, when combined with the 5′- and the 3′-flanking nucleotides, this redundant sequence formed a symmetrical motif gACGACGAGGAGCagcag (the flanking nucleotides are in lowercase). Sequences of this group indicated the consensus [gACGAC····Cagcag] with a variable purine-rich core in most clones, although a few contained no purine-rich core (e.g. LP4.7, Fig. 2 A). Fourteen clones from pool LP4 contain this motif, or 31% of the pool, although only 1 clone (LP0.14) from pool LP0 matches this consensus, or 3.3%. Therefore, this motif has been enriched approximately 10-fold from pool LP0 to LP4. In Group II, sequences point to the consensus [gAC··purine-rich··cag] with a variable purine-rich core in the middle (Fig. 2 A). There are 21 clones in LP4 in this group, or 46.7% of the pool, while 13 clones in pool LP0, or 43.3%. Therefore, there is nearly no enrichment for this motif from pool LP0 to LP4. Group III contains both purine-rich and non-purine-rich sequences without a consensus. This study has focused on investigating whether the Group I motif represents strong splicing enhancers and whether the symmetrical structure per se plays a role in exon inclusion.Table ILength distribution of the selected sequencesPoolLP0LP4LengthTotal no. of clonesnt3045 03– 12– 2–– 31– 41– 51– 622 737 858 949105611–5122713––14––15––16––17––1811 Open table in a new tab Because the purine-rich core GAGGAG of LP4.19 conforms to the exon-splicing enhancer GARGAR present in other pre-mRNAs (e.g. Ref. 32Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine the contribution of the purine-rich core to splicing enhancer activity. As a comparison, we used LP4.7, which lacks the purine-rich core but has the same motif and a single uridine present at the center (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 3, the LP4.19 pre-mRNA included the internal exon very efficiently during splicing (lane 4), and the LP4.7 pre-mRNA showed only slightly lower exon inclusion (lane 5). This indicates that the motif [GACGAC·····CAGCAG] largely retained enhancer activity in the absence of the purine-rich core. To examine the effect of the symmetrical structure of the motif on splicing enhancer activity, LP4.19 and LP4.7, and several modified LP4.7 sequences either retaining or lacking a symmetrical structure (Fig. 3, LP4.7RB, LP4.7RA, and LP4.7RC), as well as the sequence corresponding to the 5′ portion of the motif (GACGAC, LP4.7DR) were introduced via site-directed mutagenesis to the equivalent positions in the internal exon of the construct DUP184REV, in which a major portion of the internal exon was in reverse orientation relative to that of DUP184. As shown in Fig. 3, while the original DUP184REV pre-mRNA included the middle exon even less efficiently than DUP184 (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 2, respectively), the LP4.19 and LP4.7 sequences placed in DUP184REV enhanced exon inclusion as efficiently as in DUP184 (lanes 4–7), indicating that they retained splicing enhancer activity in a different sequence context. Deletion of the right-half portion of the motif drastically reduced its enhancer activity (lane 8), indicating that the 3′ portion of the motif (CAGCAG) is also required for the splicing enhancer activity even though the 3′ portion by itself has no splicing enhancer activity. In addition, it appears that the particular selected sequence rather than the symmetrical structure per se contributed to the splicing enhancer activity, as nucleotide substitutions either retaining or disrupting a symmetrical structure also led to dramatically reduced exon inclusion (lanes 9–11). To test whether the selected splicing enhancer motifs interact with protein factors in the HeLa nuclear extract, we used a double filter binding method (33Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Internally 32P-labeled RNA probes of the selected motifs (LP4.19 and LP4.7) and several mutated sequences lacking the motifs (LP4.19A, LP4.7A, LP4.7B, LP4.7C, and LP4.7D), as well as the equivalent DUP184 sequence were incubated with HeLa nuclear extract. The mixtures were passed through the stacking nitrocellulose and nylon filters. As shown in Fig.4 A, around 60% of the input LP4.19 and LP4.7 RNA probes were present in RNA-protein complexes and bound to the nitrocellulose membrane, while only 9–17% of the input DUP184, LP4.19A, LP4.7A, LP4.7B, LP4.7C, and LP4.7D RNA probes were retained on the nitrocellulose membrane. To determine whether the selected splicing enhancers interact with SR proteins, a mixture of fully internally 32P-labeled RNA probes (DUP184, LP4.19, LP4.19A, LP4.7, 4.7A, LP4.7B, LP4.7C, and LP4.7D) and HeLa nuclear extract were irradiated with UV after incubation. The cross-linking products were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 1H4 that recognizes all members of the SR protein family. The immunoprecipitates were treated with RNase before being resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both LP4.7 and LP4.19 probes were cross-linked to SRp30. In contrast, mutations that changed the LP4.19 and LP4.7 enhancer motifs (LP4.19A, LP4.7A, B, C, and D) abolished their interaction with SRp30. Therefore, the specific interaction of the selected LP4.7 and LP4.19 motifs and SRp30 strongly correlates with their splicing enhancer activity. Consistent with its lack of splicing enhancer activity, the DUP184 sequence was not recognized by SR proteins. In separate experiments, depletion of the SRp30 from HeLa nuclear extract by affinity columns tagged with either the LP4.7 or LP4.19 RNA motifs has led to the inhibition of splicing of the LP4.7 and LP4.19 pre-mRNAs, while depletion with the DUP184 RNA sequence showed nearly no effect on splicing (data not shown). It is possible that the SRp30 is an essential splicing factor or that by binding to exonic enhancers the SRp30 interacts with other general splicing factors in the early spliceosome, so that depletion of the SRp30 also removed these general splicing factors and abolished the splicing activity of the nuclear extract. Selection of particular RNA molecules from a random sequence library provides a powerful tool for identifying binding motifs or for selecting new catalysts (34Ekland E.H. Szostak J.W. Bartel D.P. Science. 1995; 269: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 35Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7469) Google Scholar, 36Tsang J. Joyce G.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5966-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7889) Google Scholar). Because the exact number of nucleotides involved in binding or catalysis is mostly unknown prior to selection, the number of residues to be randomized is in most cases arbitrarily chosen. The “consensus” sequences identified by such method are the homologous regions present among the multiple selected winners but may not necessarily represent the complete motifs for binding or function. In most cases, sequences outside the consensus must also be included for proper activity. Our study shows that complete sequence motifs can be directly identified from a complex pool enriched for multiple targets by isolating a subpopulation of sequences of variegated length. This method uses a primer extended from the fixed flanking region to isolate and amplify a subpopulation that shares a common short sequence through annealing with the extended 3′-leader of the primer in PCR. Consequently, a library with variable number of nucleotides but a common short sequence in the random region is obtained. We believe that by using PCR primers with various leader sequences different subpopulations of the whole pool, which represent various regions of the sequence space, may be isolated and individually enriched to a further extent. As a result, multiple sequence identities from selections for very complex targets may be rapidly determined. Although in our study short sequences recognized by the 3′-leader of the selective primer are present in certain selected enhancers, they do not have to be part of the enhancer motifs. In search for unknown splicing enhancers, RNA sequences have been selected against purified SR proteins through binding affinity (7Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Tacke R. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Manley J.L.

RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, the splicing enhancer activity has not been involved in selection mechanism. Not surprisingly, all selected high-affinity binding sequences are not splicing enhancers (e.g. Ref. 28Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We and others have used function-based SELEX to simultaneously select various exonic splicing enhancers regardless of the mechanism of action (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Coulter L.R. Landree M.A. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell.

Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Although the in vitro selections have generated a much broader spectrum of splicing enhancers than those identified in vivo, it is difficult to identify particular motifs based on limited sequencing data due to the presence of extremely diverse enhancers (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In this study we have developed a unique method to isolate a motif through selective amplification of a subpopulation from a complex pool of splicing enhancers, which is shown to specifically interact with SRp30. We believe that with our method, various motifs recognized by different splicing factors can be isolated from a very complex pool of enhancers when the identity of particular motifs cannot be revealed through preliminary selection. A subpopulation of exonic enhancers isolated from our previously enriched pool of splicing enhancers contained a variable number of random nucleotides ranging from 0 to 18. After a few additional rounds of selection, the length of the random sequences in 45 randomly chosen clones ranged from 6 to 12 nucleotides (Table I). The pre-mRNAs with fewer or no random sequences (e.g. LP0.3, LP0.7, and LP0.9) were eliminated through further selection. The progress of selection is associated with increasing splicing enhancer activity of the pool and enrichment of the most efficient splicing enhancers,e.g. LP4.19 and LP4.7 (Figs. 2 and 3). It is unlikely that enhanced exon inclusion is due to the removal of a negative element from exon as observed in other studies (39Amendt B.A. Si Z.H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 40McNally L.M. McNally M.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nemeroff M.E. Utans U. Kramer A. Krug R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), because replacement of the original DUP184 sequence with either random sequences prior to selection or various defined sequences largely maintained predominant exon skipping (9Tian H. Kole R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6291-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 3H. Tian and R. Kole, unpublished data. Therefore we conclude that specific splicing enhancers have been enriched through the cycled selection employed in our studies. The alternative splicing of pre-mRNA involves the selection of a particular pair of 5′- and 3′-splice sites from other possible combinations of potential splice sites present in the same pre-mRNA. This process appears to be largely facilitated by SR proteins that link the appropriate splice sites in the early spliceosome (e.g. Ref. 18Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). From a very complex pool of splicing enhancers, we have isolated a splicing enhancer motif (GACGAC···CAGCAG) that stimulates exon inclusion and specifically interacts with SRp30. Two studies have independently identified similar but shorter consensus (RGACKACGAY, R = A/G, K = G/U, Y = C/U) in exonic enhancers that are recognized by the SR protein 9G8 and stimulate splicing of an upstream intron (26Schaal T.D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1705-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Cavaloc Y. Bourgeois C.F. Kister L. Stevenin J. RNA. 1999; 5: 468-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, in either case the role of the sequences adjacent to the consensus in splicing enhancer activity or in binding with 9G8 has not been characterized. Therefore, the consensus identified in these studies may not represent the complete splicing enhancers, as the adjacent sequences obtained from selection were also inserted in the pre-mRNAs when the enhancer activity was assayed. In contrast, our approach allowed direct identification of the complete enhancer motifs through systematic comparison of a selectively amplified subpopulation of enhancers variegated in length. Although the enhancer motifs identified in our study are mostly symmetrical in contents, it is apparent that the particular 5′ and 3′ sequences rather than the symmetrical structure present in these motifs are essential for splicing enhancer activity, because nucleotide substitutions that either disrupted the original symmetrical structure or created a new symmetrical sequence dramatically reduced exon inclusion and abolished their interaction with SR proteins (Figs. 3 and 4). In our preliminary experiments, the RNA probe GACGACGA representing the 5′ portion of our selected motif was rapidly degraded in HeLa nuclear extract, indicating that this sequence itself may not be sufficient to specifically interact with any proteins (data not shown). We have also found that a 3′ adjacent sequence AGCAGCAG is required for both splicing enhancer activity and binding with SRp30, because replacement of this sequence by the sequence at further downstream of the exon abolished exon inclusion and binding with SRp30 (LP4.7RD, Fig. 3; LP4.7D, Fig. 4). Therefore, the 3′ portion AGCAG, although by itself shows a lack of enhancer activity in the original DUP184 pre-mRNA, makes a significant contribution to the enhancer activity and therefore part of the enhancer motif. We are not certain whether the SRp30 cross-linked with the RNA probes in our study is 9G8. However, it is apparent that although we and others have obtained a similar splicing enhancer consensus, degenerate but particular 3′ adjacent sequences are also required for enhancer activity and interaction with SR proteins. The SRp30 observed in our study may participate in the early spliceosome assembly through direct interaction with the enhancer motifs of the pre-mRNAs and with other general splicing factors, as depletion of the SRp30 from the nuclear extract through affinity chromatography using the enhancer motifs has dramatically reduced splicing activity (data not shown). We are now characterizing particular proteins purified by affinity chromatography tagged with the selected enhancers, by protein mass spectrometry or microsequencing. This will allow us not only to identity the SRp30 but also to find other associated general splicing factors in the early spliceosome. Although the purine-rich core GAGGAG is present in many selected enhancers in our study (Fig. 2 B), it is dispensable for their splicing enhancer activity, as the absence of the purine-rich core only slightly reduced exon inclusion (Fig. 3) and did not abolish the cross-linking of the enhancer motif with SRp30 (Fig. 4). This is in contrast with observations by others in which purine-rich GARGAR enhancers specifically interact with SR proteins (e.g. Refs.1Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tacke R. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We conclude that the selected enhancer motif (GACGAC···CAGCAG) largely contributes to the splicing enhancer activity observed in our study. We thank John P.

We have previously shown that the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression by modulating the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of TATA-binding protein (TBP). In this study, we asked whether the p38 MAP kinase regulated the transcriptional activity of AP-1. We found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was unable to drive the AP-1-dependent reporter gene in THP-1 cells. PMA activated both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAP kinases, but it did not activate the p38 MAP kinase. We found that cells expressing MAP kinase kinase 6(Glu), which is the upstream kinase that activates the p38 MAP kinase, had significantly increased AP-1-dependent gene expression alone and when stimulated with PMA. These cells also had increased phosphorylation of native c-Jun, suggesting that both c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinases phosphorylate c-Jun. More importantly, expression of a constitutive active MAP kinase kinase 6(Glu) resulted in the phosphorylation of a His-TBP fusion protein and increased direct interaction of TBP with c-Jun. These findings suggest that in macrophages, the p38 MAP kinase regulates AP-1-driven transcription by modulating the activation of TBP.

AP-1 is a dimeric complex composed of members of the Fos and Jun proteins (1Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). These families of proteins are members of the basic leucine zipper group of proteins, and the basic leucine zipper motif mediates the formation of homo- and heterodimers. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is often used to induce AP-1 activity (2Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). AP-1 DNA binding does not always correlate with transcriptional activity. In fact, the induction of transcriptional activity requires the phosphorylation of c-Jun at N-terminal sites and c-Fos at C-terminal sites (3Karin M. J. Biol.

In addition, it has been suggested that the interaction of all Jun family members and c-Fos and FosB with the basal transcription factors, transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and TATA-binding protein (TBP), may be necessary for transcriptional activation (9Metz R.

The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a family of second messenger kinases that are essential for transferring signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases have been linked to AP-1 activation (12Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1996; 183: 2017-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ERK MAP kinase does not directly increase AP-1 transcriptional activity by phosphorylation of either c-Jun or c-Fos; rather, it phosphorylates Elk-1, which induces c-Fos synthesis (12Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 16Chou M.M. Fajardo J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell.

ERK MAP kinase also phosphorylates c-Jun at a C-terminal site, Ser-243, which actually inhibits its transcriptional activity (12Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In contrast, the JNK MAP kinase phosphorylates c-Jun at the N-terminal sites Ser-63 and Ser-73, which increases its transcriptional activity (12Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 17Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The JNK MAP kinase, however, does not phosphorylate c-Fos. Unlike ERK or JNK, the p38 MAP kinase has been linked to AP-1 DNA binding but not phosphorylation of either c-Fos or c-Jun (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Based on our previous data showing that the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression by modulating the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of TBP (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we analyzed the role of the p38 MAP kinase in the regulation of AP-1-dependent gene expression in THP-1 cells. Utilizing a promoter construct driven only by AP-1, we found that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) alone was unable to drive the AP-1-dependent reporter gene. PMA activated both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases, but it did not activate the p38 MAP kinase. We found that cells expressing a constitutive active MKK6(Glu), the upstream kinase of the p38 MAP kinase, had significantly increased AP-1-dependent gene expression in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, and SB 203580, a competitive inhibitor of p38, abrogated the effect of MKK6(Glu). AP-1 DNA binding was not altered by inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase, but the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector enhanced the phosphorylation of a His-TBP fusion protein. In addition, cells expressing MKK6(Glu) had increased direct interaction of TBP with c-Jun, whereas PMA alone had no significant effect on this interaction. We performed similar studies in RAW 264.7 macrophages, cells in which the p38 MAP kinase is activated by PMA. In these cells, AP-1-dependent gene expression was increased by PMA alone. These findings suggest that in macrophages, the p38 MAP kinase regulates AP-1-driven transcription by modulating the activation of TBP. The THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with gentamicin and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For in vivo phosphorylation studies, the cells were cultured in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the same supplements, and for in vivo kinase assays, the cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with gentamicin and 0.5% fetal calf serum. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with gentamicin and 10% fetal calf serum. AP-1-dependent gene expression was evaluated using a luciferase reporter plasmid (pAP-1-luc) driven by six tandem copies of the AP-1 enhancer linked to a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The pcDNA-MKK6(Glu) and pCMV-Flag-p38 plasmids have been previously described (a generous gift from Dr. Roger Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) (21Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S.

Transfections were performed utilizing the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with PMA (Sigma) at a dose of 100 ng/ml. Luciferase activity, which was normalized to total protein, was measured after 6 h, which was determined to be the time of maximal activity. When used, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was used at 0.5 μm and added 1 h prior to PMA. THP-1 cells were stimulated with PMA for 3 h, and nuclear protein was extracted as previously described (23Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

A consensus AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and binding reactions were performed as previously described (23Carter A.B.

Supershift assays were performed by incubating nuclear extracts with c-Fos or c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 30 min prior to the binding reaction with the labeled oligonucleotide. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described (25Carter A.B. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The p38, JNK1, or ERK2 MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated from the lysates overnight at 4 °C with their respective rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to Gammabind with Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitrokinase activity was assayed as previously described using ATF-2, c-Jun, or TFIID (TBP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a substrate (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J.

Co-transfection of the pTRE-luc with the pTET-ATF plasmid was performed to determine p38 MAP kinase activity in vivo, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with PMA; luciferase activity, which was normalized to total protein, was measured after 6 h, which was determined to be the time of maximal activity. For Western blot analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously described (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The p38, JNK1, and ERK2 MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution, and the p-ERK monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:500 dilution. The c-Jun and c-Fos rabbit polyclonal antibodies, the p-c-Jun monoclonal antibody, and the TFIID (TBP) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at dilutions of 1:150, 1:250, and 1:500, respectively. The AntiXpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) recognizes the sequence Asp-Leu-Tyr-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys from the leader peptide in the His-TBP fusion protein, and it was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were developed using a chemiluminescent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or chemifluorescent (JBL Scientific, San Luis Obispo, CA) substrate. THP-1 cells were co-transfected with an empty vector or the pcDNA-MKK6(Glu) and the pcDNA-His-TBP plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were labeled with 32Pi as previously described (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The His-TBP fusion protein was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C from whole cell lysates with the AntiXpress monoclonal antibody bound to Gammabind with Sepharose. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. All luciferase assays, which were normalized to total protein, are shown as means with the standard error. Statistical comparisons were performed using a paired, one-tailed t test, with a probability of p< 0.05 considered to be significant. Because, in most cells, phorbol esters are strong activators of AP-1 activity, we first determined which MAP kinases were activated in THP-1 cells stimulated with PMA. ERK kinase activation was determined by performing a Western analysis for p-ERK. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of SB 203580, the competitive inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, for 1 h and then stimulated with PMA for 15 min. We found that PMA strongly activated the ERK kinase and that SB 203580 had no effect on the status of p-ERK (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, PMA activated the ERK kinase as early as 5 min, and this activity stayed at the same level for as long as 60 min (data not shown). JNK MAP kinase activity was determined by performing an in vitro kinase assay using c-Jun as the substrate. PMA activated the JNK1 MAP kinase in THP-1 cells, and SB 203580 significantly augmented this activity as measured by the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig.1 B). In contrast, PMA did not activate the p38 MAP kinase, even over a prolonged period of time, as measured by in vitro kinase activity using TFIID (TBP) as a substrate. To assure ourselves that the p38 MAP kinase could be activated in these cells, we included LPS as a positive control (Fig. 1 C). These data show that the ERK and JNK MAP kinases are activated in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, but the p38 MAP kinase is not activated. Furthermore, these data show that inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 has no inhibitory effect on either ERK-mediated or JNK MAP kinase-mediated signaling. In fact, JNK MAP kinase-mediated signaling is enhanced by p38 MAP kinase inhibition. To determine the role of the p38 MAP kinase in regulating AP-1-dependent transcription, we measured AP-1-dependent promoter activity using a luciferase reporter plasmid, pAP-1-luc. Because PMA did not activate the p38 MAP kinase, we utilized a constitutive active MKK6(Glu) plasmid to activate the p38 MAP kinase. We used an in vivo kinase assay to show that pcDNA-MKK6(Glu) was constitutively active in THP-1 cells. Cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pTET-ATF and either an empty vector or the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector. In this assay, when the ATF is phosphorylated by the p38 MAP kinase via the constitutive active MKK6(Glu), the phosphorylated ATF can bind to the tetracycline-response element in the luciferase reporter promoter to induce luciferase expression. MKK6(Glu) alone and in combination with PMA increased luciferase activity greater than 7.5 times the level of the control, whereas PMA alone had no effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A). Anin vitro p38 MAP kinase assay using ATF-2 as a substrate revealed similar results (data not shown). These data confirm that pcDNA-MKK6(Glu) constitutively activates p38 both in vivo and in vitro and that PMA does not activate the p38 MAP kinase in THP-1 cells. Utilizing the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector, we next evaluated its role in regulating AP-1-driven transcription. In these studies, we co-transfected pAP-1-luc with either an empty vector or the MKK6(Glu) expression vector. In cells expressing MKK6(Glu), there was a greater than 3-fold increase in luciferase activity in control cells and a greater than 5-fold increase in cells exposed to PMA. In contrast, PMA had no effect on luciferase activity in cells expressing the empty vector (Fig. 2 B). A similar experiment was performed with cells cultured in the presence or absence of SB 203580 after the transient co-transfection. Cells expressing MKK6(Glu) had significantly increased luciferase activity compared with those expressing the empty vector, and SB 203580 abrogated the effect of MKK6(Glu) on AP-1-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2 C). To evaluate this in a different manner, cells were co-transfected with the pAP-1-luc plasmid and either an empty vector or the dominant negative pCMV-Flag-p38 plasmid. The results from these experiments corroborated the results found with SB 203580. PMA did not increase luciferase activity in cells expressing the empty vector, whereas luciferase activity in cells expressing the dominant negative p38 MAP kinase was below control levels (Fig. 2 D). In aggregate, these results show that AP-1-dependent gene expression, as measured by AP-1-dependent luciferase activity, requires an active p38 MAP kinase. In order to determine the role of p38 MAP kinase-mediated signaling in the regulation of AP-1-driven transcription, we first confirmed that the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector was not activating JNK MAP kinase-mediated signaling. Cells were transiently transfected with either an empty vector or pcDNA-MKK6(Glu). After 24 h, cells were treated with PMA or LPS, which was used as a positive control. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with JNK1 MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed using c-Jun as the substrate. We found that PMA slightly activated JNK1 compared with LPS in cells expressing the empty vector. There was no difference in this activity in cells expressing MKK6(Glu) (Fig.3 A). This validated the conjecture that the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector activated the p38 MAP kinase without altering JNK-mediated signaling. We next determined the effect of the p38 MAP kinase on AP-1 DNA binding. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of SB 203580 for 1 h and then stimulated with PMA for 3 h. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PMA increased DNA binding and SB 203580 had no significant effect on this binding (Fig.3 B). In a complementary experiment, cells were transiently transfected with either an empty vector or the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) with or without the dominant negative p38 expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with PMA for 3 h, and nuclear protein was extracted. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PMA increased DNA binding of AP-1, and there was no significant effect on this binding in cells expressing MKK6(Glu) with or without the dominant negative p38 (Fig. 3 C). Utilizing a supershift assay, the AP-1 complex in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells was composed of both c-Jun and c-Fos proteins (data not shown). These data suggest that the p38 MAP kinase does not regulate the binding of the AP-1 complex to DNA. Due to the fact that the p38 MAP kinase did not regulate PMA-induced AP-1 DNA binding and the AP-1 complex contained both c-Jun and c-Fos, we next determined the effect of PMA on the nuclear accumulation of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of PMA for 3 h, and nuclear protein was extracted. Nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot analysis was performed for either c-Jun or c-Fos. PMA did not increase the accumulation of c-Jun protein (Fig.4 A), but it significantly increased the amount of c-Fos protein (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that c-Jun is constitutively present in the nucleus of THP-1 cells and that PMA increases synthesis and translocation of c-Fos. The translocation of c-Fos to the nucleus allows it to combine with c-Jun to form an AP-1 complex that is more stable than those formed by Jun proteins alone (27Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because the p38 MAP kinase does not regulate AP-1 DNA binding and PMA did not affect c-Jun translocation to the nucleus, we next determined whether p38-mediated signaling was involved in c-Jun phosphorylation. THP-1 cells were transfected with either an empty vector or the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with PMA for 3 h, and nuclear protein was extracted. Nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot analysis was performed for native p-c-Jun. In cells expressing the empty vector, PMA significantly increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas in cells expressing MKK6(Glu), there was a slight increase in the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun in both control cells and in PMA-stimulated cells (Fig. 4 C). This finding shows that PMA, through activation of the JNK kinase, stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun and that MKK6(Glu), through activation of the p38 MAP kinase, also stimulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun. In aggregate, these data also show one mechanism by which control cells expressing MKK6(Glu) increase AP-1-dependent gene transcription. Furthermore, these data suggest that cells expressing MKK6(Glu) and stimulated with PMA have enhanced AP-1-dependent gene transcription due to the fact that PMA augments AP-1 DNA binding. Based on our previous studies demonstrating the role of the p38 MAP kinase in regulating TBP phosphorylation and subsequent activation (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we next evaluated the role of TBP in AP-1-driven transcription. We first determined whether expression of the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) expression vector resulted in increased TBP phosphorylation. THP-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA-His-TBP and either an empty vector or the MKK6(Glu) expression vector. After 24 h, the cells were labeled with 32Pi in phosphate-free medium, washed, and subsequently exposed to PMA for 1 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with AntiXpress monoclonal antibody, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. We found that PMA had no significant effect on TBP phosphorylation in vivo in cells expressing the empty vector. In contrast, THP-1 cells expressing MKK6(Glu) had approximately a 3-fold increase in phosphorylation of TBP, as measured by densitometry (Fig. 5 A). A Western blot analysis was performed for His-TBP to confirm equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. These data show that cells expressing the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) have increased phosphorylation of TBP in vivo. One study has shown that c-Jun directly interacts with the C terminus of TBP (11Franklin C.C. McCulloch A.V. Kraft A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), so we determined whether the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) increased this direct interaction in THP-1 cells. Cells were transiently co-transfected as in the in vivo phosphorylation experiments described in the preceding paragraph. After 24 h, cells were exposed to PMA, and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with AntiXpress monoclonal antibody. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed for c-Jun. We found that there was a significant increase in c-Jun interaction with His-TBP in cells expressing the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) (Fig. 5 B). PMA alone did not increase this interaction in cells expressing the empty vector. We performed a similar experiment in cells cultured in the presence or absence of SB 203580 after the transient co-transfection. SB 203580 abrogated the effect of MKK6(Glu) on the interaction of c-Jun and His-TBP (Fig.5 C). To complement the results of the data in Fig. 5,B and C, we co-transfected THP-1 cells with pcDNA-His-TBP and the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) either alone or with the dominant negative p38 expression vector. The results from these experiments corroborated the results found with SB 203580. The cells expressing both MKK6(Glu) and the dominant negative p38 expression vector had significantly decreased interaction of c-Jun and His-TBP compared with the cells expressing the constitutive active MKK6(Glu) alone (Fig. 5 D). Taken together, these studies show that TBP activation in macrophages requires an active p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, these studies show that TBP phosphorylation is necessary for the direct interaction of TBP with c-Jun and thus for AP-1-driven transcription. To evaluate the necessity of p38 MAP kinase activity in TBP activation and subsequent AP-1-dependent gene expression, we performed similar studies in a different macrophage cell line. In contrast to THP-1 cells, PMA modestly activates the p38 MAP kinase in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were exposed to PMA for 15 min, and whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the p38 MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibody. In vitro kinase assays were performed using ATF-2 as the substrate. PMA significantly increased the phosphorylation of ATF-2 compared with control cells (Fig.6 A). Western blot analysis for the p38 MAP kinase confirmed equal loading of the immunoprecipitated proteins. AP-1-driven transcription was determined by co-transfecting RAW 264.7 cells with pAP-1-luc and either an empty vector or the constitutively active MKK6(Glu) expression vector with or without the dominant negative pCMV-Flag-p38 plasmid. Cells were exposed to PMA for 6 h the day after the transient co-transfection. In cells expressing the empty vector, PMA significantly increased (∼3.5 times control) AP-1-dependent luciferase activity. This activity was significantly augmented in cells expressing MKK6(Glu), which is more effective in activating the p38 MAP kinase, but in cells expressing both MKK6(Glu) and the dominant negative p38 expression vector, this luciferase activity was significantly inhibited (Fig. 6 B). In PMA-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, all MAP kinases (ERK, JNK (data not shown), and p38) are activated. Thus, PMA-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells will have increased c-Fos and c-Jun synthesis due to ERK- and JNK-mediated signaling, increased c-Jun phosphorylation due to JNK-mediated and possibly p38-mediated signaling, and increased TBP phosphorylation due to p38 MAP kinase activity. Take together, these studies show that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates TBP and that this phosphorylation is necessary for AP-1-driven transcription in macrophages. We have previously shown that the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression by modulating the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of TBP (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether the p38 MAP kinase regulated the transcriptional activity of AP-1. We found that PMA alone was unable to drive the AP-1-dependent reporter gene in THP-1 cells. PMA activated both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases, but it did not activate the p38 MAP kinase. We found that cells expressing a constitutive active MKK6(Glu) had significantly increased AP-1-depenedent gene expression in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells, and SB 203580 abrogated the effect of MKK6(Glu). Expression of a constitutive active MKK6(Glu) resulted in the phosphorylation of a His-TBP fusion protein, and it increased direct interaction of His-TBP with c-Jun. PMA alone had no significant effect on either the phosphorylation of TBP or the interaction of TBP with c-Jun. In addition, cells expressing MKK6(Glu) had increased amounts of phosphorylated c-Jun. To further support these data, we used a different macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) in which the p38 MAP kinase is activated by PMA. We found that AP-1-dependent gene expression was increased by PMA alone, but this activity was significantly increased in cells expressing MKK6(Glu), which is a more potent activator of the p38 MAP kinase. These findings suggest that in macrophages, the p38 MAP kinase regulates AP-1-driven transcription by modulating the activation of TBP. The regulation of AP-1-dependent gene expression can occur at multiple levels after cell stimulation. AP-1 proteins are transcribed from immediate-early genes. The induction of c-fos transcription by MAP kinases occurs via a serum response element (28Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). After cell stimulation, the transcription factor Elk-1 is phosphorylated by both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases. This phosphorylation results in the formation of a ternary complex composed of Elk-1, the serum response element, and the serum response factor needed to initiate c-fos transcription (29Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 30Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Once translated, the c-Fos protein is subsequently able to translocate to the nucleus, form dimers with Jun proteins, and bind to DNA. Unlike c-fos, the transcription of c-jun is dependent only on JNK MAP kinase activation. The c-junpromoter has a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element that is constitutively occupied by c-Jun/ATF-2 heterodimers that are each phosphorylated by JNK MAP kinase. This phosphorylation is required to induce transcription (31Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 32van Dam H.

Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). AP-1 transcriptional activity, then, is dependent on both ERK and JNK MAP kinase-mediated signaling for c-Fos and c-Jun synthesis and c-Jun phosphorylation. Our data show that phorbol esters activate both the ERK and JNK MAP kinases in THP-1 cells but are unable to drive an AP-1-dependent gene. The involvement of the p38 MAP kinase in AP-1-driven transcription has been suggested in several studies. In murine epidermal cells exposed to silica, inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase with SB 203580 resulted in reduction in AP-1 DNA binding (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that certain p38 isoforms, in combination with ERK5, are necessary to activate the c-jun promoter in murine fibroblasts by a JNK-independent mechanism (36Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The role of these isoforms, p38α and p38γ, however, was not evaluated in terms of AP-1 transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that an important role of the p38 MAP kinase in regulating AP-1-driven transcription occurs downstream of Jun and Fos protein synthesis and AP-1 DNA binding. We do, however, also show that the p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates c-Jun, which is necessary for AP-1-driven transcription. AP-1 proteins have been shown to interact with both enhancer transcription factors, such as ATF-2 and NF-κB (32van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 37Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TBP (9Metz R. Bannister A.J. Sutherland J.A. Hagemeier C. O'Rourke E.C. Cook A. Bravo R. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6021-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10Metz R. Kouzarides T. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3832-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Franklin C.C. McCulloch A.V. Kraft A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All Jun proteins interact with both TFIIB and TBP in vitro, and TBP is capable of interacting with c-Jun at both the N-terminal transcriptional activation and the C-terminal basic leucine zipper domains (11Franklin C.C. McCulloch A.V. Kraft A.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of c-Jun on it N-terminal domain is required for transcriptional activity, but this phosphorylation is not necessary for TBP/c-Jun interaction. It is unclear from this study, however, whether this interaction is required for AP-1 transcriptional activity in vivo. The role of the p38 MAP kinase in regulating both NF-κB and ATF-2 have been shown previously (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol.

In fact, we have shown that the p38 MAP kinase regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity by modulating the phosphorylation of TBP. TBP is a required component in class I, II, and III promoters for the initiation of transcription (40Timmers H.T. Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Brou C. Chaudhary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of TBP has been shown to be essential for the transcription of class II promoters (19Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that either ATF-2 or NF-κB is required in our system, because our luciferase reporter is driven only by AP-1. The novel aspect of the current study is that the transcriptional activity of AP-1, like NF-κB, is regulated by the p38 MAP kinase through its modulation of TBP activation. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of TBP by the p38 MAP kinase is necessary for its interaction with c-Jun. Thus, an active p38 MAP kinase is necessary in order for macrophages to express inflammatory genes dependent on AP-1 and/or NF-κB. We thank the University of Iowa DNA Facility for sequencing the plasmids used in this study, S. Roach for excellent assistance in graphics, and Dr. Davis for providing the p38 MAP kinase plasmids."
