https://openalex.org/W1932052686,"Small amounts (7-250 pmol) of myoglobin, beta-lactoglobulin, and other proteins and peptides can be spotted or electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue, and sequenced directly. The membranes are not chemically activated or pretreated with Polybrene before usage. The average repetitive yields and initial coupling of proteins spotted or blotted into PVDF membranes ranged between 84-98% and 30-108% respectively, and were comparable with the yields measured for proteins spotted onto Polybrene-coated glass fiber discs. The results suggest that PVDF membranes are superior supports for sequence analysis of picomole quantities of proteins purified by gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W2018600945,"The 14 kb human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cDNA corresponding to a complete representation of the fetal skeletal muscle transcript has been cloned. The DMD transcript is formed by at least 60 exons which have been mapped relative to various reference points within Xp21. The first half of the DMD transcript is formed by a minimum of 33 exons spanning nearly 1000 kb, and the remaining portion has at least 27 exons that may spread over a similar distance. The DNA isolated from 104 DMD boys was tested with the cDNA for detection of deletions and 53 patients exhibit deletion mutations. The majority of deletions are concentrated in a single genomic segment corresponding to only 2 kb of the transcript."

It has been suggested that TNF/cachectin may cause cachexia. To determine if TNF/cachectin can induce progressive weight loss in tumor-bearing animals, a clone of the human TNF/cachectin gene was isolated and inserted into a mammalian expression vector. This construct was transfected into CHO cells, and a cell line (CHO/TNF-20) that secretes TNF/cachectin was isolated. A cell line (CHO/CMV-Neo) that contains the same expression vector without the TNF/cachectin gene was also isolated. Nude mice injected intraperitoneally with CHO/TNF-20 cells died more quickly than mice injected with CHO/CMV-Neo cells. Eighty-seven percent of mice inoculated intramuscularly with CHO/TNF-20 cells developed severe cachexia and weight loss. All mice bearing CHO/CMV-Neo tumors maintained or increased their body weight. We conclude that mice bearing tumors that secrete TNF/cachectin develop progressive wasting and die more quickly than mice bearing control tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1597628009,"Significant losses of DNA 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues in old age could disrupt cellular gene expression and contribute to the physiological decline of the animal. Thus, the 5-methyldeoxycytidine content of DNAs, isolated from the tissues of two rodent species of various ages, were determined. Mus musculus lost DNA methylation sites at a rate of about 4.7×10(4) (approximately 0.012% of the newborn level)/month. Peromyscus leucopus lost DNA 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues at a rate of only 2.3×10(4) (approximately 0.006% of the newborn level)/month. Since P. leucopus generally live twice as long as M. musculus, the rate of loss of DNA 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues appears to be inversely related to life span. Similar losses in genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine content were also observed to correlate with donor age in cultured normal human bronchial epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048356148,"Elements controlling tissue-specific expression of the rat albumin gene reside within roughly 150 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site. We show here by DNAase I footprinting assays that at least four distinct factors present in extracts derived from cells expressing albumin interact with these sequences. One of these factors is closely related or identical to nuclear factor 1 (NF1). Extracts from nonhepatic tissues or from dedifferentiated hepatoma cells that do not transcribe the albumin gene display a different pattern of DNA-protein interactions. Mixing experiments show that the variant pattern of dedifferentiated cells is dominant over that of differentiated ones, suggesting that nonexpressing cells contain dominant negatively acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1516111762,"The lipid moiety of the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani had been isolated and characterized as a novel lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol. Treatment of lipophosphoglycan with either 10% NH4OH or a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus liberated a monoalkylglycerol substituent. Structural characterization of the monoalkylglycerol by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated the presence of two saturated, unbranched hydrocarbons: a C24 alkyl chain comprising 78% of the lipid with the remaining 22% as a C26 alkyl chain. Periodate sensitivity demonstrated that the alkyl side chain is linked to the C-1 position of the glycerol backbone. Treatment of lipophosphoglycan with nitrous acid released 1-O-alkylglycerophosphorylinositol due to an unacetylated glucosamine residue linked to the inositol of the lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol. Quantitative analysis of the organic solvent-soluble product of nitrous acid deamination of lipophosphoglycan confirmed the expected ratio of inositol:phosphate:1-O-alkylglycerol as 1:1:1. These results suggest that L. donovani anchors its lipophosphoglycan with a unique lipid component."

(1986) Biochem. J. 240, 413-422) has been used to isolate cDNA to the messenger RNA. Analysis of the deduced primary structure and additional biochemical characterization indicates that the protein is lactotransferrin. An increase in the level of lactotransferrin mRNA of at least 300-fold can be induced in the mouse uterus by estrogen. In contrast, the mRNA is virtually undetectable in rat uterine tissue following estrogen administration. The estrogenic stimulation in mouse uterus contrasts with the known prolactin dependence in mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1517698792,"Incubation of mutant Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) resulted in excessive internalization of lipoprotein and extensive cellular over-accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. The uptake of LDL by the mutant cells appeared to occur through the classic LDL receptor pathway and internalized lipoprotein was processed in lysosomes. Lipoprotein uptake into mutant cells was associated with delays in the initiation of established cellular cholesterol homeostatic responses. Subcellular fractionation of mutant Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts accumulating LDL-cholesterol showed excess unesterified sterol to be localized in the light lysosome-light membrane region of a Percoll gradient, and revealed that cholesterol storage was associated with a specific alteration in the normal profiles of lysosomal marker enzymes.— Pentchev, P.

https://openalex.org/W1549703942,"Abstract The low density lipoprotein receptor is encoded by a housekeeping gene that is transcribed in most mammalian cells and is subject to negative feedback regulation by sterols. To determine the basis for this regulated expression, we performed a transfection analysis with hybrid genes containing up to 6500 base pairs of 5' flanking DNA from the low density lipoprotein receptor gene fused to the coding region of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. These studies identified a 177-base pair fragment of 5' flanking DNA that is sufficient for expression as well as negative regulation by sterols. The positive elements within this region were further defined by analysis of a series of 15 mutations in which overlapping 10-base pair segments were scrambled by site-specific mutagenesis. These studies identified the positive elements as three imperfect direct repeats of 16 base pairs and a TATA-like sequence. The three repeats contain a sequence that is homologous to the consensus DNA sequence recognized by transcription factor Sp1."
https://openalex.org/W2159924007,"The structure of the deoxyoligomer d(C-G-C-G-A-A-T-T-T-G-C-G) was determined at 2.5-A resolution by single crystal x-ray diffraction techniques. The final R factor is 18% with the location of 71 water molecules. The oligomer crystallizes in a B-DNA-type conformation, with two strands interacting to form a dodecamer duplex. The double helix consists of four A X T and six G X C Watson-Crick base pairs and two G X T mismatches. The G X T pairs adopt a structure with the thymine projecting into the major groove and the guanine into the minor groove. The mispairs are accommodated in the normal double helix by small adjustments in the conformation of the sugar phosphate backbone. A comparison with the isomorphous parent compound containing only Watson-Crick base pairs shows that any changes in the structure induced by the presence of G X T mispairs are highly localized. The global conformation of the duplex is conserved. The G X T mismatch has already been studied by x-ray techniques in A and Z helices where similar results were found. The geometry of the mispair is essentially identical in all structures so far examined, irrespective of the DNA conformation. The hydration is also similar with solvent molecules bridging the functional groups of the bases via hydrogen bonds. Hydration may be an important factor in stabilizing G X T mismatches. A characteristic of Watson-Crick paired A X T and G X C bases is the pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis in the plane of the base pairs. The G X T wobble base pair is pronouncedly asymmetric. This asymmetry, coupled with the disposition of functional groups in the major and minor grooves, provides a number of features which may contribute to the recognition of the mismatch by repair enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2037654635,"We have analyzed the mechanism and dynamics of telomere length variation in the macronucleus of Tetrahymena thermophila. In a newly differentiated macronucleus, the average length of the telomeric repeated sequence, (C4A2 X T2G4)n, is closely regulated. In contrast, in vegetatively dividing cells in log phase, all macronuclear telomeric sequences lengthen coordinately by 3-10 bp per generation until up to 1000 bp are added. In both elongated and short telomeres, characteristic single-stranded breaks on both strands are distally located. Reduction of elongated telomeres to their original length involves either the appearance of a novel type of variant cell, incapable of net telomere elongation, or, under stationary phase conditions, a reversible removal of telomeric sequences. The demonstration that telomeres are dynamic structures provides evidence for a model of telomere length regulation by activities that add and remove telomeric repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1589155180,"Using a nonpolymerizable form of tropomyosin (NPTM) we have investigated the interactions between the T1 (residues 1-158) and T2 (residues 159-259) regions of troponin T and the other components of the thin filament at 50 mM KCl +/- Ca2+. Under these conditions the binding of NPTM to F-actin is fully restored by whole troponin (+/- Ca2+), and in each case, retains a residual degree of cooperativity as demonstrated by Scatchard and Hill plots. Fragment T2 alone had a small inductive effect on the interaction of NPTM with F-actin. In the presence of troponin I, this interaction is increased to a level which exceeds that observed with either component alone. The effects of T2 and troponin I are moderately (-Ca2+) and markedly (+Ca2+) reduced by troponin C. While fragment T1 alone did not promote induction, it accentuated the effects of T2 and troponin I. Since T1 does not interact with T2 or troponin I but does interact weakly with the NH2 terminus of tropomyosin and can be expected to bind weakly at the residual interaction site(s) at the COOH terminus of NPTM, the observed effects of T1 have been ascribed to the linking of neighboring NPTM molecules at their ends."
https://openalex.org/W1560376606,"13C NMR chemical shift and intensity results for a series of carboxyl 13C-enriched saturated fatty acids (8-18 carbons) bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) are presented as a function of increasing fatty acid (FA)/BSA mole ratio. Spectra for long-chain (greater than or equal to 12 carbons) FA × BSA complexes exhibited up to five FA carboxyl resonances, designated a, b, b', c, and d. Only three resonances (peaks b, b', and d) were observed below 3:1 FA × BSA mole ratio, and at greater than or equal to 3:1 mole ratio, two additional resonances were observed (peaks c and a). In a spectrum of 5:1 stearic acid × BSA complexes, peaks b, b', and d each represented approximately one-fifth, and peak c approximately two-fifths, of the total FA carboxyl intensity. Plots of total carboxyl/carbonyl intensity ratio as a function of FA × BSA mole ratio were linear up to 7-9 mole ratio. Deviation from linearity at mole ratios greater than or equal to 7 was accompanied by the detection of crystalline unbound FA (as 1:1 acid/soap) by X-ray diffraction. In contrast to long-chain FA × BSA complexes, 13C NMR spectra of octanoic acid × BSA complexes yielded only one FA carboxyl resonance (peak c) at FA × BSA mole ratios between 1 and 20. We conclude: peaks b, b', and d represent FA bound to three individual high affinity (primary) long-chain FA binding sites on BSA; peak c represents FA bound to several secondary long-chain (or primary short-chain) FA binding sites on BSA; peak a represents long-chain FA bound to an additional lower affinity binding site. We present a model that correlates the observed 13C NMR resonances with individual binding site locations predicted by a recent three-dimensional model of BSA."
https://openalex.org/W1588405578,"The mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase has been investigated using single-turnover experiments in an effort to determine the primary source of the oxygen atom incorporated into product in the course of catalysis. It is found from mass spectroscopic analysis of the uric acid generated in these experiments that when 16O-labeled enzyme in [18O]H2O is reacted with substoichiometric amounts of xanthine (under conditions where no enzyme molecule is likely to react with more than one substrate molecule), the uric acid isolated from the reaction mixture contains 16O at position 8 of the purine ring. Conversely, when 18O-labeled enzyme in [16O]H2O is exposed to substoichiometric xanthine, 18O is incorporated into the product uric acid. These results strongly support a variety of chemical studies with model molybdenum complexes suggesting that the oxygen atom of the Mo = O group known to be present at the active site of xanthine oxidase is transferred to product in the course of catalysis. The mechanistic implications of the present work are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536899263,"3T3-L1 adipocytes in culture incorporated [35S]methionine into a protein which could be immunoprecipitated with chicken antiserum to bovine lipoprotein lipase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed this protein had an Mr of 55,000, similar to that of bovine lipoprotein lipase, and accounted for 0.1-0.5% of total protein synthesis in the adipocytes. Lipoprotein lipase protein was present in small amounts in confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, and the amount increased many-fold as the cells differentiated into adipocytes. This increase was accompanied by parallel increases in cellular lipase activity and secretion. When cells were grown with [35S]methionine, the amount of label incorporated into lipoprotein lipase increased for 2 h and then leveled off. Pulse-chase experiments showed that half-life of newly synthesized lipase was about 1 h. Turnover of lipoprotein lipase in control cells involved both release to the medium and intracellular degradation. When N-linked glycosylation was blocked by tunicamycin, the cells synthesized a form of lipase that had a smaller Mr (48,000), was catalytically inactive, and was not released to the medium. Radioimmunoassay demonstrated that 3T3-L1 adipocytes contained an unexpectedly large amount of lipoprotein lipase protein. 55% of the enzyme protein in acetone/ether powder of the cells was insoluble in 50 mM NH3/NH4Cl at pH 8.1, a solution commonly used to extract lipoprotein lipase; 27% of the lipase protein was soluble but did not bind to heparin-Sepharose and had very low lipase activity; and the remaining 13% was soluble, bound to heparin-Sepharose, and had high lipolytic activity. About one-half of the lipase released spontaneously to the medium was inactive, and lipase inactivation proceeded in the medium with little loss of enzyme protein. Lipoprotein lipase released heparin, in contrast, was fully active and more stable. When protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide, the level of lipoprotein lipase activity in adipocytes decreased more rapidly than the amount of lipase protein in the cells. Most of the inactive lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes probably results from dissociation of active dimeric lipase, but some could be a precursor of active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1574451580,"13C NMR chemical shift results as a function of pH for a series of carboxyl 13C-enriched saturated fatty acids (8-18 carbons) bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) are presented. For octanoic acid bound to BSA (6:1, mol/mol), the chemical shift of the only FA carboxyl resonance (designated as peak c), plotted as a function of pH, exhibited a complete sigmoidal titration curve that deviated in shape from a corresponding theoretical Henderson-Hasselbach curve. However, FA carboxyl chemical shift plotted as a function of added HCl yielded a linear titration curve analogous to those obtained for protein-free monomeric fatty acid (FA) in water. The apparent pK of BSA-bound octanoic acid was 4.3 +/- 0.2. However, the intrinsic pK (corrected for electrostatic effects resulting from the net positive charge on BSA) was approximately 4.8, a value identical to that obtained for monomeric octanoic acid in water in the absence of protein. For long-chain FA (greater than or equal to 12 carbons) bound to BSA (6:1, mol/mol), chemical shift titration curves for peak c were similar to those obtained for octanoic acid/BSA. However, the four additional FA carboxyl resonances observed (designated as peaks a, b, b', and d) exhibited no change in chemical shift between pH 8 and 3. For C14.0 × BSA complexes (3:1 and 6:1, mol/mol) peaks b' and a exhibited chemical shift changes between pH 8.8 and 11.5 concomitant with chemical shift changes in the epsilon-carbon (lysine) resonance. In contrast, peaks c and d exhibited no change and peak b only a slight change in chemical shift over the same pH range. We conclude: the carboxyl groups of bound FA represented by peaks a, b, b', and d were involved in ion pair electrostatic interactions with positively charged amino acyl residues on BSA; the carboxyl groups of bound FA represented by peak c were not involved in electrostatic interactions with BSA; the similarity of the titration curves of peak c for BSA-bound octanoic acid and long-chain FA suggested that short-chain and long-chain FA represented by peak c were bound to the same binding site(s) on BSA; bound FA represented by peaks b' and a (but not d or b) were directly adjacent to BSA lysine residues. We present a model which correlates NMR peaks b, b', and d with the putative locations of three individual high-affinity binding sites in a three-dimensional model of BSA."
https://openalex.org/W1577232116,"A receptor which recognizes glycoproteins bearing terminal mannose residues has been isolated from human placental membranes. Washed membranes were solubilized with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and applied to a mannose-Sepharose affinity column. The column was eluted with buffer containing 200 mM mannose and 1% cholate. The major protein eluted exhibited a molecular weight of 175 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein binds 125I-labeled mannosylated bovine serum albumin in a saturable fashion with a dissociation constant of 4 nM. Ligand binding is pH-dependent with maximal binding above pH 6.5. This binding can be inhibited with EDTA, mannose, fucose, mannan, beta-glucuronidase, and bovine serum albumin conjugated to fucose. Polyclonal antibodies generated against the mannose binding protein immunoprecipitate a single 175-kDa protein species from both surface-iodinated and biosynthetically labeled human monocyte-derived macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1546705165,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) purified from microwave-irradiated rat head contained about 46 esterified phosphates (mole/mol), which were not bound covalently to lipids and did not assemble with microtubules. After some phosphates were released by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the phosphate content of MAP-2 decreased to 16 mol of phosphate and the protein assembled in vitro. MAP-2 purified after microtubule assembly cycles and also the cytosolic heat-stable fraction without assembly cycles had 10 mol of phosphate, and both assembled with microtubules. The MAP-2 with 46 phosphates and that with 10 had different pI in isoelectric focusing, but the components, MAP-2a and -2b, were always near each other. In high-pressure liquid chromatography, MAP-2 containing 46 mol of phosphate appeared after that 10 mol of phosphate. Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were recovered from tryptic digestion of MAP-2 with 46 mol of phosphate. These findings suggest that two kinds of MAP-2, one with 46 phosphates and not bound to tubulin and the other with 10-16 phosphates and bound to tubulin, are present in the living rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1604054721,"The flavoprotein D-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.1) has been purified to homogeneity from beef kidney cortex. The protein is a monomer with a molecular weight of 39,000 containing 1 molecule of flavin. The enzyme as isolated is a mixture of a major active form containing FAD and a minor inactive form containing 6-hydroxy-flavin adenine dinucleotide (6-OH-FAD). The absorption and fluorescence spectral properties of the two forms have been studied separately after reconstitution of the apoprotein with FAD or 6-OH-FAD, respectively. FAD-reconstituted D-aspartate oxidase has flavin fluorescence, shows characteristic spectral perturbation upon binding of the competitive inhibitor tartaric acid, is promptly reduced by D-aspartic acid under anaerobiosis, reacts with sulfite to form a reversible covalent adduct, stabilizes the red anionic form of the flavin semiquinone upon photoreduction, and yields the 3,4-dihydro-FAD-form after reduction with borohydride. A Kd of 5 X 10(-8) M was calculated for the binding of FAD to the apoprotein. 6-OH-FAD-reconstituted D-aspartate oxidase has no flavin fluorescence, shows no spectral perturbation in the presence of tartaric acid, is not reduced by D-aspartic acid under anaerobiosis, does not stabilize any semiquinone upon photoreduction, and does not yield the 3,4-dihydro-form of the coenzyme when reduced with borohydride; the enzyme stabilizes the p-quinoid anionic form of 6-OH-FAD and lowers its pKa more than two pH units below the value observed for the free flavin. The general properties of the enzyme thus resemble those of the dehydrogenase/oxidase class of flavoprotein, particularly those of the amino acid oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1526695402,"Ca2+ binding to calmodulin was measured in the presence of mastoparan or caldesmon fragment. Mastoparan and caldesmon fragment were used as model compounds of enzymes and cytoskeleton proteins, respectively, working as the target of calmodulin. Although the Ca2+ bindings of the two globular domains of calmodulin occur independently in the absence of the target peptide (or proteins), mastoparan and caldesmon fragment increased the affinity of Ca2+ and, at the same time, produced the positive cooperative Ca2+ bindings between the two domains. The result of Ca2+ binding was compared with 1H NMR spectra of calmodulin in the presence of equimolar concentration of mastoparan. It is known that a conformation change of the C-terminal half-region (C-domain) occurs by the Ca2+ binding to C-domain. A further change in conformation of C-domain was demonstrated by the Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal half-region (N-domain) in the presence of mastoparan. It indicates that the two domains of calmodulin get into communication with each other in the associated state with the target, and we concluded that the Ca2+ binding to the N-domain is responsive to the development of calmodulin function."
https://openalex.org/W1514817757,"The Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C autophosphorylates by an intrapeptide reaction in a mixed micelle system in which the enzyme is a monomer. The rate of autophosphorylation in the micellar system is comparable to that observed in bilayer systems, where the enzyme may exist as an oligomer. Trypsinolysis of the enzyme reveals that both the regulatory and catalytic domains of the molecule are modified by the intrapeptide phosphorylation. Proteolysis of the enzyme to separate the two domains results in loss of ability to autophosphorylate. Furthermore, intact protein kinase C cannot phosphorylate either the cleaved regulatory or catalytic domains. Kinetic and proteolytic analyses suggest that intrapeptide phosphorylation is the predominant, and perhaps only, mechanism by which protein kinase C autophosphorylates. The intrapeptide modification of protein kinase C has intriguing implications for protein structure and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1488455175,"cDNA encoding the precursor of rat liver medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.3) was cloned and sequenced. The longest cDNA insert isolated was 1866 bases in length. This cDNA encodes the entire protein of 421-amino acids including a 25-amino acid leader peptide and a 396-amino acid mature polypeptide. The identity of the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase clone was confirmed by matching the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA to the NH2-terminal and nine internal tryptic peptide sequences derived from pure rat liver medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The calculated molecular masses of the precursor medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the mature medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and the leader peptide are 46,600, 43,700, and 2,900 daltons, respectively. The leader peptide contains five basic amino acids and only one acidic amino acid; thus, it is positively charged, overall. Cysteine residues are unevenly distributed in the mature portion of the protein; five of six are found within the NH2-terminal half of the polypeptide. Comparison of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase sequence to other flavoproteins and enzymes which act on coenzyme A ester substrates did not lead to unambiguous identification of a possible FAD-binding site nor a coenzyme A-binding domain. The sequencing of other homologous acyl-CoA dehydrogenases will be informative in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W1539744882,"A polypeptide of Mr 4400 was isolated from soybean (Glycine max) seeds by extraction with 60% ethanol followed by ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The peptide contains an unusually high amount of aspartic acid residues (approximately 25%, and hence is designated as soybean aspartic acid-rich peptide). Its complete primary structure was determined by conventional methods to be the following. Ser-Lys-Trp-Gln-His-Gln-Gln-Asp-Ser-Cys-Arg-Lys-Gln-Leu-Gln-Gly-Val-Asn- Leu-Thr-Pro-Cys-Glu-Lys-His-Ile-Met-Glu-Lys-Ile-Gln-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Asp- Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp A striking features of this primary structure is the presence of a poly(L-aspartic acid) sequence at the carboxyl terminus, and this polyaspartyl segment was found to precipitate bovine trypsin. The presence of the putative cell attachment sequence Arg-Gly-Asp was also noted."
https://openalex.org/W1586778165,"The growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) is inhibited in vitro by progestins which also induce several proteins. We have cloned cDNA sequences corresponding to one of them, a 250-kDa protein, and have shown that the corresponding mRNA is also rapidly induced by progestins (Chalbos D., Westley B., May F.E.B., Alibert C., and Rochefort H. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 965-982). We show here that the 250-kDa protein is very similar, if not identical, to fatty acid synthetase: fatty acid synthetase is regulated to the same extent by progestins, the 250-kDa protein is specifically immunoprecipitated by antibodies to fatty acid synthetase, and fatty acid synthetase covalently labeled by [14C]pantothenate is immunoprecipitated by antibodies to the 250-kDa protein. The induction of fatty acid synthetase by progestin in cancer cells thus provides another model for studying the mechanism regulating steroid transcription in human cells. Since fatty acid synthetase regulation by progestins appears to be the opposite in cancer and normal mammary cells, this observation may also be a clue for understanding the role of progestins in mammary carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1612192907,"Abstract The core-specific lectin (CSL) synthesized and secreted by rat hepatocytes and the rat hepatoma H-4-II-E shows affinity for mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core region of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. The CSL undergoes two stages of post-translational modification which result in an increase in its Mr from 24,000 to 26,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have determined that the lectin undergoes hydroxylation of proline and lysine and that the hydroxylysine is glycosylated to form glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine (GlcGalHyLys). CSL metabolically labeled with [3H]lysine and [3H]proline contains hydroxylated forms of proline and lysine. The mature form of the lectin can also be metabolically labeled with [3H]galactose. alpha,alpha'-Dipyridyl, an inhibitor of collagen prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, prevents the metabolic incorporation of [3H]galactose and the post-translational increases in the Mr of the CSL, indicating that both events are dependent upon hydroxylation of proline and lysine. Virtually all of the hydroxylysine present in the CSL is recovered as glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine after alkaline hydrolysis. The post-translational modifications of the CSL place it in a select family of secreted proteins which contain collagen-like sequences, including the pulmonary surfactant proteins, complement component C1q, and the 18 S asymmetric form of acetylcholinesterase."
https://openalex.org/W101795600,"We used 2-GHz frequency-domain fluorometry to examine the intensity decays of N-acetyl-L-tryptophamide (NATA) and the protein staphylococcal nuclease in the presence and absence of quenching by oxygen or acrylamide. When analyzed with a multiexponential model, the decays of NATA and nuclease both become more heterogeneous in the presence of quenching. We attribute the increased complexity to transient effects in quenching or equivalently a time-dependent rate constant for quenching. The frequency-domain data were analyzed using the Smoluchowski model (exp(-t/tau-2b square root t)) and the radiation model, which is known to correct some flaws in the more approximate Smoluchowski model. The radiation model provides improved fits to the data, as evidenced by average 10-fold decreases in chi R2. The radiation model also provides an estimate of the sum of the diffusion coefficients and the specific rate constant for quenching. The apparent diffusion coefficients for acrylamide and oxygen in nuclease, as seen by its single tryptophan (residue 140) are 15- and 11-fold lower than in water, respectively. The apparent values of the oxygen diffusion coefficient in water, as seen by NATA, are 2- to 3-fold larger than expected from earlier steady-state measurements. The ability to recover the detailed form of the intensity decays by the frequency-domain method should allow comparison of experimental results with calculated trajectories of quenchers in proteins."

Maturation-specific disaccharidase activity was accompanied by decreased amounts of types I and III collagen and decreased procollagen type I and III mRNA levels. Conversely, type IV procollagen, fibronectin, and laminin amounts and their respective mRNA levels were increased. In vitro transcription of nuclei isolated from small intestine and colon of suckling rats indicated a decreased rate of synthesis of procollagen types I and III mRNAs and an increased rate of synthesis of procollagen type IV mRNAs and laminin mRNAs after dexamethasone treatment. The data suggest that glucocorticoids mediate a differential regulation of interstitial and basement membrane collagen gene expression in the developing rat intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1569099138,"The plasminogen activator urokinase was linked covalently to a monoclonal antibody specific for the amino terminus of the beta chain of human fibrin by means of the unidirectional cross-linking reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. N-Succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate allowed the amino groups on urokinase to be coupled to the sulfhydryl groups on iminothiolane (which had been introduced into the antibody before the coupling reaction). The inter-heavy chain sulfhydryl of the Fab' of this antibody was also linked to N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate-substituted urokinase. The antibody- or Fab'-urokinase complexes were purified by two affinity chromatography steps. In the first, benzamidine was used as ligand for urokinase, in the second, a heptapeptide consisting of the 7 amino-terminal residues of the beta chain of fibrin (beta peptide) was used as ligand for the antibody. The activity of the purified conjugates was compared with that of urokinase alone in an assay measuring lysis of 125I-fibrin monomer covalently linked to Sepharose CL-4B. For any concentration of either urokinase alone or urokinase-antifibrin antibody conjugate, an equivalent amount of lysis (release of labeled peptide from fibrin monomer-Sepharose) was obtained with 1/250 the concentration (with respect to urokinase content) of antifibrin antibody-urokinase conjugate. The antifibrin Fab'-urokinase conjugate exhibited a similar enhancement of activity in comparison with urokinase. Enhanced fibrinolysis was fully inhibited by beta peptide. These results suggest that antibody targeting enhances the concentration of urokinase in the vicinity of immobilized fibrin monomer, thereby also increasing the local conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades its substrate, fibrin. Univalent antigen-antibody binding is sufficient for optimal efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1587637211,"The phosphorylation state of six cytoplasmic proteins is increased following treatment of isolated rat hepatocytes with hormones that elevate free intracellular Ca2+ levels (Garrison, J. C. and Wagner, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13135-13143). Tryptic 32P-phosphopeptide maps of two of the substrates, pyruvate kinase and a 49,000-dalton protein, the major 32P-labeled protein in hepatocytes, were prepared following stimulation of cells with vasopressin, a Ca2+-linked hormone. Peptide maps of the 49,000-dalton protein phosphorylated in vitro with the recently identified multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase contained phosphopeptides identical to those observed in the intact cell, suggesting that this kinase is activated in response to Ca2+-mobilizing hormones. Similar in vitro phosphorylation experiments with pyruvate kinase suggested that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate not only the serine residues observed following vasopressin stimulation of the intact cell but also additional threonine residues. Both pyruvate kinase and the 49,000-dalton protein are also phosphorylated in the hepatocyte in response to glucagon and in vitro by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Both vasopressin and glucagon appear to stimulate the phosphorylation of identical serine residues in pyruvate kinase but only vasopressin enhances the phosphorylation of certain sites in the 49,000-dalton protein. Comparison of the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of these substrates phosphorylated in vitro with either the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or the cAMP-dependent protein kinase suggests that the Ca2+-dependent kinase can phosphorylate unique sites in both substrates. It appears to share specificity at other sites with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Overall, the results suggest that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase plays an important role in the response of the hepatocyte to a Ca2+ signal."
https://openalex.org/W1603703245,"Abstract The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase consists of a catalytic subunit (Kc) and a basic subunit (Kb) which appear to be anchored to the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase core component (E2) by another subunit, referred to as protein X (Rahmatullah, M., Jilka, J. M., Radke, G. A., and Roche, T. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6515-6523). We determined the catalytic requirements for reduction and acetylation of the lipoyl moiety in protein X and linked those changes in protein X to regulatory effects on kinase activity. Using fractions prepared by resolution and proteolytic treatments, we evaluated which subunits are required for regulatory effects on kinase activity. With X-KcKb fraction (treated to remove the mercurial agent used in its preparation), we found that the resolved pyruvate dehydrogenase component, the isolated inner domain of E2 (lacking the lipoyl-bearing region of E2), and the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component directly utilize protein X as a substrate. The resulting reduction and acetylation of protein X occurs in association with enhancement of kinase activity. Following tryptic cleavage of E2 and protein X into subdomains, full acetylation of the lipoyl-bearing subdomains of these proteins is retained along with the capacity of acetylating substrates to stimulate kinase activity. All kinase-containing fractions, including those in which the Kb subunit was digested, were inhibited by pyruvate or ADP, alone, and synergistically by the combination suggesting that pyruvate and ADP bind to Kc. Our results suggest that the Kb subunit of the kinase does not contribute to the observed regulatory effects. A dynamic role of protein X in attenuating kinase activity based on changes in the mitochondrial redox and acetylating potentials is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1828734010,"Products of glucose and glutamine metabolism by L929 cells were detected and quantitated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the oxime-trimethylsilyl derivatives. This method allowed detection and identification of all major carboxylic and amino acids produced in the system. Although lactic acid was expected to be the major product, alanine, citric, glutamic, aspartic, and pyruvic acids were also released into the culture medium at significant rates. Incorporation of labeled carbon from D-[U-13C]glucose showed that the alanine, lactic, and pyruvic acids were derived from glucose as was one-third of the citric acid carbon. The rate of glucose utilization for production of these end products was 29-fold greater than the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2, and calculated ATP production from alanine and pyruvate synthesis exceeded that from lactate synthesis by nearly 2-fold. Utilization of glutamine for synthesis of aspartic, glutamic, and citric acids also exceeded the rate of glutamine oxidation, thereby making end-product synthesis from glucose and glutamine the dominant cellular metabolic activity. In the absence of glucose, synthesis and intracellular levels of aspartic and glutamic acids increased, whereas synthesis and cell content of the other acids decreased markedly. This response is consistent with the metabolic pattern proposed by Moreadith and Lehninger (Moreadith, R.W., and Lehninger, A.L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6215-6221) in which much of the glutamine used by these cells is converted to aspartate in the absence of a pyruvate source and to aspartate or citrate in the presence of pyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1531042454,"Physical association of calcineurin with phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was observed by molecular exclusion chromatography; the enzyme did not associate with phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine. The interactions with PS and PG were enhanced by Ca2+ which implicates a regulatory role for the Ca2+-binding subunit in this process. Addition of PG or PS to standard calcineurin assays elicited profound changes in enzymatic activity; phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were without effect. Up to 23-fold stimulation of the calmodulin-independent activity was observed with phosphorylated histone H1 or synapsin I as the substrates. In contrast, the activity toward p-nitrophenyl phosphate and tyrosine phosphate was found to be inhibited. A characterization and comparison of the two opposite responses showed that: the phospholipids had insignificant effects on the Km for substrates, the phospholipid specificity for activation and inhibition was nearly indistinguishable, half-maximal activation and inhibition were obtained at similar concentrations of PG (K0.5 = 0.21 and 0.14 mg/ml, respectively), and calmodulin enhanced the responses to PG (K0.5 = 0.064 and 0.033 mg/ml for activation and inhibition, respectively) to similar extents. Together, these observations demonstrate that the two substrate-dependent responses of calcineurin are due to the association of the phosphatase with phospholipids and not a result of substrate-phospholipid interactions. This suggests that Ca2+- and calmodulin-stimulated interactions of calcineurin with acidic phospholipids may play a role in regulating the substrate specificity of this multifunctional phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1553739706,"Abstract A structural model for the chicken liver fatty acid synthase is proposed based on electron microscope and small-angle neutron-scattering studies of the enzyme. The model has the overall appearance of two side by side cylinders with dimensions of 160 X 146 X 73 A, with each subunit 160 A in length and 73 A in diameter. The model was constructed by dividing each cylinder into three domains having lengths of 32, 82, and 46 A, with the domain structures in the two subunits being related to each other by a dyad axis. The model is consistent with chemical cross-linking studies which indicated that the subunits are arranged in a head to tail fashion. The cross-linking studies further showed that the beta-ketoacyl synthase active site contains a cysteine and a pantetheine residue from adjacent subunits. It is proposed that the domains which catalyze the addition of C2 units from malonate to the growing fatty acid chain lie in the crevice between the two subunits and that the two independent sets of fatty acid-synthesizing centers lie on the major axis of the model on opposite ends of the molecular dyad."
https://openalex.org/W1597238891,"P/2e- stoichiometries in six assay systems spanning different portions of the respiratory chain were estimated by direct determinations of Pi uptake in suspensions of bovine heart mitochondria containing a hexokinase trap. The electron donors were malate + pyruvate, succinate, and ascorbate + N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and the electron acceptors were ferricyanide (Site 1, Site 2, and Sites 1 + 2) and O2 (Sites 1 + 2 + 3, Sites 2 + 3, and Site 3). A major objective was to find conditions in which the six systems yield results in sufficiently good agreement to allow confidence as to their reliability. This objective was achieved, and maximum values of 1.1, 0.5, and 1.0 were observed in the Sites 1, 2, and 3 systems, respectively. This required that the energy-conserving reactions be relatively nonlimiting and that the P/2e- ratios be estimated from the slopes of plots of respiration rate versus phosphorylation rate obtained by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation with respiratory chain inhibitors. The latter requirement allows avoidance of the effect of an apparent endogenous uncoupler and is based on the observation (Tsou, C. S., and Van Dam, K. (1969) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 172, 174-176) that uncoupling agents at low concentrations decrease the rate of phosphorylation nearly as much in absolute amount at low rates of respiration as at high rates. The maximum P/2e- stoichiometry at Site 1 is considered to be 1.0, and the value observed in the Site 1 system is suggested to be higher as a result of H+ ejection at the transhydrogenase level. Respiratory control due to carboxyatractyloside inhibition was examined and found to differ greatly among the systems. It is pointed out that this observation is not consistent with the lack of complete control being due primarily to ion cycling and that, in view of this, the relatively meager control at Site 3 is not consistent with O2 being reduced on the matrix side of the coupling membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1502339640,"The Z band in skeletal muscle has two distinct structural states —a relaxed (small square or ss) form and a maximally activated (basket weave or bw) form. We have examined by electron microscopy and optical diffraction Z lattice forms and dimensions and A band spacings in relaxed, tetanized, stretched, and stretched-and-tetanized rat soleus muscle. We have tested the independent contributions of passive load, active tension, and sarcomere length to Z band state. As the A band spacing decreased with increasing load and increasing sarcomere length in the untetanized muscles, the Z lattice remained in the ss form and the Z spacing changed only slightly. Computer-enhanced images from digitized electron micrographs showed that the ss Z lattice resisted deformation regardless of load or method of stretching. In contrast, when the muscle was tetanized at sarcomere lengths of up to 2.7 μm, the Z lattice assumed the bw form and the Z spacing was increased by 20%. Regardless of lattice form, Z spacing did not vary significantly with sarcomere length. Images from freeze-substituted preparations showed both lattice forms comparable to those in images from glutaraldehyde-fixed muscles. Thus, Z band state appears to be a function of the presence (or absence) of active tension. Our previous three-dimensional model is compatible with these observations and with the substructures revealed by computer-enhanced images of both lattice forms.—Goldstein, M. A.; Michael, L.

https://openalex.org/W1568892603,"Abstract A protein methyltransferase which recognizes racemized and isomerized aspartyl residues in proteins has been identified in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of Xenopus laevis oocytes by enzymatic and immunochemical assays. The methyltransferase activity is maintained at a constant concentration of approximately 0.2 microM throughout vitellogenesis. Two forms of the enzyme can be identified on immunoblots by their cross-reactivity with an antibody prepared against the purified enzyme from bovine brain. Although both forms, with molecular weights of 27,000 and 34,000, are present in the cytoplasm, only the smaller form is found in the oocyte nucleus. A heterogeneous group of endogenous methyl-accepting proteins has been identified following the addition of S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine to oocyte extracts. The subcellular distribution of these methyl-accepting proteins, i.e. those proteins with unmodified or unmetabolized D- and L-isoaspartyl residues, is complementary to that of the methyltransferase. Very low levels of methyl-accepting activity are associated with nuclear proteins, which are actively methylated by the methyltransferase in vivo (O'Connor, C. M., and Germain, B. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10404-10411). Yolk platelet proteins, which are inaccessible to the methyltransferase in vivo, are readily methylated by the enzyme in vitro. The specific methyl-accepting activity of the yolk proteins increases severalfold during the months required for the development of an early-to-late vitellogenic oocyte, suggesting that derivatized aspartyl residues accumulate with time in proteins which are inaccessible to the methyltransferase. The results support the hypothesis that the methyltransferase initiates either the repair or metabolism of cellular proteins which have been damaged by spontaneous racemization and deamidation processes (Clarke, S. (1985) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54, 479-506)."
https://openalex.org/W1583463550,"calmodulin (CaM) is the major calcium-binding protein in all the eukaryotic cells with the exception of skeletal and cardiac muscle. CaM has a Mr around 16 kDa and in higher eukaryotic cells it is encoded by three different genes (CaMI, CaMII and CaMIII) which in spite of displaying different structure and nucleotide sequence, specially in the 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences, all of them encode for exactly the same protein. In yeast and other fungi, only one gene encoding for CaM has been identified. The amino acid sequence of CaM from all the mammalian cells is exactly the same and the homology with CaM from the other eukaryotic species is also very high."
https://openalex.org/W1522782708,"Abstract The effective rate of dissociation of 1-N6-ethenoadenosine diphosphate (epsilon ADP) from the regulated actin X subfragment 1 X epsilon ADP complex of rabbit skeletal muscle is approximately 10-15 times smaller in the absence of calcium ion compared to the presence of calcium ion. The decrease in fluorescence emission with dissociation of the bound epsilon ADP fitted two exponential terms. The evidence is consistent with a kinetic scheme in which two first-order transitions precede the dissociation step: (Formula: see text) where D is epsilon ADP, A is regulated actin, M is subfragment 1, the asterisks refer to the degree of fluorescence enhancement, and AM(D) is a collision complex in equilibrium with free epsilon ADP. Both rate constants k-2 and k-1 were reduced approximately 15-fold in the absence of calcium ion. The rate constants for the dissociation of epsilon ATP, epsilon ADP X Pi, formed in the enzyme cycle, and epsilon ADP are all reduced in the absence of calcium ion; consequently, the primary effect in calcium regulation of the actin-subfragment 1 ATPase is on the rate constant of a transition (or transitions) between actomyosin-nucleoside phosphate complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1503092294,"Plasma fibronectin is an acute-phase reactant synthesized by hepatocytes. Glucocorticoids are one of the major factors implicated in controlling the hepatic acute-phase response. To study the regulatory effects of glucocorticoids on plasma fibronectin biosynthesis, a model chick hepatocyte culture system under serum- and hormone-free conditions was used. In the presence of either dexamethasone or corticosterone, secreted plasma fibronectin increased maximally to 2.8-fold above basal levels. The stimulatory effect of the hormones was maintained only in their continuous presence, since plasma fibronectin production dropped to near basal levels within 16 h of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Pulse-chase studies indicated that pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone stimulated the level of secreted plasma fibronectin but had no effect on its rate of secretion. The increase in plasma fibronectin production by dexamethasone was abolished in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of progestin, an antagonist of dexamethasone known to compete specifically for the liver glucocorticoid receptor. Actinomycin D and alpha-amanitin, which are inhibitors of transcription, also blocked the early dexamethasone effect on plasma fibronectin synthesis. Slot blot hybridization of total RNA samples from dexamethasone-treated cultures revealed a 6-fold stimulatory rise in fibronectin mRNA during the first 6 h of treatment, which later declined and was no longer evident at 48 and 72 h. However, fibronectin mRNA levels were elevated to about the same extent in control and dexamethasone-treated cells at the later time points. During the same time period (0 to 72 h), plasma fibronectin protein levels rose and remained elevated. Evaluation of pulse-chase experiments following pretreatment with hormone for 48 h demonstrated that equal amounts of plasma fibronectin were translated by dexamethasone-treated and control cells, but only 42% of labeled plasma fibronectin was secreted by control cells compared with 93% for dexamethasone-treated cells. These findings suggest that the early phase of glucocorticoid regulation of plasma fibronectin biosynthesis occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated through the specific action of the glucocorticoid receptor. A later phase of glucocorticoid-stimulated plasma fibronectin biosynthesis results from modulation of post-translational processing events leading to secretion of an increased amount of newly translated plasma fibronectin polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1590917846,"Transmethylation reactions in fully grown Xenopus oocytes were analyzed following the microinjection of S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine (AdoMet). The size of the endogenous AdoMet pool, measured by cation exchange high pressure liquid chromatography is 5.91 pmol/oocyte. The AdoMet pool turns over with a half-time of 2 h, at a rate of 2.07 pmol/h/oocyte. Fractionation experiments indicate that approximately one-third of the AdoMet in oocytes is utilized for protein carboxylmethylation reactions and another third is metabolized into small molecules which are secreted. The remainder of the intracellular AdoMet is used primarily for protein N-methylation reactions, although some methylation of phospholipids and nucleic acids also occurs. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 3H-methylated proteins at pH 2.4 in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate demonstrated that methyl esters are associated with a heterogeneous group of proteins in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of oocytes, coincident with the subcellular distribution of the protein D-aspartyl, L-isoaspartyl methyl transferase (O'Connor, C. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 10398-10403). The protein methyl esters associated with oocyte proteins turn over rapidly, as evidenced from the presence of [3H]methanol in the medium. The calculated rate of protein carboxyl methylation, 0.7 pmol/h/oocyte, is similar to that of protein synthesis in oocytes, suggesting that the modification of derivatized aspartyl residues represents a major pathway in oocyte protein metabolism. Since the formation of protein methyl esters is unaffected by cycloheximide, it is unlikely that methyl-accepting sites on oocyte proteins arise primarily from errors in protein synthesis. Unlike protein carboxyl methylation reactions, protein N-methylation reactions are closely linked to protein synthesis, and the methyl group linkages are stable over a period of at least 4 h. Numerous protein acceptors for N-methylation reactions were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

During short-term incubation in the dark, NapADG and BADG are reversible inhibitors of Na+ gradient-dependent D-glucose uptake and Na+-dependent phlorizin binding with Ki values of about 40 and 400 microM, respectively. Irreversible inhibition of Na+-dependent phlorizin binding, which was prevented by D-glucose or phlorizin, was measured after a 1-h incubation with BADG. Both NapADG and BADG selectively labeled polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 82,000, 75,000, 64,000, and 47,000. Since labeling of the Mr 82,000 and 75,000 polypeptides by both analogs was partially dependent on the presence of Na+ and was partially protected by D-glucose or phlorizin but not by L-glucose or D-mannose, these polypeptides are thought to be components of the renal Na+-D-glucose cotransporter which contain D-glucose-binding sites. For the Mr 64,000 and 47,000 polypeptides, Na+ dependence and D-glucose protection were not constantly observed. However, also, these polypeptides are thought to be components or proteolytic splitting products of the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter since we observed that three monoclonal antibodies showed cross-reaction with the BADG-labeled Mr 82,000, 64,000, and 47,000 polypeptides (K. Korn, A. Raszeja-Specht, S. Bernotat-Danielowski, and H. Koepsell, manuscript in preparation). When the BADG-labeled Mr 82,000 and 75,000 polypeptides were analyzed after two-dimensional separation by isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, three-labeled, D-glucose-protectable polypeptides with the respective molecular weights and isoelectric points of 82,000 and 5.6, 75,000 and 5.4, and 75,000 and 6.9 were distinguished. The data indicate that renal brush-border membranes contain several polypeptides which are components of the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter and contain D-glucose-binding sites."

Meta polar substituents avoid contact with the enzyme and show only electronic effects on Km. Using the x-ray crystallographic coordinates for chymotrypsin and computer graphics, a model was constructed which is used to interpret the quantitative structure-activity relationship.

These unknown phospholipids incorporated label from the phosphate and acyl chains of the substrate, but not from the head group. Two-dimensional TLC of the intact lipids and their deacylation products showed that these lipids were phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin, and the previously unreported phosphatidyltriton. The reaction involved the transfer of the phosphatidyl moiety of the substrate molecule in a phospholipase D-like manner. The reaction displayed sigmoidal kinetics, did not require divalent cations, possessed an acidic pH optimum, and was sensitive to thermal inactivation. Differences in thermal sensitivity and pH optimum indicated that a distinct enzyme activity may be involved in the formation of cardiolipin. A primary alcohol group was required on the acceptor molecule, which could be either amphipathic or water-soluble. Addition of exogenous unlabeled phosphatidylglycerol resulted in the increased formation of cardiolipin, with a concomitant decrease in the level of phosphatidyltriton formed. Labeled phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylserine could be formed upon addition of their corresponding alcoholic head group to incubations containing a 32P-labeled phosphatidyl donor and Triton X-100. These results indicate that, in C. butyricum, enzymic steps exist that would allow remodeling of the membrane phospholipids, without requiring de novo biosynthesis."

The time course of deglycosylation was monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and evidence for sugar removal was shown by a modification of the Western blot technique utilizing 125I-labeled concanavalin A and by amino acid analysis. Protein was detected in the gel by using specific antibodies and 125I-labeled protein A. Steady-state kinetic data of deglycosylated D beta H show minor differences between the native and the deglycosylated protein.

https://openalex.org/W1597837646,"Chemical modification of calcineurin by phenylglyoxal was used to probe for the presence of arginine at, or in close proximity to, the catalytic site of this phosphatase. Phenylglyoxal inactivated calcineurin with a second-order rate constant of 1.5 M-1 min-1 at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. The inactivation reaction was extremely sensitive to Ca2+-induced conformational changes on calcineurin; removal of this metal ion from the reaction medium increased the rate of inactivation by almost 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, significant protection of calcineurin by ADP was observed only in the presence of Ca2+, which suggests either that distinct sites are modified by phenylglyoxal in the absence and presence of Ca2+ or that the metal ion promotes binding of ADP to calcineurin. Inactivation of calcineurin by phenyl[2-14C]glyoxal resulted in the incorporation of more than 12 eq of the reagent. However, a kinetic analysis of the order of the inactivation reaction and complete protection of calcineurin by p-nitrophenyl phosphate suggest that only one of the modified residues is responsible for the loss of enzymatic activity. Protection of calcineurin by ADP was enhanced severalfold by calmodulin, which correlated well with a calmodulin-stimulated decrease in the Ki for this ligand. Protection of calcineurin from inactivation by phenylglyoxal was also observed in the presence of various other nucleotides; half-maximal protection by these poor substrates and competitive inhibitors was observed at concentrations near their respective inhibition constants. Thus, the results of this modification study indicate that at least 1 arginine residue is essential for the expression of catalytic activity of the calmodulin-regulated phosphatase."

These fragments were used as inhibitors in a sensitive competitive binding radioimmunoassay with noncross-reactive rabbit alloantisera to study the distribution and localization of the major allotype-specific allotopes within the SC polypeptide. The 40-kDa fragments were shown to inhibit the 125I-labeled intact SC/anti-SC allotype reaction to the extent of 90%, i.e. nearly as well as the intact homologous high Mr SC form. In contrast, the NH2-terminal fragments (domain 1) were not inhibitory. The low Mr SC of each allotype was less inhibitory on a molar basis than the homologous high Mr SC polypeptide, an observation compatible with the deletion of domains 2 and 3 in the smaller polypeptide (Deitcher, D. L., and Mostov, K. E. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 2712-2715; Frutiger, S., Hughes, G. J., Fonck, Ch., and Jaton, J.-C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1712-1715). The structural correlates of the allotypic specificities were evaluated by comparative peptide mapping of the 40-kDa fragments (allotypes t61, t62, and t63). The data suggest that the t61 allotype structure differs significantly from the t62 and t63 structures, the latter two being much more related to each other than to t61. These findings are in full agreement with the serological data. The inhibition results suggest that the major allotype-specific, noncross-reactive allotopes of SC are distributed throughout domains 3, 4, and 5, even though domain 4 appears to be more conserved than domains 3 and 5 between the allotypes t61 and t63. Seven amino acid substitutions between t61 and t63 have been detected within domains 3, 4, and 5."
