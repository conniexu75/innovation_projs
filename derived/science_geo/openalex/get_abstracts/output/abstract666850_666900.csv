https://openalex.org/W3121906900,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 78 million individuals and is responsible for over 1.7 million deaths to date. Infection is associated with the development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity, which can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but, to our knowledge, the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be required to produce antibodies upon reinfection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We find that titres of IgM and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 decrease significantly over this time period, with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. By contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remains unchanged at 6.2 months after infection. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies that they express have greater somatic hypermutation, resistance to RBD mutations and increased potency, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Immunofluorescence and PCR analyses of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals at 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 individuals. We conclude that the memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence."
https://openalex.org/W3121407008,"To study the effect of host genetics on gut microbiome composition, the MiBioGen consortium curated and analyzed genome-wide genotypes and 16S fecal microbiome data from 18,340 individuals (24 cohorts). Microbial composition showed high variability across cohorts: only 9 of 410 genera were detected in more than 95% of samples. A genome-wide association study of host genetic variation regarding microbial taxa identified 31 loci affecting the microbiome at a genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10-8) threshold. One locus, the lactase (LCT) gene locus, reached study-wide significance (genome-wide association study signal: P = 1.28 × 10-20), and it showed an age-dependent association with Bifidobacterium abundance. Other associations were suggestive (1.95 × 10-10 < P < 5 × 10-8) but enriched for taxa showing high heritability and for genes expressed in the intestine and brain. A phenome-wide association study and Mendelian randomization identified enrichment of microbiome trait loci in the metabolic, nutrition and environment domains and suggested the microbiome might have causal effects in ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3121239749,"Clinical laboratory tests are a critical component of the continuum of care. We evaluate the genetic basis of 35 blood and urine laboratory measurements in the UK Biobank (n = 363,228 individuals). We identify 1,857 loci associated with at least one trait, containing 3,374 fine-mapped associations and additional sets of large-effect (>0.1 s.d.) protein-altering, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and copy number variant (CNV) associations. Through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, we discover 51 causal relationships, including previously known agonistic effects of urate on gout and cystatin C on stroke. Finally, we develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for each biomarker and build 'multi-PRS' models for diseases using 35 PRSs simultaneously, which improved chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, gout and alcoholic cirrhosis genetic risk stratification in an independent dataset (FinnGen; n = 135,500) relative to single-disease PRSs. Together, our results delineate the genetic basis of biomarkers and their causal influences on diseases and improve genetic risk stratification for common diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3123988232,"Single-cell transcriptomic analysis is widely used to study human tumors. However, it remains challenging to distinguish normal cell types in the tumor microenvironment from malignant cells and to resolve clonal substructure within the tumor. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach called copy number karyotyping of aneuploid tumors (CopyKAT) to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5 Mb from read depth in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We applied CopyKAT to analyze 46,501 single cells from 21 tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma and glioblastoma, to accurately (98%) distinguish cancer cells from normal cell types. In three breast tumors, CopyKAT resolved clonal subpopulations that differed in the expression of cancer genes, such as KRAS, and signatures, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia. These data show that CopyKAT can aid in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in a variety of solid human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3122118092,"Coexisting microbial cells of the same species often exhibit genetic variation that can affect phenotypes ranging from nutrient preference to pathogenicity. Here we present inStrain, a program that uses metagenomic paired reads to profile intra-population genetic diversity (microdiversity) across whole genomes and compares microbial populations in a microdiversity-aware manner, greatly increasing the accuracy of genomic comparisons when benchmarked against existing methods. We use inStrain to profile >1,000 fecal metagenomes from newborn premature infants and find that siblings share significantly more strains than unrelated infants, although identical twins share no more strains than fraternal siblings. Infants born by cesarean section harbor Klebsiella with significantly higher nucleotide diversity than infants delivered vaginally, potentially reflecting acquisition from hospital rather than maternal microbiomes. Genomic loci that show diversity in individual infants include variants found between other infants, possibly reflecting inoculation from diverse hospital-associated sources. inStrain can be applied to any metagenomic dataset for microdiversity analysis and rigorous strain comparison."
https://openalex.org/W3124201952,"Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits a range of correlated phenomena that originate from strong electron-electron interactions. These interactions make the Fermi surface highly susceptible to reconstruction when ±1, ±2 and ±3 electrons occupy each moiré unit cell, and lead to the formation of various correlated phases1-4. Although some phases have been shown to have a non-zero Chern number5,6, the local microscopic properties and topological character of many other phases have not yet been determined. Here we introduce a set of techniques that use scanning tunnelling microscopy to map the topological phases that emerge in MATBG in a finite magnetic field. By following the evolution of the local density of states at the Fermi level with electrostatic doping and magnetic field, we create a local Landau fan diagram that enables us to assign Chern numbers directly to all observed phases. We uncover the existence of six topological phases that arise from integer fillings in finite fields and that originate from a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions driven by correlations7,8. These topological phases can form only for a small range of twist angles around the magic angle, which further differentiates them from the Landau levels observed near charge neutrality. Moreover, we observe that even the charge-neutrality Landau spectrum taken at low fields is considerably modified by interactions, exhibits prominent electron-hole asymmetry, and features an unexpectedly large splitting between zero Landau levels (about 3 to 5 millielectronvolts). Our results show how strong electronic interactions affect the MATBG band structure and lead to correlation-enabled topological phases."

https://openalex.org/W3125528398,"Abstract Lungfishes belong to lobe-fined fish (Sarcopterygii) that, in the Devonian period, ‘conquered’ the land and ultimately gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans 1–3 . Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish ( Neoceratodus forsteri ), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14× larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods 4,5 , underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes. These findings advance our understanding of this major transition during vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3124502889,"The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in estrogen receptor (ER)-α-positive breast cancer is controversial, constraining implementation of AR-directed therapies. Using a diverse, clinically relevant panel of cell-line and patient-derived models, we demonstrate that AR activation, not suppression, exerts potent antitumor activity in multiple disease contexts, including resistance to standard-of-care ER and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Notably, AR agonists combined with standard-of-care agents enhanced therapeutic responses. Mechanistically, agonist activation of AR altered the genomic distribution of ER and essential co-activators (p300, SRC-3), resulting in repression of ER-regulated cell cycle genes and upregulation of AR target genes, including known tumor suppressors. A gene signature of AR activity positively predicted disease survival in multiple clinical ER-positive breast cancer cohorts. These findings provide unambiguous evidence that AR has a tumor suppressor role in ER-positive breast cancer and support AR agonism as the optimal AR-directed treatment strategy, revealing a rational therapeutic opportunity."
https://openalex.org/W3123537370,"Admixed populations are routinely excluded from genomic studies due to concerns over population structure. Here, we present a statistical framework and software package, Tractor, to facilitate the inclusion of admixed individuals in association studies by leveraging local ancestry. We test Tractor with simulated and empirical two-way admixed African-European cohorts. Tractor generates accurate ancestry-specific effect-size estimates and P values, can boost genome-wide association study (GWAS) power and improves the resolution of association signals. Using a local ancestry-aware regression model, we replicate known hits for blood lipids, discover novel hits missed by standard GWAS and localize signals closer to putative causal variants."

https://openalex.org/W3122987480,"The intestinal microbiome is implicated as an important modulating factor in multiple inflammatory1,2, neurologic3 and neoplastic diseases4. Recent genome-wide association studies yielded inconsistent, underpowered and rarely replicated results such that the role of human host genetics as a contributing factor to microbiome assembly and structure remains uncertain5-11. Nevertheless, twin studies clearly suggest host genetics as a driver of microbiome composition11. In a genome-wide association analysis of 8,956 German individuals, we identified 38 genetic loci to be associated with single bacteria and overall microbiome composition. Further analyses confirm the identified associations of ABO histo-blood groups and FUT2 secretor status with Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium spp. Mendelian randomization analysis suggests causative and protective effects of gut microbes, with clade-specific effects on inflammatory bowel disease. This holistic investigative approach of the host, its genetics and its associated microbial communities as a 'metaorganism' broaden our understanding of disease etiology, and emphasize the potential for implementing microbiota in disease treatment and management."
https://openalex.org/W3121830305,"The response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) is dictated by homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and the abundance of lesions that trap PARP enzymes. It remains unclear, however, if the established role of PARP in promoting chromatin accessibility impacts viability in these settings. Using a CRISPR-based screen, we identified the PAR-binding chromatin remodeller ALC1/CHD1L as a key determinant of PARPi toxicity in HR-deficient cells. ALC1 loss reduced viability of breast cancer gene (BRCA)-mutant cells and enhanced sensitivity to PARPi by up to 250-fold, while overcoming several resistance mechanisms. ALC1 deficiency reduced chromatin accessibility concomitant with a decrease in the association of base damage repair factors. This resulted in an accumulation of replication-associated DNA damage, increased PARP trapping and a reliance on HR. These findings establish PAR-dependent chromatin remodelling as a mechanistically distinct aspect of PARPi responses and therapeutic target in HR-deficient cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3125553198,"Nearly one billion people worldwide suffer from obsessive-compulsive behaviors1,2, yet our mechanistic understanding of these behaviors is incomplete, and effective therapeutics are unavailable. An emerging perspective characterizes obsessive-compulsive behaviors as maladaptive habit learning3,4, which may be associated with abnormal beta-gamma neurophysiology of the orbitofrontal-striatal circuitry during reward processing5,6. We target the orbitofrontal cortex with alternating current, personalized to the intrinsic beta-gamma frequency of the reward network, and show rapid, reversible, frequency-specific modulation of reward- but not punishment-guided choice behavior and learning, driven by increased exploration in the setting of an actor-critic architecture. Next, we demonstrate that chronic application of the procedure over 5 days robustly attenuates obsessive-compulsive behavior in a non-clinical population for 3 months, with the largest benefits for individuals with more severe symptoms. Finally, we show that convergent mechanisms underlie modulation of reward learning and reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The results contribute to neurophysiological theories of reward, learning and obsessive-compulsive behavior, suggest a unifying functional role of rhythms in the beta-gamma range, and set the groundwork for the development of personalized circuit-based therapeutics for related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3121267967,"Nonlinear data visualization methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), summarize the complex transcriptomic landscape of single cells in two dimensions or three dimensions, but they neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subsets of cells are given more visual space than warranted by their transcriptional diversity in the dataset. Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains."
https://openalex.org/W3125886950,"In the type III CRISPR-Cas immune response of prokaryotes, infection triggers the production of cyclic oligoadenylates that bind and activate proteins that contain a CARF domain1,2. Many type III loci are associated with proteins in which the CRISPR-associated Rossman fold (CARF) domain is fused to a restriction endonuclease-like domain3,4. However, with the exception of the well-characterized Csm6 and Csx1 ribonucleases5,6, whether and how these inducible effectors provide defence is not known. Here we investigated a type III CRISPR accessory protein, which we name cyclic-oligoadenylate-activated single-stranded ribonuclease and single-stranded deoxyribonuclease 1 (Card1). Card1 forms a symmetrical dimer that has a large central cavity between its CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold and restriction endonuclease domains that binds cyclic tetra-adenylate. The binding of ligand results in a conformational change comprising the rotation of individual monomers relative to each other to form a more compact dimeric scaffold, in which a manganese cation coordinates the catalytic residues and activates the cleavage of single-stranded-but not double-stranded-nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA). In vivo, activation of Card1 induces dormancy of the infected hosts to provide immunity against phage infection and plasmids. Our results highlight the diversity of strategies used in CRISPR systems to provide immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3124781615,"Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with protein biosynthesis. Macrolides represent one of the most successful classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The main clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to macrolides is dimethylation of the 23S rRNA nucleotide A2058, located in the drug-binding site, a reaction catalyzed by Erm-type rRNA methyltransferases. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Erm-dimethylated 70S ribosome at 2.4 Å resolution, together with the structures of unmethylated 70S ribosome functional complexes alone or in combination with macrolides. Altogether, our structural data do not support previous models and, instead, suggest a principally new explanation of how A2058 dimethylation confers resistance to macrolides. Moreover, high-resolution structures of two macrolide antibiotics bound to the unmodified ribosome reveal a previously unknown role of the desosamine moiety in drug binding, laying a foundation for the rational knowledge-based design of macrolides that can overcome Erm-mediated resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3121165557,"The transition zones of the squamous and columnar epithelia constitute hotspots for the emergence of cancer, often preceded by metaplasia, in which one epithelial type is replaced by another. It remains unclear how the epithelial spatial organization is maintained and how the transition zone niche is remodelled during metaplasia. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize epithelial subpopulations and the underlying stromal compartment of endo- and ectocervix, encompassing the transition zone. Mouse lineage tracing, organoid culture and single-molecule RNA in situ hybridizations revealed that the two epithelia derive from separate cervix-resident lineage-specific stem cell populations regulated by opposing Wnt signals from the stroma. Using a mouse model of cervical metaplasia, we further show that the endocervical stroma undergoes remodelling and increases expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-2 (DKK2), promoting the outgrowth of ectocervical stem cells. Our data indicate that homeostasis at the transition zone results from divergent stromal signals, driving the differential proliferation of resident epithelial lineages."
https://openalex.org/W3125742210,"Cerebrovascular injuries can cause severe edema and inflammation that adversely affect human health. Here, we observed that recanalization after successful endovascular thrombectomy for acute large vessel occlusion was associated with cerebral edema and poor clinical outcomes in patients who experienced hemorrhagic transformation. To understand this process, we developed a cerebrovascular injury model using transcranial ultrasound that enabled spatiotemporal evaluation of resident and peripheral myeloid cells. We discovered that injurious and reparative responses diverged based on time and cellular origin. Resident microglia initially stabilized damaged vessels in a purinergic receptor-dependent manner, which was followed by an influx of myelomonocytic cells that caused severe edema. Prolonged blockade of myeloid cell recruitment with anti-adhesion molecule therapy prevented severe edema but also promoted neuronal destruction and fibrosis by interfering with vascular repair subsequently orchestrated by proinflammatory monocytes and proangiogenic repair-associated microglia (RAM). These data demonstrate how temporally distinct myeloid cell responses can contain, exacerbate and ultimately repair a cerebrovascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W3122552508,"Despite the strong genetic basis of psychiatric disorders, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unmapped. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are responsible for most post-transcriptional regulation, from splicing to translation to localization. RBPs thus act as key gatekeepers of cellular homeostasis, especially in the brain. However, quantifying the pathogenic contribution of noncoding variants impacting RBP target sites is challenging. Here, we leverage a deep learning approach that can accurately predict the RBP target site dysregulation effects of mutations and discover that RBP dysregulation is a principal contributor to psychiatric disorder risk. RBP dysregulation explains a substantial amount of heritability not captured by large-scale molecular quantitative trait loci studies and has a stronger impact than common coding region variants. We share the genome-wide profiles of RBP dysregulation, which we use to identify DDHD2 as a candidate schizophrenia risk gene. This resource provides a new analytical framework to connect the full range of RNA regulation to complex disease."
https://openalex.org/W3108946043,"Introduction Patients with sepsis who present to an emergency department (ED) have highly variable underlying disease severity, and can be categorized from low to high risk. Development of a risk stratification tool for these patients is important for appropriate triage and early treatment. The aim of this study was to develop machine learning models predicting 31-day mortality in patients presenting to the ED with sepsis and to compare these to internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores. Methods A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted amongst 1,344 emergency department patients fulfilling sepsis criteria. Laboratory and clinical data that was available in the first two hours of presentation from these patients were randomly partitioned into a development (n = 1,244) and validation dataset (n = 100). Machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the development dataset and compared to internal medicine physicians and risk scores in the independent validation dataset. The primary outcome was 31-day mortality. Results A number of 1,344 patients were included of whom 174 (13.0%) died. Machine learning models trained with laboratory or a combination of laboratory + clinical data achieved an area-under-the ROC curve of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.80–0.84) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81–0.87) for predicting 31-day mortality, respectively. In the validation set, models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in sensitivity (92% vs. 72% vs. 78%;p&lt;0.001,all comparisons) while retaining comparable specificity (78% vs. 74% vs. 72%;p&gt;0.02). The model had higher diagnostic accuracy with an area-under-the-ROC curve of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.78–0.92) compared to abbMEDS (0.63,0.54–0.73), mREMS (0.63,0.54–0.72) and internal medicine physicians (0.74,0.65–0.82). Conclusion Machine learning models outperformed internal medicine physicians and clinical risk scores in predicting 31-day mortality. These models are a promising tool to aid in risk stratification of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3124103939,"Tryptophan 2C methyltransferase (TsrM) methylates C2 of the indole ring of L-tryptophan during biosynthesis of the quinaldic acid moiety of thiostrepton. TsrM is annotated as a cobalamin-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methylase; however, TsrM does not reductively cleave SAM to the universal 5'-deoxyadenosyl 5'-radical intermediate, a hallmark of radical SAM (RS) enzymes. Herein, we report structures of TsrM from Kitasatospora setae, which are the first structures of a cobalamin-dependent radical SAM methylase. Unexpectedly, the structures show an essential arginine residue that resides in the proximal coordination sphere of the cobalamin cofactor, and a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is ligated by a glutamyl residue and three cysteines in a canonical CXXXCXXC RS motif. Structures in the presence of substrates suggest a substrate-assisted mechanism of catalysis, wherein the carboxylate group of SAM serves as a general base to deprotonate N1 of the tryptophan substrate, facilitating the formation of a C2 carbanion."
https://openalex.org/W3123537749,"Efficient genome editing methods are essential for biotechnology and fundamental research. Homologous recombination (HR) is the most versatile method of genome editing, but techniques that rely on host RecA-mediated pathways are inefficient and laborious. Phage-encoded single-stranded DNA annealing proteins (SSAPs) improve HR 1,000-fold above endogenous levels. However, they are not broadly functional. Using Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Caulobacter crescentus, we investigated the limited portability of SSAPs. We find that these proteins specifically recognize the C-terminal tail of the host's single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and are portable between species only if compatibility with this host domain is maintained. Furthermore, we find that co-expressing SSAPs with SSBs can significantly improve genome editing efficiency, in some species enabling SSAP functionality even without host compatibility. Finally, we find that high-efficiency HR far surpasses the mutational capacity of commonly used random mutagenesis methods, generating exceptional phenotypes that are inaccessible through sequential nucleotide conversions."
https://openalex.org/W3119559628,"Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress–regulated protein exhibiting cytoprotective properties through a poorly understood mechanism in various in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal and non-neuronal damage. Although initially characterized as a secreted neurotrophic factor for midbrain dopamine neurons, MANF has recently gained more interest for its intracellular role in regulating the ER homeostasis, including serving as a cofactor of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). We aimed for a better understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of MANF. Here we show for the first time that MANF promotes the survival of ER-stressed neurons in vitro as a general unfolded protein response (UPR) regulator, affecting several UPR pathways simultaneously. Interestingly, MANF does not affect naive neurons. We hypothesize that MANF regulates UPR signaling toward a mode more compatible with neuronal survival. Screening of MANF interacting proteins from two mammalian cell lines revealed a conserved interactome of 15 proteins including several ER chaperones such as GRP78, GRP170, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 1, and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 6. Further characterization confirmed previously published finding that MANF is a cofactor of GRP78 interacting with its nucleotide binding domain. Using microscale thermophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we discovered that MANF is an ATP binding protein and that ATP blocks the MANF–GRP78 interaction. Interestingly, functional analysis of the antiapoptotic properties of MANF mutants in cultured neurons revealed divergent roles of MANF as a GRP78 cofactor and as an antiapoptotic regulator of UPR. We conclude that the co-factor type interaction with GRP78 is dispensable for the survival-promoting activity of MANF in neurons."

Astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ADEVs) and neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs) were immunoabsorbed separately from physically precipitated plasma total EVs. Extracted mitochondrial ATP synthase was specifically immunofixed to plastic wells for quantification of catalytic activity based on conversion of NADH to NAD+. Other extracted mitochondrial functional proteins were quantified by ELISAs. All protein levels were normalized with EV content of the CD81 exosome marker. FP patient ADEV level but not NDEV level of mitochondrial ATP synthase activity was significantly lower than that of ctls. FP patient ADEV and NDEV levels of the functionally critical mitochondrial proteins mitofusin 2 and cyclophilin D, but not of transcription factor A of mitochondria, and of the mitochondrial short open-reading frame neuroprotective and metabolic regulatory peptides humanin and MOTS-c were significantly lower than those of ctls. In contrast, FP patient NDEV, but not ADEV, level of the mitochondrial-tethering protein syntaphilin, but not of myosin VI, was significantly higher than that of ctls. The distinctively different neural levels of some mitochondrial proteins in FP patients than ctls now should be correlated with diverse clinical characteristics. Drugs that increase depressed levels of proteins and mimetics of deficient short open-reading frame peptides may be of therapeutic value in early phases of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3121299015,"Transgender women (TGW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa have high HIV acquisition risks and can benefit from daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We assessed PrEP adherence by measuring tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels and explore motives for PrEP persistence in TGW and MSM.Participants were enrolled in a one-year PrEP programme and made quarterly visits irrespective of whether they were still using PrEP. At their month 6 visit, participants provided a dried blood spot to test for TFV-DP levels; protective levels were defined as those compatible with ≥4 pills per week (700-1249 fmol/punch). Before TFV-DP levels were available, a sub-set of these participants were invited for an in-depth interview (IDI). Semi-structured IDI topic guides were used to explore motives to uptake, adhere to, and discontinue PrEP. IDI data were analyzed thematically.Fifty-three participants (42 MSM and 11 TGW) were enrolled. At month 6, 11 (20.7%) participants (8 MSM and 3 TGW) were lost to follow up or stopped taking PrEP. Any TFV-DP was detected in 62.5% (5/8) of TGW vs. 14.7% of MSM (5/34, p = 0.01). Protective levels were detected in 37.5% of TGW (3/8), but not in any MSM. Nineteen IDI were conducted with 7 TGW and 9 MSM on PrEP, and 1 TGW and 2 MSM off PrEP. Unplanned or frequent risky sexual risk behaviour were the main motives for PrEP uptake. Among participants on PrEP, TGW had a more complete understanding of the benefits of PrEP. Inconsistent PrEP use was attributed to situational factors. Motives to discontinue PrEP included negative reactions from partners and stigmatizing healthcare services.While MSM evinced greater adherence challenges in this PrEP programme, almost 40% of TGW were protected by PrEP. Given high HIV incidences in TGW these findings hold promise for TGW PrEP programming in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3094479743,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau, a microtubule-associated protein (MAP), becomes hyperphosphorylated, aggregates, and accumulates in the somato-dendritic compartment of neurons. In parallel to its intracellular accumulation in AD, tau is also released in the extracellular space, as revealed by its increased presence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Consistent with this, recent studies, including ours, have reported that neurons secrete tau, and several therapeutic strategies aim to prevent the intracellular tau accumulation. Previously, we reported that late endosomes were implicated in tau secretion. Here, we explore the possibility of preventing intracellular tau accumulation by increasing tau secretion. Using neuronal models, we investigated whether overexpression of the vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), an R-SNARE found on late endosomes, could increase tau secretion. The overexpression of VAMP8 significantly increased tau secretion, decreasing its intracellular levels in the neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line. Increased tau secretion by VAMP8 was also observed in murine hippocampal slices. The intracellular reduction of tau by VAMP8 overexpression correlated to a decrease of acetylated tubulin induced by tau overexpression in N2a cells. VAMP8 staining was preferentially found on late endosomes in N2a cells. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, the fusion of VAMP8-positive vesicles with the plasma membrane was correlated to the depletion of tau in the cytoplasm. Finally, overexpression of VAMP8 reduced the intracellular accumulation of tau mutants linked to frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism and α-synuclein by increasing their secretion. Collectively, the present data indicate that VAMP8 could be used to increase tau and α-synuclein clearance to prevent their intracellular accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W3094349587,"Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is a mechanism of regulating light harvesting that protects the photosynthetic apparatus from photodamage by dissipating excess absorbed excitation energy as heat. In higher plants, the major light-harvesting antenna complex (LHCII) of photosystem (PS) II is directly involved in NPQ. The aggregation of LHCII is proposed to be involved in quenching. However, the lack of success in isolating native LHCII aggregates has limited the direct interrogation of this process. The isolation of LHCII in its native state from thylakoid membranes has been problematic because of the use of detergent, which tends to dissociate loosely bound proteins, and the abundance of pigment-protein complexes (e.g. PSI and PSII) embedded in the photosynthetic membrane, which hinders the preparation of aggregated LHCII. Here, we used a novel purification method employing detergent and amphipols to entrap LHCII in its natural states. To enrich the photosynthetic membrane with the major LHCII, we used Arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking the PSII minor antenna complexes (NoM), treated with lincomycin to inhibit the synthesis of PSI and PSII core proteins. Using sucrose density gradients, we succeeded in isolating the trimeric and aggregated forms of LHCII antenna. Violaxanthin- and zeaxanthin-enriched complexes were investigated in dark-adapted, NPQ, and dark recovery states. Zeaxanthin-enriched antenna complexes showed the greatest amount of aggregated LHCII. Notably, the amount of aggregated LHCII decreased upon relaxation of NPQ. Employing this novel preparative method, we obtained a direct evidence for the role of in vivo LHCII aggregation in NPQ."

Different calls typologies exist, and each ultrasonic call can be manually classified, but the qualitative analysis is highly time-consuming. Considering this framework, in this work we proposed and evaluated a set of supervised learning methods for automatic USVs classification. This could represent a sustainable procedure to deeply analyze the ultrasonic communication, other than a standardized analysis. We used manually built datasets obtained by segmenting the USVs audio tracks analyzed with the Avisoft software, and then by labelling each of them into 10 representative classes. For the automatic classification task, we designed a Convolutional Neural Network that was trained receiving as input the spectrogram images associated to the segmented audio files. In addition, we also tested some other supervised learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptrons, exploiting informative numerical features extracted from the spectrograms. The performance showed how considering the whole time/frequency information of the spectrogram leads to significantly higher performance than considering a subset of numerical features. In the authors’ opinion, the experimental results may represent a valuable benchmark for future work in this research field."
https://openalex.org/W3124666925,"Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver necrosis is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) in which APAP activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and specifically the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, leading to necrotic cell death. Previously, we have shown that receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1) knockdown is also protective against APAP RCD upstream of JNK. However, whether the kinase or platform function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP RCD is not known. To answer this question, we used genetic mouse models of targeted hepatocyte RIPK1 knockout (RIPK1HepCKO) or kinase dead knock-in (RIPK1D138N) and adult hepatocyte specific knockout of the cytoprotective protein A20 (A20HepCKO), known to interact with RIPK1, to study its potential involvement in MAPK signaling. We observed no difference in injury between WT and RIPK1D138N mice post APAP. However, RIPK1HepCKO was protective. We found that RIPK1HepCKO mice had attenuated pJNK activation, while A20 was simultaneously upregulated. Conversely, A20HepCKO markedly worsened liver injury from APAP. Mechanistically, we observed a significant upregulation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and increased JNK activation in A20HepCKO mice compared with littermate controls. We also demonstrated that A20 coimmunoprecipitated (co-IP) with both RIPK1 and ASK1, and that in the presence of RIPK1, there was less A20-ASK1 association than in its absence. We conclude that the kinase-independent platform function of RIPK1 is involved in APAP toxicity. Adult RIPK1HepCKO mice are protected against APAP by upregulating A20 and attenuating JNK signaling through ASK1, conversely, A20HepCKO worsens injury from APAP."

A major obstacle hindering investigations of the functional consequences of brain NaV channel mutations is an unexplained instability of the corresponding recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) when propagated in commonly used bacterial strains manifested by high spontaneous rates of mutation. Here, using a combination of in silico analysis, random and site-directed mutagenesis, we investigated the cause for instability of human NaV1.1 cDNA. We identified nucleotide sequences within the NaV1.1 coding region that resemble prokaryotic promoter-like elements, which are presumed to drive transcription of translationally toxic mRNAs in bacteria as the cause of the instability. We further demonstrated that mutations disrupting these elements mitigate the instability. Extending these observations, we generated full-length human NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 plasmids using one or two introns that interrupt the latent reading frames along with a minimum number of silent nucleotide changes that achieved stable propagation in bacteria. Expression of the stabilized sequences in cultured mammalian cells resulted in functional NaV channels with properties that matched their parental constructs. Our findings explain a widely observed instability of recombinant neuronal human NaV channels, and we describe re-engineered plasmids that attenuate this problem.

Recombinant brain-expressed voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels are important tools for investigating structure–function relationships, drug discovery, and for determining the consequences of naturally occurring human mutations associated with neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders such as epilepsy, familial migraine, and autism spectrum disorder (1Decaen P.G.

Toxicol. 2014; 54: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, high-throughput manipulations of these nucleic acid reagents are difficult owing to the instability of neuronal NaV channels when propagated in bacteria (3Feldman D.H. Lossin C. The NaV channel bench series: Plasmid preparation.MethodsX. 2014; 1: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). When transformed into typical Escherichia coli bacterial host cells, some neuronal NaV channel cDNAs, particularly NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6, exhibit a high spontaneous mutation rate resulting in single-nucleotide changes, small deletions, and insertion sequence (IS) element integrations. Certain bacterial strains (e.g., JM101, DH5α, DH10B/Top10) appear to be more prone to this instability while others such as Stbl2 and Epi400 can be used to maintain the cDNAs more stably, possibly by reducing the plasmid copy number. However, even in the more accommodating cell types, mutations do occur and render the isolated plasmid DNA useless for experiments. Clones on agar plates that appear early and grow into large colonies are almost invariably corrupt, whereas the small later-appearing clones have a lower incidence of spontaneous mutation. A number of approaches have been used to mitigate the plasmid instabilities of human neuronal NaV channel cDNAs, such as the use of the aforementioned Stbl2 or Epi400 host strains, low (30 °C) growth temperature, selecting only small colonies, and not allowing liquid cultures to reach the saturation phase (3Feldman D.H. Lossin C. The NaV channel bench series: Plasmid preparation.MethodsX. 2014; 1: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although these precautions can increase the odds of obtaining unaltered DNA, unwanted mutations still emerge. Codon optimization has been reported to alleviate the instability of recombinant NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 (4Bertelli S. Barbieri R. Pusch M. Gavazzo P.

However, this approach may not always be desirable because altering rare codons encoding protein transmembrane domains may impair translational pausing and affect proper protein folding (7Komar A.A. A pause for thought along the co-translational folding pathway.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 16-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8Mauro V.P. Chappell S.A.

Furthermore, while codon optimization may be effective for stabilizing cDNAs, this approach does not explain the cause of the instabilities. Because of the importance of NaV channel research and the cost in time and resources incurred by this instability, we sought to determine the underlying molecular causes to enable a rationally designed solution to generate stable NaV channel cDNAs with few or no codon alterations. We investigated causes of the bacterial instability of a recombinant human NaV1.1 cDNA (NCBI accession NM_001165963) by determining the stability of individual cloned subfragments (Fig. 1A). When divided into four overlapping cassettes (cassette-1: coding sequence nucleotides [c.] 1–1560; cassette-2: c.1555–3218; cassette-3: c.3213–5601; and cassette-4: c.5341–6030), only cassette-3 exhibited instability in bacteria as evidenced by a high proportion of isolated plasmid DNAs having altered restriction fragment patterns. To pinpoint sequences responsible for this instability, cassette-3 was further divided into seven overlapping subfragments for analysis. Two of the subfragments (subfragments 5 and 7) exhibited instability in bacteria suggesting they harbored unstable elements (Fig. 1B). To pinpoint sequences that were responsible for the instability, we used serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of subfragments 5 and 7 to introduce random mutations that would result in rare stabilizing events informative about the location of unstable elements. Plasmid DNA isolated from fast-growing (appearing after overnight growth) bacterial colonies was screened by restriction digestion to identify clones with correct restriction patterns, reasoning that some of those clones would have stabilizing single-nucleotide mutations. The sequences of three clones (one from subfragment 5, two from subfragment 7) were informative. Two of the three stable clones had single-nucleotide mutations (c.4507G>T and c.4594G>T, nucleotide numbering based on the full-length NaV1.1 open reading frame [ORF]) that introduced in-frame premature stop codons (E1503X and G1532X), whereas the third clone had a single nucleotide mutation (c.4157A>G) resulting in a nonsynonymous codon change (D1386E; Fig. 2A). This raised the possibility that stabilization of the cloned subfragments occurred secondary to either truncation or disruption of an inappropriately expressed portion of the NaV1.1 cDNA. Analysis of the sequence surrounding the nonsynonymous mutation revealed a prokaryotic promoter-like element. Specifically, the mutation disrupted a putative -35 box of a predicted Sigma 70 factor promoter-like sequence (Fig. 2B). These findings suggested that stop codons in the first two clones truncated a toxic reading frame translated from mRNA transcribed by the promoter-like sequence that was disrupted by the nonsynonymous mutation in the third clone. To test this hypothesis, three sets of silent mutations were made in the promoter-like sequence of cassette-3 to disrupt the putative -35 box (c.4155T>C), -10 box (c.4179T>C and c.4182T>C), or both elements (Fig. 2B). All three sets of silent mutations resulted in stable cDNA clones. To test whether the instability in the cassette correlated with a translated region of NaV1.1, four in-frame methionine residues (Met1435, Met1438, Met1459, and Met1500) in the original cDNA between the promoter-like sequence and the earliest PCR-induced stop codon were mutated from ATG to ATA. Only one ATG>ATA mutation (c.4500G>A; Met1500Ile) stabilized cassette-3, indicating that this codon may serve as an aberrant translation start (Fig. 3A). In support of this idea, a high-scoring bacterial ribosome-binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence; TTTGGAGGT) was predicted 13–21 nucleotides 5′ of this ATG (c.4486–4497; Fig. 3B). The location of this cryptic reading frame within the full-length NaV1.1 cDNA sequence aligns with the last six-transmembrane domain (domain IV) of the encoded NaV channel protein. Introduction of the cassette-3 stabilizing mutations into the full-length NaV1.1 cDNA did not stabilize the entire plasmid, and we suspected the existence of other cryptic promoter-like elements elsewhere in the sequence. While NaV1.1 cassettes 1 and 2 were stable individually, they were unstable when assembled together. Using a similar strategy that led to identification of promoter-like elements in cassette-3, we tested the stability of six overlapping subfragments of cassette-1/2 and identified a 2029 bp unstable segment (c.749–2778). Mutating one of the four methionine codons (Met-350; c.1048–1050) in this segment to ATA stabilized cassette-1/2. An in silico search for additional cryptic promoters identified high-scoring promoter-like sequences (see Experimental procedures) between positions c.27 and c.3113 (Table S1). Cassettes 1 and 2 were remade by gene synthesis to disrupt the putative promoter elements with silent mutations (Table S2), then recombined with the stabilized cassette-3 and the unaltered stable cassette-4. The final reconstructed full-length cDNA (Fig. S1) included 60 synonymous nucleotide changes and was stably propagated in bacteria (Top10 cells) grown at 37 °C. We inferred that a cryptic promoter located at nucleotide position 875–903 was driving a toxic reading frame initiated at Met-350. Figure 4 illustrates the location of cryptic bacterial promoters, translation start sites, and toxic peptides on a topographical map of the NaV1.1 channel. Guided by these initial observations, we chose a simpler strategy that required fewer alterations of the coding sequence to stabilize the human NaV1.1 cDNA and two other human neuronal sodium channels (NaV1.2, NCBI accession NM_021007; NaV1.6, NCBI accession NM_014191) using short introns to interrupt the putative toxic reading frames. We introduced introns at native exon–exon junctions close to or within the sequence analogous to the toxic reading frame found in NaV1.1 or in regions where bacterial insertion elements had been previously observed in stable but mutated NaV1.1 clones. We inserted a previously published β-globin/IgG chimeric intron intervening sequence (IVS) (GenBank accession U47120) immediately after c.2946 in the NaV1.1 cDNA. The human NaV1.1 cDNA required additional silent mutations to disable a cryptic promoter located at nucleotide position 875–903 including c.879G>A in the -35 box and three others (c.897T>C, c.900T>C, c.903C>T) in the -10 box (Fig. S2), as well as a silent change (c.4155T>C) in the -35 box described earlier. Stabilization of the NaV1.2 cDNA was achieved by inserting the IVS immediately after c.4551, and no other substitutions were required. For the NaV1.6 cDNA, we inserted the IVS immediately after c.4281 and a second intron after c.2370. The second intron was derived from intron 4 of human HSPA5 (NCBI accession NM_005347) modified so it more closely matched the consensus for eukaryote splice acceptor sites (designated HSPA5 intron 4 v2; Fig. S3). We also examined the effects of a silent mutation (c.1383T>C) designed to disrupt an out-of-frame mini-ORF spanning c.1382–1390 (ATG CCA TAG) that appeared to contribute to bacterial toxicity (slower bacterial growth rate) of a partial-length cDNA fragment. However, this mutation did not impact cDNA stability or plasmid yields of full-length NaV1.6 and was therefore was not included in the final construct. We also made two silent mutations (c.4208A>G, c.4211T>C) to disrupt a putative promoter-like sequence analogous to that discovered in the NaV1.1 cDNA. The combination of these modifications resulted in full-length NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 cDNAs that were stable in bacteria (TOP10 host strain) grown under usual conditions (Fig. S4). The complete nucleotide sequences of intron stabilized NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 are presented in Figures S5–S7. Finally, we compared the functional properties of the original and intron stabilized NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 cDNAs by performing whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of transiently transfected HEK-293T cells. We observed no differences in overall kinetics of activation or inactivation of whole-cell sodium current for any isoform (Fig. 5). Additionally, we measured voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, recovery from inactivation, and frequency-dependent rundown at 50 Hz and found no differences in functional properties between the NaV channels with or without introns (Table 1, Fig. S8). We concluded that insertion of introns and silent mutations into human NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.6 cDNAs had no functional impact on the encoded channels.Table 1Biophysical properties of original and stabilized human NaV channelsPropertyOriginalnStabilizednHuman NaV1.1V1/2 activation (mV)−22.4 ± 0.914−23.3 ± 1.714Slope (k)6.5 ± 0.1146.4 ± 0.214V1/2 inactivation (mV)−56.9 ± 1.114−58.6 ± 1.514Slope (k)−4.9 ± 0.214−4.5 ± 0.114Recovery tau fast (ms)1.5 ± 0.1121.5 ± 0.112% Tau fast77.5 ± 3.01277.5 ± 3.012Recovery tau slow (ms)243.9 ± 14.112259.1 ± 14.912Inactivation tau 0 mV (ms)0.40 ± 0.03140.37 ± 0.0314Frequency-dependent rundown 50 Hz (P300/P1)0.79 ± 0.04120.81 ± 0.0414Human NaV1.2V1/2 activation (mV)−24.4 ± 1.514−25.3 ± 1.114Slope (k)6.7 ± 0.2146.1 ± 0.214V1/2 inactivation (mV)−68.0 ± 1.514−66.8 ± 1.714Slope (k)−6.0 ± 0.414−5.9 ± 0.114Recovery tau fast (ms)1.7 ± 0.1121.6 ± 0.115% Tau fast81.2 ± 2.31283.3 ± 2.315Recovery tau slow (ms)263.9 ± 38.612264.7 ± 27.815Inactivation tau 0 mV (ms)0.42 ± 0.03120.39 ± 0.0214Frequency-dependent rundown 50 Hz (P300/P1)0.70 ± 0.04130.72 ± 0.0214Human NaV1.6V1/2 activation (mV)−24.0 ± 0.715−25.5 ± 1.116Slope (k)6.0 ± 0.2155.7 ± 0.416V1/2 inactivation (mV)−66.5 ± 1.615−66.4 ± 0.816Slope (k)−5.9 ± 0.315−5.9 ± 0.316Recovery tau fast (ms)1.4 ± 0.1131.5 ± 0.114% Tau fast81.7 ± 4.11381.7 ± 4.114Recovery tau slow (ms)240.5 ± 29.313256.0 ± 29.714Inactivation tau 0 mV (ms)0.51 ± 0.02150.52 ± 0.0315Frequency-dependent rundown 50 Hz (P300/P1)0.82 ± 0.05130.82 ± 0.0315 Open table in a new tab Recombinant human brain NaV channels are essential molecular tools for determining the functional consequences of disease-causing mutations and for pharmacological studies including drug discovery (10George Jr., A.L. Inherited disorders of voltage-gated sodium channels.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, use of these molecular reagents is hindered by an intrinsic instability of recombinant NaV channel plasmid in bacteria, which was of unclear origin until our study. Here, we deduced that the instability of brain NaV channel cDNAs in bacteria correlated with the presence of one or more cryptic promoter-like elements driving reading frames that encode peptides apparently toxic to the transfected cells. We speculate that this is coupled to a negative fitness selection against bacteria carrying intact clones, but a favorable fitness selection for cells carrying clones with interrupted or truncated reading frames. According to this model, the instability of brain NaV cDNAs in bacteria is the result of favorable growth of bacterial clones carrying mutant cDNAs in which the toxic reading frames have been inactivated. The presence of cryptic bacterial promoter-like elements in unstable recombinant human and viral genes has been well documented. The cloning of human growth hormone cDNA encountered difficulties with propagating clones in bacteria because of an inherent toxicity of the recombinant molecule. The cause of this toxicity was traced to a cryptic promoter that could be neutralized by a single-nucleotide change designed to disrupt a TATA box and this resulted in stable high copy number clones (11Bieth E. Cahoreau C. Cholin S. Molinas C. Cerutti Rochiccioli P. Devauchelle G. Tauber M.

A similar liability has been encountered with certain recombinant viral coding sequences that could be overcome by intron insertion (12Johansen I.E.

Virol. 2011; 85: 2927-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The presence of cryptic bacterial promoters in recombinant cDNAs may be under appreciated and should be considered when troubleshooting unstable low-yield plasmids. The exact manner in which the expressed fragments of brain NaV channels exert toxic effects in E. coli cells is unknown. We speculate that toxicity may be the result of integration of the products, which contain transmembrane domains, into the bacterial plasma membrane leading to selection against host cells due to membrane stress. It is also possible that the product forms toxic inclusion bodies. We identified a potentially toxic out-of-frame mini-ORF in human NaV1.6 (c. 875–903), but this did not contribute to the overall instability of the full-length cDNA. Small ORFs can promote accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA and inhibition of protein synthesis as has been demonstrated for the bacteriophage lambda two-codon barl minigene (14Cruz-Vera L.R.

The approach used by Bertelli et al. (4Bertelli S. Barbieri R. Pusch M. Gavazzo P.

Inspection of their optimized NaV1.1 sequence revealed strategic single-nucleotide changes that inadvertently disrupted specific promoter-like elements including two modifications to the -10 box (c.900T>C, c.903T>C) in cassette 1, single-nucleotide substitutions in the -35 box (c.4158C>T) and -10 box (c.4182T>C) in cassette 3, and changes to the predicted Shine–Dalgarno sequence in cassette 3 (c.4482A>G, c.4485T>G). These modifications are likely reasons for the stabilization of their plasmid. Codon optimization of human NaV1.6 (5Patel R.R. Barbosa C. Brustovetsky T. Brustovetsky N. Cummins T.R.

Despite the success of codon optimization to stabilize brain NaV channel cDNAs, it may be desirable to maintain the natural codon usage whenever possible because synonymous nucleotide changes may inadvertently disrupt the kinetics of translation required for proper protein folding (7Komar A.A. A pause for thought along the co-translational folding pathway.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 16-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 8Mauro V.P. Chappell S.A.

Kashina A. Sounds of silence: Synonymous nucleotides as a key to biological regulation and complexity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 2073-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Rare codons may promote translational pausing that enables cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide. Membrane proteins including ion channels may be particularly vulnerable to these effects. For example, codon optimization of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel alters its biosynthesis in heterologous cells and causes a significant difference in the voltage dependence of activation compared with expression of cDNA with the native coding sequence (16Bertalovitz A.C. Badhey M.L.O. McDonald T.V. Synonymous nucleotide modification of the KCNH2 gene affects both mRNA characteristics and translation of the encoded hERG ion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 12120-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The effects of widespread synonymous codon modifications may confound efforts to determine the functional consequences of nonsynonymous disease-associated NaV channel variants. The approach we used to stabilize brain NaV channels alleviates this concern, specifically addresses the mechanism responsible for instability, and preserves the functional properties of the original constructs. We assessed NaV channel plasmid instability primarily by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from small-volume overnight cultures. Deviations in restriction fragment patterns were used as a qualitative index of plasmid instability, and the proportion of bacterial clones showing disrupted patterns was used to semiquantify the degree of instability. Plasmid DNA was digested for 1 h at 37 °C with NcoI (New England BioLabs) unless otherwise specified in a final volume of 20 μl before evaluating restriction fragment patterns by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Overnight growth of Top10 bacterial colonies on agar and in liquid culture was used as a surrogate for plasmid-related toxicity, which was inferred by poor growth or low plasmid yields. Clones with the correct restriction digest pattern were then subjected to Sanger sequencing using a commercial vendor (Eurofins Genomics). Overlapping fragments of the unstable NaV1.1 cassette-3 were amplified in PCRs using Q5 Hot Start High Fidelity 2x Master mix (New England Biolabs) and the primer pairs listed in Table S1. Cycling conditions were: 98 °C for 3 min; followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 10 s, 72 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 10 min. Fragments were gel purified using the NucleoBond Gel/PCR purification system and then ligated into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher Scientific). Three microliter of ligation reactions were used to transform chemically competent One Shot Top10 cells (Invitrogen) that were then plated on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Large kanamycin-resistant colonies were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 3 ml LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was isolated using NucleoBond miniprep spin columns and then digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs). Three clones with a wild-type restriction pattern were sequenced in both directions using the M13F and M13R primers by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). We identified potential cryptic bacterial promoters using the Berkeley Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool (http://www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html) for prokaryotic promoters on the sense strand with 0.9 as the cutoff score. We also searched the cDNA sequences using BPROM using a threshold for promoters of 0.2 (17Solovyev V. Salamov A. Automatic annotation of microbial genomes and metagenomic sequences.in: Li R.W. Metagenomics and it Applications in Agriculture, Biomedicine and Environmental Studies. Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY2011: 61-78Google Scholar) and with the DNA Element Search Tool of pLOT Plasmid Mapper using a cutoff of 0.75 (http://www.plasmidplotter.com/). Potential ORFs, which were in-frame with the sodium channel ORF, were identified using pLOT Plasmid Mapper's Shine Dalgarno/ORF finder with minimal ORF sizes set to greater than 200 amino acids and a 0.8 cutoff score. Potential out-of-frame toxic mini ORFs were similarly identified by specifying a maximal ORF size of five amino acids. Primers were designed with the mutation(s) of interest, a minimal 5′ overlap of 20 bp, and a predicted melting temperature (Tm) of 60 °C using custom software. PCR was performed with 10 ng of plasmid DNA template using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl according to the manufacturer's recommendations except that the extension time was set to 80 s per kb for a total of 20 cycles. Plasmid template DNA in the reaction was digested with DpnI (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C, then 2.5 μl of digested PCR reactions were used to transform chemically competent Top10 cells using a standard heat shock protocol and selected with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. In silico analysis of high ranking E. coli Sigma70 promoter-like sequences was performed on the first 3213 bp of the wild-type human NaV1.1 cDNA. Cassettes 1 (bp 1–1560) and cassette 2 (bp 1555–3213) were synthesized as double-stranded DNAs (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) with the top ranking promoter-like elements altered by synonymous mutations and cloned into pCR4-Blunt (Invitrogen). Bacterial clones were screened by restriction digestion and those with correct patterns were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The modified cassettes 1 and 2 were assembled with the stabilized cassette 3 in the pCR4 vector and subsequently subcloned into a mammalian expression plasmid for functional studies (see below). All cDNA constructs were sequenced in their entirety by Sanger sequencing beginning at the promoter through the polyadenylation signal. The introns were PCR amplified using Q5 Hot Start 2x Master Mix (New England BioLabs) with primers designed to contain homology arms to their respective targets. PCR fragments were inserted into linearized NaV channel expression plasmids by Gibson Assembly using NEBuilder HiFi Assembly Mix according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England BioLabs). Introns were inserted after c.2946 (exon 15/16 junction) of NaV1.1, and after c.4551 (exon 25/26 junction) of NaV1.2. NaV1.1 also required silent mutations in a promoter-like element located at c.875–903. In NaV1.6, the first intron was inserted after c.2370, between exons 14 and 15, and the second intron was inserted after c.4370, between exons 22 and 23. Two silent mutations (c.4119A>G, c.4122T>C) were made to a cryptic promoter-like sequence analogous to that of the NaV1.1 cassette 3 promoter. Final constructs were subcloned into mammalian expression plasmids pIR-CMV (NaV1.1, NaV1.2) (18Kahlig K.M. Saridey S.K. Kaja A. Daniels M.A. George Jr., A.L. Wilson M.H. Multiplexed transposon-mediated stable gene transfer in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or pcDNA4/TO (NaV1.6; ThermoFisher). Each construct included an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES2) after the sodium channel sequence that was followed by the reading frame for the fluorescent protein mScarlet. Heterologous expression of NaV channels was performed in HEK293T cells (CRL-3216, American Type Culture Collection). Cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently cotransfected with original or intron-stabilized NaV1.1, NaV1.2, or NaV1.6, along with the human NaV β1 and β2 subunits (2 μg total plasmid DNA was transfected with a cDNA ratio of 10:1:1 for NaV1.X:β1:β2 subunits) using Qiagen SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Human β1 and β2 cDNAs were cloned into plasmids encoding the CD8 receptor (CD8-IRES-hβ1) or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (EFGP-IRES-hβ2), respectively, as transfection markers, as previously described (19Lossin C.

Whole-cell voltage clamp recording of heterologous cells was performed as previously described (20Thompson C.H. Kahlig K.M. George Jr., A.L.

Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were made at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus Ltd) with a multistage P-1000 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments Co) and fire-polished using a microforge (Narashige MF-830) to a resistance of 1.0–2.0 MΩ. The pipette solution consisted of (in mM): 10 NaF, 105 CsF, 20 CsCl, 2 EGTA, and 10 HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH and osmolality adjusted to 300 mOsmol/kg with sucrose. The recording solution was continuously perfused with bath solution containing (in mM): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 10 HEPES with pH 7.35, and osmolality 310 mOsmol/kg. A Ag/AgCl pellet served as the reference electrode. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Voltage clamp pulse generation and data collection were done using Clampex 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell capacitance was determined by integrating capacitive transients generated by a voltage step from −120 mV to −110 mV filtered at 100 kHz low-pass Bessel filtering. Series resistance was compensated with prediction >70% and correction >90% to assure that the command potential was reached within microseconds with a voltage error <3 mV. Leak currents were subtracted by using an online P/4 procedure. All whole-cell currents were filtered at 5 kHz low-pass Bessel filtering and digitized at 50 kHz. All voltage clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–25 °C). Data were analyzed using a combination of Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices), Microsoft Excel 2019, and GraphPad Prism 8.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Peak current was normalized for cell capacitance and plotted against step voltage to generate a peak current density–voltage relationship. Whole-cell sodium currents were elicited by 500 ms pulses ranging from –120 to 60 mV, followed by a tail pulse to 0 mV, from a holding potential of –120 mV. Whole-cell conductance (GNa) was calculated as GNa = I/(V – Erev), where I is the measured peak current, V is the step potential, and Erev is the calculated sodium reversal potential predicted by linear regression of the I-V curve for each cell. GNa at each voltage step was normalized to the maximum conductance between −80 mV and 40 mV. To calculate voltage dependence of activation (protocol described in figure insets), normalized GNa was plotted against voltage and fitted with the Boltzmann function G/Gmax= (1 + exp[(V – V1/2)/k])−1, where V1/2 indicates the voltage at half-maximal activation and k is a slope factor describing voltage sensitivity of the channel. Voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was assessed by plotting currents generated by the 0 mV postpulse voltage step normalized to the maximum current against prepulse voltage step from –120 to 10 mV in 10 mV increments. The plot was fitted with the Boltzmann function. Time-dependent recovery from inactivation was evaluated by a two-step protocol. The first pulse elicited currents with a 100 ms pulse to –10 mV from a holding potential of –120 mV to inactivate channels. The second pulse to –10 mV was elicited after varying recovery periods ranging from 1 to 3000 ms. Time-dependent recovery from inactivation was evaluated by fitting peak current recovery with a two-exponential function. Frequency dependent rundown was assessed by 300 pulses (4 ms) to 0 mV elicited at a frequency of 50 Hz. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

https://openalex.org/W3093259099,"Faithful replication of the mitochondrial genome is carried out by a set of key nuclear-encoded proteins. DNA polymerase γ is a core component of the mtDNA replisome and the only replicative DNA polymerase localized to mitochondria. The asynchronous mechanism of mtDNA replication predicts that the replication machinery encounters dsDNA and unique physical barriers such as structured genes, G-quadruplexes, and other obstacles. In vitro experiments here provide evidence that the polymerase γ heterotrimer is well-adapted to efficiently synthesize DNA, despite the presence of many naturally occurring roadblocks. However, we identified a specific G-quadruplex-forming sequence at the heavy-strand promoter (HSP1) that has the potential to cause significant stalling of mtDNA replication. Furthermore, this structured region of DNA corresponds to the break site for a large (3,895 bp) deletion observed in mitochondrial disease patients. The presence of this deletion in humans correlates with UV exposure, and we have found that efficiency of polymerase γ DNA synthesis is reduced after this quadruplex is exposed to UV in vitro."

OGT is highly expressed in pancreatic glucagon-secreting cells (α-cells), which secrete glucagon in response to hypoglycemia. The objective of this study was to determine whether OGT is necessary for the regulation of α-cell mass and function in vivo. We utilized genetic manipulation to produce two α-cell specific OGT-knockout models: a constitutive glucagon-Cre (αOGTKO) and an inducible glucagon-Cre (i-αOGTKO), which effectively delete OGT in α-cells. Using approaches including immunoblotting, immunofluorescent imaging, and metabolic phenotyping in vivo, we provide the first insight on the role of O-GlcNAcylation in α-cell mass and function. αOGTKO mice demonstrated normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity but displayed significantly lower glucagon levels during both fed and fasted states. αOGTKO mice exhibited significantly lower α-cell glucagon content and α-cell mass at 6 months of age. In fasting, αOGTKO mice showed impaired pyruvate stimulated gluconeogenesis in vivo and reduced glucagon secretion in vitro. i-αOGTKO mice showed similarly reduced blood glucagon levels, defective in vitro glucagon secretion, and normal α-cell mass. Interestingly, both αOGTKO and i-αOGTKO mice had no deficiency in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis under fed or fasting conditions, despite impairment in α-cell mass and function, and glucagon content.

In the pancreas, glucose homeostasis is mainly regulated by the islets of Langerhans, which consist of different endocrine cells including the β-cells and α-cells (1Da Silva Xavier G. The cells of the islets of Langerhans.J. Clin. Med. 2018; 7: 54Crossref Google Scholar). β-cells secrete insulin in response to high blood glucose. In contrast, α-cells secrete glucagon in response to low blood glucose levels. Together, these endocrine cells, secreting their counter regulatory hormones, work together to maintain blood glucose at a physiological level (2Folli F. La Rosa S. Finzi G. Davalli A.M. Galli A. Dick Jr., E.J. Perego C. Mendoza R.G. Pancreatic islet of Langerhans' cytoarchitecture and ultrastructure in normal glucose tolerance and in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2018; 20 Suppl 2: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, a clear role for absolute deficiency or insufficiency in insulin has been established (3Donath M.Y. Halban P.A. Decreased beta-cell mass in diabetes: Significance, mechanisms and therapeutic implications.Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition to altered insulin levels, dysregulation of glucagon levels in T1D and T2D contributes to the pathology of these diseases (4D'Alessio D. The role of dysregulated glucagon secretion in type 2 diabetes.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2011; 13 Suppl 1: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Wewer Albrechtsen N.J. Kuhre R.E. Pedersen J. Knop F.K. Holst J.J. The biology of glucagon and the consequences of hyperglucagonemia.Biomark. Med. 2016; 10: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). High glucagon levels in both T1D and T2D exacerbate hyperglycemia due to enhanced hepatic glucose output (6Lund A. Bagger J.I. Christensen M. Knop F.K. Vilsboll T. Glucagon and type 2 diabetes: The return of the alpha cell.Curr. Diab. Rep. 2014; 14: 555Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). While the cause and result of functional β-cell deficiency have been studied heavily in the field, the mechanisms and impact of α-cell failure are less known. Thus, a greater understanding of processes that regulate α-cell function may present new avenues for optimal glucose control in T1D or advanced therapy for T2D patients. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) is a minor branch of glycolysis responsible for the production of the key substrate for protein glycosylation, UDP-GlcNAc (7Love D.C. Hanover J.A. The hexosamine signaling pathway: Deciphering the “O-GlcNAc code”.Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005re13PubMed Google Scholar). Posttranslational addition of UDP-GlcNAc (known as O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic and reversible process analogous to phosphorylation and has been shown to affect the function, stability, and subcellular localization of many proteins (8Hanover J.A. Krause M.W. Love D.C. The hexosamine signaling pathway: O-GlcNAc cycling in feast or famine.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 80-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed solely by the enzyme O-linked GlcNAc transferase (OGT), by means of the addition of UDP-GlcNAc to the serine or threonine residues on nuclear and cytosolic proteins (9Hart G.W. Akimoto Y. The O-GlcNAc modification.in: Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology Chapter 18. Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009Google Scholar). Conversely, the O-GlcNAc is removed by the enzyme O-linked β-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase or OGA) (10Gloster T.M. Vocadlo D.J. Mechanism, structure, and inhibition of O-GlcNAc processing enzymes.Curr. Signal Transduct. Ther. 2010; 5: 74-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 to 5% of glucose entering the cell is shunted toward use by the HBP, and therefore, the degree of O-GlcNAcylation present in the cell is dependent on the amount of nutrients (glucose) present in the cellular environment (11Vasconcelos-Dos-Santos A. Oliveira I.A. Lucena M.C. Mantuano N.R. Whelan S.A. Dias W.B. Todeschini A.R. Biosynthetic machinery involved in aberrant glycosylation: Promising targets for developing of drugs against cancer.Front. Oncol. 2015; 5: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). OGT is richly expressed in the pancreas (12Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). At the protein level, OGT appears to be more abundantly expressed in islets compared with the acinar tissue (14Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E.

Within the islet, high OGT mRNA expression has been detected in both the α- and β-cells (12Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W.

Elevated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine metabolism in pancreatic beta-cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, our group reported that O-GlcNAcylation is essential for cell survival and function. We reported that loss of O-GlcNAcylation in the β-cell leads to cell failure and diabetes in mice due to increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis (14Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Disruption of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine signaling induces ER stress and beta cell failure.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2527-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ablation of OGT in pancreatic progenitors also leads to an increased apoptosis (16Baumann D. Wong A. Akhaphong B. Jo S. Pritchard S. Mohan R. Chung G. Zhang Y. Alejandro E.U. Role of nutrient-driven O-GlcNAc-posttranslational modification in pancreatic exocrine and endocrine islet development.Development. 2020; 147dev186643Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Independent of its role in cell survival, OGT also regulates insulin secretion at basal (14Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Disruption of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine signaling induces ER stress and beta cell failure.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2527-2538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in obesity conditions in part through SERCA2 (17Lockridge A.,J.S. Gustafson E. Damberg N. Mohan R. Olson M. Abrahante J. Alejandro E.U. Islet O-GlcNAcylation is required for lipid-potentiation of insulin secretion through SERCA2.Cell Rep. 2020; 31: 107609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, OGT regulates insulin processing via downstream target eIF4G1, a translation initiation factor (18Jo S. Lockridge A. Alejandro E.U. eIF4G1 and carboxypeptidase E axis dysregulation in O-GlcNAc transferase-deficient pancreatic beta cells contributes to hyperproinsulinemia in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 13040-13050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, as a nutrient sensor protein that is highly expressed in glucagon-secreting cells, the role of OGT in α-cells has not been explored. We hypothesize that OGT plays a key role in the maintenance of α-cell mass and proper function of secreting glucagon in response to hypoglycemia. It is unknown how nutrient-driven posttranslational O-GlcNAcylation of proteins impacts pancreas α-cell mass and function. In the currently study, through the characterization of mice lacking α-cell OGT, the only enzyme capable of adding O-GlcNAc modification onto proteins, we show that O-GlcNAcylation is necessary for the maintenance of α-cell mass and regulation of glucagon secretion. High expression of OGT mRNA has been reported in the pancreas (12Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Localization of the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase in rat pancreas.Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Within the islet, it is controversial whether glucagon-producing α-cells or insulin-producing β-cells express more OGT mRNA (12Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Localization of the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase in rat pancreas.Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2407-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Hanover J.A. Lai Z. Lee G. Lubas W.A. Sato S.M. Elevated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine metabolism in pancreatic beta-cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first sought to compare protein levels of OGT and OGA between α-cells and β-cells cell lines due to the limited number and difficulty of selecting α-cells in primary islets. Baseline levels of OGT and OGA protein were measured in αTC-1 and βTC-6 immortalized cell lines (Fig. 1A). OGT levels were similar in both cell types in cell lines (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1, A and B). However, there was a significantly lower level of OGA protein present in the αTC-1 cell line compared with the βTC-6 cell line (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1, A and C). Interestingly, the level of O-GlcNAcylation, measured by the RL2 antibody, was comparable between both cell lines (Fig. S1D). RL2 is a specific O-GlcNAc antibody that has been validated in our lab (18Jo S. Lockridge A. Alejandro E.U. eIF4G1 and carboxypeptidase E axis dysregulation in O-GlcNAc transferase-deficient pancreatic beta cells contributes to hyperproinsulinemia in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 13040-13050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and others (19Tashima Y. Stanley P.

Monoclonal antibodies identify a group of nuclear pore complex glycoproteins.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that OGT and OGA are expressed in α-cells, and thus the role of O-GlcNAcylation in α-cell physiology should be tested in vivo. Therefore, we next tested the hypothesis that OGT is required for the maintenance of α-cell mass and for appropriate α-cell function in vivo. We utilized genetic manipulation to generate a mouse model with α-cell specific OGT deletion in vivo. αOGTKO mice were produced by crossing Gcg-Cre mice (constitutive KO) with OGTflox/flox mice. To facilitate lineage tracing, αOGTKO mice were also crossed with a fluorescent Cre reporter (either RFP or GFP) to mark all cells exhibiting the Cre activity. The Gcg-Cre recombination efficiency was previously calculated at 94 to 97% of α-cells, whereas it was detected in a negligible (∼0.2%) proportion of β-cells (21Shiota C. Prasadan K. Guo P. Fusco J. Xiao X. Gittes G.K. Gcg (CreERT2) knockin mice as a tool for genetic manipulation in pancreatic alpha cells.Diabetologia. 2017; 60: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our hands, we detected RFP, by immunofluorescent staining, colocalized with glucagon-expressing cells of the islet in Gcg-cre, OGTWT mice (Fig. 1D). We then compared the staining patterns in Gcg-cre, OGTWT mice with those in αOGTKO mice. In addition, we conducted RL2 staining to test whether genetic deletion of OGT in the α-cells had an effect on O-GlcNAcylation. At 1 month of age, αOGTKO mice showed reduced RL2 staining in glucagon-positive cells in comparison with the control (Fig. 1E). Importantly, the glucagon-positive cells with reduced RL2 staining were also positive for RFP, suggesting activation of the Gcg-Cre in these cells. These data confirmed that our αOGT deletion resulted in a decrease in α-cell O-GlcNAcylation. After confirming that OGT deletion reduced O-GlcNAcylation in α-cells, we next sought to assess the metabolic health of the αOGTKO mice in fed and fasted states, in order to determine what effect this deficit has on islet function. In nonfasted states, male and female αOGTKO mice showed normal blood glucose levels (Fig. 2, A and B) as well as no alterations in serum insulin levels, compared with controls (Fig. S2, A and B). When we analyzed serum for glucagon levels, however, male αOGTKO mice displayed significantly reduced levels of serum glucagon in the fed state (Fig. 2C). Comparable level of glucagon was observed in female αOGTHET and control (Fig. 2D). Female αOGTKO mice showed a trend toward reduction of serum glucagon levels in nonfasted state, but the results did not reach significance (Fig. 2D). Both male and female αOGTKO mice displayed normal glucose tolerance (Fig. 2, E and F). Additionally, neither group showed differences in insulin sensitivity via IP insulin tolerance test (Fig. 2, G and H). These results show that in spite of their reduced serum glucagon levels, αOGTKO mice manage to maintain normal glucose homeostasis. Next, we challenged the αOGTKO mice by performing a fasting experiment. Male control and αOGTKO mice showed similar decrease in blood glucose after 18 h of fasting (Fig. 3A). Control and αOGTKO blood glucose levels did level off and even begin to increase between 18 and 24 h of fasting, and there was a trend toward higher increase in the αOGTKO (Fig. 3A). Female control and partial or full αOGTKO mice also showed similar decrease in blood glucose after 16 h of fasting, with no marked differences in glucose level (Fig. 3B). During this fasting period, male αOGTKO circulating glucagon levels were significantly lower than the control (Fig. 3C). Female αOGTKO circulating glucagon levels were significantly lower at the 16-h fasted timepoint (Fig. 3D). These knockout mice failed to increased serum glucagon levels in response to the fasting. When subjected to an IP pyruvate tolerance test, which measures the gluconeogenesis capacity of the mice in a hypoglycemic condition, both male (Fig. 3E) and female (Fig. 3F) αOGTKO mice exhibited significantly reduced blood glucose in response to pyruvate injection compared with the control, indicating impaired gluconeogenesis. Four-month-old male αOGTKO mice exhibited normal glucagon sensitivity (Fig. 3G). Liver glycogen measurement in both male and female mice showed no significant differences (Fig. 3H). These results show that αOGTKO mice were able to maintain normal glucose homeostasis, despite evidence of reduced glucagon levels in the circulation. After observing reduced glucagon levels in αOGTKO mice, we determined whether loss of α-cell mass can contribute to this effect. Morphometric analysis of 1-month-old male αOGTKO pancreata demonstrated that α-cell mass at postweaning age was not statistically different between genotypes (Fig. 4, A and B). However, α-cell mass was significantly decreased in 6-month-old male αOGTKO mice with an average mass of approximately 0.08 mg in the αOGTKO, compared with an average of approximately 0.33 in the control (Fig. 4, C and D). Representative images of the whole pancreas were shown in Fig. S3, A and B. Based on these data, we hypothesized that α-cells were diminishing over time in αOGTKO mice. Due to the heterogeneity of islet cells, and limitations imposed by using primary islets from αOGTKO mice (reduced number of α-cells in αOGTKO islets), we used αTC-1 cells to assess the effect of OGT inhibition on α-cell death. We used the OGT inhibitor, OSMI-1 (50 μM), to reduce O-GlcNAcylation in αTC-1 cells. OSMI-1 treatment of αTC-1 cells decreased O-GlcNAcylation measured at both 8 and 24 h timepoints compared with control (DMSO) samples (Fig. S4A), demonstrating successful reduction of O-GlcNAcylation. We then assessed the protein level of apoptosis markers, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Fig. 4, E–G). During apoptosis, PARP, a nuclear DNA-binding protein, which detects DNA strand breaks and performs in base excision repair, is cleaved by caspase-3. Here, we observed a trend of increased levels of cleaved-PARP and a significant increase in cleaved-caspase-3 level after 24 h treatment with OSMI-1. We previously reported that β-cell OGT-deficient cells display ER stress-mediated apoptosis (14Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S.

These data suggest that increased ER stress may contribute to cell death in αTC-1 cells when O-GlcNAcylation is blocked, consistent with the reported effects of OGT inhibition in other pancreatic cells (14Alejandro E.U. Bozadjieva N. Kumusoglu D. Abdulhamid S. Levine H. Haataja L. Vadrevu S. Satin L.S. Arvan P. Bernal-Mizrachi E.

After establishing the effect of OGT loss on α-cell mass, we next sought to determine the effect on α-cell function. To assess α-cell function, we subjected islets from 2-month-old male mice to an in vitro glucose and arginine-inhibited glucagon secretion test in vitro. Younger mice were used for this test in order to avoid major confounding effect of reduced α-cell number present per islet, since our data show a severe reduction of α-cell mass in 6-month-old mice. Islets isolated from 2-month-old male αOGTKO mice showed a significant impairment in glucagon secretion compared with control, as shown by the significantly lower amount of glucagon released when islets were treated with 1 mM glucose +20 mM arginine condition for 1 h (Fig. 5A). A trend toward a lower level of total islet glucagon content (normalized by islet DNA) was also observed (Fig. 5B). This indicated to us that the secretory defect in αOGTKO islets was not likely due to a defect in secretory mechanism, but rather could be attributed to lower glucagon content per single α-cell in the αOGTKO islets. Assessment of total pancreas glucagon content was not ideal due to the defect in α-cell mass. Therefore, to directly assess glucagon content at the single cell level, we dispersed islets from αOGTKO mice with GFP reporter for visualization and hand-picked GFP cells under the microscope (Fig. S5A). We determined that the averaged glucagon content per cell in αOGTKO mice was significantly reduced compared with that of the control cells (Fig. 5C). To test whether glucagon biosynthesis is altered in the islets, we assessed for glucagon transcript and observed a reduction in i-αOGTKO islets (Fig. S4C). We also treated αTC-1 cells acutely with OSMI-1 as before. We found decreased mRNA levels of α-cells transcription factors (Arx, Nkx2.2, and FOXA2, Fig. 5, D–F) as well as protein level of FOXA2 in OGT-inhibited αTC-1 cells (Fig. 5, H and I). However, no significant reduction in glucagon mRNA level was detected in the OSMI-1-treated αTC-1 cells (Fig. 5G). Then, we assessed the protein level of the prohormone convertase, Carboxypeptidase E (CPE), which was shown to regulate total glucagon content in αTC-1 cells (22McGirr R. Guizzetti L. Dhanvantari S. The sorting of proglucagon to secretory granules is mediated by carboxypeptidase E and intrinsic sorting signals.J. Endocrinol. 2013; 217: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and found it decreased in OSMI-1 treated αTC-1 cells (Fig. 5, H and J). Decreased CPE protein was correlated with the elevated proglucagon levels by western blot (Fig. 5, H and K), which suggested a defect in glucagon processing. Although glucagon transcription was not altered in acute treatment of αTC-1 cells with OSMI-1, glucagon mRNA was reduced in islets of iαOGTKO mice. Next, we aimed to test whether FOXA2 was O-GlcNAc-modified in α-cells. FOXA2, a potent regulator of glucagon transcription, was projected to be O-GlcNAc by a prediction software (23Gupta R. Brunak S. Prediction of glycosylation across the human proteome and the correlation to protein function.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2002; : 310-322PubMed Google Scholar), at multiple potential O-GlcNAc sites. In αTC-1 cells, we confirmed that FOXA2 was indeed an OGT target, via IP pull-down of the protein (Fig. 5, L and M). Altogether, these findings illustrate the resultant deficiencies of αOGTKO, consisting of reduced α-cell mass in older mice and a deficiency in islet glucagon secretion and single α-cell content in younger mice. αOGTKO mice displayed reduced α-cell mass, reduced glucagon levels, and impaired gluconeogenesis. This, however, did not affect their ability to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Next, we sought to corroborate these findings in the inducible i-αOGTKO model, thus observing the effect of acute OGT deletion in adult mice. We generated i-αOGTKO animals by crossing male Gcg-CreERTM (21Shiota C. Prasadan K. Guo P. Fusco J. Xiao X. Gittes G.K. Gcg (CreERT2) knockin mice as a tool for genetic manipulation in pancreatic alpha cells.Diabetologia. 2017; 60: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (inducible KO) and female with OGTflox/flox mice. Morphometric analysis of i-αOGTKO mouse pancreata was conducted at 15 weeks post-tamoxifen induction (Fig. 6A). Expression of RFP cells in glucagon cells demonstrated the efficiency of the tamoxifen in inducing Cre recombination (Fig. S5B). We assessed α-cell mass at 15 weeks post-tamoxifen, and we uncovered that i-αOGTKO and age-matched control mice show comparable α-cell mass (Fig. 6B). I-αOGTKO mice demonstrated normal blood glucose level (Fig. 6C), fasting and fed serum insulin (Fig. S6, A and B) compared with the control. In line with the constitutive αOGTKO model, i-αOGTKO also displayed a significantly reduced random blood glucagon levels (Fig. 6D). The defect in glucagon secretion from islets of i-αOGTKO in vitro was confirmed (Fig. 6E), as well as loss of glucagon content (Fig. S6C). Additionally, iαOGTKO mice exhibited significant pyruvate intolerance (Fig. 6F) and normal glucagon sensitivity (Fig. 6G). No body weight phenotype was observed in the iαOGTKO. Body weights of experimental mice (two different cohorts) at 15 or 24 weeks post-tamoxifen induction showed no significantly different increase in body weight than the age-matched controls (Fig. 6, H and I, Fig. S6, D and E). Glucose tolerance was also noted to be comparable between the control and iαOGTKO at 24 weeks post-tamoxifen induction (Fig. 6J, Fig. S6F). These findings demonstrated that acute deletion of OGT in adult mice had a similar effect on glucagon level but differed from αOGTKO through its milder effect on α-cell mass. Unlike the iαOGTKO model, the αOGTKO mice displayed a body weight phenotype. Weekly weighing of mice under normal chow diet revealed heavier body weight over time in male αOGTKO mice, which became significant at 2 months of age and continued to increase in until 3 months of age, body weight measurement from 1 month to 3-month-old mice is shown (Fig. 7A). In sharp contrast, αOGTKO and control females did not show differences in body weight (Fig. 7A). To analyze contributing body mass differences in these mice, we conducted an Echo-MRI imaging in young and old cohort of mice. MRI imaging of 1-month-old male αOGTKO mice showed no significant differences in lean mass or fat mass (Fig. 7B). In addition, metabolic cage analysis in these mice showed no significant differences in heat expenditure between αOGTKO and control mice (Fig. 7C). Food intake studies between 2 and 3 months of age revealed that αOGTKO mice, at this timepoint, were eating a significantly higher average amount of chow per month (Fig. 7D). We also performed the metabolic cages study at 6 months of age, where male αOGTKO mice had become significantly heavier than their control counterparts, with Echo-MRI analysis revealing significantly increased levels of both fat and lean mass (Fig. 7E). When corrected with body weight, there was a nonsignificant difference in heat expenditure between αOGTKO and control mice (Fig. 7F). Consistent with the progression of obesity, we found normal circulating leptin level in 2 to 3 months old mice, but significantly increased leptin levels in 6-month-old αOGTKO mice (Fig. S6, G and H). These findings show a phenotype of obesity in part due to hyperphagia and not due to defect in energy balance, and this was discovered only in male, but not in female αOGTKO or in male i-αOGTKO mice 3 months (Fig. 6H) or 5 months post-tamoxifen injection (Fig. 6I). Visual differences in fat deposition between male αOGTKO and control mice was observed in 6-month-old mice at the time of sacrifice (Fig. 7G). Next, we sought to determine the mechanisms behind the obesity in αOGTKO mice. Deletion of OGT in α-CaMKII-positive periventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons in the hypothalamus has been previously shown to cause obesity in part due to hyperphagia (24Lagerlof O. Slocomb J.E.

Gut microbiota are altered in adults with obesity, HS, and PCOS, which may worsen metabolic outcomes, but similar data is lacking in youth. Methods Thirty-four adolescents with PCOS and obesity underwent stool and fasting blood collection, oral glucose tolerance testing, and MRI for hepatic fat fraction (HFF). Fecal bacteria were profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results 50% had HS (N = 17, age 16.2±1.5 years, BMI 38±7 kg/m 2 , HFF 9.8[6.5, 20.7]%) and 50% did not (N = 17, age 15.8±2.2 years, BMI 35±4 kg/m 2 , HFF 3.8[2.6, 4.4]%). The groups showed no difference in bacterial α-diversity (richness p = 0.202; evenness p = 0.087; and diversity p = 0.069) or global difference in microbiota (β-diversity). Those with HS had lower % relative abundance (%RA) of Bacteroidetes (p = 0.013), Bacteroidaceae (p = 0.009), Porphyromonadaceae (p = 0.011), and Ruminococcaceae (p = 0.008), and higher Firmicutes : Bacteroidetes (F : B) ratio (47.8% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.018) and Streptococcaceae (p = 0.034). Bacterial taxa including phyla F : B ratio, Bacteroidetes , and family Bacteroidaceae , Ruminococcaceae and Porphyromonadaceae correlated with metabolic markers. Conclusions Obese adolescents with PCOS and HS have differences in composition of gut microbiota, which correlate with metabolic markers, suggesting a modifying role of gut microbiota in HS and PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W3123703770,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether moderate aerobic exercise training improves high-fat diet-induced alterations in mitochondrial function and structure in the skeletal muscle. Male 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups: control (CON), control plus exercise (CON + EX), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet plus exercise (HFD + EX). After obesity was induced by 20 weeks of 60% HFD, treadmill exercise training was performed at 13-16 m/min, 40-50 min/day, and 6 days/week for 12 weeks. Mitochondrial structure, function, and dynamics, and mitophagy were analyzed in the skeletal muscle fibers from the red gastrocnemius. Exercise training increased mitochondrial number and area and reduced high-fat diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia. In addition, exercise training attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction in the permeabilized myofibers, indicating that HFD-induced decrease of mitochondrial O2 respiration and Ca2+ retention capacity and increase of mitochondrial H2O2 emission were attenuated in the HFD + EX group compared to the HFD group. Exercise also ameliorated HFD-induced imbalance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, demonstrating that HFD-induced decrease in fusion protein levels was elevated, and increase in fission protein levels was reduced in the HFD + EX groups compared with the HFD group. Moreover, dysregulation of mitophagy induced by HFD was mitigated in the HFD + EX group, indicating a decrease in PINK1 protein level. Our findings demonstrated that moderate aerobic exercise training mitigated obesity-induced insulin resistance by improving mitochondrial function, and reversed obesity-induced mitochondrial structural damage by improving mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, suggesting that moderate aerobic exercise training may play a therapeutic role in protecting the skeletal muscle against mitochondrial impairments and insulin resistance induced by obesity."

It synthesizes the Galα1→4Gal linkage on two different glycosphingolipids (GSLs), producing globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, CD77, Pk) and the P1 antigen. Gb3 is the major receptor for Shiga toxins (Stxs) produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. A single amino acid substitution (p.Q211E) ramps up the enzyme’s promiscuity, rendering it able to attach Gal both to another Gal residue and to GalNAc, giving rise to NOR1 and NOR2 GSLs.

Human Gb3/CD77 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase, P1/Pk synthase; EC 2.4.1.228, UDP-galactose: β-D-galactosyl-β1-R 4-α-D-galactosyltransferase), encoded by the A4GALT gene, is a prominent enzyme in glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis (Fig. 1). It initiates the globo series GSL pathway by synthesizing the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, Gb3Cer, CD77, Pk antigen, ceramide trihexoside, Galα1→4Galβ1→4Glc-Cer) from lactosylceramide (LacCer). Additionally, it generates the P1 antigen (nLc5, Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc-Cer) from paragloboside (nLc4) in the neolacto series. Moreover, Gb3/CD77 synthase with a p.Q211E substitution acts further down the globo series sequentially with Gb4 synthase forming NOR1 and NOR2, both of which are determinants of the rare NOR blood group antigen, displaying a terminal Galα1→4GalNAc disaccharide (1Suchanowska A.

Stxs produced by STEC fall into two types: Stx1, which is identical to the toxin secreted by S. dysenteriae of serotype 1, and more genetically distinct Stx2. Stxs display AB5 structure with one catalytic A domain and a pentamer of B subunits, which interact with Gb3 (5Cooling L. Blood groups in infection and host susceptibility.Clin. Microbiol.

Microbiol. 2010; 8: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). After binding to Gb3 and internalization, Stxs traverse to the Golgi, then retrogradely to the ER, where they release the catalytically active fragment of the A domain, which then translocates to the cytosol. There, the catalytic A domain fragment directly inhibits protein synthesis, induces proinflammatory cytokine expression, and activates signaling cascades leading to apoptosis (24Johannes L. Römer W.

So far, human Gb3/CD77 synthase has been considered a strictly GSL-specific enzyme, unlike several other mammalian glycosyltransferases, which can use both GSLs and glycoproteins as acceptors. For example, human A and B transferases synthesize A and B blood group antigens on N- and O-glycans as well as on GSLs (26Cooling L.L.W. Kelly K. Barton J. Hwang D. Koerner T.A.W. Olson J.D. Determinants of ABH expression on human blood platelets.Blood. 2005; 105: 3356-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, at least five human β-galactosyltrasferases, three α1,3-fucosyltransferases, human and mouse sialyltransferases use glycoproteins and GSLs as acceptor substrates (27Taniguchi N. Honke K. Fukuda M. Narimatsu H. Yamaguchi Y. Angata T. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes. Springer Japan, Tokyo, Japan2014Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Previously we provided the first biochemical evidence that human Gb3/CD77 synthase is responsible for the production of both Gb3 and P1 antigen, while the same enzyme with p.Q211E substitution additionally synthesizes the rare NOR antigen (2Kaczmarek R. Duk M. Szymczak K. Korchagina E. Tyborowska J. Mikolajczyk K. Bovin N. Szewczyk B. Jaskiewicz E. Czerwinski M. Human Gb3/CD77 synthase reveals specificity toward two or four different acceptors depending on amino acid at position 211, creating Pk, P1 and NOR blood group antigens.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 470: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we present evidence that human Gb3/CD77 synthase activity is not limited to GSL acceptors, but extends to complex type N-glycans and N-glycoproteins, where it can produce a terminal P1 antigen glycotope (Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAc-R). Moreover, we demonstrate that glycoproteins carrying the P1 glycotope may function as receptors for Stx1, but not Stx2. The catalytic domain of human Gb3/CD77 synthase and the p.Q211E mutein were expressed recombinantly in insect cells with an N-terminal 6xHis Tag. The reactivity of both glycosyltransferases toward N-glycans was tested in 50 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 6.3) containing UDP-Gal, Mn2+ and alkaline phosphatase (28Unverzagt C. Kunz H. Paulson J.C. High-efficiency synthesis of sialyloligosaccharides and sialoglycopeptides.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9308-9309Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As an acceptor substrate was selected nonasaccharide azide 1 with two terminal lactosamine units (29Ullmann V. Rädisch M. Boos I. Freund J. Pöhner C. Schwarzinger S. Unverzagt C. Convergent solid-phase synthesis of N-glycopeptides facilitated by pseudoprolines at consensus-sequence Ser/Thr residues.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012; 51: 11566-11570Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after incubation with the p.Q211E mutein showed new glycans with higher masses corresponding to one and two additional galactose units. Since the LC-peaks of the N-glycans were not well resolved and conversion was incomplete, the concentration of acceptor 1 was varied (1–10 mM). Only the reaction with 10 mM 1 and p.Q211E mutein gave nearly complete conversion after 6 days of incubation (data not shown). Subsequently, the activities of Gb3/CD77 synthase and the p.Q211E mutein were compared. LC-MS analysis of both reactions after 24 h showed mainly acceptor 1 (77%) for the Gb3/CD77 synthase (Fig. 2B), whereas for the p.Q211E mutein only 38% of 1 remained (Fig. 2C). For the decasaccharide intermediates 2, the conversions were 21% versus 48%, and for the undecasaccharide product, 3 2% versus 14%, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). To determine the linkage of the transferred galactose units, a preparative reaction was carried out, lasting 7 days, followed by purification of 3 by gel filtration and ultrahigh-performance chromatography (UHPLC). The product 3 was obtained in 84% yield and was characterized by LC-MS and NMR (Fig. 2D). In the 500 MHz NMR spectrum, the anomeric signals (H-1) of the two newly transferred galactoses H-17 and H-17' overlap with H-14 but show a small coupling constant indicating their α-configuration. This is further ascertained by the large 1JCH coupling constants for H-17, C-17 and H-17', C-17' of 170.6 Hz. Both α-galactoses 7 and 7' are attached to O-4 of the β-galactoses 6 and 6' resulting in the typical downfield shift of the ring carbon after glycosylation (C-46 and C-46' at 78.2 ppm). We next investigated the possibility of α-galactosylating N-glycopeptides. Since both Gb3/CD77 synthase and its p.Q211E mutein showed the ability to galactosylate the nonasaccharide azide 1, but p.Q211E mutein appeared to act faster, we decided to use the mutein in the next approach. A synthetic human saposin D (SapD) 1-35 aa. glycopeptide hydrazide, bearing the biantennary N-glycan part of 1, was tested as a substrate and gave full conversion with the p.Q211E mutein even at an acceptor concentration of 1 mM (data not shown). A synthetic glycoform of SapD (4) (30Graf C.G.F. Schulz C. Schmälzlein M. Heinlein C. Mönnich M. Perkams L. Püttner M. Boos I. Hessefort M. Lombana Sanchez J.N. Weyand M. Steegborn C. Breiden B.

Ed. 2017; 56: 5252-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) also showed full conversion after incubation of 1 mM 4 with the p.Q211E mutein in the presence of UDP-Gal for 7 days (Fig. 2, E and F). The reaction was purified by UHPLC and gave the new SapD glycoform 5 in a yield of 78%. HR-MS analysis of purified 5 (Fig. 2G) revealed the addition of two hexose units and virtual identity of the deconvoluted (Fig. 2H) and the simulated spectrum. The sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the purity of the synthetic glycoprotein 5 (Fig. 2I) and the presence of terminal Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAc structures on the N-glycan termini of SapD 5 was confirmed by western blotting using anti-P1 monoclonal antibodies (p3NIL100 and 650, specificities detailed in Table S1), which bound to SapD 5 in contrast to SapD 4 (Fig. 3). Artifactual bands of higher molecular weight than 11 kDa are visible only in SapD 5 sample after blotting with P3NIL100 antibody because of its high sensitivity (Fig. 3A). CHO-Lec2 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the full-length human Gb3/CD77 synthase (CHO-Lec2 A4GALT) or its p.Q211E mutein (CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E). The anti-P1 antibody (P3NIL100) detected Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAc structures on several glycoproteins in CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cell lysates (Fig. 4A). After PNGase F treatment, no binding was detected suggesting that these structures were present only on N-linked, but not on O-linked glycan chains. There was no binding to the untransduced cell lysate. GSL I B4 lectin did not bind to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cell lysates, indicating a lack of Galα1→3Gal structures (Fig. S1A). Similarly, anti-NOR antibody (nor118) did not detect any glycoproteins in CHO-Lec2 cell lysates, suggesting that they do not contain Galα1→4GalNAc structures (Fig. S1B). To answer the question whether Gb3/CD77 synthase produces P1 glycotope on GSLs only, or on GSLs and glycoproteins, CHO-Lec2 cells were cultured in the presence of Genz-123346, which is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (31Liu Y.-Y. Hill R.A. Li Y.-T. Ceramide glycosylation catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase and cancer drug resistance.Adv. Cancer Res. 2013; 117: 59-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After 2 weeks of culture in the Genz-123346-containing medium, no GSLs were detected in high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E (Fig. 4B), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) only detected a hexosylceramide (which probably was galactosylceramide) (Fig. 4C). Significantly, the binding of anti-P1 antibody (P3NIL100) to the lysates of Genz-123346-treated cells in western blotting was increased in comparison with the untreated cell lysates (Fig. 4D). The binding of anti-P1 (P3NIL100 and 650) and anti-CD77 to CHO-Lec2 cells was evaluated by quantitative flow cytometry (Fig. 4E). Both anti-P1 antibodies recognize Galα1→4Gal structures not only on GSLs but also on glycoproteins, in contrast to anti-CD77, which binds solely Gb3 (specificities detailed in Table S1). The binding levels of anti-P1 (P3NIL100) to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E treated with Genz-123346 and untreated cells were similar, in contrast to anti-P1 (650), the binding of which was increased. Thus, CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells treated with Genz-123346 produce at least that much of P1 glycoproteins as untreated cells. In contrast, anti-CD77 antibody did not bind to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E treated with Genz-123346, suggesting that these cells did not produce Gb3. To further characterize the changes in N-glycans of CHO-Lec2 cells induced by Gb3/CD7 synthase and p.Q211E mutein expression, N-glycans were enzymatically released from total cellular protein preparations, reduced, and analyzed by porous graphitized carbon LC-MS. CHO-Lec2 cells showed expression of mainly oligomannosidic N-glycans. The major complex-type glycans were identified as a biantennary, fully galactosylated N-glycans with and without core fucose (H5N4F0-1). CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E showed largely similar N-glycan profiles, but exhibited an additional decasaccharide N-glycan species at m/z 901.33 [M-2H]2− (Fig. S2A) at a relative abundance of 0.77% (standard deviation 0.10%) and 1.07% (standard deviation 0.03%), respectively (Fig. S2B). Of note, this decasaccharide was not detected in the untransfected CHO-Lec2 cells. Notably, tandem mass spectrometry of this species revealed a 1,3A4 fragment ion at m/z 586.21 indicating the addition of a hexose to one of the antennae (Fig. 5). The D ion at m/z 688.13 and D-18 ion at m/z 670.13 indicated this modification to present on the three-linked antenna rather than on the six-linked antenna. No other N-glycans with an additional antennary hexose were detected when screening the tandem mass spectra for the diagnostic ion of m/z 586.21. These additional hexose-modified N-glycans may well occur, albeit below the detection limit of the LC-MS method. Together, these data indicate the addition of a hexose to the three-linked antenna of a biantennary complex type N-glycan in CHO-Lec2 cells upon expression of Gb3/CD77 synthase, which points to the presence of an antennary Galα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAc motif. To determine whether Shiga toxin 1 or 2 can bind to glycoproteins containing P1 glycotope, we performed a western blotting analysis of SapD 4 and SapD 5 using recombinant Shiga toxin 1 and 2 B subunits (Stx1B and Stx2B). Stx1B recognized only SapD 5, while Stx2B did not bind any of the SapD glycoforms (Fig. 6A). The binding of Stx1B to SapD 4 and SapD 5 immobilized on the sensor chip CM5 was evaluated by SPR analysis. Stx1B bound to SapD 5, whereas no interaction was observed for SapD 4 (Fig. 6B). A single affinity analysis for SapD 5 interactions with different concentrations of Stx1B (4.16, 8.31, 16.62, 33.25, 66.5 μM) reported calculated dissociation constant, KD = 3.31 × 10−5 M (Fig. 6C). Moreover, western blotting analysis of CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cell lysates revealed that Stx1B binds several glycoproteins (Fig. 6D), whereas Stx2B did not detect any proteins. Next, we evaluated Stx1B and Stx2B binding to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 6, E and F). CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells showed increased Stx1B and Stx2B binding capacities in comparison with CHO-Lec2 A4GALT. After Genz-123346 treatment, Stx1B binding to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells was approximately two times higher than to the untreated cells (Fig. 6E), whereas Stx2B binding was abolished (Fig. 6F). The results of western blotting and flow cytometry analysis of CHO-Lec2 cells suggested that the p.Q211E mutein exhibits a stronger activity toward glycoprotein substrates than Gb3/CD77 synthase (Figs. 4, A and E and S1B). Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of CHO-Lec2 cells with anti-CD77 antibody and HPTLC analysis using orcinol staining and overlay with Stx1B and anti-P1 (650) antibody revealed that CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells produced more Gb3 than CHO-Lec2 A4GALT (Figs. 4, B and E and S3A). Quantitative analysis of the A4GALT transcript revealed that CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells express approximately ten times less A4GALT mRNA than CHO-Lec2 A4GALT (Table 1). Likewise, anti-A4GALT antibody (5C7) detected significantly less p.Q211E protein in CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cell lysates in comparison with Gb3/CD77 synthase protein in CHO-Lec2 A4GALT (Fig. S3B). Thus, the elevated levels of p.Q211E mutein products did not result from upregulation of the A4GALT transcript, nor did they result from an increase in enzyme production.Table 1Quantitative analysis of A4GALT transcripts in CHO-Lec2 cellsCellsΔCtΔΔCtRQNAT15.712301A4GALT−0.1155−15.827858,163.7A4GALT Q211E3.2034−12.50895828.3NAT + Genz-12334616.490501A4GALT + Genz-123346−0.6479−17.1384144269.5A4GALT Q211E + Genz-123346′3.5537−12.93697841.2RQ, relative quantity. Open table in a new tab RQ, relative quantity. We sought to determine if the higher activity of the p.Q211E mutein observed in CHO-Lec2 cells was unique to that cell line or representative also for cells of human origin. Therefore, we analyzed RBCs of different A4GALT genotypes using quantitative flow cytometry. Table 2 summarizes relationships between phenotypes in terms of P1PK blood group system, A4GALT genotypes, and the presence or absence of Gb3/CD77 synthase GSL products on the RBC surface. P1NORP1 and P1NORP2 genotypes showed elevated Stx1B binding compared with P1P1and P1P2, respectively (Fig. 7).Table 2Phenotypes of P1PK histo-blood group system and A4GALT genotypesPhenotypeGenotypeAntigensP1P1P1P1, PkP1P2P2P2P2PkPψψ-P1NORP1NORP1P1, Pk, NOR1, NOR2, NORintP1NORP2Pk, Gb3; ψ, allele not encoding any functional protein. Open table in a new tab Pk, Gb3; ψ, allele not encoding any functional protein. To examine whether Stx1 and Stx2 can use P1 glycoproteins as functional receptors, we performed cytotoxicity assays on CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells. Untransduced CHO-Lec2 cells were not sensitive to Stx1 and Stx2 and served as the negative control. We found that CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells were more sensitive to Stx1 (Fig. 8, A and E) and Stx2 (Fig. 8, B and F) in comparison with CHO-Lec2 A4GALT. While this may be due to elevated Gb3 synthesis in CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells, the increased sensitivity to Stx1 may be also caused by an increased amount of P1 glycoproteins. After Genz-123346 treatment, CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E cells were still susceptible to Stx1 (but to a lesser extent than the untreated cells) (Fig. 8, C and E) in contrast to CHO-Lec2 A4GALT cells, which displayed a lower level of P1 glycoproteins. Strikingly, the cells cultured in the presence of Genz-123346 were refractory to the Stx2 treatment (both CHO-Lec2 A4GALT and CHO-Lec2 A4GALT Q211E) (Fig. 8, D and F), which suggests that P1 glycoproteins serve as functional receptors for Stx1, but not for Stx2. The P1PK histo-blood group system continues to perplex. The conundrum of its genetic and biochemical background was covered in depth in reviews and original reports by us and other groups (4Kaczmarek R. Buczkowska A. Mikolajewicz K. Krotkiewski H.

https://openalex.org/W3121563048,"The ecosystem services concept has come into wide use in conservation and natural resource management, partly due to its appeal as an anthropocentric rationale for protecting and restoring nature. Proponents of the ecosystem services concept expect that presenting these arguments alongside biodiversity arguments should lead to a broader base of support for conservation. This raises the question of whether support for activities that ensure ecosystem service provision relates to different sets of core values, or environmental attitudes, than support for biodiversity protection. We surveyed adult Australians to evaluate the influence of values and attitudes on willingness to pay for different habitat restoration outcomes. We hypothesized that when restoration is framed with an anthropocentric rationale (such as ecosystem service provision), support for restoration would align more strongly with anthropocentric or self-centered values and attitudes. Specifically, we tested if preference for ecosystem service benefits over biodiversity attributes, as indicated by willingness to pay in different restoration scenarios, is more strongly associated with self-enhancing (Egoistic) than self-transcending (Altruistic and Biospheric) values, and more associated with a pro-use attitude towards nature (Utilization) than an anti-use attitude (Preservation). We found that support for habitat restoration is generally based on ecocentric values and attitudes, but that positive associations between pro-environmental behavior and Egoistic values emerge when emphasis is placed on ecosystem service outcomes. Individuals scoring higher on Egoistic/Utilization metrics were also more likely to anticipate disservices from restoration. Attitudes predicted behavioral intention (willingness to pay) better than core values. Our results support the notion that the ecosystem services concept garners nontraditional backers and broadens the appeal of ecological restoration."
https://openalex.org/W3123155480,"Background Handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent transmission of infectious diseases. A substantial body of research has examined the status and determinants of handwashing facilities in healthcare settings and schools. However, its status at home in the community, especially in developing countries, remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the availability and factors influencing basic handwashing facilities at households in Ethiopia. Method We analysed the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. EDHS employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected from the lowest administrative unit (kebele). A multivariable logistic regression model that allowed cluster-level random effects was employed to examine factors that affect the availability of basic handwashing facilities (water plus soap) at households. Estimates from the regression model are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level to account for a sampling methodology. Results In our sample, only 1292 (8% [95% CI, 7.6%–8.4%]) of the households had basic handwashing facilities. Compared with head of household who had no formal education, the odds of having basic handwashing facilities was higher among head of household who completed secondary level of education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.35–2.49) and higher level of education (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.63–3.39). Odds of having basic handwashing facilities was increased with having radio (AOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.10–1.63) and television (AOR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.10–2.02) at home. Households that had improved latrine were two times more likely to have basic handwashing facilities (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.56–2.80). Being at higher household wealth quintiles was associated with increased odds of having basic handwashing facilities. Conclusion Very low basic handwashing facilities was demonstrated by this study, whereas, awareness and socio-economic related factors were identified as a determinants for its availability in the household. Greater efforts are needed to increase the coverage of community-level handwashing facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3122206436,"Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain cancer, and sequencing studies identified frequent mutations in DDX3X, a DEAD-box RNA helicase primarily implicated in translation. Forty-two different sites were identified, suggesting that the functional effects of the mutations are complex. To investigate how these mutations are affecting DDX3X cellular function, we constructed a full set of equivalent mutant alleles in DED1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of DDX3X, and characterized their effects in vivo and in vitro. Most of the medulloblastoma-associated mutants in DDX3X/DED1 (ded1-mam) showed substantial growth defects, indicating that functional effects are conserved in yeast. Further, while translation was affected in some mutants, translation defects affecting bulk mRNA were neither consistent nor correlated with the growth phenotypes. Likewise, increased formation of stress granules in ded1-mam mutants was common but did not correspond to the severity of the mutants’ growth defects. In contrast, defects in translating mRNAs containing secondary structure in their 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) were found in almost all ded1-mam mutants and correlated well with growth phenotypes. We thus conclude that these specific translation defects, rather than generalized effects on translation, are responsible for the observed cellular phenotypes and likely contribute to DDX3X-mutant medulloblastoma. Examination of ATPase activity and RNA binding of recombinant mutant proteins also did not reveal a consistent defect, indicating that the translation defects are derived from multiple enzymatic deficiencies.

Therefore, further research into the molecular defects of medulloblastoma is needed in order to design more effective and targeted treatments that address these shortcomings. Medulloblastoma was one of the first cancers to be characterized using next-generation sequencing techniques in a series of exome- and genome-wide studies with a combined cohort of several hundred patients (8Jones D.T.

One of the most prominent findings from these studies was frequent mutations in the RNA helicase DDX3X, which had not previously been linked to medulloblastoma. In fact, in a meta-analysis, DDX3X was the second-most commonly mutated gene in medulloblastoma after the transcription factor β-catenin (CTNNB1), and the mutations were not limited to a particular subtype, although they were especially frequent in Wnt and adult Shh subtypes (1Northcott P.A.

Interestingly, the identified mutations were all single-nucleotide variants or small, in-frame indels (see Table 1), suggesting that they are not simply inactivating the gene but have a more specific effect on DDX3X function. On the other hand, the mutations were spread throughout the central “helicase domains” of DDX3X, thus complicating any prediction of their effects (Fig. 1A).Table 1Growth phenotypes of DDX3X/DED1 medulloblastoma-associated mutationsThe sites of 42 DDX3X point mutations identified in four genome-wide sequencing studies of medulloblastoma patients are organized by encoded amino acid sequence, with the orthologous change in Ded1 sequence also listed.

Lethal ded1-mam alleles (those unable to grow at any temperature) are marked in red type. DDX3X and its orthologs, including Ded1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are members of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, which have critical roles in many facets of RNA biology and gene expression (for review, see (12Linder P. Jankowsky E. From unwinding to clamping - the DEAD box RNA helicase family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar)). While DDX3X/Ded1 has been implicated in a number of processes, it has been best characterized as a translation factor (13Sharma D. Jankowsky E. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box RNA helicases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Shen L. Pelletier J. General and target-specific DExD/H RNA helicases in eukaryotic translation initiation.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 4402Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Current models of eukaryotic translation initiation propose that translation factors, including the 40S ribosomal subunit, first assemble on the mRNA, and this preinitiation complex (PIC) then scans the mRNA, starting from the 5’ cap, for the start codon (15Aylett C.H. Ban N. Eukaryotic aspects of translation initiation brought into focus.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372: 20160186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Once the start codon is recognized, conformational rearrangements commit the PIC to initiation at that site, the 60S subunit joins, and translation elongation can begin. During steady-state conditions, both Ded1 and DDX3X have been shown to stimulate initiation (13Sharma D. Jankowsky E. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box RNA helicases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Specifically, both orthologs are proposed to unwind RNA secondary structure in the 5’UTR in order to facilitate start site scanning by the PIC (13Sharma D. Jankowsky E.

Results from both reporter assays and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) studies are consistent with this proposal, showing that transcripts vary in their sensitivity to DDX3X/Ded1 depending on the extent of predicted structure in their 5’ UTRs (18Lai M.C.

DDX3X/Ded1 also associates with the eIF4F translation complex, which binds to the mRNA early in PIC assembly, and it appears to have a role in this process, again in an mRNA-specific fashion (19Soto-Rifo R.

Interestingly, DDX3X/Ded1 can also act as a translation repressor (23Hilliker A. Gao Z. Jankowsky E. Parker R.

Candidate tumor suppressor DDX3 RNA helicase specifically represses cap-dependent translation by acting as an eIF4E inhibitory protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 700-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In some cases, this may be a direct effect on translation, particularly in cellular stress, as we recently showed in conditions in which the target-of-rapamycin pathway is repressed (28Aryanpur P.P. Renner D.M. Rodela E. Mittelmeier T.M. Byrd A. Bolger T.A. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1 has a role in the translational response to TORC1 inhibition.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2019; 30: 2171-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In addition, however, DDX3X/Ded1 is associated with stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic accumulations of RNAs, and RNA-binding proteins that are believed to serve as sorting and storage sites for mRNAs during conditions of translation repression (29Buchan J.R. Parker R. Eukaryotic stress granules: The ins and outs of translation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 932-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 30Anderson P. Kedersha N.

Principles and properties of stress granules.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 668-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). DDX3X/Ded1 appears to play important roles in the formation and disassembly of SGs, though the cellular consequences of this function are not completely clear (23Hilliker A. Gao Z. Jankowsky E.

These effects appear to be primarily mediated through the N- and C-terminal regions of DDX3X/Ded1, which comprise low-complexity domains that contribute to liquid–liquid phase separations (33Hondele M. Sachdev R. Heinrich S. Wang J. Vallotton P. Fontoura B.M.A. Weis K.

The medulloblastoma-associated mutations in DDX3X are not found in these regions, however. Several studies have examined the effects of the DDX3X mutations identified in medulloblastoma. Despite the high frequency of mutations in the Wnt subtype of medulloblastoma and a reported direct effect on Wnt signaling by DDX3X (35Cruciat C.M. Dolde C. de Groot R.E. Ohkawara B. Reinhard C. Korswagen H.C. Niehrs C. RNA helicase DDX3 is a regulatory subunit of casein kinase 1 in Wnt-beta-catenin signaling.Science. 2013; 339: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), only minimal effects on Wnt signaling were observed with the mutants in reporter assays (10Pugh T.J. Weeraratne S.D. Archer T.C. Pomeranz Krummel D.A. Auclair D. Bochicchio J. Carneiro M.O. Carter S.L. Cibulskis K. Erlich R.L. Greulich H. Lawrence M.S. Lennon N.J. McKenna A. Meldrim J. et al.Medulloblastoma exome sequencing uncovers subtype-specific somatic mutations.Nature. 2012; 488: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Noting that many of the mutations are located in conserved regions of the helicase core (Fig. 1, A and B), two additional studies identified biochemical defects in a subset of mutants, focusing in particular on a few mutants with severe phenotypes in vitro and in vivo (36Epling L.B. Grace C.R. Lowe B.R. Partridge J.F. Enemark E.J. Cancer-associated mutants of RNA helicase DDX3X are defective in RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis.J. Mol.

Chem. 2016; 291: 2412-2421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Further implicating translational defects in DDX3X-driven oncogenesis, Valentin-Vega and colleagues showed both an increase in SG formation and a general decrease in translation when a subset of DDX3X mutants were overexpressed in mammalian cell lines (38Valentin-Vega Y.A. Wang Y.D. Parker M. Patmore D.M. Kanagaraj A. Moore J. Rusch M. Finkelstein D. Ellison D.W. Gilbertson R.J. Zhang J. Kim H.J. Taylor J.P. Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 25996Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, hinting that the translational effects of the DDX3X mutations may be complex, ribosome profiling of cells expressing a medulloblastoma-associated DDX3X mutant showed some mRNA-specific effects, particularly on stress-related genes (39Oh S. Flynn R.A. Floor S.N. Purzner J. Martin L. Do B.T. Schubert S. Vaka D. Morrissy S. Li Y. Kool M. Hovestadt V. Jones D.T. Northcott P.A. Risch T. et al.Medulloblastoma-associated DDX3 variant selectively alters the translational response to stress.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 28169-28182Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This previous work has contributed greatly to our understanding of the role of DDX3X/Ded1 in medulloblastoma and cancer generally. A limitation of these studies, however, is that they have generally focused on a small subset of the 42 distinct mutation sites that have been identified, largely for technical reasons. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent the results are representative or broadly applicable to the identified DDX3X mutations as a whole. Here, we have begun to address this question by taking advantage of the genetic tractability of budding yeast to construct a full set of mutations in DDX3X/DED1 at all 42 identified sites (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The S. cerevisiae model system does not lend itself to detailed pathological analysis; however, since DDX3X and Ded1 are highly conserved in both sequence and function (13Sharma D. Jankowsky E. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box RNA helicases.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40Sharma D. Putnam A.A. Jankowsky E. Biochemical differences and similarities between the DEAD-box helicase orthologs DDX3X and Ded1p.J. Mol. Biol. 2017; 429: 3730-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we conducted a comparison of molecular and cellular defects in the mutants. After an initial screening of the full set of mutants, we further characterized the translational and biochemical defects in a large, representative subset that reflects the spectrum of effects produced by the mutations. This analysis revealed that while some mutants had significant defects in bulk translation and particular biochemical properties, the most common and well-correlated defects in medulloblastoma-associated mutants of DDX3X/DED1 were in specific translation processes, suggesting that these should be a focus in future studies of DDX3X-driven oncogenesis. To characterize the impact of the medulloblastoma-associated mutations on cellular function, we began our study by mutating yeast DED1 at the 42 conserved sites identified in medulloblastoma patient sequencing studies (Fig. 1, A and B and Table 1) (8Jones D.T.

Because DED1 is an essential gene in yeast, these ded1-mam (medulloblastoma-associated mutation) alleles were introduced into ded1-null yeast on single-copy CEN plasmids via plasmid shuffle, replacing wild-type DED1 as the only copy in cells. Following successful replacement, 9 of the 42 ded1-mam mutations resulted in lethality (Table 1). The lethal mutations were located across the helicase core and in different conserved motifs. This result is consistent with the lethality of several other known ded1 point mutations in the conserved DEAD-box motifs (16Chuang R.Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H.

Gle1 regulates RNA binding of the DEAD-box helicase Ded1 in its complex role in translation initiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2017; 37e00139-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two of the lethal mutants (G261V and G284E) were previously shown to be incapable of complementing a temperature-sensitive ded1 mutant in Saccharomyces pombe and had severe defects in enzymatic activity (36Epling L.B. Grace C.R. Lowe B.R. Partridge J.F. Enemark E.J. Cancer-associated mutants of RNA helicase DDX3X are defective in RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1779-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lethality of these ded1-mam mutants suggests an acute loss of DDX3X/Ded1 function for a subset of the medulloblastoma-associated mutations (see Discussion). The viable ded1-mam mutants were further studied to determine if other growth defects were present. These mutants were screened for changes in growth on nutrient-rich agar at 16, 25, 30, and 37 °C (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Many of the medulloblastoma-associated mutants displayed temperature-dependent growth inhibition, while some mutants had no noticeable defect. Of the 33 viable ded1-mam mutants, 19 showed temperature-sensitive growth defects, including 16 cold-sensitive and 3 heat-sensitive (Table 1). Overall, growth inhibition or lethality occurred in two-thirds (28 out of 42) of the medulloblastoma-associated DDX3X/ded1 mutants. To further examine the effects of the ded1-mam mutations on DDX3X/Ded1 function, we took advantage of the ability of wild-type DED1 to inhibit growth when highly overexpressed with a galactose-inducible promoter (23Hilliker A.

The goal of this study was to further investigate the effects of ELOVL3 ablation in homozygous Elovl3-knockout mice (E3hom) in comparison with age and sex matched wild-type controls (E3wt). Slit lamp examination of the ocular surface of mice, and histological examination of their ocular tissues, highlighted a severe negative impact of Elovl3 inactivating mutation on the Meibomian glands (MG) and conjunctiva of mice. MG transcriptomes of the E3hom and E3wt mice were assessed and revealed a range of up- and downregulated genes related to lipid biosynthesis, inflammation, and stress response, compared with E3wt mice. Heat stage polarized light microscopy was used to assess melting characteristics of normal and abnormal meibum. The loss of Elovl3 led to a 8°C drop in the melting temperature of meibum in E3hom mice, and increased its fluidity. Also noted were the excessive accumulation of lipid material and tears around the eye and severe ocular inflammation, among other abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W3047618975,"The highly individual plasma membrane expression and cAMP signaling of odorant receptors have hampered their ligand assignment and functional characterization in test cell systems. Chaperones have been identified to support the cell surface expression of only a portion of odorant receptors, with mechanisms remaining unclear. The presence of amino acid motifs that might be responsible for odorant receptors' individual intracellular retention or cell surface expression, and thus, for cAMP signaling, is under debate: so far, no such protein motifs have been suggested. Here, we demonstrate the existence of highly conserved C-terminal amino acid motifs, which discriminate at least between class-I and class-II odorant receptors, with their numbers of motifs increasing during evolution, by comparing C-terminal protein sequences from 4808 receptors across eight species. Truncation experiments and mutation analysis of C-terminal motifs, largely overlapping with helix 8, revealed single amino acids and their combinations to have differential impact on the cell surface expression and on stimulus-dependent cAMP signaling of odorant receptors in NxG 108CC15 cells. Our results demonstrate class-specific and individual C-terminal motif equipment of odorant receptors, which instruct their functional expression in a test cell system, and in situ may regulate their individual cell surface expression and intracellular cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3092784892,"Knockout mouse models have been extensively used to study the antiviral activity of IFIT (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats). Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of “self” in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess “nonself” cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA–binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.

Viruses with capped positive-sense RNA genomes must convincingly mimic host mRNA to avoid recognition by cell-intrinsic defense systems. In eukaryotes, the mRNA cap consists of a guanosine nucleotide covalently linked to the first RNA nucleotide by a 5′-5′ triphosphate bridge (capG, GpppNN), which is methylated at the N-7 position (cap0, m7GpppNN) to facilitate nuclear export and translation initiation factor recruitment. In higher eukaryotes, including insects and vertebrates, mRNA is further modified by methylation on the 2′-hydroxyl of the first and second cap-proximal nucleotide riboses (cap1, m7GpppNmN and cap2, m7GpppNmNm) (1Cowling V.H.

Coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV and the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV-2, and mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV), encode viral 2′-O-methyltransferases to produce cap1 viral mRNAs (2Decroly E. Ferron F. Lescar J. Canard B. Conventional and unconventional mechanisms for capping viral mRNA.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 10 (22138959): 51-6510.1038/nrmicro2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), which effectively mimic those of the host to avoid immune surveillance. Sensing of mRNA 2′-O-methylation in vertebrates is primarily mediated by a family of antiviral RNA-binding proteins known as IFITs (interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats). In most mammals, including humans, the IFIT family comprises five members: IFIT1, IFIT1B, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 (3Liu Y. Zhang Y.-B. Liu T.-K. Gui J.-F.

Instead, these species typically harbor multiple copies of the Ifit1b gene. In mice, Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c (Fig. 1A) (also called Ifit1b1, Ifit1b2, and Ifit1b3, to reflect their evolutionary relatedness) (4Daugherty M.D. Schaller A.M.

Therefore, rodent Ifits may have alternative mechanisms to regulate their expression and function, which are distinct from the human IFIT complex. In this study, we investigated the expression and activity of the entire murine Ifit family. We verified expression of noncanonical family members Ifit1b, Ifit1c, and Ifit3b in murine cells and found that Ifit1b binds to cap1-RNA with remarkable affinity and specificity. Ifit1b selectively inhibited cap1-RNA translation and restricted the replication of WT mouse coronavirus in vitro. We then established the different Ifit complexes that can form in mice and found that Ifit1c acts as a cofactor to Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their stability and translation inhibition activity, thereby fulfilling a role analogous to human IFIT3. As such, this study helps to elucidate the ways in which primates and rodents have developed convergent roles for IFIT proteins in the innate immune response that occupy their same functional niche. We additionally highlight key distinctions between the human and murine IFIT families in the hope that this will inform use of mouse models in understanding IFIT biology and antiviral activity. To date, a systematic and quantitative examination of the induction kinetics of the entire murine Ifit family has not been carried out. Although the expression patterns of murine Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3 have been examined in detail (24Bluyssen H.A. Vlietstra R.J. van der Made A. Trapman J.

To address this, murine Ifit expression was examined in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells, 17Cl-1 immortalized fibroblasts, and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The cells were stimulated with recombinant IFNβ or transfected with synthetic dsRNA (poly(I:C)) for up to 48 h. The cell lysates were examined by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analysis, using qPCR primers (Fig. S1) and antibodies (Fig. S2) specific to each murine Ifit family member. Because Ifit3 and Ifit3b differ by only 5 amino acids, it was not possible to differentiate between these proteins by immunoblotting so, to reflect this, this band will be annotated as Ifit3/3b. Consistent with previous reports (25Smith J.B. Herschman H.R. The glucocorticoid attenuated response genes GARG-16, GARG-39, and GARG-49/IRG2 encode inducible proteins containing multiple tetratricopeptide repeat domains.Arch. Biochem.

Expression decreased between 9 and 24 h poststimulation. Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3/3b proteins were detectable 6–12 h following stimulation, just after the peak of mRNA expression (Fig. 1D). Ifit mRNA expression was induced to a lesser extent in 17Cl-1 fibroblast cells, and expression was delayed compared with expression in RAW264.7 cells, with peak mRNA expression at 12–24 h poststimulation (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3B). Similarly, at the protein level, Ifit1, Ifit2, and Ifit3/3b were detectable at 24–48 h poststimulation (Fig. 1E), slightly later than in the RAW264.7 cells. In MEFs, the Ifit mRNA induction patterns were similar to RAW264.7 cells, although the magnitude of induction was 10–100-fold lower, and expression had largely returned to baseline by 24–48 h poststimulation (Fig. S3C). In both 17Cl-1 cells and MEFs, induction of Ifit2 expression was lower compared with RAW264.7 cells, indicating that Ifit2 may be regulated differently in fibroblasts compared with macrophages (Fig. 1, compare D and E, and Fig. S3). mRNA expression was observed for Ifit1b, Ifit1c (Fig. 1, B and C), and Ifit3b (Fig. S3) following stimulation and could be verified by Sanger sequencing of the qPCR product (Fig. S1). Although Ifit3b expression was strongly induced following stimulation, Ifit1b and Ifit1c were poorly up-regulated, with only 10–100-fold induction over baseline in all cell lines tested. We tested a number of antibodies to confirm Ifit expression at the protein level. A commercially available antibody against human IFIT1 was cross-reactive with murine Ifit1 but detected Ifit1b to a greater extent (Fig. S2B). This antibody could detect a signal in IFN-stimulated mouse cells, but because it reacted with both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, the identity of this signal was ambiguous. A peptide-raised antibody against Ifit1b detected Ifit1b without cross-reactivity with Ifit1 (Fig. S2A) with greater sensitivity (Fig. S2C). Using this antibody, in 17Cl-1 cell lysates, Ifit1b was detectable at the protein level 48 h (Fig. 1E) and 80 h (Fig. S2D) after IFN stimulation. A peptide-raised antibody against Ifit1c was highly specific for recombinant Ifit1c protein but could not reproducibly detect endogenous Ifit1c in stimulated mouse cells (Fig. S2A). To investigate the reason behind the poor expression of Ifit1b and Ifit1c in murine cells, the promoter regions of Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c were examined. Ifit1 has two well-defined tandem interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) within 100 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) (Fig. S4A). The Ifit1c promoter region contains one canonical ISRE sequence proximal to the TSS and a second ISRE-like sequence further upstream. For Ifit1b, there are two annotated TSS: one proximal to the coding sequence of Ifit1b (here designated Ifit1b_1) and one several kilobases upstream (Ifit1b_2), which overlaps the Ifit1 promoter region (Fig. 1A), both of which contain poorly conserved ISRE-like sequences (Fig. S4A). Promoter plasmids were designed to express firefly luciferase (Fluc) under the control of the murine Ifit promoters. The promoter sequence was defined as 0.8–1 kb upstream of the TSS for each Ifit gene. A control plasmid was also generated with 1 kb of scrambled DNA sequence upstream of the Fluc mRNA (SCR). Promoter plasmids were cotransfected into 17Cl-1 cells alongside a constitutive Renilla luciferase (Rluc) expression plasmid. After 4 h, the cells were treated with IFNβ to stimulate promoter activity and then harvested after 24 h to determine luciferase expression. Luciferase activity was normalized to the Rluc control for each condition. As expected, luciferase production from the Ifit1 promoter was strongly stimulated by treatment with IFNβ (Fig. S4B). For Ifit1b, the upstream Ifit1b_2 promoter weakly drove Fluc expression but was not IFN-responsive, whereas the downstream Ifit1b_1 promoter was slightly stimulated in response to IFNβ. Similarly, the Ifit1c promoter showed a small degree of up-regulation when cells were treated with IFNβ (Fig. S4B). Therefore, the lower expression of Ifit1b and Ifit1c at the mRNA level, described above, may be due to poorly IFN-responsive promoter sequences. We next sought to examine the effect of the murine Ifit proteins on translation, using an in vitro translation assay system, which we have previously used to examine the effect of human IFIT heterocomplexing on their function (14Fleith R.C. Mears H.V. Leong X.Y. Sanford T.J. Emmott E. Graham S.C. Mansur D.S. Sweeney T.R. IFIT3 and IFIT2/3 promote IFIT1-mediated translation inhibition by enhancing binding to non-self RNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29554348): 5269-528510.1093/nar/gky191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An Fluc reporter mRNA flanked by the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of human β-globin (Globin-Fluc) was transcribed and capped in vitro (Fig. 2, A and B). The efficiency of cap methylation was verified using a primer extension inhibition assay, based on the propensity of reverse transcriptase to terminate at methylated nucleotides, dependent on Mg2+ concentration (28Zamudio J.R.

Methods We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the relationship between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk using 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coffee consumption from a genome-wide association (GWA) study on 212,119 female UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry. Risk estimates for breast cancer were retrieved from publicly available GWA summary statistics from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) on 122,977 cases (of which 69,501 were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 21,468 ER-negative) and 105,974 controls of European ancestry. Random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR analyses were performed along with several sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of potential MR assumption violations. Results One cup per day increase in genetically predicted coffee consumption in women was not associated with risk of total (IVW random-effects; odds ratio (OR): 0.91, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.80–1.02, P: 0.12, P for instrument heterogeneity: 7.17e-13), ER-positive (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.79–1.02, P: 0.09) and ER-negative breast cancer (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.75–1.03, P: 0.12). Null associations were also found in the sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger (total breast cancer; OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.80–1.25), weighted median (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89–1.05) and weighted mode (OR: 1.00, CI: 0.93–1.07). Conclusions The results of this large MR study do not support an association of genetically predicted coffee consumption on breast cancer risk, but we cannot rule out existence of a weak association."
https://openalex.org/W3124842421,"Soil organic carbon content has a significant impact on soil fertility and grain yield, making it an important factor affecting agricultural production and food security. Dry farmland, the main type of cropland in China, has a lower soil organic carbon content than that of paddy soil, and it may have a significant carbon sequestration potential. Therefore, in this study we applied the CENTURY model to explore the temporal and spatial changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) in Jilin Province from 1985 to 2015. Dry farmland soil polygons were extracted from soil and land use layers (at the 1:1,000,000 scale). Spatial overlay analysis was also used to extract 1282 soil polygons from dry farmland. Modelled results for SOC dynamics in the dry farmland, in conjunction with those from the Yushu field-validation site, indicated a good level of performance. From 1985 to 2015, soil organic carbon density (SOCD) of dry farmland decreased from 34.36 Mg C ha −1 to 33.50 Mg C ha −1 in general, having a rate of deterioration of 0.03 Mg C ha −1 per year. Also, SOC loss was 4.89 Tg from dry farmland soils in the province, with a deterioration rate of 0.16 Tg C per year. 35.96% of the dry farmland its SOCD increased but 64.04% of the area released carbon. Moreover, SOC dynamics recorded significant differences between different soil groups. The method of coupling the CENTURY model with a detailed soil database can simulate temporal and spatial variations of SOC at a regional scale, and it can be used as a precise simulation method for dry farmland SOC dynamics."

We assessed the trends for 28-day readmissions after a stroke in Malaysia from 2008 to 2015 and evaluated the causes and factors associated with readmissions in 2015. Methods Using the national hospital admission records database, we included all stroke patients who were discharged alive between 2008 and 2015 for this secondary data analysis. The risk of readmissions was described in proportion and trends. Reasons were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Edition. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with readmissions. Results Among 151729 patients, 11 to 13% were readmitted within 28 days post-discharge from their stroke events each year. The trend was constant for ischemic stroke but decreasing for hemorrhagic stroke. The leading causes for readmissions were recurrent stroke (32.1%), pneumonia (13.0%) and sepsis (4.8%). The risk of 28-day readmission was higher among those with stroke of hemorrhagic (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.52) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (AOR: 2.56) subtypes, and length of index admission &gt;3 days (AOR: 1.48), but lower among younger age groups of 35–64 (AORs: 0.61–0.75), p values &lt;0.001. Conclusion The risk of 28-day readmission remained constant from 2008 to 2015, where one in eight stroke patients required readmission, mainly attributable to preventable causes. Age, ethnicity, stroke subtypes and duration of the index admission influenced the risk of readmission. Efforts should focus on minimizing potentially preventable admissions, especially among those at higher risk."
https://openalex.org/W3094015346,"Investigations of bacterial resistance strategies can aid in the development of new antimicrobial drugs as a countermeasure to the increasing worldwide prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance. One such strategy involves the TipA class of transcription factors, which constitute minimal autoregulated multidrug resistance (MDR) systems against diverse antibiotics. However, we have insufficient information regarding how antibiotic binding induces transcriptional activation to design molecules that could interfere with this process. To learn more, we determined the crystal structure of SkgA from Caulobacter crescentus as a representative TipA protein. We identified an unexpected spatial orientation and location of the antibiotic-binding TipAS effector domain in the apo state. We observed that the α6–α7 region of the TipAS domain, which is canonically responsible for forming the lid of antibiotic-binding cleft to tightly enclose the bound antibiotic, is involved in the dimeric interface and stabilized via interaction with the DNA-binding domain in the apo state. Further structural and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the unliganded TipAS domain sterically hinders promoter DNA binding but undergoes a remarkable conformational shift upon antibiotic binding to release this autoinhibition via a switch of its α6–α7 region. Hence, the promoters for MDR genes including tipA and RNA polymerases become available for transcription, enabling efficient antibiotic resistance. These insights into the molecular mechanism of activation of TipA proteins advance our understanding of TipA proteins, as well as bacterial MDR systems, and may provide important clues to block bacterial resistance.

Structural analyses using apo and mta promoter-bound structures of the Mta N terminus (MtaN) revealed that MtaN possesses a canonical MerR-type HTH motif that binds promoter DNA to activate transcription using a distortion mechanism identical to BmrR, which belongs to another MerR-type MDR gene regulator family with a GyrI-like effector domain (25Godsey M.H.

However, because of the lack of ligand-bound full-length structural information, whether TipA-class regulators also adopt a drug-induced activation mechanism similar to BmrR, which was elaborated by the analysis of the liganded BmrR–bmr promoter complex structure, remains unknown (27Zheleznova E.E.

Previous NMR studies with accurate determinations of apo and liganded TipAS proteins indicated that thiopeptide binding induces stabilization and restructuring of the flexible N-terminal region and thus results in the formation of a large MD-binding pocket (14Habazettl J.

Nevertheless, it is still a missing part in the current model of how this kind of drug-induced change in the TipAS domain drives a global structural shift to facilitate transcriptional activation of TipAN in the context of full-length TipAL protein (Fig. 1A). Here, we sought to obtain full-length structural information of TipA-class proteins, and the SkgA structure was successfully determined at a resolution of 2.5 Å. The solved structure indicated a significantly different orientation of the TipAS effector domain compared with the GyrI-like effector domain of BmrR. Structural and biochemical analyses indicated that the interaction of TipA regulators with promoter DNA is hindered in the apo state and revealed an unexpected activation mechanism in which drug binding induces conformational turnover of the TipAS domain to release the N-terminal HTH motif for promoter DNA binding and subsequent transcriptional activation, during which the α6–α7 region may serve as a key switch element to drive the global transition. Remarkably, further biochemical results strongly support the above conclusion by showing that mutations on the drug-recognizing sites within the α6–α7 region resulted in no significant loss of drug-binding affinity but a sharp reduction of promoter DNA-binding affinity. Overall, our findings provide a crucial complement to the current understanding of TipA-class MDR systems. Full-length proteins of three reported TipA-class transcriptional regulators, S. lividans TipAL, C. crescentus SkgA, and B. subtilis Mta were expressed, purified, and set up for crystallization. As a result, diffraction-quality crystals of SkgA were obtained, and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2.5 Å using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method (Table 1). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the crystals were composed of full-length SkgA proteins (Fig. S1A). Although full-length SkgA (residues 1–255) protein was used for crystallization, only residues 1–138 were observed in the final structure. The established structure consists of the N-terminal MerR-type HTH motif, coiled-coil region, and the initial two α-helices of the C-terminal TipAS domain (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B), whereas the rest of the TipAS domain was still invisible in the current model, probably because of structural flexibility or diffraction damage. As expected, the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal MerR-like DNA-binding domain and coiled-coil region of SkgA share a high level of identity with those of other TipA-class proteins and BmrR (Fig. S1, C and D).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSkgASeMet-SkgAData collection statistics X-ray sourceShanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline 17U1Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility Beamline 17U1 Space groupP6522P6522 Unit cell parametersa, b, c (Å)89.57, 89.57, 88.9689.61, 89.61, 89.22α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 120.0090.00, 90.00, 120.00 Wavelength (Å)0.97850.9785 Resolution limits (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.50.00–2.5050.00–2.90 No. of unique reflections77594765 Completeness (%)95.8 (80.5)94.9 (99.2) Redundancy32.8 (13.1)34.0 (29.4) Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σh Σl |Ihl − <Ih>|/Σh Σl <Ih>, where Ihl is the lth observation of reflection h, and <Ih> is the weighted average intensity for all observations l of reflection h.11.1 (114.5)21.0 (193.6) Rp.i.m.

Open table in a new tab Because MerR family proteins reportedly function as dimers and SkgA protein also exhibits a dimer conformation in solution (Fig. S2A), a dimeric SkgA structure was established by combining two molecules from two adjacent asymmetric units for subsequent analysis (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2B). The α6–α7 region of the SkgA dimer does not show any significant crystal contact with other symmetry mates (Fig. S2C). The dimeric interface was analyzed by the programs PyMOL and PISA (30Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 (17681537): 774-79710.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (5877) Google Scholar). The total surface area of the SkgA dimer is 15,051.4 Å2, and the buried area is 5,404.7 Å2 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2B). Remarkably, apart from the coiled-coil α5 helices, the α6–α7 region and N-terminal domain are also involved in the dimeric interface. Fifteen residues of the α6–α7 region of each protomer interact with the N-terminal domain of the other protomer via hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1, D–G), which contribute to stabilization of the conformation of the α6–α7 region. Eleven residues of the N-terminal α1–α2 region exhibit interactions with ten residues of the α6–α7 region via hydrophobic interactions and three hydrogen bonds formed by residue pairs Tyr4–Asp117, Ser16–Glu133, and Tyr23–His132 (Fig. 1, E and F). Twelve residues from the N-terminal α3–α4 region interact with eleven residues of the α6–α7 region via hydrophobic interactions, a salt bridge of Arg44–Asp117, and four hydrogen bonds of Arg44–Met115, Gln51–Leu120, Arg57–Lys128, and Arg57–Gln129 (Fig. 1, E and G). Similar results were found in the structure of Listeria monocytogenes TipA-class protein Lmo0526 with modeled α6–α7 helices (PDB code 3QAO) (Fig. S3A). The α6–α7 region of Lmo0526 also exhibits a wide interaction with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain in the Lmo0526 dimer via hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. S3, B–E), which is in line with the corresponding interaction in the SkgA dimer. The α6–α7 region of the Lmo0526 dimer also does not exhibit any significant crystal contact with other symmetrical molecules (Fig. S3F). Notably, many of these interacting residues are conserved among the TipA-class family proteins, and the corresponding residues of some antibiotic-binding residues reported in TipA and DNA-binding residues revealed by MtaN–DNA and TipAN–DNA structures are involved in the interaction (Fig. S4). Collectively, these findings suggested that the α6–α7 region of the TipA-class proteins, which is reportedly unstructured flexible loops in unliganded TipAS protein (14Habazettl J. Allan M. Jensen P.R. Sass H.J. Thompson C.J. Grzesiek S. Structural basis and dynamics of multidrug recognition in a minimal bacterial multidrug resistance system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To confirm whether the in-solution conformation of the α6–α7 region is consistent with the conformation in crystal structures, double-cysteine mutants of TipA-class proteins were constructed and analyzed. In light of the structures, the conserved interacting residue pairs Ser16–Glu133 of SkgA and Ser13–Glu131 of Lmo0526 exhibit close distances (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4). Therefore, double-cysteine mutants, SkgACC (S16C/E133C), MtaCC (S15C/E138C), and TipALCC (T15C/E134C), were constructed based on sequence homology (Fig. S4) and were analyzed by both reduced and nonreduced SDS-PAGE. As a result, although WT SkgA, Mta, and TipAL were shown as monomer bands, the double-cysteine mutants were all shown as dimer bands in the nonreduced SDS-PAGE gel as a result of the formation of disulfide bonds (Fig. 2A, right panel). The results indicated that in solution, the α6–α7 region of the TipA-class protein exhibits a conformation consistent with that revealed by SkgA and Lmo0526 structures. Alignment of the two structures indicated that the α6 helices share a high structural similarity, whereas the α7 helices differ slightly in length and direction. However, notably, in the two structures, the α6–α7 helices can be seen to consistently extend from the α5 helix toward the DNA-binding interface, indicating that the relative orientation of the TipAS domain in TipA proteins is significantly different from the relative orientation of the GyrI-like effector domain in BmrR (Fig. 2B). Because multiple DNA-binding residues are involved in the dimeric contacts with the α6–α7 helices (Fig. S4) that exhibit an unexpected orientation, we further sought to investigate how the α6–α7 region and TipAS domain with the orientation affect DNA binding. SkgA and Lmo0526 structures were aligned on Cα atoms with the B-DNA–bound TipAN structure (PDB code 2VZ4) and distorted DNA-bound MtaN structure (PDB code 1R8D), respectively. Notably, it is currently unclear whether SkgA binding to DNA will result in DNA distortion, as observed in published MerR–DNA complexes, or remain B-DNA in form, as seen in the TipAN–DNA complex. Putative shifts of the α2 and wing region required for DNA binding were indicated by the structural superposition (Fig. 2C and Fig. S5) as previously elaborated by structural studies on MtaN (25Godsey M.H. Baranova N.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Crystal structure of MtaN, a global multidrug transporter gene activator.J. Biol.

Importantly, the α7 helix, which is situated closely to the α2 helix, was found to occupy a part of the space for the putative bound DNA, which suggested that it may hinder both DNA loading and the movement of the α2 and wing regions for DNA binding and thus inhibit DNA association (Fig. 2C and Fig. S5). Analysis of the electrostatic distribution of the α6–α7 region was also performed using the two structures, as well as the NMR structure of TipAS (PDB code 2MC0). As a result, with a relatively high sequence homology (Fig. 2D), the α6–α7 surfaces of all three structures are strikingly electronegative, (Fig. 2E), which would likely impair DNA binding. Fluorescence polarization assays (FPAs) were performed to test the structure-based hypothesis that α6–α7 plays a key role in communication between the ligand-binding and DNA-binding regions. TipAL, TipAN, and a truncated protein consisting of TipAN and the α6–α7 region (TipAH7, TipAL residues 1–140) were purified for the first assessment, and all of them were found to be dimers in solution (Fig. 3A). The affinities with the tipA promoter DNA (ptipA) were measured as 44.0 ± 5.1, 380.2 ± 56.0, and 318.5 ± 58.5 nm for TipAN, TipAL, and TipAH7, respectively (Fig. 3B), indicating ptipA-associating affinities of TipAL and TipAH7 significantly lower than the ptipA-associating affinity of TipAN. The double-cysteine mutant TipALCC was also applied for the analysis and showed a complete loss of DNA-binding ability (Fig. 3B). Parallel experiments were also performed for Mta and SkgA proteins, and consistent results were obtained. Full-length proteins and truncated proteins containing the α6–α7 region, MtaH7 (Mta residues 1–144), and SkgAH7 (SkgA residues 1–141), all exhibited a drastic loss of promoter DNA-binding affinity compared with the respective N-terminal constructs, and the double-cysteine mutants (MtaCC and SkgACC) did not show any specific binding with their respective promoter DNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Based on the sequence homology shared by TipA-class proteins (14Habazettl J. Allan M. Jensen P.R. Sass H.J. Thompson C.J. Grzesiek S.

In this context, there is no, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies that correlate both spatio-temporal and age-specific mortality rates in Mexico City. Spatio-temporal Kriging modeling was used over five age-specific mortality rates (from the years 2000 to 2016 in Mexico City), to gain both spatial (borough and neighborhood) and temporal (year and trimester) data level description. Mortality age-specific patterns have been modeled using multilevel modeling for longitudinal data. Posterior tests were carried out to compare mortality averages between geo-spatial locations. Mortality correlation extends in all study groups for as long as 12 years and as far as 13.27 km. The highest mortality rate takes place in the Cuauhtémoc borough, the commercial, touristic and cultural core downtown of Mexico City. On the contrary, Tlalpan borough is the one with the lowest mortality rates in all the study groups. Post-productive mortality is the first age-specific cause of death, followed by infant, productive, pre-school and scholar groups. The combinations of spatio-temporal Kriging estimation and time-evolution linear mixed-effect models, allowed us to unveil relevant time and location trends that may be useful for public policy planning in Mexico City."
https://openalex.org/W3093945314,"Bacterial low-copy-number plasmids require partition (par) systems to ensure their stable inheritance by daughter cells. In general, these systems consist of three components: a centromeric DNA sequence, a centromere-binding protein and a nucleotide hydrolase that polymerizes and functions as a motor. Type III systems, however, segregate plasmids using three proteins: the FtsZ/tubulin-like GTPase TubZ, the centromere-binding protein TubR and the MerR-like transcriptional regulator TubY. Although the TubZ filament is sufficient to transport the TubR-centromere complex in vitro, TubY is still necessary for the stable maintenance of the plasmid. TubY contains an N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal coiled-coil followed by a cluster of lysine residues. This study determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of TubY from the Bacillus cereus pXO1-like plasmid and showed that it forms a tetrameric parallel four-helix bundle that differs from the typical MerR family proteins with a dimeric anti-parallel coiled-coil. Biochemical analyses revealed that the C-terminal tail with the conserved lysine cluster helps TubY to stably associate with the TubR-centromere complex as well as to nonspecifically bind DNA. Furthermore, this C-terminal tail forms an amphipathic helix in the presence of lipids but must oligomerize to localize the protein to the membrane in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that TubY is a component of the nucleoprotein complex within the partitioning machinery, and that lipid membranes act as mediators of type III systems."
