In a magnetic field, their Dirac cones split into two halves, one supporting left-handed and the other right-handed fermions. If an electric field is applied parallel to the magnetic field, this “chiral” symmetry may break: a phenomenon called the chiral anomaly. Xiong et al. observed this anomaly in the Dirac semimetal Na 3 Bi (see the Perspective by Burkov). Transport measurements lead to the detection of the predicted large negative magnetoresistance, which appeared only when the two fields were nearly parallel to each other.

Gold and platinum dispersed on metal oxide supports, for example, show remarkable low-temperature reactivity for carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation by oxygen or water. Ding et al. used infrared spectroscopy to identify CO adsorbed on isolated platinum atoms or nanoparticles dispersed on zeolite and oxide supports. Temperature-programmed desorption studies showed that CO reacted at much lower temperatures when adsorbed on nanoparticles versus on isolated metal atoms. Science , this issue p. 189"

Continuous energy supply maintains these transient biomolecular assemblies far from thermodynamic equilibrium, unlike typical synthetic systems that spontaneously assemble at thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we report the transient self-assembly of synthetic molecules into active materials, driven by the consumption of a chemical fuel. In these materials, reaction rates and fuel levels, instead of equilibrium composition, determine properties such as lifetime, stiffness, and self-regeneration capability. Fibers exhibit strongly nonlinear behavior including stochastic collapse and simultaneous growth and shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamics."

However, these superior properties have yet to be realized for graphene-derived macroscopic structures such as graphene fibers. We report the fabrication of graphene fibers with high thermal and electrical conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. The inner fiber structure consists of large-sized graphene sheets forming a highly ordered arrangement intercalated with small-sized graphene sheets filling the space and microvoids. The graphene fibers exhibit a submicrometer crystallite domain size through high-temperature treatment, achieving an enhanced thermal conductivity up to 1290 watts per meter per kelvin. The tensile strength of the graphene fiber reaches 1080 megapascals."

This is probably because as children, they breathe air containing bacterial components, which reduce the overall reactivity of the immune system. Schuijs et al. chronically exposed mice to bacterial endotoxin before they received an allergic stimulus. The protocol indeed protected them from developing an allergic response. Protection relied on a particular enzyme: A20. In humans, a variant of A20 correlates with increased susceptibility to asthma and allergy in children growing up on farms.

https://openalex.org/W1803064406,"Detecting single-photon level signals—carriers of both classical and quantum information—is particularly challenging for low-energy microwave frequency excitations. Here we introduce a superconducting amplifier based on a Josephson junction transmission line. Unlike current standing-wave parametric amplifiers, this traveling wave architecture robustly achieves high gain over a bandwidth of several gigahertz with sufficient dynamic range to read out 20 superconducting qubits. To achieve this performance, we introduce a subwavelength resonant phase-matching technique that enables the creation of nonlinear microwave devices with unique dispersion relations. We benchmark the amplifier with weak measurements, obtaining a high quantum efficiency of 75% (70% including noise added by amplifiers following the Josephson amplifier). With a flexible design based on compact lumped elements, this Josephson amplifier has broad applicability to microwave metrology and quantum optics."

Microbes often cause localized infections, so how do T cells know where to go? Lim et al. explore this question in a mouse model of influenza infection and find that immune cells called neutrophils help guide the way (see the Perspective by Kiermaier and Sixt). Upon infection, neutrophils quickly traffic to the trachea. There, they lay down “tracks” enriched in proteins called chemokines, especially the chemokine CXCL12, which guide CD8 + T cells to the infected organ. Mice whose neutrophils could not lay down such tracks exhibited defects in CD8 + T cell recruitment and viral clearance. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.aaa4352 ; see also p. 1055"

The SM proteins are universally required for intracellular vesicle fusion, yet their mechanism of action has long been enigmatic. Baker et al. have solved a piece of the puzzle by “capturing” SNAREs in the process of assembling into fusogenic complexes on the surface of an SM protein. The findings suggest exactly how and why SM proteins help vesicular fusion during intracellular membrane trafficking. Science , this issue p. 1111"

Handa et al. now report that when mixed in a specific preparation with iron, just parts per million of Pd suffice to catalyze the C-C bond–forming Suzuki coupling reaction.

Controlling these properties frequently requires modifying the number and type of structural defects in a metal alloy. Kuzmina et al. produced a new type of defect, called a linear complexion, in magnesium-rich steel (see the Perspective by Kaplan). These complexions are chemically and structurally distinct regions located inside a linear defect and are isolated from the bulk by a layer of dislocations. The discovery suggests a new path for targeting defects and improving alloy development. Science , this issue p. 1080 ; see also p. 1059"

https://openalex.org/W2167137586,"Ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities in structure and function across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. We assembled a global data set for 2260 communities of large mammals, invertebrates, plants, and plankton. We find that predator and prey biomass follow a general scaling law with exponents consistently near ¾. This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory."

They continually move proteins to and from the cellular destinations where they are needed, usually without mishap, through an elaborate system of endomembranes. Wheeler et al. show that a glitch in the traffic control system can help propel a cell toward malignancy (see the Perspective by Ferguson). RAB35, a protein previously implicated in endomembrane trafficking, is a key regulator of a well-known oncogenic signaling pathway. Mutations in RAB35 found in certain human tumors aberrantly activate this pathway and cause mislocalization of a factor that promotes cell growth. Science , this issue p. 211 , see also p. 162"
https://openalex.org/W1813667843,"Aging reduces skeletal muscle mass and strength, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we used mouse models to investigate molecular mechanisms of age-related skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy as well as new potential interventions for these conditions. We identified two small molecules that significantly reduce age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass: ursolic acid (a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in apples) and tomatidine (a steroidal alkaloid derived from green tomatoes). Because small molecule inhibitors can sometimes provide mechanistic insight into disease processes, we used ursolic acid and tomatidine to investigate the pathogenesis of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that ursolic acid and tomatidine generate hundreds of small positive and negative changes in mRNA levels in aged skeletal muscle, and the mRNA expression signatures of the two compounds are remarkably similar. Interestingly, a subset of the mRNAs repressed by ursolic acid and tomatidine in aged muscle are positively regulated by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Based on this finding, we investigated ATF4 as a potential mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. We found that a targeted reduction in skeletal muscle ATF4 expression reduces age-related deficits in skeletal muscle strength, quality, and mass, similar to ursolic acid and tomatidine. These results elucidate ATF4 as a critical mediator of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. In addition, these results identify ursolic acid and tomatidine as potential agents and/or lead compounds for reducing ATF4 activity, weakness, and atrophy in aged skeletal muscle.

In addition, these results identify ursolic acid and tomatidine as potential agents and/or lead compounds for reducing ATF4 activity, weakness, and atrophy in aged skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy are among the most pervasive and disruptive effects of aging. In nearly all people, even elite athletes, a subtle loss of muscle strength begins between the ages of 30 and 40. Over the next two to three decades, strength continues to erode, whereas muscle mass typically declines to a lesser degree. As a result, reduced muscle quality (i.e. strength per unit muscle mass) is a hallmark of the aging process (1Goodpaster B.H. Park S.W. Harris T.B. Kritchevsky S.B. Nevitt M. Schwartz A.V. Simonsick E.M. Tylavsky F.A. Visser M. Newman A.B. The loss of skeletal muscle strength, mass, and quality in older adults: the health, aging and body composition study.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med.

Mechanisms of skeletal muscle aging: insights from Drosophila and mammalian models.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). By the age of 65, overt muscle loss (age-related muscle atrophy or sarcopenia) is apparent in many individuals, and nearly all elderly persons report a gradual loss of strength and muscle over the course of their lives. The clinical consequences of age-related weakness and muscle loss are significant. Weakness limits activity, impairs quality of life, contributes to falls and fractures, and can create a vicious cycle of muscle disuse and further muscle loss and weakness. In its later stages, age-related muscle atrophy can lead to frailty, debilitation, and loss of independent living. All of these issues are becoming more prevalent as the elderly population increases. For example, in the United States, the number of persons over 65 years old is predicted to more than double between 2010 and 2040 (3Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics Older Americans. Key Indicators of Well-being. Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, Washington, D. C.2013Google Scholar). Despite their broad impact, age-related muscle weakness and atrophy cannot be reliably prevented by physical therapy or current nutritional approaches, and a pharmacologic therapy does not exist. The development of effective interventions has been somewhat hindered by the fact that the molecular basis of age-related muscle weakness and atrophy is largely unknown. The slow progression of age-related skeletal muscle atrophy represents a significant barrier to its experimental study and suggests that the condition may reflect subtle molecular changes that accumulate in skeletal muscle over many years. At the cellular level, age-related muscle atrophy shares some features with acute forms of muscle atrophy caused by fasting, muscle disuse, or systemic illness, which reduce muscle mass and strength over the course of days or weeks rather than years. For example, aging, fasting, muscle disuse, and systemic illness all cause a reduction in skeletal muscle fiber size and a loss of skeletal muscle protein. However, it is also clear that age-related muscle atrophy differs from acute muscle atrophy in some important ways. For example, at least some mediators of acute muscle atrophy (e.g. MAFbx/atrogin-1, MuRF1, and AMP kinase) also appear to protect muscle from effects of aging, and thus, chronic deficiencies of those proteins reduce muscle atrophy during acute stress conditions but accelerate the loss of muscle mass and/or quality during aging (4Bodine S.C.

A specific protein target for reducing the loss of muscle quality, strength, and mass during aging has not yet been found. In the current study, we investigated mechanisms of skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy during aging as well as potential interventions for these conditions. The potential interventions we investigated were two structurally dissimilar small molecules, ursolic acid and tomatidine. Ursolic acid is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene acid present in several edible herbs and fruits, including apples (8Frighetto R.T.S. Welendorf R.M. Nigro E.N. Frighetto N. Siani A.C.

Tomatidine is a naturally occurring steroidal alkaloid derived from tomato plants and green tomatoes (9Friedman M.

The effects of ursolic acid and tomatidine on age-related muscle weakness and atrophy were not known. However, despite the existence of mechanistic differences between acute and age-related muscle atrophy, we hypothesized that acute and age-related muscle atrophy might share some common molecular mediators, and thus, age-related muscle weakness and/or atrophy might be reduced by ursolic acid and/or tomatidine.

Ursolic acid and betulinic acid were then extracted from plasma samples as follows. 600 μl acetonitrile was added to each sample, and the samples were vortexed for 1 min and allowed to sit for 5 min. 400 μl of ethyl acetate was added to each sample, and the samples were vortexed, centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 rpm, and then transferred to a Phree Phospholipid Removal plate (product number 8E-S133-TGB, Phenomenex, Torrance CA). A vacuum was applied, and the eluent was collected, transferred to a 13 × 100-mm glass tube, and dried under nitrogen. The dried samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of mobile phase (5 mm ammonium acetate in ultrapure water (15%) and methanol (85%)) and then transferred to HPLC injection vials. LC/MS was performed with a Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with binary solvent manager, sample manager, and column manager operating under Empower software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and a Shimadzu 2010A LC/MS platform in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization negative mode operating under LC/MS Solutions software (version 3.41.324; Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). The analytical column was an Acquity UPLC high strength silica column (C18, 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Waters Corp.) with a Phenomenex C18 ULTRA UHPLC SecurityGuard column. Separation conditions were as follows: sample temperature, 7 °C; column temperature, 40 °C; sample was injected in partial loop with overfill injection mode; injection volume, 15 μl. The analysis was isocratic at 0.4 ml/min flow. Solvent A (15%) was 5 mm ammonium acetate; solvent B (85%) was methanol. The total run time for an LC/MS analysis was 7 min. The scan interval was 0.3 s with the following parameters: microscan, 0.1 atomic mass unit; atmospheric pressure chemical ionization temperature, 450 °C; curved desolvation line temperature, 200 °C; heat block temperature, 200 °C; nitrogen flow rate, 2.5 liters/min; detector voltage, 1.6 kV. The monitored mass-to-charge ratio for both ursolic acid and betulinic acid was 455.45. The retention times for ursolic acid and betulinic acid were 3.85 and 3.25 min, respectively. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 1–1000 ng/ml, and the coefficient of variation was less than 15% at all control concentrations. In the tomatidine assay, solanidine was utilized as the internal standard. Stock solutions of tomatidine and solanidine were generated by dissolving the compounds in 100% methanol, and working solutions were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solutions in 100% methanol. Standard curve samples were generated by adding tomatidine to 100 μl of blank mouse plasma at concentrations ranging from 4 to 1000 ng/ml. Control samples contained 0, 10, 100, or 700 ng/ml tomatidine in 100 μl of blank mouse plasma. Solanidine (5 μl of a 10 μg/ml stock) was added to the standard curve samples, control samples, and experimental samples (100 μl of plasma from mice treated with control diet, ursolic acid diet, or tomatidine diet). Tomatidine and solanidine were then extracted from plasma samples as follows. Samples were applied to Isolute SLE+ cartridges (6 ml; Biotage, AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in a Cerex solid phase extraction processor (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and allowed to adsorb onto the packing for 10 min. Samples were eluted with 5 ml of hexanes:dichloromethane (2:1 volume ratio) under gravity flow for ∼15 min. Eluates were collected in 13 × 100-mm glass tubes and evaporated under flowing nitrogen at 25 °C. Dried samples were reconstituted in 200 μl of water containing 40% methanol and 0.05% acetic acid and then transferred to HPLC injection vials. LC/MS was performed with a Shimadzu LC/MS-2010A mass spectrometer operated using electrospray interface in positive ion mode controlled using LC/MS Solutions software (version 3.41.324). The block and curved desolvation line temperature were both set at 250 °C. Data were collected in the selected ion monitoring mode at 416.45 (tomatidine) and 398.45 atomic mass units (solanidine). The analytical column was a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) preceded by a Phenomenex C18 ULTRA UHPLC SecurityGuard column. Separation conditions were as follows: sample temperature, 24 °C (+3 °C); column temperature, 40 °C; sample injection volume, 10 μl. A gradient of 0.25 ml/min was used for the analysis. Solvent A was water with 0.05% acetic acid and 5 mm ammonium acetate, and solvent B was methanol (75%) mixed with acetonitrile (25%). The gradient started at 40% B and increased to 90% B at 5 min, was held for 3 min, and then was changed back to baseline at 9 min. The total run time for LC/MS analysis was 12 min. The retention times for tomatidine and solanidine were 5.4 and 4.6 min, respectively. The assay was linear from 4 to 1000 ng/ml, and the coefficient of variation for all control samples was less than 15%. Protein extracts from mouse skeletal muscle and cultured myotubes were prepared as described previously (14Ebert S.M. Dyle M.C. Kunkel S.D. Bullard S.A. Bongers K.S. Fox D.K. Dierdorff J.M.

A separate aliquot of each extract was used to determine protein concentration by the BCA kit after which an equivalent amount of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad catalog number 162-0115). Immunoblots were performed at 4 °C for 16 h using primary antibodies diluted to 1:1000 (phospho-S6K), 1:2000 (S6K, Akt, phospho-Akt, and phospho-4E-BP1), 1:3000 (4E-BP1), 1:4000 (puromycin), or 1:5000 (FLAG). Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Thermo Scientific) using a 1:2000–1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to ensure equal loading. For microarray analyses, skeletal muscle RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified with an RNeasy kit and RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). RNA was processed and hybridized to Mouse Ref-8 version 2.0 BeadChip arrays (Illumina) by the Southern California Genotyping Consortium (University of California, Los Angeles) as described previously (18Fox D.K.

Arrays were scanned with an iScan reader, and data were extracted and analyzed with BeadStudio software (Illumina). Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) and methods described previously (14Ebert S.M. Dyle M.C. Kunkel S.D. Bullard S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2136791851,"The explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is a highly toxic and persistent environmental pollutant. Due to the scale of affected areas, one of the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of removing explosives pollution could be the use of plants. However, mechanisms of TNT phytotoxicity have been elusive. Here, we reveal that phytotoxicity is caused by reduction of TNT in the mitochondria, forming a nitro radical that reacts with atmospheric oxygen, generating reactive superoxide. The reaction is catalyzed by monodehydroascorbate reductase 6 (MDHAR6), with Arabidopsis deficient in MDHAR6 displaying enhanced TNT tolerance. This discovery will contribute toward the remediation of contaminated sites. Moreover, in an environment of increasing herbicide resistance, with a shortage in new herbicide classes, our findings reveal MDHAR6 as a valuable plant-specific target."
https://openalex.org/W1749969348,"Organophosphorus pesticides are widely used throughout the world. Because of their ease of availability, organophosphorus compounds are commonly used for self-poisoning in developing countries. The acute effects of exposure to organophosphorus pesticides are well known, but the chronic effects are unclear. Recent studies suggest that abnormalities of the central and peripheral nervous systems persisted for up to 5 years after acute poisoning due to a single large dose of organophosphates (OPs). However, the long-term effects on cardiovascular diseases are poorly understood.An OPs-exposed cohort (N = 7,561) and an age- and gender-matched control cohort (N = 30,244), both identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database, were compared. We utilized the multivariable Cox proportional model to estimate the risks of developing arrhythmia, coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patients with acute poisoning from OPs had higher incidence rates of arrhythmia (5.89 vs. 3.61 per 1,000 person-years), CAD (9.10 vs. 6.88 per 1,000 person-years), and CHF (3.89 vs. 2.98 per 1,000 person-years) compared with that of the non-OPs poisoning cohort, with a crude subhazard ratio (SHR) of 1.40, 1.13, and 1.12, respectively. Additionally, a significantly higher risk of arrhythmia was observed in the OPs poisoning cohort (adjusted SHR = 1.25) compared with the non-OPs poisoning cohort, particularly in male patients (adjusted SHR = 1.33) and those under 49 years of age (adjusted SHR = 3.16). After accounting for the competing risks of death, there was a higher risk of arrhythmia and CAD during a three year follow-up period (adjusted SHR = 1.50 for arrhythmia; adjusted SHR = 1.10 for CAD). We also found an adjusted SHR of 1.36 associated with developing CHF after 6 years of follow-up for OPs poisoning cohort.Acute OPs poisoning may continuously impact human health through mechanisms that are unclear. Any supportive measurements that could contribute to a reduction in the risk of heart disease may be beneficial in cases of OPs poisoning survivors."
https://openalex.org/W1959008540,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pah1 phosphatidate phosphatase, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidate to yield diacylglycerol, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. This evolutionarily conserved enzyme also plays a negative regulatory role in controlling de novo membrane phospholipid synthesis through its consumption of phosphatidate. We found that the pah1Δ mutant was defective in the utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources but not in oxidative phosphorylation; the mutant did not exhibit major changes in oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, F1F0-ATP synthase activity, or gross mitochondrial morphology. The pah1Δ mutant contained an almost normal complement of major mitochondrial phospholipids with some alterations in molecular species. Although oxidative phosphorylation was not compromised in the pah1Δ mutant, the cellular levels of ATP in quiescent cells were reduced by 2-fold, inversely correlating with a 4-fold increase in membrane phospholipids. In addition, the quiescent pah1Δ mutant cells had 3-fold higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide and cellular lipid hydroperoxides, had reduced activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and were hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, the pah1Δ mutant had a shortened chronological life span. In addition, the loss of Tsa1 thioredoxin peroxidase caused a synthetic growth defect with the pah1Δ mutation. The shortened chronological life span of the pah1Δ mutant along with its growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources and hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide was suppressed by the loss of Dgk1 diacylglycerol kinase, indicating that the underpinning of pah1Δ mutant defects was the excess synthesis of membrane phospholipids.

In this work, we confirmed that the mutant is defective in growth on glycerol and other non-fermentable carbon sources, but this phenotype was ascribed to reduced levels of ATP through its overconsumption for lipid synthesis rather than due to a defect in oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, the pah1Δ mutant was susceptible to oxidative stress, which together with reduced ATP contributed to a shortened chronological life span. These phenotypes of the pah1Δ mutant were partially complemented by loss of the Dgk1 DAG kinase, indicating that an underlying mechanism is the excess synthesis of membrane phospholipids.

https://openalex.org/W2100029339,"Although recent studies have provided a wealth of information about archaeal biology, nothing is known about the molecular basis of DNA segregation in these organisms. Here, we unveil the machinery and assembly mechanism of the archaeal Sulfolobus pNOB8 partition system. This system uses three proteins: ParA; an atypical ParB adaptor; and a centromere-binding component, AspA. AspA utilizes a spreading mechanism to create a DNA superhelix onto which ParB assembles. This supercomplex links to the ParA motor, which contains a bacteria-like Walker motif. The C domain of ParB harbors structural similarity to CenpA, which dictates eukaryotic segregation. Thus, this archaeal system combines bacteria-like and eukarya-like components, which suggests the possible conservation of DNA segregation principles across the three domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W1809673718,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an unstable expanded CTG repeat located within the DMPK gene 3'UTR. The nature, severity and age at onset of DM1 symptoms are very variable in patients. Different forms of the disease are described, among which the congenital form (CDM) is the most severe. Molecular mechanisms of DM1 are well characterized for the adult form and involve accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA forming foci in the nucleus. These RNA foci sequester proteins from the MBNL family and deregulate CELF proteins. These proteins are involved in many cellular mechanisms such as alternative splicing, transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation miRNA regulation as well as mRNA polyadenylation and localization. All these mechanisms can be impaired in DM1 because of the deregulation of CELF and MBNL functions. The mechanisms involved in CDM are not clearly described. In order to get insight into the mechanisms underlying CDM, we investigated if expanded RNA nuclear foci, one of the molecular hallmarks of DM1, could be detected in human DM1 fetal tissues, as well as in embryonic and neonatal tissues from transgenic mice carrying the human DMPK gene with an expanded CTG repeat. We observed very abundant RNA foci formed by sense DMPK RNA and, to a lesser extent, antisense DMPK RNA foci. Sense DMPK RNA foci clearly co-localized with MBNL1 and MBNL2 proteins. In addition, we studied DMPK sense and antisense expression during development in the transgenic mice. We found that DMPK sense and antisense transcripts are expressed from embryonic and fetal stages in heart, muscle and brain and are regulated during development. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying DM1 and CDM involved common players including toxic expanded RNA forming numerous nuclear foci at early stages during development."

Effective mucociliary clearance depends on adequate airway hydration, governed by ion transport. Apically expressed, large-conductance, Ca2+- and voltage-dependent K+ (BK) channels play an important role in this process. In this study, TGF-β1 decreased airway surface liquid volume, ciliary beat frequency, and BK activity in fully differentiated CF bronchial epithelial cells by reducing mRNA expression of the BK γ subunit leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 26 (LRRC26) and its function. Although LRRC26 knockdown itself reduced BK activity, LRRC26 overexpression partially reversed TGF-β1-induced BK dysfunction. TGF-β1-induced airway surface liquid volume hyper-absorption was reversed by the BK opener mallotoxin and the clinically useful TGF-β signaling inhibitor pirfenidone. The latter increased BK activity via rescue of LRRC26. Therefore, we propose that TGF-β1-induced mucociliary dysfunction in CF airways is associated with BK inactivation related to a LRRC26 decrease and is amenable to treatment with clinically useful TGF-β1 inhibitors.

Thorac. Soc. 2004; 1: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Due to a genetically defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, CF airway epithelia reveal reduced ASL volume that worsens under stress. Alternative pathways exist to hydrate the airway surface via calcium-activated chloride channels. However, attempts to stimulate these channels and maintain ASL volume in CF have clinically failed (7Ratjen F. Durham T. Navratil T. Schaberg A. Accurso F.J. Wainwright C. Barnes M. Moss R.B.

There are several possible explanations for this outcome, including the short duration of action of the agonist used. The focus here, however, is on the driving force needed to secrete apical Cl−. ATP-induced apical K+ secretion, driven by apical large-conductance, Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent potassium (BK) channels, is critical for adequate ASL volume and mucociliary clearance (8Manzanares D.

Apical K+ secretion facilitates Cl− efflux by hyperpolarizing the apical membrane and increasing the driving force for Cl− secretion by acting as the counter ion. This creates a short circuit loop favoring airway surface hydration. In normal airway epithelial cells, inhibition of BK channels or knockdown of the BK α-subunit led to periciliary fluid collapse as revealed by low ciliary beat frequency (CBF) that can be fully rescued by apical fluid addition (8Manzanares D.

Polymorphisms at codon 10 and 25 up-regulate TGF-β1 synthesis (11Arkwright P.D. Laurie S. Super M. Pravica V. Schwarz M.J. Webb A.K. Hutchinson I.V. TGF-β1 genotype and accelerated decline in lung function of patients with cystic fibrosis.Thorax. 2000; 55: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These TGF-β1 genotypes have been associated with worse lung function in at least three independent large clinical studies (12Collaco J.M. Cutting G.R. Update on gene modifiers in cystic fibrosis.Curr. Opin. Pulm. Med. 2008; 14: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of TGF-β1 were elevated in CF patients and associated with diminished lung function and recent hospitalization (13Harris W.T. Muhlebach M.S. Oster R.A. Knowles M.R. Noah T.L. Transforming growth factor-β1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis.Pediatr.

This study addressed the effect of TGF-β1 on ion transport and ASL volume regulation in CF epithelia, specifically focusing on BK channels. TGF-β1 reduced ASL volume and parameters of mucociliary clearance, at least in part by decreasing BK activity. This was due to the down-regulation of leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 26 (LRRC26), a subunit necessary for BK function in non-excitable tissues (17Yan J. Aldrich R.W. LRRC26 auxiliary protein allows BK channel activation at resting voltage without calcium.Nature. 2010; 466: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). LRRC26 overexpression, a BK opener, and the clinically used TGF-β1 inhibitor pirfenidone overcame the detrimental effect of TGF-β1.

The following antibodies were used for BK: immunoprecipitation with polyclonal AP107 anti-α BK subunit antibody (Alomone Labs), probing with monoclonal anti-α BK subunit antibody (clone L6/60, NeuroMab, Antibodies Inc.). The polyclonal anti-rabbit LRRC26 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-102015 V19) and used at a dilution of 1:200. Fully differentiated CFBEcells on Snapwell filters were mounted in Ussing chambers (EasyMount chamber) connected to a VCC MC6 voltage clamp unit (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Data were acquired as described previously from intact and basolaterally permeabilized cell layers (8Manzanares D. Gonzalez C. Ivonnet P. Chen R.S. Valencia-Gattas M. Conner G.E. Larsson H.P.

Apical K+ currents were measured in the presence of apically applied 10 μm amiloride and 30 min after basolateral permeabilization using 20 μm amphotericin B, 10 μm valinomycin, and 10 μm nigericin, using a basolateral to apical K+ gradient (8Manzanares D.

Using calcium phosphate co-precipitation (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), lentiviruses were prepared by co-transfecting HEK 293T cells with pLKO.1-puro-expressing LRRC26 shRNA (TRCN0000245794; MISSIONRNAi from Sigma-Aldrich) and packaging DNA plasmids. Virus-containing medium was collected, concentrated by polyethylene glycol (11%) precipitation, and stored at −80 °C. An estimation of the virus titer was performed using the p24 HIV antigen ELISA kit (PerkinElmer). Dedifferentiated cells were used for infections. At the time of plating the cells on Transwell inserts, virus was added at a ratio of 100 ng/500,000 cells in bronchial epithelial growth medium containing Polybrene (2 μg/ml). The infection was carried out overnight, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The following day, virus was removed, and bronchial epithelial growth medium was changed to air-liquid interface medium top and bottom including puromycin until cells reached confluence, when an air-liquid interface was created. Full-length LRRC26 was amplified from CF cells and cloned into the pCDH-EF1-MCS-IRES-Puro vector from SBI. Viruses were made, and cells were infected and selected as above. Washing of the apical surface was suspended for the duration of the experiments. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200, equipped with differential interference contrast optics. CBF was measured as described previously (29Salathe M. Bookman R.J. Mode of Ca2+ action on ciliary beat frequency in single ovine airway epithelial cells.J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Measurements were done within a 0.5-cm radius from the center (no influence of possible fluid menisci at the edges of the cultures). CBF was measured before and after apical fluid addition. ASL volumes from CFBE cells were estimated by meniscus scanning (20Harvey P.R. Tarran R. Garoff S. Myerburg M.M. Measurement of the airway surface liquid volume with simple light refraction microscopy.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 45: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cultures were washed with PBS 24 h prior to measurements to clean the filters from mucus accumulation that may interfere with the ASL reading. Scanned menisci data were transformed to ASL volume using software generously provided by Dr. Myerburg (University of Pittsburgh). Alternatively, the ASL of fully differentiated CFBE cells was labeled with rhodamine-dextran (Life Technologies). ASL height was measured by XZ confocal microscopy as described previously (21Roomans G.M. Kozlova I. Nilsson H. Vanthanouvong V. Button B. Tarran R. Measurements of airway surface liquid height and mucus transport by fluorescence microscopy, and of ion composition by x-ray microanalysis.J. Cyst. Fibros. 2004; 3: 135-13910.1016/j.jcf.2004.05.029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63× glycerol immersion lens. GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used to analyze all results. Student's t test or Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare two groups as appropriate. One-way analysis of variance was used for comparisons of more than two groups followed by the appropriate post hoc tests. A p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. ASL volume was measured by meniscus scanning (20Harvey P.R. Tarran R. Garoff S. Myerburg M.M. Measurement of the airway surface liquid volume with simple light refraction microscopy.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 45: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in fully differentiated, homozygous ΔF508 CFBE cells. Cells treated basolaterally with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) revealed fluid absorption both during the first 20 h and during the subsequent 5-h time window (Fig. 1A), whereas control cells switched to net fluid secretion in this 5-h period. TGF-β1 also resulted in a significant CBF decrease (Fig. 1B). ASL volume homeostasis maintains an appropriate periciliary layer height that allows normal ciliary activity. Therefore, a CBF reduction rescued by adding apical fluid is due to ASL volume loss. In fact, TGF-β1-induced CBF decreases were fully reversed by adding apical buffer (Fig. 1B), indicating no direct TGF-β1 effect on cilia. TGF-β1 treatment significantly decreased transepithelial voltage (TEV, Fig. 2A), baseline short circuit current (Isc, Fig. 2A), transepithelial resistance (TER, Fig. 2A), and amiloride-sensitive Isc (Fig. 2A) due to epithelial sodium channel activity, an effect previously reported in alveolar epithelia (22Peters D.M. Vadász I. Wujak L. Wygrecka M. Olschewski A. Becker C. Herold S. Papp R. Mayer K. Rummel S. Brandes R.P. Günther A. Waldegger S. Eickelberg O. Seeger W. Morty R.E. TGF-β directs trafficking of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC which has implications for ion and fluid transport in acute lung injury.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: E374-E383Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Apical BK activity was measured by ATP-induced Isc changes in basolaterally permeabilized CFBE cells exposed to a serosal-mucosal K+ gradient and amiloride (8Manzanares D. Gonzalez C. Ivonnet P. Chen R.S. Valencia-Gattas M. Conner G.E. Larsson H.P. Salathe M. Functional apical large conductance, Ca2+-activated, and voltage-dependent K+ channels are required for maintenance of airway surface liquid volume.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19830-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 significantly reduced ATP-stimulated BK activity (Fig. 2B). To test whether TGF-β1 treatment interfered with ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling that opens BK, we measured the change in fura-2 fluorescence as an indicator of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2C). TGF-β1 did not reduce the Ca2+ response to ATP, eliminating the possibility that the decreased BK activity was due to a breakdown of the upstream signaling pathway. TGF-β1 treatment had no negative impact on the cellular expression of the BK channel pore-forming α-subunit. TGF-β1 increased its mRNA and did not change protein expression significantly (Fig. 3A). Control and TGF-β1-treated cells responded to 5 μm of the BK opener NS11021 (23Bentzen B.H. Nardi A. Calloe K. Madsen L.S. Olesen S.P. Grunnet M. The small molecule NS11021 is a potent and specific activator of Ca2+-activated big-conductance K+ channels.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with a similar current change (Fig. 3B), suggesting that surface availability of the channel was not affected by TGF-β1. BK activity can be modified by the presence of γ modulatory proteins, most commonly LRRC26 (17Yan J. Aldrich R.W. LRRC26 auxiliary protein allows BK channel activation at resting voltage without calcium.Nature. 2010; 466: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Yan J. Aldrich R.W. BK potassium channel modulation by leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7917-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the presence of LRRC26, the threshold for BK channel opening at physiological membrane potentials is left-shifted and requires a thousandfold lower [Ca2+]i, namely 100 nm instead of 100 μm (17Yan J. Aldrich R.W. LRRC26 auxiliary protein allows BK channel activation at resting voltage without calcium.Nature. 2010; 466: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This shift allows BK activity in non-excitatory cells. TGF-β1 decreased LRRC26 mRNA and protein expression significantly (Fig. 3C). To evaluate whether these changes translated to altered functional activity, the BK opener mallotoxin (MTX (5 μm)) was used. MTX potently shifts the conductance-voltage relationship of BK channels to the left (25Almassy J. Begenisich T. The LRRC26 protein selectively alters the efficacy of BK channel activators.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but only in the absence of LRRC26. Control CFBE cells did not respond to MTX, whereas TGF-β1-treated cells showed increased apical K+ secretion upon MTX exposure (Fig. 3D). Therefore, LRRC26 was also functionally decreased in TGF-β1-treated cells, leading to decreased apical activity of BK channels. Confocal microscopy was used to confirm the effects of TGF-β1 and BK channel inhibitors on ASL height (Fig. 4A). Either 20 h of TGF-β1 alone or the combination of paxilline with TGF-β1 pretreatment reduced ASL height relative to control (Fig. 4, A and B). The presence of the BK opener MTX alleviated the effects of TGF-β1. LRRC26 was knocked down using shRNA-expressing lentiviruses. Quantitative PCR showed a significant decrease of LRRC26 expression in fully differentiated CFBE cells after they were infected in an undifferentiated state (Fig. 5A). LRRC26 protein expression was also reduced by a modest amount when assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B; ∼0.7-fold control). As with TGF-β1, LRRC26 knockdown actually increased KCNMA1 mRNA expression (Fig. 5C). Nevertheless, knockdown cells exhibited decreased BK activity (Fig. 5D) and increased MTX sensitivity (Fig. 5E). We could not quantify ASL volume in these cells using the meniscus scanning technique because they were dry and showed mucus accumulation on their surfaces without movement (Fig. 5F), indicating ASL volume loss. LRRC26 overexpression increased LRRC26 mRNA and protein expression as expected (Fig. 6, A and B). LRRC26 overexpression also reversed TGF-β1-induced BK dysfunction (Fig. 6C). As seen with TGF-β1 alone, the increased LRRC26 protein expression did not change the TGF-β1-induecd increases in KCNMA1 mRNA expression, the pore-forming subunit of BK. However, this increase did not explain the rescued K+ current with LRRC26 overexpression because the current was down with TGF-β1 alone despite an increase in KCNMA1 mRNA in the cells infected with the control plasmid. In normal human airway epithelial cells, the Smad3 inhibitor SIS3 (26Jinnin M. Ihn H. Tamaki K. Characterization of SIS3, a novel specific inhibitor of Smad3, and its effect on transforming growth factor-β1-induced extracellular matrix expression.Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but not p38 MAP kinase or PIK inhibitors, partially counteracted the TGF-β1-induced impairments of BK activity and CBF (not shown), indicating a Smad-dependent mechanism. We therefore tested the clinically useful Smad2/3 inhibitor pirfenidone in CFBE cells. Pirfenidone (1 mg/ml) rescued TGF-β1-mediated BK dysfunction (Fig. 7A), LRRC26 down-regulation (Fig. 7B), and reversed MTX sensitivity (Fig. 7C). In addition, pirfenidone rescued TGF-β1-mediated CBF decreases (Fig. 7D) and reversed the prolonged ASL volume absorption induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 7E). TGF-β1 is a potent physiological cytokine that is involved in differentiation and proliferation. TGF-β1 is increased in CF lung disease and associated with worse clinical outcome. Our results indicate that TGF-β1 decreased ASL volume and CBF in CFBE cells (Fig. 8). We found that TGF-β1 reduced apical BK activity and that this effect was mediated by decreased expression of the γ modulatory protein LRRC26, which causes a shift of the voltage and [Ca2+]i needed for activation of BK (17Yan J. Aldrich R.W. LRRC26 auxiliary protein allows BK channel activation at resting voltage without calcium.Nature. 2010; 466: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and thus enables BK activity in non-excitable cells. Our results confirmed that BK activity is necessary for ASL homeostasis (8Manzanares D. Gonzalez C. Ivonnet P. Chen R.S. Valencia-Gattas M. Conner G.E. Larsson H.P. Salathe M. Functional apical large conductance, Ca2+-activated, and voltage-dependent K+ channels are required for maintenance of airway surface liquid volume.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 19830-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) because the BK inhibitor paxilline decreased ASL volume similarly to TGF-β1. A BK opener was partially able to rescue ASL homeostasis in TGF-β1-treated CFBE cells. However, potassium channel openers might be associated with toxicity in human beings when reaching the systemic circulation. On the other hand, it was interesting to note that a clinically useful TGF-β1 signaling inhibitor, pirfenidone, partially reversed the adverse effects of TGF-β1 on ASL volume and CBF. Thus, targeting TGF-β signaling might have benefits as a therapy in patients with CF. This is not only true for ASL volume but also for CFTR corrector therapies, because a BK-induced increase in the driving force for Cl− secretion would be beneficial even for partially corrected CFTR. How good are preclinical models in predicting clinical outcome? The most commonly measured clinical outcome in CF patients is a change in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). As described previously, a good correlation between preclinical data on ASL volume regulation in air-liquid interface cultures, where ASL height was brought into the normal range (i.e. ≥ 7 μm), and clinical outcome data was found using ivacaftor (10% FEV1 improvement in G551D patients) and inhaled hypertonic saline (3% improvement) (27Van Goor F.

Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 1663-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented here suggest that pirfenidone could have a significant clinical effect in CF patients. This medication is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and therefore relatively easily amenable to clinical testing. In conclusion, we showed that BK activity is necessary for ASL homoeostasis in non-stressed CFBE cells and found that TGF-β1 decreases BK activity by reducing functional LRRC26 expression. The use of BK openers has a significant rescuing effect, but targeting TGF-β1 signaling might pave the way for novel therapies for the treatment of CF and could have clinically measurable therapeutic effects via improved airway hydration.

To understand how this rescue occurs, we evaluated the change in the binding of proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, such as Hsp27 (HspB1) and Hsp40 (DnaJ). We saw a dramatic reduction in binding to heat shock proteins 27 and 40 following combined corrector therapy. siRNA experiments confirmed that a reduction in Hsp27 or Hsp40 rescued CFTR in the ΔF508 mutant, but the rescue was not additive or synergistic with C4 + 18 treatment, indicating these correctors shared a common pathway for rescue involving a network of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation proteins.

We included 568 patients with OSA and 2840 subjects without OSA. Each subject was followed for a 1-year period to evaluate their healthcare resource utilization. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare differences in healthcare utilization between patients with and those without OSA during the 1-year follow-up period.As to all healthcare service utilization, patients with OSA had significantly more outpatient visits (30.3 vs. 18.6), outpatient costs (US$1231.2 vs. US$764.8), inpatient days (1.8 vs. 1.2), inpatient costs (US$563.6 vs. US$276.7), and total costs (US$1794.8 vs. US$1041.5) than comparison subjects during the 1-year follow-up period. Moreover, patients with OSA aged 40~49 and 50~59 years respectively incurred 2.11- and 2.02-fold higher total costs compared to patients without OSA. However, patients with OSA aged over 70 years did not have higher total costs compared to those without OSA.This study found that patients with OSA had greater healthcare service utilization than those without OSA.

https://openalex.org/W1886775230,"A few studies in the past have shown that plant diversity in terms of species richness and functional composition can modify plant defense chemistry. However, it is not yet clear to what extent genetic differentiation of plant chemotypes or phenotypic plasticity in response to diversity-induced variation in growth conditions or a combination of both is responsible for this pattern. We collected seed families of ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) from six-year old experimental grasslands of varying plant diversity (Jena Experiment). The offspring of these seed families was grown under standardized conditions with two levels of light and nutrients. The iridoid glycosides, catalpol and aucubin, and verbascoside, a caffeoyl phenylethanoid glycoside, were measured in roots and shoots. Although offspring of different seed families differed in the tissue concentrations of defensive metabolites, plant diversity in the mothers' environment did not explain the variation in the measured defensive metabolites of P. lanceolata offspring. However secondary metabolite levels in roots and shoots were strongly affected by light and nutrient availability. Highest concentrations of iridoid glycosides and verbascoside were found under high light conditions, and nutrient availability had positive effects on iridoid glycoside concentrations in plants grown under high light conditions. However, verbascoside concentrations decreased under high levels of nutrients irrespective of light. The data from our greenhouse study show that phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental variation rather than genetic differentiation in response to plant community diversity is responsible for variation in secondary metabolite concentrations of P. lanceolata in the six-year old communities of the grassland biodiversity experiment. Due to its large phenotypic plasticity P. lanceolata has the potential for a fast and efficient adjustment to varying environmental conditions in plant communities of different species richness and functional composition."
https://openalex.org/W2238669589,"The regulation of AMPA-type receptor (AMPAR) abundance in the postsynaptic membrane is an important mechanism involved in learning and memory formation. Recent data suggest that one of the constituents of the AMPAR complex is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), a brain-specific isoform located in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons. Previous results had demonstrated that CPT1C deficiency disrupted spine maturation in hippocampal neurons and impaired spatial learning, but the role of CPT1C in AMPAR physiology had remained mostly unknown. In the present study, we show that CPT1C binds GluA1 and GluA2 and that the three proteins have the same expression profile during neuronal maturation. Moreover, in hippocampal neurons of CPT1C KO mice, AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and synaptic levels of AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2 are significantly reduced. We show that AMPAR expression is dependent on CPT1C levels because total protein levels of GluA1 and GluA2 are decreased in CPT1C KO neurons and are increased in CPT1C-overexpressing neurons, whereas other synaptic proteins remain unaltered. Notably, mRNA levels of AMPARs remained unchanged in those cultures, indicating that CPT1C is post-transcriptionally involved. We demonstrate that CPT1C is directly involved in the de novo synthesis of GluA1 and not in protein degradation. Moreover, in CPT1C KO cultured neurons, GluA1 synthesis after chemical long term depression was clearly diminished, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor treatment was unable to phosphorylate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and stimulate GluA1 protein synthesis. These data newly identify CPT1C as a regulator of AMPAR translation efficiency and therefore also synaptic function in the hippocampus. The regulation of AMPA-type receptor (AMPAR) abundance in the postsynaptic membrane is an important mechanism involved in learning and memory formation. Recent data suggest that one of the constituents of the AMPAR complex is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), a brain-specific isoform located in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons.

Whereas liver CPT1A and muscle CPT1B isoforms catalyze the conversion of long-chain acyl-CoA to acyl-carnitines in fatty acid β-oxidation, the brain-specific isoform CPT1C exhibits low catalytic activity in vitro (1Sierra A.Y.

Recently, the involvement of hippocampal CPT1C in cognition and spinogenesis has been described (3Carrasco P. Sahún I. McDonald J. Ramírez S. Jacas J. Gratacós E. Sierra A.Y. Serra D. Herrero L.

CPT1C knock-out (KO) mice were shown to present strongly compromised spatial learning and disrupted dendritic spine morphology by increasing immature filopodia and decreasing mature spines. Interestingly, high-resolution proteomic analyses have revealed CPT1C as one of the constituents of the complex of α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) (9Schwenk J. Harmel N. Brechet A. Zolles G. Berkefeld H. Müller C.S. Bildl W. Baehrens D. Hüber B. Kulik A. Klöcker N. Schulte U. Fakler B.

Yefimenko N. Cascos-García H. Soto D. AMPAR interacting protein CPT1C enhances surface expression of GluA1-containing receptors.Front. Cell Neurosci. 2014; 8: 469PubMed Google Scholar). However, given that CPT1C only interacts with AMPARs in the ER, the role of CPT1C in AMPAR synthesis has been scarcely examined. In the present study, we show that CPT1C binds to endogenous GluA1 and GluA2 subunits and regulates their expression in mouse hippocampi and in cultured hippocampal neurons, which is crucial for AMPARs to reach the synapsis and for synaptic transmission. Furthermore, we reveal that this regulation is exerted post-transcriptionally, at the level of the de novo protein synthesis, without affecting protein degradation. Consequently, synaptic AMPARs are diminished in CPT1C KO hippocampal cultures, correlating with a reduction in the amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). These data may explain the previously described involvement of CPT1C in dendritic spinogenesis and learning. Anti-CPT1C antibody was developed in our laboratory (1Sierra A.Y. Gratacós E. Carrasco P. Clotet J. Ureña J. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Casals N. CPT1c is localized in endoplasmic reticulum of neurons and has carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity.J. Biol.

Anti-GluN2A, anti-biotin, anti-β-tubulin, and anti-calreticulin were obtained from Sigma; anti-GluA1, anti-GluA2, and anti-synapsin I were obtained from Merck Millipore. Anti-postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), anti-stargazin, and anti-GFP were obtained from Abcam. Anti-phospho-PERK Thr-980, anti-EIF2 Ser-51, anti-EIF2, anti-ATF4, and anti-GADD34 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-Akt Ser-473, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-mTOR Ser-3448, and phospho-5′ AMP-activated protein kinase α (phospho-AMPKα) Thr-172 were sourced from Cell Signaling, and anti-GAPDH was obtained from Ambion. l-Serine-D7 was obtained from CDN Isotypes. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise specified. CPT1C knock-out mice were developed as described previously (3Carrasco P. Sahún I. McDonald J. Ramírez S. Jacas J. Gratacós E. Sierra A.Y. Serra D. Herrero L. Acker-Palmer A. Hegardt F.G. Dierssen M. Casals N.

After 8 back-crosses with C57BL/6J mice, littermate homozygous CPT1C KO and wild type (WT) mice were crossed separately to obtain a line for each genotype, which were used in the experiments. Hippocampi were obtained from adult male mice. All animal procedures met the guidelines in Spanish legislation (BOE 32/2007) and were approved of by the local ethics committee. Primary hippocampal mouse neurons were prepared from embryonic day 16 WT or CPT1C KO embryos and cultured as described previously (13Fadó R. Moubarak R.S. Miñano-Molina A.J. Barneda-Zahonero B. Valero J. Saura C.A. Moran J. Comella J.X. Rodríguez-Álvarez J. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein negatively regulates neuronal differentiation through interaction with cRAF and Trk.Sci. Rep. 2013; 32397Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons at 15–16 days in vitro (DIV), coverslips were mounted and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX50). Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier-Digidata1440A series interface board using pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). To isolate AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs, the following blockers were added to the extracellular solution: 1 μm tetrodotoxin, 50 μm D-AP5, 25 μm 7-CK, and 20 μm SR95531/gabazine (all from Abcam). Series resistance (Rs) was typically 15–22 megaohms and was monitored at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. Cells that showed a change in Rs greater than 20% were rejected (14Lissin D.V. Carroll R.C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Rapid, activation-induced redistribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in membrane capacitance when comparing WT and CPT1C KO neurons. For electrophysiology data analysis, mEPSCs were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Data were analyzed using IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics) together with Neuromatic (Jason Rothman). Events were detected using amplitude threshold crossing (15Kudoh S.N. Taguchi T. A simple exploratory algorithm for the accurate and fast detection of spontaneous synaptic events.Biosens. Bioelectron. 2002; 17: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with the threshold (typically ∼7–8 pA) set according to the baseline current variance. For amplitude and kinetic analyses, only events with monotonic fast rise (<1 ms) and uncontaminated decay were included. For labeling surface AMPARs, neurons at 17–18 DIV were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, blocked with 2% goat serum, and incubated with anti-AMPAR N terminus antibodies. After washing, cells were incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. Neurons were then permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then blocked once more. Buffer was substituted with the appropriate anti-PSD95 antibody. After washing, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount mounting medium. Imaging was performed with the confocal laser-scanning microscope ZEISS LSM 700 using a ×63 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective. For quantification, sets of cells were cultured and stained simultaneously and imaged using identical settings. The region of interest was randomly selected. Measurements with the Fiji image processing package were performed as described previously (16Aoto J. Martinelli D.C. Malenka R.C. Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Presynaptic neurexin-3 alternative splicing trans-synaptically controls postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking.Cell. 2013; 154: 75-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Neurons were collected using Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in an orbital shaker. Samples were processed as described previously (17Miñano-Molina A.J. España J. Martín E. Barneda-Zahonero B. Fadó R. Solé M. Trullás R. Saura C.A. Rodríguez-Alvarez J. Soluble oligomers of amyloid-β peptide disrupt membrane trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) contributing to early synapse dysfunction.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27311-27321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dissected hippocampi and neuronal cultures were collected in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), respectively, and supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Next, protein extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in TBS-T and incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in TBS-T 0.2% (w/v) BSA. After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using the LuminataTM Forte Western HRP substrate (Millipore). Semiquantitative analysis was performed using densitometry with Fiji software. Two lentiviral vectors, pWPI-IRES-GFP and pWPI-CPT1C-IRES-GFP, were constructed to drive cell expression of GFP and CPT1C plus GFP, respectively. The map and the sequences of these plasmids, kindly provided by Dr. Trono (Laboratory of Virology and Genetics, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland), are available from Addgene. Lentiviruses were propagated and titrated as described previously (18Naldini L. Blömer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Efficient transfer, integration, and sustained long-term expression of the transgene in adult rat brains injected with a lentiviral vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Infection was performed on the day of seeding in complete DMEM medium at 1 virus/cell and left to stand for 5 h. The medium was then replaced with supplemented neurobasal medium. Fourteen days later, cells were collected for the analysis of GFP and CPT1C expression. The percentage of infected cells reached at least 75% in cultured hippocampal neurons. For expression analysis, template cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription (Moloney murine leukemia virus). Gene expression was quantified using real-time PCR with SsoFast Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad) and gene-specific primer VIC, FAN, or HEX dye-labeled as follows: Gapdh forward, reverse, and probe (4352339F; Applied Biosystems); Gria1 (64845347; IDT); and Gria2 (64845351; IDT) on a CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad). All biological samples were amplified in the same run for each experiment. Relative gene expression between paired samples was estimated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The de novo protein synthesis rate was determined by a bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging assay in WT or CPT1C KO hippocampal neurons as described previously (19Dieterich D.C. Lee J.J. Link a J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Labeling, detection and identification of newly synthesized proteomes with bioorthogonal non-canonical amino-acid tagging.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), using copper sulfate and tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine to generate the Cu(I) catalyst for the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (20Pedraza N. Ortiz R. Cornadó A. Llobet A. Aldea M. Gallego C. KIS, a kinase associated with microtubule regulators, enhances translation of AMPA receptors and stimulates dendritic spine remodeling.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 13988-13997Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were depleted of methionine for 30 min before treatment with azidohomoalanine at 1 mm (an effective surrogate for methionine; Jena Bioscience) for 4 h. After cell lysis with 0.05% SDS in PBS, pH 7.6, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors, the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction was prepared as follows: 200 μm triazole ligand, 50 μm biotin-alkyne, 400 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 200 μm copper sulfate, incubated at 4 °C overnight under agitation. The excess reagents were removed by gel filtration using PD-10 columns and eluted in 0.05% SDS in PBS, pH 7.6. A dot-blot analysis was performed to determine the newly synthesized protein concentration tagged with biotin. Desalted samples were precipitated with NeutrAvidin resin (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. NeutrAvidin beads were then washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, pH 7.6, and samples were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were detected using immunoblotting. Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM (GraphPad Software). Significance between two groups was determined according to data normality according to the Shapiro-Wilk test, using either Student's t test or a Mann-Whitney U test (parametric and non-parametric, respectively). For comparisons among 3–4 groups, ANOVA was performed, followed by the Bonferroni post-test. It has been demonstrated that CPT1C binds AMPARs in solubilized membrane fractions from the hippocampus in rodents (9Schwenk J. Harmel N. Brechet A. Zolles G. Berkefeld H. Müller C.S. Bildl W.

We therefore first analyzed whether CPT1C was able to interact with AMPARs in cultured hippocampal neurons. We performed immunoprecipitation studies using specific anti-CPT1C antibodies developed in our laboratory (1Sierra A.Y. Gratacós E. Carrasco P. Clotet J. Ureña J. Serra D. Asins G. Hegardt F.G. Casals N. CPT1c is localized in endoplasmic reticulum of neurons and has carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6878-6885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows how CPT1C interacts with GluA1 and GluA2 but not with other synaptic glutamatergic proteins, such as NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2A or the AMPAR auxiliary subunit stargazin (also called TARPγ2; transmembrane AMPA regulatory protein). We also performed reverse immunoprecipitation using a GluA1 antibody and confirmed that interaction (Fig. 1B). It is worth noting that GluA1-GluA2 and GluA1-stargazin bindings were not found to be disrupted in the absence of CPT1C (Fig. 1C). To prove antibody specificity, CPT1C immunoprecipitation was performed in the hippocampi of CPT1C KO animals; in those samples, we did not detect CPT1C or GluA1 in immunoblotting (data not shown). These data demonstrate that CPT1C binds AMPARs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Because CPT1C binds to GluA1/GluA2 and previous results from our laboratory clearly showed that spatial learning and dendritic spine maturation are impaired in CPT1C KO mice (3Carrasco P. Sahún I. McDonald J. Ramírez S. Jacas J. Gratacós E. Sierra A.Y. Serra D. Herrero L. Acker-Palmer A. Hegardt F.G. Dierssen M. Casals N. Ceramide levels regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C control dendritic spine maturation and cognition.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21224-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we wondered whether excitatory synaptic transmission was altered in those animals. To address this issue, we performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons and measured AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs. Cells were treated with tetrodotoxin to block synaptic transmission and with D-AP-5, 7-CK, and SR95531 to block NMDA and GABAA receptors. We found that mEPSC amplitude was decreased in neurons from CPT1C KO animals (Fig. 2, A–C) when compared with WT neurons (−18.96 ± 0.95 pA for WT versus −15.46 ± 0.99 pA for KO; n = 26 and n = 18, respectively; p = 0.0175; t test). Cumulative amplitude histograms for mEPSCs (Fig. 2D) revealed that the distribution of amplitudes in CPT1C KO neurons shifted toward smaller values, indicating a decrease in the quantity of postsynaptic AMPARs. We then examined the frequency of AMPA-mediated mEPSCs and found no significant differences (4.12 ± 0.84 Hz for WT versus 3.83 ± 1.24 Hz for KO; p = 0.3519; Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 2E), demonstrating that no presynaptic alteration is present in CPT1C KO cells. Next, we measured the decay time constant of AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs in WT and KO animals and did not observe any change (3.67 ± 0.20 ms for WT versus 3.69 ± 0.16 ms for KO; p = 0.9256; t test; Fig. 2F), suggesting that no alteration in AMPAR subunit composition takes place in CPT1C-deficient neurons (21Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P. A molecular determinant for submillisecond desensitization in glutamate receptors.Science. 1994; 266: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The decrease in postsynaptic AMPARs in CPT1C KO neurons was further confirmed when we analyzed the presence of surface GluA1 and GluA2 at synaptic puncta by double immunocytochemistry with the postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3A). Quantitative image analysis showed that the percentage of postsynaptic puncta containing AMPARs was reduced in CPT1C KO neurons (39.3 ± 2.4% with GluA1 for WT versus 27.8 ± 1.8% for KO, p = 0.0002 (Fig. 3B); 49.0 ± 1.9% with GluA2 versus 28.0 ± 2.1%; p < 0.0001 (Fig. 3C); t test) and that the intensity of synaptic AMPARs was particularly decreased in CPT1C KO hippocampal neurons when compared with WT (1.00 ± 0.06 GluA1 intensity for WT versus 0.77 ± 0.03 for KO, p = 0.0033, n = 79 and 69, respectively (Fig. 3D); 1.00 ± 0.04 GluA2 intensity versus 0.61 ± 0.03, p < 0.0001, n = 74 (Fig. 2E); t test). Interestingly, the number of PSD95 puncta per 10 μm was increased (11.85 ± 0.76 puncta for WT versus 16.71 ± 1.14 for KO; n = 79 and n = 69, respectively; p = 0.0004; t test; Fig. 3F), and the size of PSD95 puncta was decreased in CPT1C-deficient neurons (1.00 ± 0.08 versus 0.61 ± 0.03; p < 0.0001; t test; Fig. 3G). In summary, our results demonstrate that the number of AMPARs in synaptic puncta is clearly reduced and that basal synaptic activity is compromised in CPT1C KO animals. Based on these findings, we asked whether these deficits could be explained because CPT1C was involved in the regulation of AMPAR expression. AMPAR protein levels were first analyzed in hippocampal cultured neurons over DIV from 4 to 16 DIV. GluA1 and GluA2 expression intensified in the same manner as CPT1C during neuronal maturation (Fig. 4A). However, AMPAR levels in CPT1C KO cultured neurons were clearly diminished when compared with WT cells (1.00 ± 0.02 GluA1 levels for WT versus 0.45 ± 0.08 for KO at 14 DIV; p = 0.0001; and 1.00 ± 0.07 GluA2 levels versus 0.46 ± 0.10; p = 0.0018; n = 5; t test; Fig. 4B). Other synaptic proteins, including PSD95, synapsin I, and GluN2A, remained unaltered (not significantly different at 14 DIV; n = 3; t test; Fig. 4, C and D). Previous results in our group demonstrated that the requirement of CPT1C for efficient spinogenesis is related with its ability to regulate ceramide levels; exogenous ceramide treatment rescues CPT1C KO phenotype on spine morphology. Therefore, we decided to analyze whether ceramide could reverse an AMPAR decrease in CPT1C-deficient neurons. Surprisingly, neither soluble C6 ceramide nor the treatment with the ceramide precursor serine increased GluA1 or GluA2 protein levels in KO cells (not significantly different; n = 6; t test; Fig. 4, E–H). In contrast, exogenous CPT1C expression using lentiviral vectors rescued the decrease in GluA1 and GluA2 protein levels in CPT1C-deficient neurons without affecting GluN2A levels (Fig. 4I). Moreover, CPT1C overexpression in cultured WT hippocampal neurons was able to increase AMPAR protein levels (0.85 ± 0.40 GluA1 levels for empty vector (EV) versus 2.59 ± 0.48 for CPT1C; 0.82 ± 0.33 GluA2 levels for EV versus 2.64 ± 0.67 for CPT1C; p < 0.05; n = 5 for non-infected, n = 3 for EV, and n = 5 for CPT1C; ANOVA; Fig. 4J), demonstrating the capacity of CPT1C to enhance AMPAR expression. Similar results were obtained in the hippocampi of CPT1C KO animals. First, we analyzed CPT1C expression during hippocampal development in WT mice. As seen in hippocampal cultures, total CPT1C protein levels were regulated with the same pattern expression as GluA1 and GluA2, which increases progressively up to adult age, as well as synapsin I, PSD95, and GluN2A (Fig. 5, A and B). To examine whether CPT1C was involved in the regulation of AMPAR expression, we measured total GluA1 and GluA2 protein levels in the hippocampi of adult CPT1C KO mice (Fig. 5C). CPT1C KO hippocampi showed lower levels of AMPARs when compared with WT mice (1.00 ± 0.04 GluA1 levels for WT versus 0.67 ± 0.07 for KO; p = 0.0012; 1.00 ± 0.05 GluA2 levels versus 0.67 ± 0.05; p = 0.0002; n = 9 for WT and n = 13 for KO; t test; Fig. 5D).

Indeed, the induction of telomere dysfunction in cells treated with AR-antagonists (Casodex or MDV3100) or AR-siRNA was associated with a dramatic increase in phosphorylation (activation) of ATM and its downstream effector Chk2 and the presenceof phosphorylated ATM at telomeres, indicating activation of DDR signaling at telomeres. Moreover, Casodex washout led to the reversal of telomere dysfunction, indicating repair of damaged telomeres. ATM inhibitor blocked ATM phosphorylation, induced PARP cleavage, abrogated cell cycle checkpoint activation and attenuated the formation of γH2AX foci at telomeres in AR-inactivated cells, suggesting that ATM inhibitor induces apoptosis in AR-inactivated cells by blocking the repair of damaged DNA at telomeres. Finally, colony formation assay revealed a dramatic decrease in the survival of cells co-treated with Casodex and ATM inhibitor as compared with those treated with either Casodex or ATM inhibitor alone.

https://openalex.org/W1883512222,"It has long been concerned how crop water use efficiency (WUE) responds to climate change. Most of existing researches have emphasized the impact of single climate factor but have paid less attention to the effect of developed agronomic measures on crop WUE. Based on the long-term field observations/experiments data, we investigated the changing responses of crop WUE to climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and agronomic practices (fertilization and cropping patterns) in the semi-arid area of northern China (SAC) during two periods, 1983-1999 and 2000-2010 (drier and warmer). Our results suggest that crop WUE was an intrinsical system sensitive to climate change and agronomic measures. Crops tend to reach the maximum WUE (WUEmax) in warm-dry environment while reach the stable minimum WUE (WUEmin) in warm-wet environment, with a difference between WUEmax and WUEmin ranging from 29.0%-55.5%. Changes in temperature and precipitation in the past three decades jointly enhanced crop WUE by 8.1%-30.6%. Elevated fertilizer and rotation cropping would increase crop WUE by 5.6-11.0% and 19.5-92.9%, respectively. These results indicate crop has the resilience by adjusting WUE, which is not only able to respond to subsequent periods of favorable water balance but also to tolerate the drought stress, and reasonable agronomic practices could enhance this resilience. However, this capacity would break down under impact of climate changes and unconscionable agronomic practices (e.g. excessive N/P/K fertilizer or traditional continuous cropping). Based on the findings in this study, a conceptual crop WUE model is constructed to indicate the threshold of crop resilience, which could help the farmer develop appropriate strategies in adapting the adverse impacts of climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2125653494,"The synarcual is a structure incorporating multiple elements of two or more anterior vertebrae of the axial skeleton, forming immediately posterior to the cranium. It has been convergently acquired in the fossil group ‘Placodermi’, in Chondrichthyes (Holocephali, Batoidea), within the teleost group Syngnathiformes, and to varying degrees in a range of mammalian taxa. In addition, cervical vertebral fusion presents as an abnormal pathology in a variety of human disorders. Vertebrae develop from axially arranged somites, so that fusion could result from a failure of somite segmentation early in development, or from later heterotopic development of intervertebral bone or cartilage. Examination of early developmental stages indicates that in the Batoidea and the ‘Placodermi’, individual vertebrae developed normally and only later become incorporated into the synarcual, implying regular somite segmentation and vertebral development. Here we show that in the holocephalan Callorhinchus milii, uniform and regular vertebral segmentation also occurs, with anterior individual vertebra developing separately with subsequent fusion into a synarcual. Vertebral elements forming directly behind the synarcual continue to be incorporated into the synarcual through growth. This appears to be a common pattern through the Vertebrata. Research into human disorders, presenting as cervical fusion at birth, focuses on gene misexpression studies in humans and other mammals such as the mouse. However, in chondrichthyans, vertebral fusion represents the normal morphology, moreover, taxa such Leucoraja (Batoidea) and Callorhinchus (Holocephali) are increasingly used as laboratory animals, and the Callorhinchus genome has been sequenced and is available for study. Our observations on synarcual development in three major groups of early jawed vertebrates indicate that fusion involves heterotopic cartilage and perichondral bone/mineralised cartilage developing outside the regular skeleton. We suggest that chondrichthyans have potential as ideal extant models for identifying the genes involved in these processes, for application to human skeletal heterotopic disorders."

Such discrepancies were never fully explained, but still it became accepted that KcsA behaves as a moderately voltage-dependent, K+-selective channel with low opening probability and the peculiar property of opening in response to intracellular acidic pH. Later on, however, different modes of KcsA activity have been reported, which differ greatly on their opening probability and channel kinetics (9Chakrapani S. Cordero-Morales J.F. Perozo E. A quantitative description of KcsA gating II: single-channel currents.J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 479-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was found that KcsA may also open at neutral pH when subjected to certain experimental conditions (10Zakharian E. Reusch R.N. Streptomyces lividans potassium channel KcsA is regulated by the potassium electrochemical gradient.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also, it has been proposed that a more “physiological” version of KcsA might correspond to a supramolecular complex in which the channels would coassemble with polyhydroxybutyrate and inorganic polyphosphates (11Zakharian E.

In our hands, purified KcsA reconstituted into giant liposomes made from asolectin phospholipids exhibits two major patterns of activity in patch-clamp recordings from excised, inside-out membrane patches: (i) a low opening probability (LOP) pattern, seen in ∼55% of the recordings, in which channel openings are scarce and result primarily from single channel events or from coupled gating of a few channels, and (ii) a high opening probability (HOP) pattern observed in the remaining 45% of the patches, in which the channels are opened most of the time and exhibit positive cooperativity through coupled gating of a larger number of channels (12Molina M.L.

Because abundant channel clusters were also detected in the giant liposomes, it was speculated that the different functional patterns could arise from “nonclustered” or “clustered” KcsA channels and that the assembly of such supramolecular entities would somehow determine changes in the integrated behavior of the channels involved. Interestingly, KcsA clusters have also been detected in vivo both in S. lividans and in Escherichia coli, suggesting that clusters may be the native form of KcsA in the bacterial membranes (13Hegermann J.

From the structural view point, KcsA is arranged as a homotetramer with subunits of 160 amino acids, each comprising N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains and two transmembrane α-helices, TM1 and TM2, connected by a short “pore” helix and a P-loop containing the characteristic TVGYG sequence of the selectivity filter in potassium channels.

These features include its folding, tetramerization, structural stability, and channel function and therefore make it extremely interesting to study the interactions involved (22Barrera F.N.

Here we report on the role of anionic phospholipids in determining the extent of KcsA clustering, which seemingly occurs as a consequence of competing lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions at the nonannular sites of the channel and brings about changes in the gating properties. In regard to the latter, our results suggest that such changes are mediated via the Trp67–Glu71–Asp80 inactivation triad within the channel structure and its bearing on the selectivity filter. Cholesterol (Chol) and asolectin (l-α-phosphatidylcholine from soybean type 2-S) were purchased from Sigma. DOPC, DOPG, PA, PC, PE, and PG, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Alexa Fluor® 647 C2-maleimide and 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiOC18(3)) were from Molecular Probes. DDM was from Calbiochem. The pT7–837KcsA containing the R64A-KcsA gene mutant was kindly donated by Professor A. Killian (Utrecht University, Utrecht, Holland). The R89A-KcsA mutant was obtained through site-directed mutagenesis, using the wild-type gene inserted into the pQE30 (Qiagen) plasmid as a template. The S22C-KcsA mutant was prepared as described previously (12Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernández A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. González-Ros J.M.

All mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Expression of the wild-type KcsA protein, S22C and R89A mutants were performed in E. coli M15 (pRep4) cells, whereas R64A mutant was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(λDE3).

Shortly before starting BN-PAGE, DDM-solubilized KcsA was incubated in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of the corresponding phospholipids as mixed micelles containing 5 mm DDM. Just before their application onto the gel, sample aliquots containing 10 μg of DDM-solubilized protein were mixed with 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G stock solution in 750 mm aminocaproic acid and 1 mm SDS to a final 4:1 (by weight) DDM to Coomassie ratio. Electrophoresis was initiated at 85 V for 30 min and then continued at 200 V for 2.5 h, at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie Blue G 250 (CCB) (29Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H.

All gels were scanned and analyzed with ImageQuant TL, version 2005 software (Molecular Dynamics). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared from (i) asolectin, (ii) PC:PG:Chol mixtures (both at 50:25:25 and 70:5:25 molar ratios), or (iii) PC:PA:Chol mixtures (both at 50:25:25 and 70:5:25 molar ratios), at 25 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl (reconstitution buffer) and stored in liquid N2 (30Riquelme G.

DDM-solubilized wild-type KcsA or mutant proteins were incubated for 30 min with the above vesicles previously resolubilized in 3 mm DDM at a lipid:tetrameric KcsA protein molar ratio of 500:1, and proteoliposomes were formed by detergent removal by gel filtration, as described (12Molina M.L.

Multilamellar giant liposomes (up to ∼100 μm in diameter) were prepared by submitting a mixture of the reconstituted vesicles from above (containing 50 μg of wild-type KcsA or mutants at a lipid to tetrameric protein molar ratio of 500:1) and either asolectin, PC:PA:Chol, or PC:PG:Chol lipid vesicles (25 mg of total lipids), to a cycle of partial dehydration/rehydration (12Molina M.L.

Cholesterol was included in the phospholipid mixtures to facilitate giant liposome formation and handling. The resulting giant liposomes have a final lipid:tetrameric protein molar ratio of 46,800:1. Standard, inside-out patch-clamp recordings (31Hamill O.P. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Patch-clamp studies of voltage-gated currents in identified neurons of the rat cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 48-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were carried out on excised patches from the giant liposomes, as reported previously (12Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernández A.M.

The pipette (extracellular) solution contained 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, and the bath (intracellular) solution contained 10 mm MES buffer, pH 4, 100 mm KCl. Voltage ramps or different holding potentials were routinely imposed on the membrane patches to record channel currents (see details in the figure legends). The extent of rectification of the I/V curves was assessed by determining the “rectification index,” calculated as the quotient between the whole outward and inward currents recorded during the voltage-ramp protocol. The sulfhydryl-containing mutant KcsA S22C was fluorescently labeled with a maleimide Alexa probe (Alexa Fluor® 647 C2-maleimide; Molecular Probes), as reported (12Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernández A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. González-Ros J.M. Clustering and coupled gating modulate the activity in KcsA, a potassium channel model.J. Biol.

Dehydration damage of domain-exhibiting supported bilayers: an AFM study on the protective effects of disaccharides and other stabilizing substances.Langmuir. 2005; 21: 6317-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, Alexa-labeled KcsA was reconstituted at 10,000:1, lipid to protein molar ratio in lipid vesicles of the indicated compositions. After a dilution to 0.7 mg/ml of lipid in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, the sample was bath-sonicated for ∼15 min to obtain small unilamellar vesicles. 150 μl of the sample were then placed on a freshly cleaved mica substrate glued to a glass coverslip within an open chamber. To induce vesicle fusion and SLB formation, 3 mm Ca2+ was added, rapidly diluted with 400 μl of buffer, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Then the chamber was rinsed thoroughly with prewarmed buffer to remove Ca2+ and nonfused vesicles. Control experiments to check for the homogeneity of lipid distribution in the SLBs were done always before measuring KcsA distribution (not shown). To do that, the fluorescent probe 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate was incorporated in the liposomes, by its addition to the lipid mixtures when in the chloroform:methanol (2:1) solution used in the initial stages of the liposome formation protocol (30Riquelme G. Lopez E. Garcia-Segura L.M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Giant liposomes: a model system in which to obtain patch-clamp recordings of ionic channels.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11215-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed on an laser scanning microscope Meta 510 system (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 40 × NA 1.2 UV-VIS-IR C Apochromat water immersion objective. SLB samples with Alexa-labeled KcsA were excited with the 633-nm line of a helium-neon laser, and the emitted light was filtered through a 650-nm long pass filter. In control experiments, DiO C18 (3Uysal S. Vásquez V. Tereshko V. Esaki K. Fellouse F.A. Sidhu S.S. Koide S. Perozo E. Kossiakoff A.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser, and the emitted light was filtered through a 505–550-nm band pass filter. Images were processed and analyzed with Scion Image (Scion Corp.). KcsA-DPPA complexes were built using the KcsA structure having cocrystallized lipids (2Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R.

The partial lipid structures seen in the crystal were used as a scaffold to build the entire DPPA lipid molecule. Lipid-protein contacts were optimized by energy minimization (see below). Modeling of KcsA in the open conformation was done by homology, using the crystal structure of the open calcium-gated potassium channel MthK as a template (33Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M.

The sequence alignment was made with CLUSTALW (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

The homology modeling was performed in the Swiss-Model protein modeling server (35Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL: An automated protein homology-modeling server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar) at the ExPASy Molecular Biology site under project mode. Structure preparation for modeling was made using DeepView, version 4.1 (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar).

This latter process involved an initial short steepest descent minimization to remove bumps. Next, we performed a simulated annealing minimization in which the simulation cell was slowly cooled toward 0 K by downscaling the atom velocities. The entire system was subject to an equilibration process before the molecular dynamics simulation. The equilibration consisted of an initial minimization of the fixed backbone atoms. Next, the restrained α-carbon atoms were minimized, and a short molecular dynamics (10 ps) minimization was performed to reduce the initial incorrect contacts and to fill the empty cavities. Finally, under periodic boundary conditions in the three coordinate directions, the full system was simulated at 310 K for 0.2 ns. All dynamic simulations were performed using Yasara (39Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Increasing the precision of comparative models with YASARA NOVA: a self-parameterizing force field.Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) with the force field AMBER03 (40Duan Y.

The above open KcsA model was used to predict dimeric KcsA-KcsA interactions. The docking prediction was accomplished with GRAMM-X v.1.2.0 using default conditions. The solutions were checked and filtered manually, discarding those without biological significance, and then evaluated in terms of energy. The final model chosen was that having the highest interaction energy and the lowest van der Waals clashes. Finally, we perform molecular dynamic simulation on the resulting dimeric KcsA, following the protocol stated above.

In this study, we measure the ATP turnover cycle of MalFGK2 in steady and pre-steady state conditions. We show that (i) the basal ATPase activity of MalFGK2 is very low because the cleavage of ATP is rate-limiting, (ii) the binding of open-state MalE to the transporter induces ATP cleavage but leaves release of Pi limiting, and (iii) the additional presence of maltose stimulates release of Pi, and therefore increases the overall ATP turnover cycle. We conclude that open-state MalE stabilizes MalFGK2 in the outward-facing conformation until maltose triggers return to the inward-facing state for substrate and Pi release. This concerted action explains why ATPase activity of MalFGK2 depends on maltose, and why MalE is essential for transport.

https://openalex.org/W2136138395,"Gastric cancer grows under a hypoxic environment. HIF-1α is known to play an important role in controlling the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria under hypoxic conditions. We previously established HIF-1α knockdown (KD) cells and control (SC) cells in the 58As9 gastric cancer cell line. In this study, we revealed that KD cells, but not SC cells, induced apoptosis under conditions of hypoxia (1% O2) due to excessive production of ROS. A quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expressions of ten genes, which are involved in the control mechanisms of ROS (including the Warburg effect, mitophagy, electron transport chain [ETC] modification and ROS scavenging), were regulated by HIF-1α. Moreover, the promotion of glucose uptake by glucose plus insulin (GI) treatment enhanced the apoptotic effect, which was accompanied by further ROS production in hypoxic KD cells. A Western blot analysis showed that the membranous expression of GLUT1 in KD cells was elevated by glucose and/or insulin treatments, indicating that the GI-induced glucose uptake is mediated by the increased translocation of GLUT1 on the cell membrane. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of HIF-1α knockdown (KD) plus GI was evaluated using a tumor xenograft model, where a hypoxic environment naturally exists. As a result, the GI treatment strongly inhibited the growth of the KD tumors whereby cell apoptosis was highly induced in comparison to the control treatment. In contrast, the growth of the SC tumors expressing HIF-1α was not affected by the GI treatment. Taken together, the results suggest that HIF-1α inhibition plus GI may be an ideal therapy, because the apoptosis due to the destruction of ROS homeostasis is specifically induced in gastric cancer that grows under a hypoxic environment, but not in the normal tissue under the aerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1801595551,"Synonymous mutations, such as I507-ATC→ATT, in deletion of Phe508 in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ΔF508 CFTR), the most frequent disease-associated mutant of CFTR, may affect protein biogenesis, structure, and function and contribute to an altered disease phenotype. Small-molecule drugs are being developed to correct ΔF508 CFTR. To understand correction mechanisms and the consequences of synonymous mutations, we analyzed the effect of mechanistically distinct correctors, corrector 4a (C4) and lumacaftor (VX-809), on I507-ATT and I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR biogenesis and function. C4 stabilized I507-ATT ΔF508 CFTR band B, but without considerable biochemical and functional correction. VX-809 biochemically corrected ∼10% of both of the variants, leading to stable, forskolin+3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)-activated whole-cell currents in the presence of the corrector. Omitting VX-809 during whole-cell recordings led to a spontaneous decline of the currents, suggesting posttranslational stabilization by VX-809. Treatment of cells with the C4+VX-809 combination resulted in enhanced rescue and 2-fold higher forskolin+IBMX-activated currents of both I507-ATT and I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR, compared with VX-809 treatment alone. The lack of an effect of C4 on I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR, but its additive effect in combination with VX-809, implies that C4 acted on VX-809-modified I507-ATC ΔF508 CFTR. Our results suggest that binding of C4 and VX-809 to ΔF508 CFTR is conformation specific and provide evidence that synonymous mutations can alter the drug sensitivity of proteins."

However, their applicability depends on obtaining both suitable large scale and cost effective cultures. One problem in the development of hPSC cultures is the vulnerability of these cells to undergo apoptosis or anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis) upon cellular detachment and dissociation (3Chen G.

This phenomenon is mediated by the ROCK signaling pathway, which is recognized to be the major pathway that prompts single cell mass mortality by phosphorylating cytoskeletal components and triggering actin-myosin contractility. Rho/ROCK pathway activation disrupts the balance between actin-myosin contractile forces and E-cadherin dependent cell-cell adhesion (3Chen G. Hou Z. Gulbranson D.R. Thomson J.A.

Recently it was demonstrated that a PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone, increased myosin light chain phosphatase activity independent of inhibition of RhoA/ROCK and thereby desensitized rat vascular smooth muscle to agonist signaling (9Atkins K.B.

Cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 95% humidity and passaged every 7 days. For dissociation as single cells, hPSCs were washed with PBS for 3 min then treated with 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C for 3 min and collected by gentle pipetting. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Calbiochem, 688000) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 10 μm (6Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B.

All small molecules were added to the culture medium for the first 24 h after the cells were replated. Subsequently, the cell cultures were continued in the absence of small molecules. To induce differentiation, hPSCs were grown in suspension as embryoid bodies in hPSC medium without basic FGF and small molecules for 2 weeks. The CHO-K1 cell line (Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran) was also used for transfection experiments. CHO cells were cultured and maintained as previously described (15Lachinani L. Ghaedi K. Tanhaei S.

We evaluated the effect of PPARγ activation on cloning efficiency of single dissociated single hPSCs [(number of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies/number of seeded cells) × 100] by analyzing the numbers of feeder-independent colonies. For this purpose single cells were plated into Matrigel-coated tissue culture dishes at a density of 60 × 103 hPSCs/well of a 6-well plate in hPSC medium. The cloning efficiency was calculated by ImageJ software version 1.4 (8Pakzad M. Totonchi M. Taei A. Seifinejad A. Hassani S.N. Baharvand H.

We used the following plasmids in this study: PPARγ-EGFP expression plasmid (16Ghasemi S. Ghaedi K. Nasr Eafahani M. Tanhaei S. Rabeei F. Karbalaii K. Baharvand H. Esmaili A. Intranuclear localization of EGFP-mouse PPARγ1 in bovine fibroblast cells.Yakhteh Medical Journal. 2010; 12: 97-104Google Scholar), PDSred-N1 (Clontech), RhoA V14, and PIP5K1α (kindly provided by Dr. Nicolai E. Savaskan, Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany). Co-transfection of plasmids into CHO cells was performed using Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen, 15338-100). The cell numbers and amount of plasmids for each transfection were determined based on the manufacturer's instructions. Two days post-transfection, we used the cells for further analyses. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 74004), and cDNA was synthesized starting with 1 μg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase and a hexamer primer (TaKaRa). Real-time (SYBR Green) PCR was performed in a thermal cycler Rotor gene 6000 (Corbett) according to the manufacturer's protocol (TaKaRa). The PCR mixture contained 10 μl of Rotor-Gene SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa), 3 pmol of each primer, and 25 ng of cDNA for each reaction in a final volume of 20 μl. All samples were assessed in relation to the levels of GAPDH expression as an internal control. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Real-time specific primer pairs were designated by Beacon Designer software (version 7.2) as obtained from Metabion (Planegg/Steinkirchen, Germany). The primer sequences are listed in Table 1.

Equal amount of sample proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (12% separating gel). Separated protein fractions were transferred onto a PVDF membrane after which the membrane was blocked overnight with 10% skim milk at 4 °C. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody in 2% skim milk for 2 h and secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature with several interval washings for 15 min with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The primary antibodies used were against β-catenin (Santa Cruz, SC-7963), PPARγ (Santa Cruz, SC-7273), E-cadherin (Abcam, ab76055), GSK3β (Santa Cruz, SC-7291), GSK3β-P (Santa Cruz, SC-373800), Tau (Sigma, T9450), MAP (Sigma, T9450), c-Myc (Santa Cruz, SC-764), PAX6 (Thermo, PIPA525970), SOX7 (Santa Cruz, SC-20093), and EOMES (Santa Cruz, SC-69269). GAPDH (Santa Cruz, MAB374, Chemicon) was used as an internal control. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako, P0447), HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma, A8919) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, SC2301). HRP-conjugated IgG bound to each protein band was visualized by an ECL Advance Western blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences, RPN2135). All measurements were performed in triplicate. The discontinuous sucrose gradient approach was used to isolate nuclear and plasma membrane fractions. At the initial step, we added a homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) that contained protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, 539134) to freshly harvested cells. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. After sonication and homogenization of the pellet by a tight glass homogenizer in homogenization buffer that contained protease inhibitor, the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min. At this step the pellet included the nucleus and plasma membrane. Next, the suspension was centrifuged on a sucrose buffer gradient (buffer A (0.3 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2) and buffer B (1.8 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2)) at 110,000 × g for 90 min. Both buffers contained protease inhibitor mixture. Finally, the nucleus fraction (pellet of the previous step) was washed with buffer A at 15,000 × g for 15 min. We used the Pierce™ Agarose ChIP kit (Life Technologies, Inc., 26156) according to the manufacturer's protocol to investigate PPARγ response element within β-catenin and E-cadherin promoters. Pierce co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP, Life Technologies, 26149) was performed to analyze β-catenin and E-cadherin interaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The colony formation assay was performed with an alkaline phosphatase kit (Sigma, 86R) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunostaining, colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, P6148) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by permeabilization with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8532) in PBS, blocked with secondary antibody-related host serum for 1 h, treated with the primary antibody for 1 h, and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h. Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-Oct4 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-5279), anti-Nanog (1:500, Sigma, N3088), anti-stage specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4 (1:100, Abcam, ab16287), anti-TRA-1–60 (1:100; Chemicon; MAB4360), anti-TRA-1–81 (1:100, Chemicon, MaB4381), anti-SSEA-3 (1:50, Chemicon, MaB4303), anti-PPARγ (1:200, Santa Cruz, SC-7273), anti-β-catenin (1:200, Santa Cruz, SC-7963), and anti-E-cadherin (1:200, Abcam, ab76055). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, A11004), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, A11001), TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50, Chemicon, T7782), and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50, sc-2078). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 mg/ml, Sigma, D8417) for visualization of the nuclei. The stained cells were analyzed with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan), and images were acquired with an Olympus DP70 camera (Olympus, Japan). For cell-cycle analysis, hPSCs seeded for 24 h were fixed in 70% ethanol. After washing, the cells were suspended in PBS that included RNase A and propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) solution. For identifying and examining proliferating cells, we incubated the cycling cells with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 h. After DNA denaturation, the cells were stained with monoclonal anti-BrdU (Sigma, B2531) as the primary antibody and IgM-FITC (Millipore, AP124F) as the secondary antibody. Apoptosis analysis was conducted at 24 h after cell seeding by using the following three protocols: Annexin V, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 activity. For annexin V analysis, cells were labeled with propidium iodide and Annexin V-FITC (IQ Products, IQP-120F) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the TUNEL assay, cells were stained to detect apoptotic nuclei by the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, G3250) according to the manufacturer's instructions, then analyzed by flow cytometry. Improvement in cellular viability was further confirmed by the caspase-3/7 activation assay as a cellular marker of apoptosis using a commercially available kit (APT403, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed by FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were processed according to the ModFit LT™ version 4.0 program. Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of RT-qPCR and Western blotting with three independent cultures were performed by Graphpad prism software version 6 and Image J software, respectively. The results were subsequently compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test or the t test when two independent groups were compared. The mean difference was significant at the p < 0.05 level. We took into consideration our previous findings (11Peymani M. Ghoochani A. Ghaedi K. Karamali F. Karbalaie K. Kiani-Esfahani A. Rabiee F. Nasr-Esfahani M.H. Baharvand H. Dual effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ on embryonic stem cell self-renewal in presence and absence of leukemia inhibitory factor.Eur J. Cell Biol. 2013; 92: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) of the positive effect of PPARγ activation on mouse embryonic stem cell proliferation to determine if a potent agonist of PPARγ could serve as a potential factor to improve hPSCs viability along with Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor). Pioglitazone, a highly specific PPARγ agonist, was added to the culture medium at various concentrations (2–16 μm) along with Y-27632 (Fig. 1, A and B) for the first 24 h after plating of dissociated single hPSCs. Subsequently the cells were cultured for 7 days. Only pioglitazone did not result in alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies in the same manner as DMSO alone (data not shown). According to the results, the 8 μm concentration of pioglitazone was the most efficient in terms of colony formation as detected by the numbers of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-positive colonies (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, this concentration was used for additional experimentation. To confirm that PPARγ activation led to enhanced cloning efficiency, we treated the cells simultaneously with Y-27632 and a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662). In this condition, a drop in colony formation was observed (p < 0.05, Fig. 1C). Of note, in two other hPSC lines we observed that single cells co-treated with Y-27632 plus pioglitazone had the best cloning efficiency, which was significantly reduced by the PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (Fig. 1C, at least p < 0.05). Therefore, treatment by Y-27632 plus pioglitazone on dissociated single hPSCs had a synergistic effect on colony formation compared with Y-27632 alone. Furthermore, due to universality of the PPARγ effect on cloning efficiency, we continued the other experiments with a hESC cell line, RH5. We sought to determine if the increase in cloning efficiency with Y-27632 plus pioglitazone could be attributed to a decreased rate of apoptosis or enhancement of proliferation. We used three distinct assays (annexin V, TUNEL, and caspase-3 activation) to evaluate apoptosis. The results showed a clearly evident significant decrease in the rate of apoptotic cells after Y-27632 treatment compared with untreated cells (at least p < 0.01; Fig. 2, A–C). However, co-treatment of the cell with Y-27632 and pioglitazone or GW9662 did not significantly change the rate of apoptotic cells. To validate if co-treatment of Y-27632 and pioglitazone increased the proliferation rate, we repeated the previous experiments and assessed the numbers of cells that were in S phase. Flow cytometry data showed no significant difference in S phase cell numbers co-treated with Y-27632 and pioglitazone compared with only Y-27632 (Fig. 2D, p > 0.05). The BrdU proliferation assay confirmed the same trend in proliferation rate (Fig. 2E). Therefore, cell preservation under this circumstance was possibly not due to reduced apoptosis or an increased proliferation rate. We proposed that adhesion alteration resulted in colony formation enhancement. Cytoskeletal components play a major role in cell-ECM/cell interactions which result in increasing viability. During cell dissociation cytoskeletal phosphorylation leads to dissociation induced apoptosis due to disruption of cytoskeletal components (4Ohgushi M. Matsumura M. Eiraku M. Murakami K. Aramaki T. Nishiyama A. Muguruma K. Nakano T. Suga H. Ueno M. Ishizaki T. Suemori H. Narumiya S. Niwa H. Sasai Y.

Long-term proliferation of human embryonic stem cell-derived neuroepithelial cells using defined adherent culture conditions.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this experiment we measured the transcript and protein levels of β-catenin and E-cadherin as cell-ECM/cell components and PPARγ in dissociated single hPSCs after 4 h. We detected no significant changes in mRNA expression in dissociated single cells and colonies (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, dissociation of hPSCs resulted in down-regulation of the protein contents of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PPARγ (Fig. 3, B and C). This was also demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 3D). Therefore, it seems that PPARγ was involved in repair of cell-ECM/cell interaction disruption. The role of E-cadherin and its associated molecule β-catenin in cell-cell interaction is critical for the survival and differentiation of hPSCs (18Li L. Bennett S.A. Wang L. Role of E-cadherin and other cell adhesion molecules in survival and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells.Cell Adh. Migr. 2012; 6: 59-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, changes in E-cadherin and β-catenin expression under pioglitazone treatment have been determined by protein level analysis and co-immunoprecipitation at 4 h post-treatment of dissociated single hPSCs. Co-treatment of Y-27632 and pioglitazone up-regulated E-cadherin and β-catenin proteins compared with Y-27632-treated cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, the PPARγ antagonist (GW-9962) reversed the conditions generated by pioglitazone. It has been reported that β-catenin performance in hPSCs is dependent on its subcellular localization (19Dietrich C. Scherwat J. Faust D. Oesch F. Subcellular localization of β-catenin is regulated by cell density.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, colony formation is a consequence of β-catenin localization in the membrane, whereas nuclear localization of β-catenin results in nuclear gene expression (20Prunier C. Hocevar B.A. Howe P.H. Wnt signaling: physiology and pathology.Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Hiroki O. Evolution of the cadherin-catenin complex.Subcell. Biochem. 2012; 60: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted immunofluorescence staining to study β-catenin subcellular localization after treatment of hPSCs with pioglitazone. Immunostaining data showed membrane localization of β-catenin in hPSCs (Fig. 4C). Next, we sought to determine whether plasma membrane localization of β-catenin increased upon pioglitazone treatment. Thus, Western blotting of plasma membrane and nuclear fractions at 4 h post-treatment of dissociated single hPSCs was performed. The subcellular plasma membrane fraction of β-catenin increased significantly in Y-27632 plus pioglitazone; however, the nuclear fraction showed no significant change (Fig. 4D). c-Myc and Tau proteins were used as positive controls for nuclear and plasma membrane proteins, respectively (Fig. 4D). We performed co-immunoprecipitation for β-catenin and subsequent Western blotting for E-cadherin to show if pioglitazone could also influence the interactions of E-cadherin and β-catenin. The result revealed that pioglitazone synergistically affected the assembly of E-cadherin and β-catenin (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, to evaluate whether Wnt signaling was involved in membrane-tethered β-catenin, we analyzed hPSC extracts for phospho-GSK3 (p-GSK3) by using a phospho-specific antibody that reacted with phosphorylated GSK3β,-ser9 (P-GSK3,-Ser-9). The activity of GSK3 is inhibited via phosphorylation of Ser-9 (22Ali A. Hoeflich K.P. Woodgett J.R. Glycogen synthase kinase-3: properties, functions, and regulation.Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2527-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We observed that the level of P-GSK3,-Ser-9 increased upon pioglitazone co-treatment with Y-27632 (Fig. 5A). As already depicted, there was an increased accumulation of β-catenin and E-cadherin proteins in the Y-27632"
https://openalex.org/W2115234786,"Hypothalamus is the highest center and the main crossroad of numerous homeostatic regulatory pathways including reproduction and energy metabolism. Previous reports indicate that some of these functions may be driven by the synchronized but distinct functioning of the left and right hypothalamic sides. However, the nature of interplay between the hemispheres with regard to distinct hypothalamic functions is still unclear. Here we investigated the metabolic asymmetry between the left and right hypothalamic sides of ovariectomized female rats by measuring mitochondrial respiration rates, a parameter that reflects the intensity of cell and tissue metabolism. Ovariectomized (saline injected) and ovariectomized+estrogen injected animals were fed ad libitum or fasted to determine 1) the contribution of estrogen to metabolic asymmetry of hypothalamus; and 2) whether the hypothalamic asymmetry is modulated by the satiety state. Results show that estrogen-priming significantly increased both the proportion of animals with detected hypothalamic lateralization and the degree of metabolic difference between the hypothalamic sides causing a right-sided dominance during state 3 mitochondrial respiration (St3) in ad libitum fed animals. After 24 hours of fasting, lateralization in St3 values was clearly maintained; however, instead of the observed right-sided dominance that was detected in ad libitum fed animals here appeared in form of either right- or left-sidedness. In conclusion, our results revealed estrogen- and satiety state-dependent metabolic differences between the two hypothalamic hemispheres in female rats showing that the hypothalamic hemispheres drive the reproductive and satiety state related functions in an asymmetric manner."
https://openalex.org/W1883079913,"Investors in stock market are usually greedy during bull markets and scared during bear markets. The greed or fear spreads across investors quickly. This is known as the herding effect, and often leads to a fast movement of stock prices. During such market regimes, stock prices change at a super-exponential rate and are normally followed by a trend reversal that corrects the previous over reaction. In this paper, we construct an indicator to measure the magnitude of the super-exponential growth of stock prices, by measuring the degree of the price network, generated from the price time series. Twelve major international stock indices have been investigated. Error diagram tests show that this new indicator has strong predictive power for financial extremes, both peaks and troughs. By varying the parameters used to construct the error diagram, we show the predictive power is very robust. The new indicator has a better performance than the LPPL pattern recognition indicator."
https://openalex.org/W2122790621,"To investigate the association of farm exposure and the development of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).One hundred eighty-nine well defined patients with AAV (n = 119 with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA], n = 48 with microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], n = 22 patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA]) and 190 controls (n = 119 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, n = 71 with large vessel vasculitis) were interrogated using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were occupation, farm exposure, contact to different livestock, participation in harvesting, residence next to a farm, MRSA status, and contact to domestic pets at disease onset or ever before. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] were calculated for each item.Univariate analysis revealed a strong association of AAV with regular farm exposure; OR 3.44 [95%CI 1.43-8.27]. AAV was also associated with regular contact to cattle 4.30 (1.43-8.27), pigs 2.75 (1.12-6.75) and MRSA carriage 3.38 (1.11-10.3). This association was stronger in the subgroup of GPA patients. OR in this group for farm exposure was 4.97; [2.02-12.2], for cattle 6.71 [95% CI 2.19-20.7], for pigs 4.34 [1.75-10.9], and MRSA carriage 5.06 [1.62-15.8]). There was no significant association of MPA or EGPA with these parameters.A significant association between farm exposure or farm animal exposure and AAV especially in the subgroup of patients with GPA has been identified. This suggests that these entities are distinct and have different triggers for the immune process."
https://openalex.org/W2238663409,"All type III secretion systems (T3SS) harbor a member of the YscU/FlhB family of proteins that is characterized by an auto-proteolytic process that occurs at a conserved cytoplasmic NPTH motif. We have previously demonstrated that YscUCC, the C-terminal peptide generated by auto-proteolysis of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YscU, is secreted by the T3SS when bacteria are grown in Ca(2+)-depleted medium at 37 °C. Here, we investigated the secretion of this early T3S-substrate and showed that YscUCC encompasses a specific C-terminal T3S signal within the 15 last residues (U15). U15 promoted C-terminal secretion of reporter proteins like GST and YopE lacking its native secretion signal. Similar to the classical N-terminal secretion signal, U15 interacted with the ATPase YscN. Although U15 is critical for YscUCC secretion, deletion of the C-terminal secretion signal of YscUCC did neither affect Yop secretion nor Yop translocation. However, these deletions resulted in increased secretion of YscF, the needle subunit. Thus, these results suggest that YscU via its C-terminal secretion signal is involved in regulation of the YscF secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1982252147,"PO43- and SiO32- are often used as modifier to improve stability and aggregating ability of the iron-base coagulants, however, there are few reports about their detailed comparison between the coagulation performance and mechanisms. In this study, three coagulants—polyferric phosphoric sulfate (PFPS), polysilicon ferric sulfate (PFSS), and polyferric sulfate (PFS) were synthesized; their structure and morphology were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). Alkali titration and Ferron species analysis were employed to investigate the hydrolysis performance and species distribution. Jar test was conducted to measure their coagulation behaviors at different dosage, pH, and temperatures in which the flocs properties were measured. The results showed that a number of new compounds were formed due to the presence of PO43- and SiO32-. Moreover, PFPS and PFSS had similar level in Fea as well as Feb. Among them, PFPS produced more multi-core iron atoms polymer and content of Feb, and the formed flocs were larger and denser. It exhibited superior coagulation performance in terms of turbidity reduction, UV254 removal and residual ferric concentration. Jar test and floc breakage/regrowth experiments indicated other than charge neutrality, the dominated mechanism involved in PFSS was the adsorption between polysilicic acid and solution particle, while PFPS was sweeping, entrapment/adsorption resulting from larger polymer colloid of Fe-P chemistry bond."
https://openalex.org/W2145243555,"Pretreatment serum levels of interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10, CXCL10) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) predict treatment response in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The association between functional genetic polymorphisms of CXCL10 and DPP4 and treatment outcome has not previously been studied. This study aimed to determine the association between genetic variations of CXCL10 and DPP4 and the outcome of treatment with pegylated interferon-α (PEG-IFN-α) based therapy in Thai patients with CHC. 602 Thai patients with CHC treated using a PEG-IFN-α based regimen were genotyped for CXCL10 rs56061981 G>A and IL28B rs12979860 C>T. In addition, in patients infected with CHC genotype 1, DPP4 (rs13015258 A>C, rs17848916 T>C, rs41268649 G>A, and rs 17574 T>C) were genotyped. Correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms, genotype, and treatment response were analyzed. The rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) was higher for the CC genotype of IL28B rs12979860 polymorphisms than for non-CC in both genotype 1 (60.6% vs. 29.4%, P < 0.001) and non-genotype 1 (69.4% vs. 49.1%, P < 0.05) CHC. SVR was not associated with the CXCL10 gene variant in all viral genotypes or DPP4 gene polymorphisms in viral genotype1. Multivariate analysis revealed IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype (OR = 3.12; 95% CI, 1.72-5.67; P < 0.001), hepatitis C virus RNA < 400,000 IU/ml (OR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.22-3.99, P < 0.05), age < 45 years (OR = 2.03; 95% CI, 1.11-3.68; P < 0.05), and liver fibrosis stage 0-1 (OR = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01-2.65, P < 0.05) were independent factors for SVR. Unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 CT or TT genotypes with the CXCL10 rs56061981 non-GG genotype were associated with a higher SVR than GG genotype (66.7% vs. 33.0%, P = 0.004) in viral genotype 1. In Thai CHC genotype 1 infected patients with an unfavorable IL28B rs12979860 CT/TT genotype, the complementary CXCL10 polymorphism strongly enhances prediction of treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W1918526960,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) assembly is still poorly understood. It is thought that trafficking of the HCV core protein to the lipid droplet (LD) surface is essential for its multimerization and association with newly synthesized HCV RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid. We carried out a mapping analysis of several complete HCV genomes of all genotypes, and found that the genotype 2 JFH-1 core protein contained 10 residues different from those of other genotypes. The replacement of these 10 residues of the JFH-1 strain sequence with the most conserved residues deduced from sequence alignments greatly increased virus production. Confocal microscopy of the modified JFH-1 strain in cell culture showed that the mutated JFH-1 core protein, C10M, was present mostly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, but not at the surface of the LDs, even though its trafficking to these organelles was possible. The non-structural 5A protein of HCV was also redirected to ER membranes and colocalized with the C10M core protein. Using a Semliki forest virus vector to overproduce core protein, we demonstrated that the C10M core protein was able to form HCV-like particles, unlike the native JFH-1 core protein. Thus, the substitution of a few selected residues in the JFH-1 core protein modified the subcellular distribution and assembly properties of the protein. These findings suggest that the early steps of HCV assembly occur at the ER membrane rather than at the LD surface. The C10M-JFH-1 strain will be a valuable tool for further studies of HCV morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1958070937,"Phenotypic differences between species are driven by changes in gene expression and, by extension, by modifications in the regulation of the transcriptome. Investigation of mammalian transcriptome divergence has been restricted to analysis of bulk gene expression levels and gene-internal splicing. Using allele-specific expression analysis in inter-strain hybrids of Mus musculus, we determined the contribution of multiple cellular regulatory systems to transcriptome divergence, including: alternative promoter usage, transcription start site selection, cassette exon usage, alternative last exon usage, and alternative polyadenylation site choice. Between mouse strains, a fifth of genes have variations in isoform usage that contribute to transcriptomic changes, half of which alter encoded amino acid sequence. Virtually all divergence in isoform usage altered the post-transcriptional regulatory instructions in gene UTRs. Furthermore, most genes with isoform differences between strains contain changes originating from multiple regulatory systems. This result indicates widespread cross-talk and coordination exists among different regulatory systems. Overall, isoform usage diverges in parallel with and independently to gene expression evolution, and the cis and trans regulatory contribution to each differs significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1845923298,"In August 2012, a phone call from Scotland told me that my sister had been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. Six weeks later she was dead. In between was a blur of travel, family tensions, and—one bright spot—making my sister laugh one more time. But my sharpest memory of those weeks is the helplessness of sitting in a hospital office learning that estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells in my sister's body had metastasized to her bones, lungs, and brain. We could make her comfortable, the doctor said. That was it.

> “My decision has been to grab life—now.” 

When I learned about my sister's cancer, I was in the midst of a career transition—the second in my professional life. Back in my 30s, I had decided to leave the bench because I felt I could have a greater impact on the human condition as a medical research foundation administrator than I could as a decent, but not great, neuroscientist. For 6 years, I was the chief scientific officer of a foundation that researched drug treatments for benign but deforming tumors that could become malignant. I was the one sitting at the other end of the table, facing people who were relying on science to change, and possibly save, the life of their loved one. “We are going to get there,” I would say. “We will find drugs that will work.” I truly believed it.

I got the news about my sister after my husband and I had taken the radical step of moving from a city-centered life to the rural one we had fallen in love with. I was working from our new home, consulting for cancer foundations and walking my dog in the woods at lunchtime. For the first time, my career had slowed down. I was quietly torn between fully embracing this change and returning to the career fast track, but I couldn't quite figure out what it was that I missed. Was it the prestige, the salary, or leading the charge to find cancer treatments? Traveling to our annual international conference 6 years straight (always at the time of my June wedding anniversary)? Strategizing with 30 researchers and clinicians about curing brain tumors (which caused me to miss a celebration dear to my in-laws)?

After the phone call from Scotland, I emailed my sister's medical reports to many of the doctors I'd worked with while at the foundation, in the hope they could help. But their responses, though sensitive and thoughtful, could only try to prepare me for my big sister's death at age 56.

First, the helplessness grew. Then the anger: Why was hospice the only option she had? Weren't there off-label drugs or clinical trials? Shouldn't I know this? Had my sister been in denial? How could she not know she was riddled with cancer? She'd feared breast exams, so she didn't get them. We'd argued about that, and about her smoking. Eventually, my anger gave way to resignation: Her cancer had simply eluded the options science had to offer.

We knew my mother's large family had a history of breast and ovarian cancer, and one cousin had a BRCA1 mutation. But it wasn't until after my sister's death that I investigated and mapped the family cancer tree. When my gynecologist saw it, she said wow. We'll never know if my sister had a BRCA1 mutation, but the summer after she died I learned that I did. The decision to have prophylactic surgery was easy.

Science may have helped me protect my health, but I no longer assume that we'll have translated enough science into better drugs for cancer if I ever need them. Meanwhile, this difficult couple of years has helped me make peace with my decision to abandon the high-profile career ladder. Just a year before she died, my sister had retired and she was looking forward to freedom. So my decision has been to grab life—now. At 50, I finally have a work-life balance. I found a job in mental health administration where I can make an intellectual contribution, and which also allows me to go home and live life. I have given enough to the “cures” cause. It is a long road, and it is time for others to lead the way.
