(ii) What colors do they see? A number of experiments were performed on the first question. First, luminosity curves were determined on three groups of subjects, consisting respectively of five protanopes, six deuteranopes, and seven normal individuals. As compared with normal subjects, protanopes show a loss of luminosity in the red, whereas deuteranopes show a loss in the blue-to-green region of the spectrum (See 10). Second, we examined the luminosity curves of a subject whose right eye is classifiable (on the basis of color-mixture determinations) as normal and whose left eye is classifiable as dichromatic. (The hue discrimination curve for her dichromatic eye seemed comparable to the curve of the usual deuteranope except in the violet, where it manifested relatively good discrimination.) The luminosity function for this subject's dichromatic eye, determined by data on threshold and flicker, exhibits the same type of luminosity loss in the blue and green regions of the spectrum as was shown by our group of six deuteranopes. Only unilaterally dichromatic subjects can tell us how colors seen by a dichromatic eye appear to a normal eye. In the color-blind eye, our unilaterally dichromatic subject sees wavelengths below and above her neutral (""grey"") point (which occurs at 502 mmicro) as, respectively, a blue equivalent to about 470 mmicro and a yellow equivalent to about 570 mmicro in her normal eye. The results on (i) luminosity loss and (ii) the seeing of wavelengths above 502 mmicro as yellow are considered theoretically. The seeing of yellow by deuteranopes and protanopes may be accounted for by an idea based on Leber-Fick transmation theory. It is proposed that the characteristic sensitivities of the red and green receptors become similar while no change takes place in their central brain connections. Losses may be introduced into the transformed sensitivity curves to indicate appropriate degrees of luminosity deficit for deuteranopes and protanopes."

Blackening occurred only when hydrogen sulphide, was produced by these organisms, some of which formed it anaerobically but others aerobically. Bromfield1 showed that hydrogen sulphide was produced by several strains of Bacillus megatterium in apparently well-aerated soils. These results suggested that sulphides in soil may reduce ferric phosphate to black ferrous sulphide and release available phosphate."

When intensity increases, the pupil contracts. The resultant effect of light falling on the retina can be re- solved into two factors : ( i) an increase due to increase in applied intensity and (ii) a decrease due to contraction of the pupil.

Oscillations are also a common pathoJogical al;mormality in a wide variety of neurological diseases and are manifested in such 'clinical signs as tremor, ataxia, clonus, and nystagmus. This report indicates how a biological system has been analyzed by linear servo- analytic methods and experimentally jus- tifies this approach by quantitatively verifying a prediction. The pupil response to light-an exam- ple of neurological servosystem- has been studied by means of servoanalytic concepts and techniques (I). A sinu- soidally varying intensity of light was ap- plied, and the pupil area was continu- l - 9:o PlfAse; o.:G,s SHIFT-- Fig. 1. Nyquist diagram of pupil response. This is a vector plot of gain and phase shift. The scale of the modulus is shown, and a few frequencies are indicated. The curve is derived from fitted Jines from gain and phase frequency-response graphs, while the points are experimental. G(s) =0.!6e-O.lSs/(1 +O.ls)s was computed from data graphically dis- played in Fig. 1. This, the Nyquist dia- gram, is a vector plot of the relationship between gain and phase shift at various frequencies. For example, at 1.2 cy/sec, the gain is 0.12, with a phase lag of 180°. This gain means that the pupil compen- sates for 12 percent of the change in ap- plied light intensity. If the gain were to be increased to 1.0 or more, the system would become un- stable, and the pupil would oscillate at its natural frequency-that is, the fre- quency at which the phase lag is 180°. From the figure we see that this fre- quency is 1.2 cy/sec. Thus, from our servoanalysis of the normal, low-gain, stable pupil system, we are led to predict that a large increase in gain would pro- duce sustained oscillations and that the frequency of these oscillations would be 1.2 cy/sec (72 cy/min) . A test of the validity of the servoanalytic method would be the production of pupil oscil- lations in this manner and at the pre- dicted frequency. Observations which comprise such a test are already avail- able for evaluation. Clinical studies have been reported in which sustained oscillations of the pupil have been produced and in which the frequency of the oscillations has been measured. Stern (2) pointed out that a series of oscillations of the pupil could be induced by imaging a small point of light just on the margin of the pupil. This causes the iris to contract, and all the light is cut off in the early phase of con- traction. The iris therefore redilates, and full light intensity again enters the eye. The gain is thus increased to more than 1.0, and sustained oscillations result. Campbell and Whiteside (3) made a careful study of parameters affecting this induced pupil oscillation, using quanti- tative techniques on a group of normal subjects. A third report is that of Wybar ( 4), who studied a large number of nor- mal subjects and also patients with mul- tiple sclerosis (5) . In Table l the fre- quencies of the sustained oscillation ob- served are summarized. There is good agreement between the frequency of pupil oscillations observed in normal subjects and our prediction. Further experiments have been carried out by Stark and Baker ( 6) in which the transfer function of the pupil system has Table 1.

For example, when the 180°-phase cross-over frequency was changed from 1.5 to 0.9 cy/sec, the high- gain oscillation frequency shifted in a parallel fashion from 1.5 to 1.0 cy/sec The qualitative value of the servo- analytic approach is demonstrated by the clarification introduced through explana- tion of the natu re of these pupil oscil- lations. The quantitative nature of the method is illustrated by the accuracy of the prediction ( 7) . LA WREN CE STARK ToM N.

It is interest.ing to note that osci llation of the pupil in the multiple sclerosis group differs from that in the normal groups in mean fre- quency. This difference must be a result or a change in system parameters produced by the neurological lesions. 6. L. Stark and F. Baker, unpublished. 7.

There seems to me to be a factor ignored in classical theory that may explain some of these discrepancies."
