The test was made by the thiocholine method of Koelle and Friedenwald3. Recent development of the diver technique for quantitative determination of cholinesterase activity in individual cells4,5 has made it possible to record quantitatively the observed histochemical reaction of the end-plates after denervation."

https://openalex.org/W1975887341,RECENT histochemical studies have demonstrated that aldosterone increases phosphatase activity in the kidney of rats1. The present communication records the influence of aldosterone monoacetate and deoxycorticosterone acetate on alkaline phosphatase activity of the liver of rats.
