https://openalex.org/W3197328793,"Abstract The efficacy of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset ( NCT04348656 ). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. In total, 940 patients were randomized, and 921 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) patients in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) patients in the standard of care arm—relative risk (RR) = 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94–1.43, P = 0.18). Patients in the convalescent plasma arm had more serious adverse events (33.4% versus 26.4%; RR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.02–1.57, P = 0.034). The antibody content significantly modulated the therapeutic effect of convalescent plasma. In multivariate analysis, each standardized log increase in neutralization or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity independently reduced the potential harmful effect of plasma (odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% CI 0.57–0.95 and OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.87, respectively), whereas IgG against the full transmembrane spike protein increased it (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.14–2.05). Convalescent plasma did not reduce the risk of intubation or death at 30 d in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with unfavorable antibody profiles could be associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to standard care."
https://openalex.org/W3176993778,"We present evidence for multiple independent origins of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses sampled from late 2020 and early 2021 in the United Kingdom. Their genomes carry single-nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern but lack the full complement of lineage-defining mutations. Instead, the remainder of their genomes share contiguous genetic variation with non-B.1.1.7 viruses circulating in the same geographic area at the same time as the recombinants. In four instances, there was evidence for onward transmission of a recombinant-origin virus, including one transmission cluster of 45 sequenced cases over the course of 2 months. The inferred genomic locations of recombination breakpoints suggest that every community-transmitted recombinant virus inherited its spike region from a B.1.1.7 parental virus, consistent with a transmission advantage for B.1.1.7’s set of mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3196873101,"Bangladesh govt. launched a nationwide vaccination drive against SARS-CoV-2 infection from early February 2021. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh. In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. At the start of the survey, there was a detailed consent section that explained the study’s intent, the types of questions we would ask, the anonymity of the study, and the study’s voluntary nature. The survey only continued when a respondent consented, and the answers were provided by the respondents themselves. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 605 eligible respondents took part in this survey (population size 1630046161 and required sample size 591) with an age range of 18 to 100. A large proportion of the respondents are aged less than 50 (82%) and male (62.15%). The majority of the respondents live in urban areas (60.83%). A total of 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety or COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be exposed to the actual scientific facts."
https://openalex.org/W3194965953,"Clinical applications of precision oncology require accurate tests that can distinguish true cancer-specific mutations from errors introduced at each step of next-generation sequencing (NGS). To date, no bulk sequencing study has addressed the effects of cross-site reproducibility, nor the biological, technical and computational factors that influence variant identification. Here we report a systematic interrogation of somatic mutations in paired tumor-normal cell lines to identify factors affecting detection reproducibility and accuracy at six different centers. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), we evaluated the reproducibility of different sample types with varying input amount and tumor purity, and multiple library construction protocols, followed by processing with nine bioinformatics pipelines. We found that read coverage and callers affected both WGS and WES reproducibility, but WES performance was influenced by insert fragment size, genomic copy content and the global imbalance score (GIV; G > T/C > A). Finally, taking into account library preparation protocol, tumor content, read coverage and bioinformatics processes concomitantly, we recommend actionable practices to improve the reproducibility and accuracy of NGS experiments for cancer mutation detection."
https://openalex.org/W3198490237,"Multiple distinct types of skeletal progenitors have been shown to contribute to endochondral bone development and maintenance. However, the division of labor and hierarchical relationship between different progenitor populations remain undetermined. Here we developed dual-recombinase fate-mapping systems to capture the skeletal progenitor transition during postnatal bone formation. We showed that postnatal osteoblasts arose primarily from chondrocytes before adolescence and from Lepr+ bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after adolescence. This transition occurred in the diaphysis during adolescence and progressively spread to the metaphysis. The osteoblast-forming Lepr+ BMSCs derived primarily from fetal Col2+ cells. Conditional deletion of Runx2 from perinatal chondrocytes and adult Lepr+ BMSCs impaired bone lengthening and thickening, respectively. Forced running increased osteoblast formation by perinatal chondrocytes but not by adult Lepr+ BMSCs. Thus, the short-term developmental skeletal progenitors generated the long-term adult skeletal progenitors. They sequentially control the growth and maintenance of endochondral bones."
https://openalex.org/W3198430125,"Safety at work, both physical and psychological, plays a central role for workers and organizations during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19. Building on the job demands-resources (JD-R) model applied to safety at work, in this study we proposed that the perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 at work can be conceptualized as a job demand (i.e., a risk factor for work-related stress), whereas those characteristics of the job (physical and psychosocial) that help workers to reduce or manage this risk can be conceived as job resources (i.e., protective factors). We hypothesized that the perceived risk of being infected at work is positively associated with emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, we hypothesized that job resources, in terms of safety systems, communication, decision-making, situational awareness, fatigue management, and participation in decision-making, are negatively associated with emotional exhaustion. We also hypothesized that job resources buffer the association between perceived risk and emotional exhaustion. Overall, 358 workers (mean age = 36.3±12.2 years) completed a self-report questionnaire, and the hypothesized relationships were tested using moderated multiple regression. Results largely supported our predictions. The perceived risk of being infected at work was positively associated with emotional exhaustion, whereas all the job resources were negatively associated with it. Furthermore, safety systems, communication, decision-making, and participation in decision-making buffered the relationship between the perceived risk of being infected at work and emotional exhaustion. In a perspective of prevention and health promotion, this study suggested that organizations should reduce the potential risk of being infected at work, whenever possible. At same time, those characteristics of the job that can help workers to reduce or manage the risk of infection should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3196953684,"The lack of samples for generating standardized DNA datasets for setting up a sequencing pipeline or benchmarking the performance of different algorithms limits the implementation and uptake of cancer genomics. Here, we describe reference call sets obtained from paired tumor–normal genomic DNA (gDNA) samples derived from a breast cancer cell line—which is highly heterogeneous, with an aneuploid genome, and enriched in somatic alterations—and a matched lymphoblastoid cell line. We partially validated both somatic mutations and germline variants in these call sets via whole-exome sequencing (WES) with different sequencing platforms and targeted sequencing with >2,000-fold coverage, spanning 82% of genomic regions with high confidence. Although the gDNA reference samples are not representative of primary cancer cells from a clinical sample, when setting up a sequencing pipeline, they not only minimize potential biases from technologies, assays and informatics but also provide a unique resource for benchmarking ‘tumor-only’ or ‘matched tumor–normal’ analyses. Tumor–normal paired DNA samples from a breast cancer cell line and a matched lymphoblastoid cell line enable calibration of clinical sequencing pipelines and benchmarking ‘tumor-only’ or ‘matched tumor–normal’ analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3198444904,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake tailors the strength of stimulation of plasma membrane phospholipase C-coupled receptors to that of cellular bioenergetics. However, how Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) shapes receptor-evoked interorganellar Ca2+ signaling is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout, subcellular Ca2+ imaging, and mathematical modeling to show that MCU is a universal regulator of intracellular Ca2+ signaling across mammalian cell types. MCU activity sustains cytosolic Ca2+ signaling by preventing Ca2+-dependent inactivation of store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels and by inhibiting Ca2+ extrusion. Paradoxically, MCU knockout (MCU-KO) enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ responses to store depletion. Physiological agonist stimulation in MCU-KO cells led to enhanced frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ refilling, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor for activated T cells transcription factors, and cell proliferation, without altering inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor activity. Our data show that MCU has dual counterbalancing functions at the cytosol-mitochondria interface, whereby the cell-specific MCU-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ clearance and buffering capacity of mitochondria reciprocally regulate interorganellar Ca2+ transfer and nuclear factor for activated T cells nuclear translocation during receptor-evoked signaling. These findings highlight the critical dual function of the MCU not only in the acute Ca2+ buffering by mitochondria but also in shaping endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic Ca2+ signals that regulate cellular transcription and function."
https://openalex.org/W3196870915,"Modern brain-machine interfaces can return function to people with paralysis, but current upper extremity brain-machine interfaces are unable to reproduce control of individuated finger movements. Here, for the first time, we present a real-time, high-speed, linear brain-machine interface in nonhuman primates that utilizes intracortical neural signals to bridge this gap. We created a non-prehensile task that systematically individuates two finger groups, the index finger and the middle-ring-small fingers combined. During online brain control, the ReFIT Kalman filter could predict individuated finger group movements with high performance. Next, training ridge regression decoders with individual movements was sufficient to predict untrained combined movements and vice versa. Finally, we compared the postural and movement tuning of finger-related cortical activity to find that individual cortical units simultaneously encode multiple behavioral dimensions. Our results suggest that linear decoders may be sufficient for brain-machine interfaces to execute high-dimensional tasks with the performance levels required for naturalistic neural prostheses."
https://openalex.org/W3197634440,"Neoantigen peptides arising from genetic alterations may serve as targets for personalized cancer vaccines and as positive predictors of response to immune checkpoint therapy. Mutations in genes regulating RNA splicing are common in hematological malignancies leading to dysregulated splicing and intron retention (IR). In this study, we investigated IR as a potential source of tumor neoantigens in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and the relationship of IR-induced neoantigens (IR-neoAg) with clinical outcomes. MM-specific IR events were identified in RNA-sequencing data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study after removing IR events that also occurred in normal plasma cells. We quantified the IR-neoAg load by assessing IR-induced novel peptides that were predicted to bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. We found that high IR-neoAg load was associated with poor overall survival in both newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients. Further analyses revealed that poor outcome in MM patients with high IR-neoAg load was associated with high expression levels of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules and elevated interferon signaling activity. We also found that MM cells exhibiting high IR levels had lower MHC-II protein abundance and treatment of MM cells with a spliceosome inhibitor resulted in increased MHC-I protein abundance. Our findings suggest that IR-neoAg may represent a novel biomarker of MM patient clinical outcome and further that targeting RNA splicing may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent MM immune escape and promote response to checkpoint blockade."

https://openalex.org/W3198343668,"COVID-19 in humans is caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the beta family of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10-15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2-3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the ""cold chain"" transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS-CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern."
https://openalex.org/W3196302131,"In this study we compared two predictions of COVID-19 cases in the Kingdom Saudi Arabia (KSA) using pre-and post-relaxation of lockdown period data to provide an insight regarding rational exit strategies. We also applied these projections to understand economic costs versus health benefit of lockdown measures.We analyzed open access data on COVID-19 cases from March 6 to January 16, 2021 in the KSA. To understand the epidemic projection during the pre- and post-lockdown period, we used two types of modeling: the SIR model, and the time series model. We also estimated the costs and benefits of lockdown- QALY gained compared to the costs of lockdown considering the payment threshold of the Government.Prediction using lockdown period data suggested that the epidemic might slow down significantly after 109 thousand cases and end on October 6, 2020. However, analysis with latest data after easing lockdown measures suggested that epidemic might be close to an end on October 28, 2021 with 358 thousand cases. The peak has also been shifted from May 18, 2020 to Jun 24, 2020. While earlier model predicted a steady growth in mid-June, the revised model with latest data predicted it in mid-August. In addition, we estimated that 4986 lives would have been saved if lockdown continued but the cost per life saved would be more than $378 thousand, which is way above not only the KSA threshold, but also the threshold of any other highly advanced economies such as the UK and the USA.Our results suggest that relaxation of lockdown measures negatively impacts the epidemic. However, considering the negative impact of prolong lockdown measures on health and economy, countries must decide on the best timing and strategy to exit from such measures to safely return to normal life with minimum loss of lives and economy considering its economic and health systems' capacity. Instead of focusing only on health, a balanced approach taking economy under consideration is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3197407476,"Obesity alters skeletal muscle lipidome and promotes myopathy, but it is unknown whether aberrant muscle lipidome contributes to the reduction in skeletal muscle contractile force-generating capacity. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses of mouse skeletal muscle revealed a very strong positive correlation between the abundance of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), a class of lipids that is known to be downregulated with obesity, with maximal tetanic force production. The level of lyso-PC is regulated primarily by lyso-PC acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), which acylates lyso-PC to form phosphatidylcholine. Tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of LPCAT3 (LPCAT3-MKI) was sufficient to reduce muscle lyso-PC content in both standard chow diet- and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed conditions. Strikingly, the assessment of skeletal muscle force-generating capacity ex vivo revealed that muscles from LPCAT3-MKI mice were weaker regardless of diet. Defects in force production were more apparent in HFD-fed condition, where tetanic force production was 40% lower in muscles from LPCAT3-MKI compared to that of control mice. These observations were partly explained by reductions in the cross-sectional area in type IIa and IIx fibers, and signs of muscle edema in the absence of fibrosis. Future studies will pursue the mechanism by which LPCAT3 may alter protein turnover to promote myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3198274847,"The functional activity and differentiation potential of cells are determined by their interactions with surrounding cells. Approaches that allow unbiased characterization of cell states while at the same time providing spatial information are of major value to assess this environmental influence. However, most current techniques are hampered by a tradeoff between spatial resolution and cell profiling depth. Here, we develop a photocage-based technology that allows isolation and in-depth analysis of live cells from regions of interest in complex ex vivo systems, including primary human tissues. The use of a highly sensitive 4-nitrophenyl(benzofuran) cage coupled to a set of nanobodies allows high-resolution photo-uncaging of different cell types in areas of interest. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of spatially defined CD8+ T cells is used to exemplify the feasibility of identifying location-dependent cell states. The technology described here provides a valuable tool for the analysis of spatially defined cells in diverse biological systems, including clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W3198469597,"Background Central to measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV is understanding the role of loss of access to essential HIV prevention and care services created by clinic and community-based organization closures. In this paper, we use a comprehensive list of HIV prevention services in four corridors of the US heavily impacted by HIV, developed as part of a large RCT, to illustrate the potential impact of service closure on LGBTQ+ youth. Methods We identified and mapped LGBTQ+ friendly services offering at least one of the following HIV-related services: HIV testing; STI testing; PrEP/PEP; HIV treatment and care; and other HIV-related services in 109 counties across four major interstate corridors heavily affected by HIV US Census regions: Pacific (San Francisco, CA to San Diego, CA); South-Atlantic (Washington, DC to Atlanta, GA); East-North-Central (Chicago, IL to Detroit, MI); and East-South-Central (Memphis, TN to New Orleans, LA). Results There were a total of 831 LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers across the 109 counties. There was a range of LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV-service provider availability across counties (range: 0–14.33 per 10,000 youth aged 13–24 (IQR: 2.13), median: 1.09); 9 (8.26%) analyzed counties did not have any LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the correlation between county HIV prevalence and LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service provider density was 0.16 (p = 0.09), suggesting only a small, non-statistically significant linear relationship between a county’s available LGBTQ+ youth-friendly HIV service providers and their HIV burden. Conclusions As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we must find novel, affordable ways to continue to provide sexual health, mental health and other support services to LGBTQ+ youth."
https://openalex.org/W3196598954,"Bisphenol A and its derivatives are recognized as endocrine disruptors based on their complex effects on estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. While the effects of bisphenol derivatives on ERα have been thoroughly evaluated, how these chemicals affect ERβ signaling is less well understood. Herein, we sought to identify novel ERβ ligands using a radioligand competitive binding assay to screen a chemical library of bisphenol derivatives. Many of the compounds identified showed intriguing dual activities as both ERα agonists and ERβ antagonists. Docking simulations of these compounds and ERβ suggested that they bound not only to the canonical binding site of ERβ but also to the coactivator binding site located on the surface of the receptor, suggesting that they act as coactivator-binding inhibitors (CBIs). Receptor-ligand binding experiments using WT and mutated ERβ support the presence of a second ligand-interaction position at the coactivator-binding site in ERβ, and direct binding experiments of ERβ and a coactivator peptide confirmed that these compounds act as CBIs. Our study is the first to propose that bisphenol derivatives act as CBIs, presenting critical insight for the future development of ER signaling-based drugs and their potential to function as endocrine disruptors."
https://openalex.org/W3198754583,"This paper uses event study based on the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to study the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on China’s financial market. It finds that the pandemic had an overall significant and negative impact on the stock prices of firms listed on SSE, SZSE and ChiNext. However, such impact appeared to be heterogeneous across industries, affecting listed firms in industries such as pharmaceutical and telecommunications positively, but those in services industries such as accommodation, catering, and commercial services negatively. Apparently, a crisis for some had been an opportunity for others. In addition, this paper seeks to understand the micro mechanism behind the heterogeneity of pandemic shock from the perspective of firms’ financial position. It finds that listed firms with higher debt level were hit harder, whereas those with more net cash flow had displayed higher resilience against the blow of the pandemic. However, the opposite pattern is found among those listed on ChiNext and in industries severely devastated by the pandemic. These findings have policy implications in terms of preventing systemic financial risks and facilitating recovery during pandemic-induced economic downturns. It also helps investor adjust investment strategies, hedge against risks, and secure gains when the market conditions in general are unfavorable."
https://openalex.org/W3197941783,"Focal adhesions (FAs) and associated actin stress fibers (SFs) form a complex mechanical system that mediates bidirectional interactions between cells and their environment. This linked network is essential for mechanosensing, force production and force transduction, thus directly governing cellular processes like polarization, migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. We introduce a tool for fast and robust coupled analysis of both FAs and SFs named the Focal Adhesion Filament Cross-correlation Kit (FAFCK). Our software can detect and record location, axes lengths, area, orientation, and aspect ratio of focal adhesion structures as well as the location, length, width and orientation of actin stress fibers. This enables users to automate analysis of the correlation of FAs and SFs and study the stress fiber system in a higher degree, pivotal to accurately evaluate transmission of mechanocellular forces between a cell and its surroundings. The FAFCK is particularly suited for unbiased and systematic quantitative analysis of FAs and SFs necessary for novel approaches of traction force microscopy that uses the additional data from the cellular side to calculate the stress distribution in the substrate. For validation and comparison with other tools, we provide datasets of cells of varying quality that are labelled by a human expert.

https://openalex.org/W3196338451,"Culturally appropriate social support predicts better psychological outcomes. Motivation for providing social support may vary cross-culturally, with more independent cultures valuing self-esteem and more interdependent cultures valuing closeness. Participants in the U.S. (N = 85) and Singapore (N = 78) reported on emotions and social support receipt using the Day Reconstruction Method. We examined cultural differences in stress and affection, and tested country as a moderator of the associations between both social support receipt and social support motivation, and next-episode emotions. Multilevel modeling analyses showed that not only did the emotional correlates of social support receipt vary by country, but that recipient perceptions of esteem-building and closeness-fostering SS also differentially correlated with subsequent emotion. For example, esteem-building SS predicted greater next-episode stress for Singaporean participants, but less stress in the U.S. Esteem-building SS predicted more next-episode affection only in the U.S. Culturally appropriate social support predicts positive psychological outcomes. This research highlights the importance of considering culture when examining the dynamic emotional correlates of social support receipt."
https://openalex.org/W3197537274,"Befriending is a popular way in which to intervene to combat loneliness and social isolation among older people. However, there is a need to improve our understanding about how these interventions work, for whom and in which contexts, to make the best use of the increasing investment in the provision and delivery of befriending services.A realist evaluation was undertaken as it focuses on uncovering causal processes and interactions between mechanisms and contextual characteristics. Five case studies of befriending programmes in Northern Ireland were studied, reflecting variation in contextual variables, service user and provider characteristics. Data was collected via service documentation and semi-structured interviews (n = 46) with stakeholders involved in the delivery and receipt of befriending interventions.Eight initial programme theories were generated, which were 'tested' in the case study analysis to uncover context-mechanism-outcome relationships. Mechanisms identified included reciprocity, empathy, autonomy, and privacy which were triggered in different contexts to support the alleviation of loneliness and social isolation. Reciprocity was 'triggered' in contexts where service users and befrienders shared characteristics, the befriender was a volunteer and befriending took the form of physical companionship. Contexts characterised in terms of shared experiences between befriender and service user triggered empathy. Autonomy was triggered in contexts where befriending relationships were delivered long-term and did not focus on a pre-defined set of priorities. Privacy was triggered in contexts where service users had a cognitive/sensory impairment and received one-to-one delivery.This study improves understanding about how and why befriending interventions work. Findings indicate that services should be tailored to the needs of service users and take into consideration characteristics including mobility, impairments e.g. physical, sensory and/or cognitive, as well as the influence of service characteristics including payment for befrienders, fixed/long-term befriending relationship, one-to-one support and the impact of non-verbal communication via face-to-face delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3197822197,"Climate change is altering suitable areas of crop species worldwide, with cascading effects on people reliant upon those crop species as food sources and for income generation. Macadamia is one of Malawi's most important and profitable crop species; however, climate change threatens its production. Thus, this study's objective is to quantitatively examine the potential impacts of climate change on the climate suitability for macadamia in Malawi. We utilized an ensemble model approach to predict the current and future (2050s) suitability of macadamia under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for macadamia (AUC = 0.9). The climatic variables that strongly influence macadamia's climatic suitability in Malawi are suggested to be the precipitation of the driest month (29.1%) and isothermality (17.3%). Under current climatic conditions, 57% (53,925 km2) of Malawi is climatically suitable for macadamia. Future projections suggest that climate change will decrease the suitable areas for macadamia by 18% (17,015 km2) and 21.6% (20,414 km2) based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, with the distribution of suitability shifting northwards in the 2050s. The southern and central regions of the country will suffer the greatest losses (≥ 8%), while the northern region will be the least impacted (4%). We conclude that our study provides critical evidence that climate change will reduce the suitable areas for macadamia production in Malawi, depending on climate drivers. Therefore area-specific adaptation strategies are required to build resilience among producers."
https://openalex.org/W3196326926,"Postoperative pain and delayed healing in surgical wounds, which require complex management strategies have understudied complicated mechanisms. Here we investigated temporal changes in behavior, tissue structure, and transcriptomic profiles in a rat model of a surgical incision, using hyperalgesic behavioral tests, histological analyses, and next-generation RNA sequencing, respectively. The most rapidly (1 hour) expressed genes were the chemokines, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2. Consequently, infiltrating leukocytes were abundantly observed starting at 6 and peaking at 24 hours after incising which was supported by histological analysis and appearance of the neutrophil markers, S100a8 and S100a9. At this time, hyperalgesia was at a peak and overall transcriptional activity was most highly activated. At the 1-day timepoint, Nppb, coding for natriuretic peptide precursor B, was the most strongly upregulated gene and was localized by in situ hybridization to the epidermal keratinocytes at the margins of the incision. Nppb was basically unaffected in a peripheral inflammation model transcriptomic dataset. At the late phase of wound healing, five secreted, incision-specific peptidases, Mmp2, Aebp1, Mmp23, Adamts7, and Adamtsl1, showed increased expression, supporting the idea of a sustained tissue remodeling process. Transcripts that are specifically upregulated at each timepoint in the incision model may be potential candidates for either biomarkers or therapeutic targets for wound pain and wound healing. This study incorporates the examination of longitudinal temporal molecular responses, corresponding anatomical localization, and hyperalgesic behavioral alterations in the surgical incision model that together provide important and novel foundational knowledge to understand mechanisms of wound pain and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3196829718,"Objective Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, with potential effects on offspring both genetically and through altered intrauterine environment. Metformin, which ameliorate hormonal disturbances in non-pregnant women with PCOS is increasingly used in pregnancy. It passes the placenta, and the evidence on potential consequences for offspring endocrine development is scarce. We explore the potential effects of maternal PCOS status and intrauterine metformin exposure on offspring steroid hormone levels. Design This is a follow-up study of 5–10 years old children from the PregMet-study–a randomized controlled trial comparing metformin (2000 mg/day) to placebo during PCOS pregnancies. Of the 255 children invited, 117 (46%) were included. Methods There was no intervention in this follow-up study. Outcomes were serum levels of androstenedione, testosterone, SHBG, cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol and calculated free testosterone converted to gender-and age adjusted z-scores from a Norwegian reference population. These were compared in i) placebo-exposed children versus children from the reference population (z-score zero) by the deviation in z-score by one-sample t-tests and ii) metformin versus placebo-exposed children by two-sample t-tests. Holm-Bonferroni adjustments were performed to account for multiple endpoints. Results Girls of mothers with PCOS (n = 30) had higher mean z-scores of androstenedione (0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 1.06), p&lt;0.0001), testosterone (0.76 (0.51 to 1.00), p&lt;0.0001), and free testosterone (0.99 (0.67 to 1.32), p&lt;0.0001) than the reference population. Metformin-exposed boys (n = 31) tended to have higher 11-deoxycortisol z-score than placebo-exposed boys (n = 24) (mean difference 0.65 (95% CI 0.14–1.17), p = 0.014). Conclusion Maternal PCOS status was associated with elevated androgens in 5- to 10-year-old daughters, which might indicate earlier maturation and increased risk of developing PCOS. An impact of metformin in pregnancy on steroidogenesis in children born to mothers with PCOS cannot be excluded. Our findings need confirmation in studies that include participants that have entered puberty."
https://openalex.org/W3196832899,"Background COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy seems to be universal across countries and subgroups, and so are its determinants. We studied the willingness and factors associated with the decision to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCW) in a Spanish tertiary hospital. Furthermore, we compared the percentage of willingness to vaccinate against COVID with actual vaccination rates among HCW in our hospital. Methods From December 21, 2020 to January 4, 2021, before initiation of the COVID-19 HCW vaccination campaign at Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital (HUGTiP), an anonymous self-administered questionnaire was administered to HCW. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression of the association of variables with the outcome “intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible” was conducted. Vaccination rates were extracted from the hospital information systems. Results Forty-four percent of HCW included in the study declared a willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible. This was associated with male sex [1.66 (95%CI 1.13–2.43); p = 0.009], older age [1.02 (95%CI 1.00–1.03); p = 0.014], belonging to the occupational groups “physician” or “other” [5.76 (95%CI 3.44–9.63) and 2.15 (95%CI 1.25–3.70); p&lt;0.001], respectively, and reporting influenza vaccination during the last three seasons or at least one of the last three seasons [3.84 (95%CI 2.56–5.75) and 2.49 (95%CI 1.71–3.63); p&lt;0.001]. One in ten hospital workers reported they were unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Actual COVID-19 vaccination uptake among HCW was higher (80.4%) than the percentage of willingness to vaccinate estimated from the questionnaire. Physicians not only had the highest vaccination rate, but also the highest correlation between the reported intention to vaccinate and the final decision to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccination uptake was higher than previously estimated according to the stated intentions of HCW. Doubts and fears must be addressed, particularly in persons less inclined to be vaccinated: females, younger people and those not vaccinated against influenza in recent seasons. The study of barriers and strategies aimed at promoting COVID-19 vaccination must be adapted in relation to occupational groups’ attitudes, understanding their idiosyncrasies with respect to this and other vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3197401160,"Site selection of health facilities is critical in ensuring universal access to basic healthcare services. However, in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) like the Philippines, site selection is traditionally based on political and pragmatic considerations. Moreover, literature that demonstrates the application of facility location models in the Philippine healthcare setting remains scarce, and their usage in actual facility planning is even more limited. In this study, we proposed a variation of cooperative covering maximal models to identify the optimal location of primary care facilities. We demonstrated the feasibility of implementing such a model by using open source data on an actual city in the Philippines. Our results generated multiple candidate locations of primary care facilities depending on the equity and efficiency parameters. This approach could be used as one of the critical considerations in evidence-based, multi-criterion health facility location decisions of governments, and can also be adapted in other industries, given the model's use of readily available open source datasets."

https://openalex.org/W3196419256,"Echolocation signals of wild beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ) were recorded in 2013 using a vertical, linear 16-hydrophone array at two locations in the pack ice of Baffin Bay, West Greenland. Individual whales were localized for 4:42 minutes of 1:04 hours of recordings. Clicks centered on the recording equipment (i.e. on-axis clicks) were isolated to calculate sonar parameters. We report the first sonar beam estimate of in situ recordings of wild belugas with an average -3 dB asymmetrical vertical beam width of 5.4°, showing a wider ventral beam. This narrow beam width is consistent with estimates from captive belugas; however, our results indicate that beluga sonar beams may not be symmetrical and may differ in wild and captive contexts. The mean apparent source level for on-axis clicks was 212 dB pp re 1 μPa and whales were shown to vertically scan the array from 120 meters distance. Our findings support the hypothesis that highly directional sonar beams and high source levels are an evolutionary adaptation for Arctic odontocetes to reduce unwanted surface echoes from sea ice (i.e., acoustic clutter) and effectively navigate through leads in the pack ice (e.g., find breathing holes). These results provide the first baseline beluga sonar metrics from free-ranging animals using a hydrophone array and are important for acoustic programs throughout the Arctic, particularly for acoustic classification between belugas and narwhals ( Monodon monoceros )."
https://openalex.org/W3196639522,"The fertility and productive value of soil are closely related to the physical and chemical properties of the soil as well as its biological activity. This activity is related to the intensity of microbially catalysed processes of transformation of organic and mineral substances contained in the soil. These processes are closely correlated with the abundance and biodiversity of soil microorganisms, especially bacteria, and the activity of enzymes produced by them. In this article we have compared some physicochemical properties of soil derived from conventional and organic farms and microbial communities inhabiting these ecosystems. We aim to investigate whether the soil management regime affects the abundance and diversity of these environments in terms of bacteria. Some differences in microbial communities were observed, but the rhizosphere of plants from organic and conventional soils does not harbour separate microbiomes. Albeit, the method of fertilization influences the diversity of soil microorganisms. A greater diversity of bacteria was observed in soils from farms where organic fertilizers were applied. Soil pH and activity of some soil enzymes were also shown to differ between organic and conventional soil cropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W3196913213,"Calcium (Ca2+ ) signaling is critical for neuronal functioning and requires the concerted interplay of numerous Ca2+ -binding proteins, including neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). Although an important role of NCS1 in neuronal processes and in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases has been established, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we systematically investigated the functions of NCS1 in the brain. Using Golgi-Cox staining, we observed a reduction in dendritic complexity and spine density in the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal hippocampus of Ncs1-/- mice, which may underlie concomitantly observed deficits in memory acquisition. Subsequent RNA sequencing of Ncs1-/- and Ncs1+/+ mouse brain tissues revealed that NCS1 modulates gene expression related to neuronal morphology and development. Investigation of developmental databases further supported a molecular role of NCS1 during brain development by identifying temporal gene expression patterns. Collectively, this study provides insights into NCS1-dependent signaling and lays the foundation for a better understanding of NCS1-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3197339002,"Objective Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis in childhood that can lead to coronary artery lesions (CALs). Although early diagnosis and treatment is important for preventing KD patients from development of CALs, diagnosis depends on the clinical features of KD. We studied the usefulness of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and angiotensinogen (AGT), previously reported as KD-related proteins, for KD diagnosis and estimation of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) efficacy. Methods We undertook a prospective cohort study with patients having two or more KD symptoms in multiple centers in Japan, between July 2017 and February 2019. Results Two hundred forty-two patients were included. In multivariable analysis, one unit increase in LRG1 was associated with higher odds of KD diagnosis (Odds ratio [OR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.001–1.03]). Double-positivity for AGT (≥ 26 μg/mL) and LRG1 (≥ 123.5 μg/mL) was an independent biomarker for KD diagnosis in both the total cohort and the subgroup of patients with two to four KD symptoms (OR 5.01 [95% CI 1.86–13.50] and 3.71 [95% CI 1.23–11.16], respectively). There was no association between LRG1/AGT and IVIG efficacy. Conclusion Double-positivity for LRG1 and AGT is an biomarker for KD diagnosis, especially useful in diagnosing incomplete KD from non-KD. Future studies with larger cohorts should seek to determine whether LRG1 and AGT are valuable as definitive data referred at the diagnosis of KD and for estimating the risk of CALs."
https://openalex.org/W3196646942,"River embankments are the basic and the oldest measures of protecting areas potentially subjected to flooding, and at the same time pose a serious threat to their environment in the event of damage or failure. The technical condition of the levees and its regular evaluation is a key element of their safety. A general assessment of the technical condition of a levee is the result of many interacting factors and parameters that depend on each other to a varying degree. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the cause-and-effect links between the interrelationships of numerous parameters and sensors of significant impact. In this article the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was applied to develop a cause-and-effect model for factors impacting the condition and safety of levees. Effective factors impacting the technical condition of a levee were identified; relationships between these factors were determined; a cause-and-effect model was developed based on identified factors; factors were categorized based on the dependence scale and influential indicators of each factors used in the DEMATEL method. The obtained results demonstrate that three following factors: hydrological factor, type and condition of soils in levee body and condition of levee areas (inter-levee and landside) play the most important role for levee safety. The results of this study can support traditional assessments of hydrotechnical structure or assist entities managing levees."

https://openalex.org/W3196975466,"The spike protein is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor-binding motif mediates recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a critical step in infection, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Posttranslational modifications of the spike receptor-binding motif have been shown to modulate viral infectivity and host immune response, but these modifications are still being explored. Here we studied asparagine deamidation of the spike protein, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, which affect both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 in the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-life of 16.5 and 123 days at 37 °C, respectively. Deamidation is significantly slowed at 4 °C, indicating a strong dependence of spike protein molecular aging on environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor more than 3.5-fold, yet its high conservation pattern suggests some positive effect on viral fitness. We propose a model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrating how deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif could lead to the accumulation on the virion surface of a nonnegligible chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for molecular aging of the spike protein with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3197050860,"Cancer cell lines, which are cell cultures derived from tumor samples, represent one of the least expensive and most studied preclinical models for drug development. Accurately predicting drug responses for a given cell line based on molecular features may help to optimize drug-development pipelines and explain mechanisms behind treatment responses. In this study, we focus on DNA methylation profiles as one type of molecular feature that is known to drive tumorigenesis and modulate treatment responses. Using genome-wide, DNA methylation profiles from 987 cell lines in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we used machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the potential to predict cytotoxic responses for eight anti-cancer drugs. We compared the performance of five classification algorithms and four regression algorithms representing diverse methodologies, including tree-, probability-, kernel-, ensemble-, and distance-based approaches. We artificially subsampled the data to varying degrees, aiming to understand whether training based on relatively extreme outcomes would yield improved performance. When using classification or regression algorithms to predict discrete or continuous responses, respectively, we consistently observed excellent predictive performance when the training and test sets consisted of cell-line data. Classification algorithms performed best when we trained the models using cell lines with relatively extreme drug-response values, attaining area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve values as high as 0.97. The regression algorithms performed best when we trained the models using the full range of drug-response values, although this depended on the performance metrics we used. Finally, we used patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate the feasibility of classifying clinical responses for human tumors based on models derived from cell lines. Generally, the algorithms were unable to identify patterns that predicted patient responses reliably; however, predictions by the Random Forests algorithm were significantly correlated with Temozolomide responses for low-grade gliomas."

Then hippocampal-dependent tasks named spatial-working and short-term memory procedures using the Y-maze apparatus were examined in morphine tolerant rats. Finally, the changes in the expression of hippocampal GABA-A receptors underlying morphine tolerance were also examined.Rats were treated with daily morphine injections, with or without distinct contextual pairing. To examine the effect of valproic acid on morphine tolerance expression, valproic acid was pretreated an hour before morphine. Spatial-working and short-term memory procedures using the Y-maze apparatus were examined in morphine tolerant rats. Afterwards the changes in the expression of hippocampal GABAα receptors using the quantitative real-time PCR and western blot techniques to detect GABArα subunits mRNAs and protein level were studied.Our results showed that both learned and non-associative morphine tolerance influence short-term memory and the subjacent expression of GABArα mRNAs and protein level. Despite its attenuating effects on the development and expression of both learned and non-associative morphine tolerance, only associative morphine tolerance-induced memory dysfunction was ameliorated by valproic acid pretreatment. We also found that the expression of GABArα1, α2, α5 subunits mRNAs and GABAα protein level were affected heavier in associative morphine tolerant rats.Our data supports the hypothesis that unconditioned and learned morphine tolerance influences short-term memory and the expression of GABArα 1, α2, α5 mRNAs and GABArα protein level differently, and adds to our understanding of the behavioral and molecular aspects of the learned tolerance to morphine effects."

The score of abdominal distention (0-5), volume of milk sucked and volume of stool, along with systemic details (pulse and respiration rates, blood pressure and number of periods of apnea) were collected at 1 week and 1 day before ROP examination, and at 1 day after examination. Results were compared between the days before and after examination. Correlation between body weight at the time of examination and the score of abdominal distention was examined. The numbers of infants with abdominal and/or systemic adverse events were compared between pre- and post-examination periods.Eighty-six infants met the inclusion criteria. The score of abdominal distention increased from 2.0 at 1 day before examination to 2.3 at 1 day after examination (p = 0.005), and the number of infants who had worsened abdominal distension increased after examination (p = 0.01). Infants with lower body weight had a higher score of abdominal distention (p < 0.0001, r = -0.57). The number of infants with reduced milk consumption increased after examination (p = 0.0001), as did the number of infants with decreased pulse rate (p = 0.0008).Screening for ROP with mydriatic may have adverse effects on systemic conditions.

However, assessing the nutritional status of Bangladeshi children and adolescents through measurement of body composition using skinfold thickness is barely studied. The current study aims to determine children’s body composition and nutritional status, and contributing factors among children aged 2 to 15 years in the northern part of Bangladesh. Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional study done in Bangladesh. Anthropometric methods, including multiple skinfold thickness and basic anthropometric and socio-demographic characteristics, were used. Body composition was calculated from multiple skinfold thicknesses using the standard regression equation. Nutritional status was measured using Z score according to WHO 2007 reference standard. A total of 330 children from Naogaon, Bogra and Kurigram districts in Bangladesh were examined from April 2019 to September 2019. Results The Nutritional status of 2–15 years old child is exceedingly poor in the northern part of Bangladesh. Fat mass and fat-free mass were higher among children from Kurigram district than from Bogra and Naogaon district. Body fat percentages and arm fat area were greater among female children than males. The overall prevalence of stunting, underweight and wasting was around 25%, 32% and 29%, respectively, and the rate was higher among girls and children aged 2–5 years. The average SD score for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and BMI-for-age was -1.295, -0.937 and -1.009. The median weight-for-age and height-for-age Z scores of boys and girls were below the WHO reference percentile rank. Girls were twice (OR:1.951, CI:1.150–3.331) as likely to suffer from being underweight than boys. Children who don’t practice handwashing are three times (OR:3.531, CI:1.657–7.525) more likely to be underweight. Children become underweight and stunted when their family income is not sufficient to maintain their nutritional requirements. Conclusions The children of the three northern districts had a poor nutritional status, and family income was the potential contributing factor. Therefore, interventions like the promotion of income-generating activities and integrated approaches to ensuring food diversification could be an option to address the nutritional problem of children of the three northern districts of Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3197996057,"Long project cycle and uncertainties are important characteristics of public-private partnership (PPP) projects. Since the introduction of PPP projects in China, the timing of capital withdrawal has become important. With the emergence of risk factors during the course of the project, it will face the problem of investment withdrawal by social capital financial investors. Escalation of commitment (EOC) refers to the erroneous behaviour of project decision makers who do not promptly withdraw from a project when they receive negative feedback and continue to invest resources in the project. EOC not only causes more unnecessary losses but also adversely affects decision makers. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the impact of EOC on the choice of the exit timing of social capital. This article adopts literature survey method and quantitative analysis method: introducing the theory of maximization of income into the real option model, combining the net present value method with the binary tree option pricing model, constructing the decision-making model to analyze the exit timing of PPP social capital in the context of EOC. Then combined numerical simulation and empirical analysis to verify the effectiveness of the decision-making model, discussed the reasons why the social capital party chooses EOC, and proposes measures for controlling EOC. The higher the degree of completion of the project, the easier it is for the person in charge of the project to make inaccurate judgements about the project due to personal psychological factors, and the easier it is for EOC to occur. Therefore, after setting the minimum goal of the project, the decision maker needs to accurately evaluate the existing value of the project to avoid falling into decision-making errors."
https://openalex.org/W3196410494,"The beginning of the 21st century brought a change in the approach to public relations (PR). Both the literature and the practice saw a shift in focus from evaluating the efficiency of communication strategies to relationship management. On the other hand, the growing interest in the use of social media in the management of many types of organizations has prompted researchers to seek the theoretical causes of this trend. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine the scope of the Polish public benefit organizations' (PBO) use of the social network Facebook in managing relationships with stakeholders. The PBO is a specific form of non-profit organization, which enjoys the special privilege of collecting tax-deductible donations of 1% of personal income tax (PIT). The research covered 876 entities, which were divided into four clusters depending on their size. A database of posts was created that the organizations published in the period selected for the research. Then, the impact of the Facebook content on user engagement was analyzed. For this purpose, various statistical methods were used, i.e. descriptive statistics, statistical tests and multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that, in spite of social media's unquestionable advantages, public benefit organizations only take advantage of a small proportion of this potential. The role of the most popular service, Facebook, in increasing organizational revenue from 1% of PIT deductions seems secondary at best. Apart from that, the results showed that the rates of posting by different Polish public benefit organizations vary widely. Although some organizations were very active in this aspect, the Facebook pages of many organizations remained completely inactive throughout the analysis or showed only minimal activity. Larger organizations exhibited a much greater posting activity than their smaller counterparts."

https://openalex.org/W3197092283,"The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across energetic membranes. Numerous Tat substrates contain co-factors that are inserted before transport with the assistance of redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs), which bind to the signal peptide of precursor proteins. How signal peptides are transferred from a REMP to a binding site on the Tat receptor complex remains unknown. Since the signal peptide mediates both interactions, possibilities include: i) a coordinated hand-off mechanism; or ii) a diffusional search after REMP dissociation. We investigated the binding interaction between substrates containing the TorA signal peptide (spTorA) and its cognate REMP, TorD, and the effect of TorD on the in vitro transport of such substrates. We found that Escherichia coli TorD is predominantly a monomer at low micromolar concentrations (dimerization KD > 50 μM), and this monomer binds reversibly to spTorA (KD ≈ 1 μM). While TorD binds to membranes (KD ≈ 100 nM), it has no apparent affinity for Tat translocons and it inhibits binding of a precursor substrate to the membrane. TorD has a minimal effect on substrate transport by the Tat system, being mildly inhibitory at high concentrations. These data are consistent with a model in which the REMP-bound signal peptide is shielded from recognition by the Tat translocon, and spontaneous dissociation of the REMP allows the substrate to engage the Tat machinery. Thus, the REMP does not assist with targeting to the Tat translocon, but rather temporarily shields the signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W3197226787,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and the survival of CHEK2 mutation positive and CHEK2 mutation negative patients diagnosed with bladder or kidney cancer. Materials and methods 1016 patients with bladder and 402 cases with kidney cancer and 8302 controls were genotyped for four CHEK2 variants: 1100delC, del5395, IVS2+1G&gt;A and I157T. Predictors of survival were determined among CHEK2 pathogenic variant carriers using the Cox proportional hazards model. The median follow-up was 17.5 years. Covariates included age (≤60; &gt;61 years), sex (female; male), clinical characteristics (stage: TNM, grade, histopathological type), smoking status (non-smoking; smoking) and cancer family history (negative; positive). Results We found no impact of CHEK2 mutations on bladder or kidney cancer survival. However, we observed a possible increased survival in the subgroup of patients with stage T1 bladder cancer with CHEK2 mutations but this did not meet statistical significance (HR = 0.14; 95% CI 0.02–1.04; p = 0.055). Moreover, we observed that the missense mutations were more frequent in the low grade invasive bladder cancer patient group (OR = 7.9; 95% CI 1.50–42.1; p = 0.04) and in patients with bladder cancer with stage Ta (OR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.30–4.55; p = 0.006). The different results where missense mutations occurs less often we observed among patients with high grade invasive bladder cancer (OR = 0.12; 95% CI 0.02–0.66; p = 0.04) and those with stage T1 disease (OR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.07–0.76; p = 0.01). Our investigations revealed that any mutation in CHEK2 occurs more often among patients with stage Ta bladder cancer (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.19–3.47; p = 0.01) and less often in patients with stage T1 disease (OR = 0.31; 95% CI 0.12–0.78; p = 0.01). In the kidney cancer patients, truncating mutations were present more often in the group with clear cell carcinoma GII (OR = 8.0; 95% CI 0.95–67.7; p = 0.05). The 10-year survival for all CHEK2 mutation carriers with bladder cancer was 33% and for non-carriers 11% ( p = 0.15). The 10-year survival for CHEK2 mutation carriers with kidney cancer 34% and for non-carriers 20% ( p = 0.5). Conclusion CHEK2 mutations were not associated with any change in bladder or kidney cancer survival regardless of their age, sex, smoking status and family history. We observed a potentially protective effect of CHEK2 mutations on survival for patients with stage T1 bladder cancer. CHEK2 missense mutations were more common among patients with low grade invasive bladder cancer and in patients with stage Ta diease. The frequencies of the I157T CHEK2 pathogenic variant were less in patients with high grade invasive bladder cancer and those with stage T1 disease. Among patients with bladder cancer with stage Ta disease, the OR for any mutation in CHEK2 was 2.0 but for those with stage T1 disease, the OR was 0.3. We observed truncating CHEK2 mutations were associated with kidney cancer patients with GII clear cell carcinoma."

Therefore, we investigated the effects of electrification on inflammation in septic rats. Twenty-eight male Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups: healthy control (C), electrified healthy (E), sepsis (S), and electrified sepsis (SE) groups. Staphylococcus aureus (1 x 10 9 colonies) in 1 ml of medium was intraperitoneally injected into rats to produce a sepsis model. The rats in the E and SE groups were exposed to a low direct electrical signal (300 Hz and 2.5 volts) for 40 min and 1 and 6 h after bacterial infection. Immediately after the second electrical signal application, blood and tissue samples of the heart, lung, and liver were collected. An antibacterial effect of a low direct electrical signal was observed in the blood of rats. The effects of electrical signals on ameliorating changes in the histological structure of tissues, blood pH, gases, viscosity and cell count, activities of some important enzymes, oxidative stress parameters, inflammation and tissue apoptosis were observed in the SE group compared to the S group. Low direct electrical signal application exerts antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on septic rats due to the induction of electrolysis in body fluids without producing any tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W3198656837,"This article describes and analyzes conceptions of equal access to healthcare by health workers and Sub Saharan African women living in Norway. The main objective of the study was to find out if there is equal access to healthcare as understood by both the provider and receiver side of healthcare. The two sides have different positions from where to observe and judge the services given, which can give a broader understanding of the healthcare system. Do Sub Saharan African women find healthcare services unjust and discriminating? Do health workers share conceptions of access held by these women? This study used a qualitative fieldwork research design. One hundred interviews were done with health workers and 55 interviews were done with Somali, Gambian and Eritrean women who all had experienced female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). The study found a mismatch in the conceptions of access to healthcare between health workers and the women. Health workers did not believe there was equal access to healthcare and were critical of how the system functioned, whereas the women trusted the system and believed there was equal access. However, both sides had corresponding views on the following challenges facing the healthcare system: little time available to identify symptoms, difficulties in navigating the system, difficulties in getting referrals, and some negative adjudication by some health workers. Bourdieu’s concepts of field, habitus and hysteresis, and candidacy theory were used to analyze the collected data. It was concluded that health workers and the women based their experiences of healthcare on differing cultural frames and expectations. The women seemed to base their assessments of healthcare on previous experiences from their home country, while health workers based their understanding from experiences within the system."

There were 55 patients in the infiltrated hip group and 44 patients in the not infiltrated group. Patients' hemoglobin level (Hb), hematocrit (HTC), red blood count (RBC), platelet count (PLT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) as well as the need for blood transfusions were compared statistically between groups preoperatively and postoperatively. There were no significant differences between Hb, HTC or RBC levels as well as the rate and amount of blood transfusions on the 1st, 4th postoperative days or at patients' discharge between infiltrated and not infiltrated groups. This study does not support the hypothesis that the use of local infiltration analgesia with adrenaline may reduce perioperative blood loss in total hip arthroplasty."

https://openalex.org/W3198114674,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) have an elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to their uninfected peers. Expanding statin use may help alleviate this burden. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of reducing the recommend statin initiation threshold for primary ASCVD prevention among PLHIV in Thailand.Our decision analytic microsimulation model randomly selected (with replacement) individuals from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (data collected between 1/January/2013 and 1/September/2019). Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years were assigned in annual cycles over a lifetime horizon and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed the Thai healthcare sector perspective. The study population included PLHIV aged 35-75 years, without ASCVD, and receiving antiretroviral therapy. Statin initiation thresholds evaluated were 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10% (control), ≥7.5% and ≥5%.A statin initiation threshold of ASCVD risk ≥7.5% resulted in accumulation of 0.015 additional quality-adjusted life-years compared with an ASCVD risk threshold ≥10%, at an extra cost of 3,539 Baht ($US113), giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 239,000 Baht ($US7,670)/quality-adjusted life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing ASCVD risk ≥5% to ≥7.5% was 349,000 Baht ($US11,200)/quality-adjusted life-year gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Baht ($US5,135)/quality-adjusted life-year gained, a 30.8% reduction in the average cost of low/moderate statin therapy led to the ASCVD risk threshold ≥7.5% becoming cost-effective compared with current practice.Reducing the recommended 10-year ASCVD risk threshold for statin initiation among PLHIV in Thailand would not currently be cost-effective. However, a lower threshold could become cost-effective with greater preference for cheaper statins."
