https://openalex.org/W2138601221,"The MuTect algorithm for calling somatic point mutations enables subclonal analysis of the whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing data being generated in large-scale cancer genomics projects. Detection of somatic point substitutions is a key step in characterizing the cancer genome. However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W2041656098,"The authors use Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice to look at the long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes. They find that, in a familiar environment, there is substantial change in the population of place-coding cells over time, but the ensembles of these cells are sufficiently stable to preserve an accurate spatial representation across weeks. Using Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice that repeatedly explored a familiar environment, we tracked thousands of CA1 pyramidal cells' place fields over weeks. Place coding was dynamic, as each day the ensemble representation of this environment involved a unique subset of cells. However, cells in the ∼15–25% overlap between any two of these subsets retained the same place fields, which sufficed to preserve an accurate spatial representation across weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2093059993,"Oncolytic viruses and active immunotherapeutics have complementary mechanisms of action (MOA) that are both self amplifying in tumors, yet the impact of dose on subject outcome is unclear. JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) is an oncolytic and immunotherapeutic vaccinia virus. To determine the optimal JX-594 dose in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we conducted a randomized phase 2 dose-finding trial (n=30). Radiologists infused low- or high-dose JX-594 into liver tumors (days 1, 15 and 29); infusions resulted in acute detectable intravascular JX-594 genomes. Objective intrahepatic Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) (15%) and Choi (62%) response rates and intrahepatic disease control (50%) were equivalent in injected and distant noninjected tumors at both doses. JX-594 replication and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression preceded the induction of anticancer immunity. In contrast to tumor response rate and immune endpoints, subject survival duration was significantly related to dose (median survival of 14.1 months compared to 6.7 months on the high and low dose, respectively; hazard ratio 0.39; P=0.020). JX-594 demonstrated oncolytic and immunotherapy MOA, tumor responses and dose-related survival in individuals with HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2048786084,"Molecular control of the pluripotent state is thought to reside in a core circuitry of master transcription factors including the homeodomain-containing protein NANOG, which has an essential role in establishing ground state pluripotency during somatic cell reprogramming. Whereas the genomic occupancy of NANOG has been extensively investigated, comparatively little is known about NANOG-associated proteins and their contribution to the NANOG-mediated reprogramming process. Using enhanced purification techniques and a stringent computational algorithm, we identify 27 high-confidence protein interaction partners of NANOG in mouse embryonic stem cells. These consist of 19 previously unknown partners of NANOG that have not been reported before, including the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family methylcytosine hydroxylase TET1. We confirm physical association of NANOG with TET1, and demonstrate that TET1, in synergy with NANOG, enhances the efficiency of reprogramming. We also find physical association and reprogramming synergy of TET2 with NANOG, and demonstrate that knockdown of TET2 abolishes the reprogramming synergy of NANOG with a catalytically deficient mutant of TET1. These results indicate that the physical interaction between NANOG and TET1/TET2 proteins facilitates reprogramming in a manner that is dependent on the catalytic activity of TET1/TET2. TET1 and NANOG co-occupy genomic loci of genes associated with both maintenance of pluripotency and lineage commitment in embryonic stem cells, and TET1 binding is reduced upon NANOG depletion. Co-expression of NANOG and TET1 increases 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels at the top-ranked common target loci Esrrb and Oct4 (also called Pou5f1), resulting in priming of their expression before reprogramming to naive pluripotency. We propose that TET1 is recruited by NANOG to enhance the expression of a subset of key reprogramming target genes. These results provide an insight into the reprogramming mechanism of NANOG and uncover a new role for 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases in the establishment of naive pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2079332279,"Alan Saltiel and his colleagues report that the approved drug amlexanox, currently used to treat asthma and canker sores, is a relatively specific inhibitor of the noncanonical IκB kinases IKK-ɛ and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and that it improves metabolic disease in mouse genetic and dietary models of obesity. These results suggest this drug may be repurposed to treat obesity and insulin resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation provides a link between obesity and insulin resistance. The noncanonical IκB kinases IKK-ɛ and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are induced in liver and fat by NF-κB activation upon high-fat diet feeding and in turn initiate a program of counterinflammation that preserves energy storage. Here we report that amlexanox, an approved small-molecule therapeutic presently used in the clinic to treat aphthous ulcers and asthma, is an inhibitor of these kinases. Treatment of obese mice with amlexanox elevates energy expenditure through increased thermogenesis, producing weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and decreased steatosis. Because of its record of safety in patients, amlexanox may be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the treatment of obesity and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2031333605,"Julie Baker and colleagues report epigenome and transcriptome profiles of rat and mouse trophoblast stem cells and show that endogenous retroviruses serve as a genome-wide source of species-specific enhancer elements in the placenta. The mammalian placenta is remarkably distinct between species, suggesting a history of rapid evolutionary diversification1. To gain insight into the molecular drivers of placental evolution, we compared biochemically predicted enhancers in mouse and rat trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and found that species-specific enhancers are highly enriched for endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) on a genome-wide level. One of these ERV families, RLTR13D5, contributes hundreds of mouse-specific histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1)- and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)-defined enhancers that functionally bind Cdx2, Eomes and Elf5—core factors that define the TSC regulatory network. Furthermore, we show that RLTR13D5 is capable of driving gene expression in rat placental cells. Analysis in other tissues shows that species-specific ERV enhancer activity is generally restricted to hypomethylated tissues, suggesting that tissues permissive for ERV activity gain access to an otherwise silenced source of regulatory variation. Overall, our results implicate ERV enhancer co-option as a mechanism underlying the extensive evolutionary diversification of placental development."
https://openalex.org/W2070493436,"During navigation, grid cells increase their spike rates in firing fields arranged on a markedly regular triangular lattice, whereas their spike timing is often modulated by theta oscillations. Oscillatory interference models of grid cells predict theta amplitude modulations of membrane potential during firing field traversals, whereas competing attractor network models predict slow depolarizing ramps. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we tested these models by directly measuring grid cell intracellular potentials in mice running along linear tracks in virtual reality. Grid cells had large and reproducible ramps of membrane potential depolarization that were the characteristic signature tightly correlated with firing fields. Grid cells also demonstrated intracellular theta oscillations that influenced their spike timing. However, the properties of theta amplitude modulations were not consistent with the view that they determine firing field locations. Our results support cellular and network mechanisms in which grid fields are produced by slow ramps, as in attractor models, whereas theta oscillations control spike timing."

https://openalex.org/W2127661946,"Tendons are often injured and heal poorly. Whether this is caused by a slow tissue turnover is unknown, since existing data provide diverging estimates of tendon protein half-life that range from 2 mo to 200 yr. With the purpose of determining life-long turnover of human tendon tissue, we used the (14)C bomb-pulse method. This method takes advantage of the dramatic increase in atmospheric levels of (14)C, produced by nuclear bomb tests in 1955-1963, which is reflected in all living organisms. Levels of (14)C were measured in 28 forensic samples of Achilles tendon core and 4 skeletal muscle samples (donor birth years 1945-1983) with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) and compared to known atmospheric levels to estimate tissue turnover. We found that Achilles tendon tissue retained levels of (14)C corresponding to atmospheric levels several decades before tissue sampling, demonstrating a very limited tissue turnover. The tendon concentrations of (14)C approximately reflected the atmospheric levels present during the first 17 yr of life, indicating that the tendon core is formed during height growth and is essentially not renewed thereafter. In contrast, (14)C levels in muscle indicated continuous turnover. Our observation provides a fundamental premise for understanding tendon function and pathology, and likely explains the poor regenerative capacity of tendon tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1965071252,"Anthony Bleyer, Eric Lander, Mark Daly and colleagues show that frameshift mutations in a large VNTR of MUC1 cause medullary cystic kidney disease type 1. Their discovery sheds light on the biology of this disease and highlights challenges in using massively parallel sequencing technologies to characterize certain types of sequence variants. Although genetic lesions responsible for some mendelian disorders can be rapidly discovered through massively parallel sequencing of whole genomes or exomes, not all diseases readily yield to such efforts. We describe the illustrative case of the simple mendelian disorder medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 (MCKD1), mapped more than a decade ago to a 2-Mb region on chromosome 1. Ultimately, only by cloning, capillary sequencing and de novo assembly did we find that each of six families with MCKD1 harbors an equivalent but apparently independently arising mutation in sequence markedly under-represented in massively parallel sequencing data: the insertion of a single cytosine in one copy (but a different copy in each family) of the repeat unit comprising the extremely long (∼1.5–5 kb), GC-rich (>80%) coding variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence in the MUC1 gene encoding mucin 1. These results provide a cautionary tale about the challenges in identifying the genes responsible for mendelian, let alone more complex, disorders through massively parallel sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2006319417,"Crossing-over ensures accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, and every pair of chromosomes obtains at least one crossover, even though the majority of recombination sites yield non-crossovers. A putative regulator of crossing-over is RNF212, which is associated with variation in crossover rates in humans. We show that mouse RNF212 is essential for crossing-over, functioning to couple chromosome synapsis to the formation of crossover-specific recombination complexes. Selective localization of RNF212 to a subset of recombination sites is shown to be a key early step in the crossover designation process. RNF212 acts at these sites to stabilize meiosis-specific recombination factors, including the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5). We infer that selective stabilization of key recombination proteins is a fundamental feature of meiotic crossover control. Haploinsufficiency indicates that RNF212 is a limiting factor for crossover control and raises the possibility that human alleles may alter the amount or stability of RNF212 and be risk factors for aneuploid conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2029459374,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that binds to the epidermal growth factor-like-A domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and mediates LDLR degradation in liver. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in humans. Size-exclusion chromatography of human plasma has shown PCSK9 to be partly associated with undefined high molecular weight complexes within the LDL size range. We used density gradient centrifugation to isolate LDL in plasma pooled from 5 normolipidemic subjects and report that >40% of total PCSK9 was associated with LDL. Binding of fluorophore-labeled recombinant PCSK9 to isolated LDL in vitro was saturable with a K(D) ∼ 325 nM. This interaction was competed >95% by excess unlabeled PCSK9, and competition binding curves were consistent with a one-site binding model. An N-terminal region of the PCSK9 prodomain (amino acids 31-52) was required for binding to LDL in vitro. LDL dose-dependently inhibited binding and degradation of cell surface LDLRs by exogenous PCSK9 in HuH7 cells. LDL also inhibited PCSK9 binding to mutant LDLRs defective at binding LDL. These data suggest that association of PCSK9 with LDL particles in plasma lowers the ability of PCSK9 to bind to cell surface LDLRs, thereby blunting PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2127416800,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important causative agent of many skin infections and produces numerous toxic phenol-soluble modulins that mediate its virulence. Michael Otto and colleagues have now identified the S. aureus genes that encode the peptide transporter responsible for the export of these toxins from the bacteria and reveal its crucial role in abscess formation in the skin. Widespread antibiotic resistance among important bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus1 calls for alternative routes of drug development. Interfering with crucial virulence determinants is considered a promising new approach to control bacterial infection2. Phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are peptide toxins with multiple key roles in pathogenesis3,4,5 and have a major impact on the ability of highly virulent S. aureus to cause disease3,6. However, targeting PSMs for therapeutic intervention is hampered by their multitude and diversity. Here we report that an ATP-binding cassette transporter with previously unknown function is responsible for the export of all PSMs, thus representing a single target for complete obstruction of PSM production. The transporter had a strong effect on virulence phenotypes, such as neutrophil lysis, and the extent of its effect on the development of S. aureus infection was similar to that of the sum of all PSMs. Notably, the transporter was essential for bacterial growth. Furthermore, it contributed to producer immunity toward secreted PSMs and defense against PSM-mediated bacterial interference. Our study reveals a noncanonical, dedicated secretion mechanism for an important class of toxins and identifies this mechanism as a comprehensive potential target for the development of drugs to efficiently inhibit the growth and virulence of pathogenic staphylococci."

https://openalex.org/W1984022579,"High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy shows that the Trypanosoma brucei kinetoplastid ribosome is characterized by the presence of large expansion segments, ribosomal-protein extensions and additional rRNA insertions, which may have implications for the protein-translation regulation process. The structure of the ribosome from Trypanosoma brucei, the African sleeping sickness parasite, has now been determined at near-atomic (∼5Å) resolution. T. brucei is a member of the kinetoplastids, a group of single-celled flagellated protozoans that includes several human pathogens. The model presented here reveals unique features that differ substantially from other known eukaryotic ribosomes, including extended rRNA expansion segments and numerous rRNA insertions. The structure suggests novel translation-regulation patterns, possibly a reflection of the trypanosome's complex parasitic life cycle, and the identification of features specific to this ribosome may offer avenues for the development of safer antitrypanosomal drugs. Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of the eukaryotic ribosome1,2,3,4,5,6 reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic counterpart7,8, owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments9. The structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions, including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely into six pieces10,11,12, and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2066528969,"Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role in embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Dishevelled (Dvl) is a central mediator for both Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity pathways. NEDD4L, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to regulate ion channel activity, cell signaling, and cell polarity. Here, we report a novel role of NEDD4L in the regulation of Wnt signaling. NEDD4L induces Dvl2 polyubiquitination and targets Dvl2 for proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, the NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination of Dvl2 is Lys-6, Lys-27, and Lys-29 linked but not typical Lys-48-linked ubiquitination. Consistent with the role of Dvl in both Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, NEDD4L regulates the cellular β-catenin level and Rac1, RhoA, and JNK activities. We have further identified a hierarchical regulation that Wnt5a induces JNK-mediated phosphorylation of NEDD4L, which in turn promotes its ability to degrade Dvl2. Finally, we show that NEDD4L inhibits Dvl2-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos. Our work thus demonstrates that NEDD4L is a negative feedback regulator of Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2060904722,"Acyl-protein thioesterase-1 (APT1) and APT2 are cytosolic enzymes that catalyze depalmitoylation of membrane-anchored, palmitoylated H-Ras and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), respectively. However, the mechanism(s) of cytosol-membrane shuttling of APT1 and APT2, required for depalmitoylating their substrates H-Ras and GAP-43, respectively, remained largely unknown. Here, we report that both APT1 and APT2 undergo palmitoylation on Cys-2. Moreover, blocking palmitoylation adversely affects membrane localization of both APT1 and APT2 and that of their substrates. We also demonstrate that APT1 not only catalyzes its own depalmitoylation but also that of APT2 promoting dynamic palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) of both thioesterases. Furthermore, shRNA suppression of APT1 expression or inhibition of its thioesterase activity by palmostatin B markedly increased membrane localization of APT2, and shRNA suppression of APT2 had virtually no effect on membrane localization of APT1. In addition, mutagenesis of the active site Ser residue to Ala (S119A), which renders catalytic inactivation of APT1, also increased its membrane localization. Taken together, our findings provide insight into a novel mechanism by which dynamic palmitoylation links cytosol-membrane trafficking of APT1 and APT2 with that of their substrates, facilitating steady-state membrane localization and function of both."
https://openalex.org/W2066129630,"Intestinal vitamin C (Asc) absorption was believed to be mediated by the Na+-dependent ascorbic acid transporter SVCT1. However, Asc transport across the intestines of SVCT1 knock-out mice is normal indicating that alternative ascorbic acid transport mechanisms exist. To investigate these mechanisms, rodents were gavaged with Asc or its oxidized form dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), and plasma Asc concentrations were measured. Asc concentrations doubled following DHA but not Asc gavage. We hypothesized that the transporters responsible were facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs). Using Xenopus oocyte expression, we investigated whether facilitative glucose transporters GLUT2 and GLUT5–12 transported DHA. Only GLUT2 and GLUT8, known to be expressed in intestines, transported DHA with apparent transport affinities (Km) of 2.33 and 3.23 mm and maximal transport rates (Vmax) of 25.9 and 10.1 pmol/min/oocyte, respectively. Maximal rates for DHA transport mediated by GLUT2 and GLUT8 in oocytes were lower than maximal rates for 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Vmax of 224 and 32 pmol/min/oocyte for GLUT2 and GLUT8, respectively) and fructose (Vmax of 406 and 116 pmol/min/oocyte for GLUT2 and GLUT8, respectively). These findings may be explained by differences in the exofacial binding of substrates, as shown by inhibition studies with ethylidine glucose. DHA transport activity in GLUT2- and GLUT8-expressing oocytes was inhibited by glucose, fructose, and by the flavonoids phloretin and quercetin.

Asc oxidizes to DHA, which is either reduced enzymatically or chemically back to Asc, or irreversibly hydrolyzed to 2,3-diketogulonic acid, with loss of vitamin C activity (1Koshiishi I. Mamura Y.

The putative importance of Asc and DHA as physiologic substrates has been a subject of nutrition research for more than 60 years. Identification of Asc-specific and DHA-specific transporters has been vital to address the issue. Asc transport as such is now known to be mediated by at least two sodium-dependent Asc transporters, SVCT1, which is expressed in the intestine, liver, and kidney, and SVCT2, which is expressed in all other tissues (2Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. A family of mammalian Na+-dependent l-ascorbic acid transporters.Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Whether Asc alone or DHA was the substrate for tissue accumulation was addressed first by creating knock-out mice lacking the generally distributed tissue transporter SVCT2. If Asc was the necessary substrate, mice engineered to lack SVCT2 would be expected to have severe deficiency and/or not survive. If DHA played a role in Asc physiology, then knock-out SVCT2 mice should continue to have Asc accumulated in tissues. SVCT2 knock-out mice were observed to have severe generalized Asc deficiency and die at birth, indicating that Asc transport as such is necessary for tissue accumulation, at least in all tissues measured (3Sotiriou S. Gispert S. Cheng J. Wang Y. Chen A. Hoogstraten-Miller S. Miller G.F. Kwon O. Levine M. Guttentag S.H. Nussbaum R.L. Ascorbic acid transporter Slc23a1 is essential for vitamin C transport into the brain and for perinatal survival.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A corollary conclusion is that DHA transport is not a salvage pathway for generalized tissue accumulation. This conclusion is consistent with plasma measurements of Asc and DHA. Asc is the dominant species measured in plasma, whereas DHA plasma concentrations cannot be distinguished from zero (4Li H. Tu H. Wang Y. Levine M. Vitamin C in mouse and human red blood cells: an HPLC assay.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 426: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ascorbic acid dehydroascorbic acid facilitative glucose transporter mouse rat wild type; GLUT (di-leucine motif) mutant GLUT (di-alanine motif) human influenza hemagglutinin 2-deoxy-d-glucose duodenal cytochrome b561. Despite SVCT2 knock-out mouse data and plasma measurements, it remained possible that DHA had a tissue-specific physiologic role relevant to humans. To further explore this possibility, SVCT1 knock-out mice were created more recently (5Corpe C.P. Tu H. Eck P. Wang J. Faulhaber-Walter R. Schnermann J. Margolis S. Padayatty S. Sun H. Wang Y. Nussbaum R.L. Espey M.G. Levine M. Vitamin C transporter Slc23a1 links renal reabsorption, vitamin C tissue accumulation, and perinatal survival in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1069-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). One potential tissue-specific role for DHA transport is in the intestine. Although an intestinal epithelial transporter for Asc transport and absorption was identified as SVCT1 (2Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. A family of mammalian Na+-dependent l-ascorbic acid transporters.Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), supporting functional evidence was lacking. In fact, when Asc was administered orally by gavage to SVCT1 knock-out mice, blood Asc concentrations still increased (5Corpe C.P. Tu H. Eck P. Wang J. Faulhaber-Walter R. Schnermann J. Margolis S. Padayatty S. Sun H. Wang Y. Nussbaum R.L. Espey M.G. Levine M. Vitamin C transporter Slc23a1 links renal reabsorption, vitamin C tissue accumulation, and perinatal survival in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1069-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These data were consistent with the existence of an alternate pathway(s) for Asc intestinal absorption. One pathway could involve another unidentified sodium-dependent Asc transporter(s). Another pathway could involve intraluminal intestinal oxidation to DHA, DHA transport into enterocytes, and then internal reduction to Asc. Asc administered orally cures scurvy in animals and humans (6Oliveira J.E. Pearson W.N. Darby W.J. Clinical usefulness of the oral ascorbic acid tolerance test in scurvy.Am. J. Clin.

DHA given enterally in about 10-fold higher amounts compared with Asc reverses scurvy in guinea pigs and the ODS rat, neither of which synthesize Asc (8Ogiri Y. Sun F. Hayami S. Fujimura A.

These findings have two explanations, either DHA is reduced to Asc enterally in these animal models or DHA itself is transported. Until now, there has not been a clear molecular candidate to mediate DHA intestinal absorption. DHA is transported by facilitated GLUT transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 (10Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W.

Of note, GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 are not expressed on either the apical membrane or the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte in the gut. The major intestinal glucose-facilitated glucose transporters are GLUT2 and GLUT5, but these transporters do not appear to transport DHA when compared with GLUT1 and GLUT3 (10Rumsey S.C. Kwon O.

However, because GLUT1 and GLUT3 are high capacity DHA transporters, lower DHA transport activity by GLUT2 and GLUT5 could be obscured in comparison, as was the case for GLUT4 (11Rumsey S.C.

Alternatively, another facilitated glucose transporter could be responsible for DHA intestinal transport. For example, GLUT8 has recently been reported to be expressed in the intestine (12Romero A. Gomez O. Terrado J. Mesonero J.E. Expression of GLUT8 in mouse intestine: identification of alternative spliced variants.J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 106: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Data showing that DHA is transported by intestinal GLUT transporters is potentially meaningful, because it suggests DHA transport across the intestine could be blocked by dietary sugars. For these reasons, we compared DHA with Asc intestinal absorption in vivo using the same dose of each, and based on the findings, we investigated whether DHA was transported by facilitated intestinal sugar transporters GLUT2, -5, -7, and -8, and as well as GLUT6, and -9–12 (13Manolescu A.R.

All animal experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. After 1 week of acclimatization, rodents were fasted overnight with full access to water and gavaged with 12 mg of DHA, Asc, or water vehicle, and post-gavage blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Blood was centrifuged in heparin-treated plasma collector tubes (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C. Plasma was then diluted at 1:10 in 90% methanol plus 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Plasma Asc levels were analyzed by HPLC with coulometric electrochemical detection as described previously (14Washko P.W. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Ascorbic acid analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrochemical detection.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Treatments with alternative solutions were performed in each rat within a 2-week time span. At each time point, at least 10 animals were treated. Statistical significance between each treatment at individual time points was calculated by two-tailed paired t test. Rat GLUT1 was obtained as a plasmid constructs from G. I. Bell and C. F. Burant (University of Chicago). HA-tagged wild type human GLUT6 and mouse GLUT8 (GenBankTM accession numbers Y17802 and Y17803) containing the N-terminal di-leucine internalization motif, and HA-tagged mutant human GLUT6 and mutant mouse GLUT8 containing the di-leucine to di-alanine substitution (LL-AA) were obtained from H. Al-Hasani (University of Cologne). The HA tag was removed from GLUT6 and GLUT8 constructs using NcoI. Mutant rat GLUT8 containing the di-leucine to di-alanine substitution was obtained from B.

Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used for 24–32 amplification cycles, followed by a 20-min incubation with Taq polymerase. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel and subcloned into pGEM-Teasy (Promega). Substituting human GLUT9, -10, -11, and -12 N-terminal di-leucine motifs with di-alanine was undertaken using site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) and the following primers (mismatches underlined): human GLUT9 5′-GGCCAGGGAGGGCAGCCGCCGAGTGTGACCACCT-3′; human GLUT10 5′-TGTGTGCCTCTGTGTCTGCCGCCGGTGGCCTGAC-3′; human GLUT11 5′-CAGGGCAGGATCGCCGCCCTGACCATCTGCGCTG-3′; and human GLUT12 5′-ACCGAGGGCCCCAGTGCCGCCAACCAGAAGGGGA-3′. All cDNA sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis and injected with mRNA using established methods (18Soreq H. Seidman S. Xenopus oocyte microinjection: from gene to protein.Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, mature adult female frogs were anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (2 g/750 ml) in ice water. Frog ovaries were resected, and their ovarian lobes were opened and incubated in OR-2 without calcium (5 mm HEPES, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.8) with collagenase type IV (2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 23 °C. Individual oocytes were isolated and transferred to OR-2 containing 1 mm CaCl2 and maintained at 18–20 °C until injection with mRNA. GLUT mRNA was prepared by cutting plasmid vectors with appropriate restriction enzymes followed by in vitro transcription utilizing SP6, T7, or T3 mMessage, mMachine (Ambion). DHA transport in oocytes injected to express GLUT2 is controversial with some authors detecting transport above sham (19Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Mammalian facilitative hexose transporters mediate the transport of dehydroascorbic acid.Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), although others have not (10Rumsey S.C.

To provide more consistent transport data, especially for transporters with low transport activity, we therefore routinely poly(A)-tailed GLUT cRNA prior to oocyte injection (20Corpe C.P. Lee J.H.

Injection volumes were between 30 and 50 nl, and mRNA concentration 0.5–1 mg/ml. Post-injected oocytes were incubated at 20 °C in OR-2 containing 1 mm pyruvate with daily media changes. Experiments were performed on 3–5 days after oocytes were injected with mRNA. [14C]DHA was prepared from crystalline [14C]Asc (6.6 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (10Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of bromine solution (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY) was added to [14C]Asc solubilized in 600 μl of ultrapure water at a concentration of 20 mm. The solution was briefly vortexed and immediately purged with nitrogen on ice in the dark for 10 min. HPLC with electro-coulometric detection confirmed 100% conversion of [14C]Asc to DHA (14Washko P.W. Hartzell W.O. Levine M. Ascorbic acid analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrochemical detection.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Transport of [14C]DHA and 2-[1,2-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (26.2 mCi/mmol) was examined using groups of 10–20 oocytes injected to express GLUTs or water-injected sham oocytes at 23 °C in OR-2 containing different concentrations of freshly prepared [14C]DHA (0.6–5.5 μCi/ml) or sugar (0.5–1 μCi/ml labeled sugar with added nonlabeled sugar) for 10 min. After incubation in uptake medium, oocytes were immediately washed four times with ice-cold PBS solution. Inhibitors were added to the incubation medium as described in the text. Individual oocytes were dissolved in 500 μl of 10% SDS, and internalized radioactivity was measured using scintillation spectrometry. Data are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.D. of 10–20 oocytes at each data point, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test. Transport kinetics were analyzed by best fit analysis of the data points in SigmaPlot using the nonlinear regression analysis equation Y = Vmax·X/Kt + X. IC50 values for inhibition of DHA transport were determined in SigmaPlot using the nonlinear regression analysis equation, y = min + (max − min)/1 + (x/IC50) − Hill slope four-parameter logistic curve. To compare Asc and DHA intestinal transport capacities, we examined their transport across rodent small intestine in vivo. Rats were gavaged with 12 mg of Asc, DHA, or PBS vehicle, and the appearance of Asc in peripheral blood was determined by HPLC. DHA gavage resulted in a rapid increase in plasma Asc concentrations, rising from a base line of 45 to 120 μm within 1 h of the DHA gavage (Fig. 1). In contrast, Asc gavage resulted in a modest increase in plasma Asc levels, from base line rising to ∼70 μm within 1–2 h of the gavage. Vehicle gavage had no effect on plasma Asc levels, which remained at base line 0–2 h after the PBS gavage (Fig. 1). To identify candidate intestinal DHA transporters, we next investigated the DHA transport properties of GLUT1, -2, and -5–12. Previous studies (16Ibberson M. Uldry M. Thorens B. GLUTX1, a novel mammalian glucose transporter expressed in the central nervous system and insulin-sensitive tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4607-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) had shown that mutating the N-terminal di-leucine motif in rat GLUT8 to a di-alanine motif was necessary for plasma membrane expression and functional characterization in oocytes; we therefore studied the transport properties of selected human wild type (di-leucine) and mutant (di-alanine) GLUTs in injected oocytes. mRNA encoding the individual isoforms were injected into oocytes, and 3–5 days post-injection, oocytes expressing putative GLUTs were incubated with 300 μm [14C]DHA for 10 min, and radiolabeled uptake was assessed. GLUT1 mRNA was injected into oocytes and served as a positive control for GLUT-mediated DHA transport. 1 mm 2-[3H]DG uptake was also studied and served as a test for the expression of functional sugar transporters. DHA uptake into oocytes expressing human GLUT2, rat GLUT8 (LL-AA), and wild type and mutant mouse GLUT8 (LL-AA) was 5–10-fold greater than the sham-injected oocytes (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous reports (10Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), DHA uptake into oocytes expressing GLUT1 was 100-fold greater than the sham control (Fig. 2A). DHA transport into GLUT5, -6, -7, -9, -10, -11, and -12 oocytes did not differ from the sham control. Radiolabeled 2-DG uptake into oocytes expressing GLUT1 and -2, rat GLUT8 (LL-AA), and wild type and mutant mouse GLUT8 was significantly greater than sham-injected oocytes (Fig. 2B). In contrast, radiolabeled 2-DG uptake in oocytes injected with mouse GLUT8 HA and wild type and mutant GLUT6, -7, -9, -10, -11, and -12 mRNA was not significantly different than the sham control. On a mole for mole basis, 2-DG and DHA uptake was similar in GLUT1-expressing oocytes, whereas for GLUT2-expressing oocytes 2-DG uptake was ∼30-fold greater than DHA, and for GLUT8 expressing oocytes 2-DG uptake was ∼5-fold greater than DHA. We next studied the kinetics of DHA, 2-DG, and d-fructose transport in GLUT2- and GLUT8-expressing oocytes. Oocytes injected to express GLUT2 and GLUT8 were incubated with different concentrations of [14C]DHA, 2-[3H]DG, and [14C]fructose for 10 min, and intracellular uptake of radiolabeled substrate was quantified. DHA, 2-DG, and d-fructose uptake into oocytes expressing GLUT2 (Fig. 3, A–C) and GLUT8 (Fig. 4, A–C) demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Apparent transport kinetics was determined by nonlinear regression analysis. For GLUT2-mediated DHA uptake (Fig. 3A), the apparent Vmax was 25.9 pmol/min/oocyte, and the Km was 2.33 mm. For GLUT2-mediated 2-DG uptake (Fig. 3B), the apparent Vmax was 224 pmol/min/oocytes and the Km was 25 mm. For GLUT2-mediated fructose uptake (Fig. 3C), the apparent Vmax was 406 pmol/min/oocytes and Km was 108 mm. The differences in GLUT2 transport affinities and maximal rates for DHA, 2-DG, and fructose cannot be attributed to differences in the expression level of the transporter protein on the oocyte plasma membrane. This is because for each experimental condition oocytes were injected and incubated in an identical manner, indicating that there must be intrinsic differences in the exofacial binding, transmembrane translocation, or endofacial binding of DHA, 2-DG, and fructose by GLUT2.FIGURE 4DHA, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and d-fructose transport kinetics in GLUT8-injected oocytes. Oocytes previously injected with GLUT8 mRNA were incubated for 10 min with 0–8 mm [14C]DHA (A), 0–100 mm 2-[3H]DG (B), and 0–300 mm d-[14C]fructose (C). Oocytes were then washed, and intracellular radioactivity was quantified. A best fit curve was fitted to the collected data using the nonlinear regression function Y = Vmax·X/Kt + X (SigmaPlot). Data represent mean ± S.D. of 10–20 oocytesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For GLUT8-mediated DHA uptake (Fig. 4A), the apparent Vmax was 10.1 pmol/min/oocyte, and the Km was 3.23 mm. For GLUT8-mediated 2-DG uptake (Fig. 4B), the apparent Vmax was 32.7 pmol/min/oocytes, and the Km was 10.3 mm. For GLUT8-mediated fructose uptake (Fig. 4C), the apparent Vmax was 116 pmol/min/oocytes, and the Km was 96 mm. Similar to GLUT2, the differences in the transport kinetics of GLUT8 for its substrates are most likely to be due to differences in substrate binding or translocation. Transport affinities (Km) for DHA were similar in GLUT2- (Fig. 3A) and GLUT8 (Fig. 4A)-expressing oocytes; however, the maximal transport rate (Vmax) for DHA uptake mediated by GLUT2 was 2-fold greater than that of GLUT8. This is unlikely to be due to differences between the protein expression levels of GLUT2 and GLUT8 in oocytes, because the maximal transport rates for 2-DG and fructose by GLUT2 were not 2-fold greater than GLUT8-mediated 2-DG and fructose uptake (2-DG uptake by GLUT2 was 7-fold higher than GLUT8, and d-fructose uptake by GLUT2 was 4-fold higher than GLUT8). It also unlikely to be due to intracellular reduction of DHA to Asc becoming rate-limiting for DHA transport, because previous studies have shown that intracellular accumulation of up to 1250 pmol of DHA/min/oocyte is rapidly (<10 min) and completely reduced to Asc (10Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Differences in the exofacial and endofacial binding affinities of GLUT2 and GLUT8 for DHA were investigated. Oocytes expressing GLUT2 or GLUT8 were incubated with 300 μm [14C]DHA in the presence of increasing concentrations of the exofacial glucose transporter inhibitor 4,6-O-ethylidene glucose (Fig. 5A) or increasing concentrations of the endofacial glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B (Fig. 5B). Intracellular uptake of radiolabeled DHA in the presence of inhibitors was quantified, and best fit curves were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis. The IC50 values for 4,6-O-ethylidene glucose inhibition of GLUT2- and GLUT8-mediated DHA uptake were 14 and 12 mm, respectively. The IC50 values for cytochalasin B inhibition of GLUT2- and GLUT8-mediated DHA uptake were 1 and 1.42 μm, respectively. These results suggest DHA binding to the external and internal face of GLUT2 and GLUT8 is comparable. Furthermore, these data suggest that the difference in the apparent maximal transport rates of GLUT2 and GLUT8 for DHA is due to differences in the transmembrane translocation of the substrate. The in vivo relevance of GLUT2- and GLUT8-mediated DHA transport is dependent on oxidation of Asc to DHA and on the presence or absence of other substrates that could inhibit transport. To test whether DHA uptake by GLUT2 and GLUT8 could occur under physiologically relevant concentrations of glucose and fructose, oocytes expressing GLUT2 or GLUT8 were incubated for 10 min with 300 μm [14C]DHA in the presence of increasing concentrations of d-glucose and d-fructose (Fig. 6, A and B). The IC50 values for glucose inhibition of GLUT2- and GLUT8-mediated DHA uptake were 0.366 and 0.122 mm, respectively. The IC50 value for fruct"

Insulin resistance reflects impairments in insulin signaling, but mechanisms involved are unclear because current research is fragmented. We report a systems level mechanistic understanding of insulin resistance, using systems wide and internally consistent data from human adipocytes. Based on quantitative steady-state and dynamic time course data on signaling intermediaries, normally and in diabetes, we developed a dynamic mathematical model of insulin signaling. The model structure and parameters are identical in the normal and diabetic states of the model, except for three parameters that change in diabetes: (i) reduced concentration of insulin receptor, (ii) reduced concentration of insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and (iii) changed feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin in complex with raptor (mTORC1). Modeling reveals that at the core of insulin resistance in human adipocytes is attenuation of a positive feedback from mTORC1 to the insulin receptor substrate-1, which explains reduced sensitivity and signal strength throughout the signaling network. Model simulations with inhibition of mTORC1 are comparable with experimental data on inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in human adipocytes. We demonstrate the potential of the model for identification of drug targets, e.g. increasing the feedback restores insulin signaling, both at the cellular level and, using a multilevel model, at the whole body level. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in an expanded adipose tissue results from cell growth restriction to prevent cell necrosis.

Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in an expanded adipose tissue results from cell growth restriction to prevent cell necrosis. Insulin is a prime controller of energy homeostasis in the human body. Dysfunction in the insulin control perturbs energy homeostasis with consequences in the form of disease such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) 3The abbreviations used are: T2Dtype 2 diabetesIRinsulin receptormTORmammalian target of rapamycinmTORC1mTOR in complex with raptormTORC2mTOR in complex with rictorPKBprotein kinase B/AktS6K1p70S6 protein kinaseGLUT4insulin-regulated glucose transporter. and its corollaries cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Insulin control of target cells is relayed from the insulin receptor (IR) at the cell surface to different cellular processes, such as glucose uptake and protein synthesis, through an intracellular signaling network. In obesity the expanding adipose tissue, for poorly understood reasons, responds to the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the adipocytes with a resistance to the hormone. Energy homeostasis is tolerably maintained despite insulin resistance in the adipose, muscle, and liver tissues as the insulin producing β-cells compensate by releasing more insulin. Eventually, after many years, the β-cells often fail to compensate and T2D can be diagnosed. Present understanding of insulin signaling is based on identification and sequencing of individual signaling intermediaries in a wide variety of different cell types and model organisms. There are many observations of differences between signaling in diabetic and normal target tissues of insulin, but there is neither consensus on their relative importance nor on how they relate to each other. We need a systems approach to examine and understand insulin resistance, where systems wide quantitative data are obtained in a consistent fashion and analyzed using mathematical modeling. Earlier models of insulin signaling are based on limited data and data from different cell types, and parameter values are often arbitrarily chosen (1Nyman E. Cedersund G. Strålfors P. Insulin signaling. Mathematical modeling comes of age.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 23: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Important examples of experimental and modeling analyses that have provided mechanistic insights into insulin signaling are insulin binding to its receptor (2Kiselyov V.V. Versteyhe S. Gauguin L.

The model required both internalization of the receptor and a feedback from IRS1 to IR to explain experimental data. However, no analysis is available for the insulin-signaling network in adipocytes, normally and in T2D, as reviewed in Ref. 1Nyman E. Cedersund G. Strålfors P. Insulin signaling. Mathematical modeling comes of age.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 23: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. We now report a quantitative and comprehensive systems analysis of insulin signaling dynamics normally and in T2D. This systems analysis rests on two pillars: (i) collection of dynamic and steady-state data of key signaling intermediaries in primary human mature adipocytes from non-diabetic individuals and, in parallel, from obese patients with T2D; and (ii) mathematical modeling analysis that translates the systems wide data to systems wide mechanistic insights. Our analyses indicate that almost all signaling intermediaries are altered in T2D, and that most alterations may be explained by a single original effect: attenuation of a positive feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in complex with raptor (mTORC1) to IRS1. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Procedures have been approved by the ethics board, Linköping University, and were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Subcutaneous fat was obtained from elective abdominal surgery during general anesthesia. A slice of subcutaneous tissue from skin to muscle fascia was excised. Subjects were recruited consecutively from elective surgery at the University Hospital in Linköping-Norrköping. To ensure inclusion only of patients with T2D related to obesity, they were selected when diagnosed with T2D and as obese or overweight (BMI > 27). In the comparison group, the only selection criterion for non-diabetic subjects was that they were not diagnosed with diabetes (supplemental Table S1). Thus, there will be some obese insulin-resistant subjects in the non-diabetic comparison group. This approach allows for examination of the common obesity-related type 2 diabetes and for a wide significance of the results. We have earlier found that there is no difference in the response to insulin between adipocytes from male and female patients with T2D (5Danielsson A. Ost A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J.

Cell incubations were terminated by separating cells from medium using centrifugation through dinonyl phtalate. To minimize postincubation signaling and protein modifications cells were immediately dissolved in SDS and β-mercaptoethanol with protease and protein phosphatase inhibitors, frozen within 10 s, and thawed in boiling water for further processing, as described (6Strålfors P.

The linearity of the chemiluminescence signal to the amount of each specific protein was ascertained after adjusting the concentration of primary and secondary antibodies used in the immunoblottings. β-Tubulin or actin was used as a loading control and all samples were normalized for the amount of β-tubulin or actin. For comparison of the level of phosphorylation between non-diabetic and diabetic subjects a standard mixture of adipocyte proteins was run in duplicate on each gel in order that all samples were normalized to the mean intensity of the corresponding phosphorylated protein in the standard mixture. After transfer of cells to medium without glucose cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of insulin for 15 min, and then 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose (10 μCi/ml) was added at a final concentration of 50 μm. Glucose transport was then determined as uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose during 30 min (7Frost S.C. Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. Effect of phenylarsine oxide on insulin-dependent protein phosphorylation and glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9872-9876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As uptake in human primary mature adipocytes is linear for at least 30 min (5Danielsson A. Ost A. Lystedt E. Kjolhede P. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. Insulin resistance in human adipocytes downstream of IRS1 after surgical cell isolation, but at the level of phosphorylation of IRS1 in type 2 diabetes.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the rate of uptake is constant and accumulated uptake of glucose is a measure of the rate of glucose uptake. All experimental values are mean ± S.E. for the indicated number (n) of cell preparations, which is the same as number of different subjects. We used ordinary differential equations to create the mechanistic model of insulin signaling (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). For model simplicity we primarily used mass-action kinetics and, only when required to explain the data, Hill/Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A simple example of an ordinary differential equation underlying Fig. 1B is shown in Equation 1, d(IRins)dt=k1a×insulin×IRm-k1c×IRins(Eq. 1) where k1a and k1c are rate constants. All model equations are given in the supplemental text, Section 2. Before simulating stimulation of cells by insulin, a steady-state simulation was performed to ensure steady-state initial conditions at basal conditions according to experimental data. We did not change the model parameters between steady-state and the stimulated state. Absolute concentrations are not known and therefore the total amount of each protein was set to 100%, except as indicated in the diabetic state of the model. The values of the model parameters are not possible to determine experimentally for the system we study. We thus used an optimization algorithm to test different values of the parameters within realistic limits, and then evaluated the agreement between the simulated output of the model and the experimental data. The optimization is centered around a cost function, V(p), that for the quantitative agreement with experimental data is given by the sum of least squares, V(p)=∑i=1N(y(i)-y^(i,p))2SE(i)2(Eq. 2) where y(i) contains the experimental data points, ŷ(i,p) the simulated output of the model for the parameter vector p, and SE(i) is the mean ± S.E. of the experimental data. The index i of the summation of least squares includes all measured proteins for all measured time points. For the optimization we used the Systems Biology Toolbox for Matlab (8Schmidt H. Jirstrand M. Systems Biology Toolbox for MATLAB. A computational platform for research in systems biology.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 514-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and its simannealingSBAO function, which is a combination of a global simulated annealing approach with a local, but not gradient-based, downhill simplex approach. The models and a complete description of the modeling are available in the supplemental material. We investigated the signaling of insulin to control of glucose transport and protein synthesis (Fig. 1A) in primary human mature adipocytes. We determined glucose uptake and the state of phosphorylation of intermediary signal transducing proteins in response to insulin at (i) quasi steady-state conditions using different concentrations of insulin to determine the sensitivity to insulin, 4Insulin sensitivity/resistance sometimes refers to the magnitude of the maximal insulin response. Herein we have restricted it to refer to the concentration of insulin that produces a half-maximal response, such that higher insulin sensitivity and lower insulin resistance results in a left-shift in the dose-response curve to lower concentrations of insulin and lower EC50 values. Lower insulin sensitivity and higher insulin resistance consequently refer to a right-shift to higher EC50 values. and (ii) the dynamics of insulin signaling by determining the extent of phosphorylation at different time points in response to maximal insulin stimulation (Fig. 2, blue symbols). A visual inspection of the data identifies some features of the signaling pathways. First, there is a marked increase in insulin sensitivity (decreased EC50) at two steps: (i) from IR autophosphorylation to phosphorylation of IRS1 by IR, and (ii) from phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) at Thr-308 to phosphorylation of AS160 (Fig. 2, summarized in Fig. 3, A and C). At the steps from phosphorylation of IRS1 to phosphorylation of PKB at Thr-308, and from phosphorylation of AS160 to enhanced glucose uptake, on the other hand, there are no changes in sensitivity to insulin (Fig. 2, summarized in Fig. 3, A and C). Second, the response time to insulin, to reach half steady-state effect (t½) remains short throughout the pathway to glucose uptake, and quasi steady-states are established after <5 min and last for at least 60 min (Fig. 2, summarized in Table 1). Furthermore, IR and IRS1 phosphorylation exhibit overshoot behavior that peaks at around 1.5 min, before it reaches steady-state (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Summary of insulin responses for phosphorylation of different signaling intermediaries and for glucose uptakeSensitivity EC50Response timeBasal levelSteady-state levelNormalaNormal, non-diabetic controls.T2DNormalT2DNormalT2DNormalT2Dnm insulint 1/2 minFold-over basal controlFold-over basal controlIR-YP0.951.21.0NDbND, not determined.10.84.31.5IRS1-YP0.282.41.0ND10.22.61.0IRS1-S307P0.230.850.72.010.64.41.9PKB-T308P0.300.41NDND10.75.05.0PKB-S473P0.100.381.01.011.05.05.0AS160-T642P0.0210.231.52.010.42.91.3Glucose uptake0.0370.17NDND10.32.11.0S6K1-T389PNDND7.57.510.74.12.6S6-S235P/S236P0.3ND1511.54.32.5a Normal, non-diabetic controls.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In addition to the signaling pathway leading to control of glucose uptake, we determined signaling through the components of the signaling branch mTORC1-S6K1-S6 that mediates insulin control of protein synthesis (Fig. 1A). Activation of mTORC1 by insulin is complex and as a minimum involves PKB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation of TSC2, as well as PKB-catalyzed phosphorylation and mTORC1-catalyzed autophosphorylation of the mTORC1 component PRAS40 (reviewed in Ref. 9Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). We therefore followed the activation of mTORC1 as phosphorylation of p70S6 protein kinase-1 (S6K1) and its substrate the ribosomal protein S6 (S6), which serve as sequential readouts of mTORC1 activity (Fig. 2). We have in human adipocytes earlier identified a rapamycin-sensitive, positive feedback signal from insulin activation of mTORC1 to phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-307 (corresponding to Ser-302 in the murine sequence) (10Danielsson A.

Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although existence of the feedback signal is undisputed, its importance in human adipocytes and whether it represents a positive or negative feedback has remained unsettled (reviewed in Ref. 16Copps K.D. White M.F. Regulation of insulin sensitivity by serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin recceptor substrate proteins IRS1 and IRS2.Diabetologia. 2012; 55: 2565-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). We also examined the response of the different signaling intermediaries to insulin in adipocytes obtained from patients diagnosed with T2D (Fig. 2, red symbols). Considering the same basic features as above for the insulin signaling pathway to control glucose transport normally, the diabetic state displays a reduced sensitivity to insulin (up to 10 times higher EC50 than in non-diabetic state) for all states except for autophosphorylation of IR, and phosphorylation of PKB at Thr-308 where the effect is small (Fig. 2, summarized in Fig. 3). Conversely, the data do not reveal any significant differences in the response time to insulin for any of the intermediaries. However, phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 display a much slower response to insulin, both normally and in T2D, than the likewise mTORC1 downstream phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-307 (Fig. 2, Table 1). A further important feature of the diabetic state concerns the steady-state level of phosphorylation of the different signaling intermediaries in response to maximal insulin concentrations. Except for phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473, there is a marked and consistent reduction of the steady-state phosphorylation of all signaling intermediaries in the diabetic compared with normal cells (Fig. 2, Table 1). A key feature of insulin resistance in the diabetic state is that activation of mTORC1 by insulin is attenuated in adipocytes from diabetic subjects. This attenuation of mTORC1 activation in T2D is demonstrated by (i) attenuation of mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-307 (Fig. 2, c2 and d2), and of S6K1 (Fig. 2, d4) and its substrate S6 (Fig. 2, d5), (ii) by the loss of mTORC1 inhibition of autophagy (13Ost A.

Attenuated mTOR signaling and enhanced autophagy in adipocytes from obese patients with type 2 diabetes.Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and (iii) impaired maintenance of mitochondrial function (13Ost A. Svensson K. Ruishalme I. Brännmark C. Franck N. Krook H.

Med. 2010; 16: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We analyzed the experimental data using modeling in two stages: first using minimal modeling based on specific qualitative observations, and then, in a second stage, by the construction of a detailed dynamic model based on all the data. The minimal modeling approach is a valuable and independent analysis, which we undertook for several reasons. First, large scale data sets, as shown in Fig. 2, result in big models with a corresponding high-dimensional parameter space that is more or less impossible to search in an exhaustive manner. Therefore model predictions will not be unique conclusions based solely on the data and the chosen model structure (so-called core predictions (3Brännmark C. Palmér R. Glad S.T. Cedersund G.

New definitions and a general method.FEBS J. 2012; 279: 3513-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), but also depend on the arbitrarily chosen parameter values. Minimal models with few parameters, on the other hand, have the advantage that they can be analyzed with unique predictions. Second, hypothesis testing with minimal models is an approach centered on rejections, which are strong conclusions that constitute valuable insights drawn from data. We have already developed a minimal model for the IR-IRS1 subsystem (Mifa in Ref. 3Brännmark C. Palmér R. Glad S.T. Cedersund G. Strålfors P. Mass and information feedbacks through receptor endocytosis govern insulin signaling as revealed using a parameter-free modeling framework.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20171-20179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which involves insulin-controlled phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 and only a feedback from an unknown downstream intermediate X to dephosphorylation of IR. The state X describes an unspecified feedback from IRS1 to IR. Additionally, for the IR-IRS1 subsystem we can identify key qualitative experimental observations that are well determined and that involve the appearance of insulin resistance: IR exhibits a clearly reduced steady-state phosphorylation in T2D (Fig. 4A) but the sensitivity to insulin is not affected (Fig. 2, a1). IRS1, on the other hand, exhibits both reduced steady-state phosphorylation (Fig. 2, b2) and reduced sensitivity to insulin (Fig. 4A). For these reasons we undertook a minimal modeling approach to identify mechanistic differences between normal and T2D signaling that can or cannot explain these qualitative observations. We first analyzed the ability of a reduction in amount of IR (as it is reduced to 55% of normal in T2D adipocytes (12Danielsson A. Fagerholm S. Ost A. Franck N. Kjolhede P. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P.

More specifically, we used all parameters determined for the Mifa model (3Brännmark C. Palmér R. Glad S.T. Cedersund G. Strålfors P.

Small molecule γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) have emerged as potential disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease because they reduce the formation of Aβ42 while not blocking the processing of γ-secretase substrates. We developed clickable GSM photoaffinity probes with the goal of identifying the target of various classes of GSMs and to better understand their mechanism of action. Here, we demonstrate that the photoaffinity probe E2012-BPyne specifically labels the N-terminal fragment of presenilin-1 (PS1-NTF) in cell membranes as well as in live cells and primary neuronal cultures. The labeling is competed in the presence of the parent imidazole GSM E2012, but not with acid GSM-1, allosteric GSI BMS-708163, or substrate docking site peptide inhibitor pep11, providing evidence that these compounds have distinct binding sites. Surprisingly, we found that the cross-linking of E2012-BPyne to PS1-NTF is significantly enhanced in the presence of the active site-directed GSI L-685,458 (L458). In contrast, L458 does not affect the labeling of the acid GSM photoprobe GSM-5. We also observed that E2012-BPyne specifically labels PS1-NTF (active γ-secretase) but not full-length PS1 (inactive γ-secretase) in ANP.24 cells. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that multiple binding sites within the γ-secretase complex exist, each of which may contribute to different modes of modulatory action. Furthermore, the enhancement of PS1-NTF labeling by E2012-BPyne in the presence of L458 suggests a degree of cooperativity between the active site of γ-secretase and the modulatory binding site of certain GSMs. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce neurotoxic β-amyloid peptides (i.e. Aβ42) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.

The genesis of a heterogeneous pool of Aβ peptides occurs via sequential proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two aspartyl proteases: β-secretase followed by C-terminal cleavage within the membrane by γ-secretase (3De Strooper B.

The NSAID-derived GSMs selectively lower the formation of Aβ42 with a concomitant increase in the generation of Aβ38, with little to no effect on the proteolysis of other γ-secretase substrates such as Notch. These compounds were important chemical tools that provided evidence that γ-secretase could be modulated to reduce the more pathogenic Aβ42 species, but that the in vitro potencies are weak (Aβ42 IC50 > 50 μm) and brain penetration is limited. Several next generation NSAID-like GSMs with improved in vitro potency and brain penetration have recently been reported, including GSM-1, GSM-10h, and JNJ-40418677 (17Page R.M. Baumann K. Tomioka M.

Although significant progress has occurred with regard to the identification and characterization of GSMs with drug-like properties, the location of the GSM binding site(s) and the mechanism that confers the selective modulation is not well understood. NSAID-derived GSMs have been proposed to selectively bind to the C-terminal fragment of APP within the Aβ region (24Kukar T.L. Ladd T.B. Bann M.A. Fraering P.C. Narlawar R. Maharvi G.M. Healy B.

However, this proposal has been disputed because these NSAID-based GSMs are prone to form aggregates that can bind nonspecifically to Aβ (26Barrett P.J. Sanders C.R. Kaufman S.A. Michelsen K.

The exact target of the imidazole GSM series is also controversial. Recently, an immobilized imidazole GSM derivative based on NGP 555 was reported to bind to Pen-2 (21Kounnas M.Z. Danks A.M. Cheng S. Tyree C. Ackerman E. Zhang X. Ahn K. Nguyen P. Comer D. Mao L. Yu C. Pleynet D. Digregorio P.J. Velicelebi G. Stauderman K.A. Comer W.T. Mobley W.C. Li Y.M. Sisodia S.S. Tanzi R.E.

In contrast, a biotinylated photoaffinity probe based on the imidazole GSM RO-57 was found to specifically label PS1-NTF and PS2-NTF (22Ebke A. Luebbers T. Fukumori A. Shirotani K. Haass C.

Clearly, more research is needed to further clarify the mechanism and binding sites of these GSMs. Here, we demonstrate that the photoaffinity probe E2012-BPyne derived from the imidazole GSM E2012 specifically labels PS1-NTF in cell membranes. We observed similar results when live HeLa cells or primary neuronal cultures were photolabeled with E2012-BPyne. Moreover, the labeling of PS1-NTF is not competed by the acid GSM-1. We also observed that the labeling of PS1-NTF by E2012-BPyne is enhanced in the presence of the active site-directed GSI L458. Taken together, our results provide evidence for multiple binding sites within the active γ-secretase complex that confer specific and selective modulatory effects on lowering pathogenic species of Aβ.

https://openalex.org/W2099402594,"Optovin is a small molecule that renders zebrafish embryos responsive to light through generation of singlet oxygen and activation of the TrpA1b channel, providing a new tool for optogenetics. Optogenetics is a powerful research tool because it enables high-resolution optical control of neuronal activity. However, current optogenetic approaches are limited to transgenic systems expressing microbial opsins and other exogenous photoreceptors. Here, we identify optovin, a small molecule that enables repeated photoactivation of motor behaviors in wild-type zebrafish and mice. To our surprise, optovin's behavioral effects are not visually mediated. Rather, photodetection is performed by sensory neurons expressing the cation channel TRPA1. TRPA1 is both necessary and sufficient for the optovin response. Optovin activates human TRPA1 via structure-dependent photochemical reactions with redox-sensitive cysteine residues. In animals with severed spinal cords, optovin treatment enables control of motor activity in the paralyzed extremities by localized illumination. These studies identify a light-based strategy for controlling endogenous TRPA1 receptors in vivo, with potential clinical and research applications in nontransgenic animals, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2104720671,"Caspase-9 has two splice variants, pro-apoptotic caspase-9a and anti-apoptotic caspase-9b, which are regulated by RNA trans-factors associated with exon 3 of caspase-9 pre-mRNA (C9/E3). In this study, we identified hnRNP U as an RNA trans-factor associated with C9/E3. Down-regulation of hnRNP U led to a decrease in the caspase-9a/9b mRNA ratio, demonstrating a novel enhancing function. Importantly, hnRNP U bound specifically to C9/E3 at an RNA cis-element previously reported as the binding site for the splicing repressor, hnRNP L. Phosphorylated hnRNP L interfered with hnRNP U binding to C9/E3, and our results demonstrate the importance of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway in modulating the association of hnRNP U to C9/E3. Taken together, these findings show that hnRNP U competes with hnRNP L for binding to C9/E3 to enhance the inclusion of the four-exon cassette, and this splice-enhancing function is blocked by the AKT pathway via phosphorylation of hnRNP L."
https://openalex.org/W2144171586,"Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins are intracellular effectors of Wnt signaling that have essential roles in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. It has long been known that Wnts stimulate Dvl phosphorylation, but relatively little is known about its functional significance. We have previously reported that both Wnt3a and Wnt5a induce Dvl2 phosphorylation that is associated with an electrophoretic mobility shift and loss of recognition by monoclonal antibody 10B5. In the present study, we mapped the 10B5 epitope to a 16-amino acid segment of human Dvl2 (residues 594–609) that contains four Ser/Thr residues. Alanine substitution of these residues (P4m) eliminated the mobility shift induced by either Wnt3a or Wnt5a. The Dvl2 P4m mutant showed a modest increase in canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity relative to wild type. Consistent with this finding, Dvl2 4Pm preferentially localized to cytoplasmic puncta. In contrast to wild-type Dvl2, however, the P4m mutant was unable to rescue Wnt3a-dependent neurite outgrowth in TC-32 cells following suppression of endogenous Dvl2/3. Earlier work has implicated casein kinase 1δ/ϵ as responsible for the Dvl mobility shift, and a CK1δ in vitro kinase assay confirmed that Ser594, Thr595, and Ser597 of Dvl2 are CK1 targets. Alanine substitution of these three residues was sufficient to abrogate the Wnt-dependent mobility shift. Thus, we have identified a cluster of Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal domain of Dvl2 that are Wnt-induced phosphorylation (WIP) sites. Our results indicate that phosphorylation at the WIP sites reduces Dvl accumulation in puncta and attenuates β-catenin signaling, whereas it enables noncanonical signaling that is required for neurite outgrowth.

https://openalex.org/W2017890252,"ROCK1 and ROCK2 mediate important processes such as cell migration, invasion and metastasis, making them good targets for the development of antitumor agents. Recently, using a fragment-based approach and X-ray crystallography, we reported on the design and synthesis of novel Rho-kinase inhibitors (RKIs). Here, we selected a pair of RKIs, the closely related structural analogs RKI-18 (potent; IC50 values of 397 nM (ROCK1) and 349 nM (ROCK2)) and RKI-11 (weak/inactive; IC50 values of 38 μM (ROCK1) and 45 μM (ROCK2)), as chemical probes and determined their effects on cytoskeleton organization, signaling, apoptosis, anchorage-dependent and independent growth, migration and invasion. RKI-18 but not RKI-11 suppresses potently the phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) in intact human breast, lung, colon and prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, RKI-18 is highly selective at decreasing the levels of P-MLC2 over those of P-Akt, P-S6 and P-Erk ½. RKI-18 suppresses ROCK-mediated actin fiber formation, following stimulation with LPA as well as p21-activated kinase (PAK)-mediated lamellipodia and filopodia formation following bradykinin or PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth of human breast cancer cells. The fact that the active ROCK inhibitor RKI-18, but not the inactive closely related structural analog RKI-11 is effective at suppressing malignant transformation suggests that inhibition of ROCK with RKI-18 results in preventing migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. The potential of this class of RKIs as anti-tumor agents warrants further advanced preclinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2055644950,"The serine/threonine kinase AKT is a key mediator of cancer cell survival. We demonstrate that transient glucose deprivation modestly induces AKT phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473. In contrast, prolonged glucose deprivation induces selective AKTThr308 phosphorylation and phosphorylation of a distinct subset of AKT downstream targets leading to cell survival under metabolic stress. Glucose-deprivation-induced AKTThr308 phosphorylation is dependent on PDK1 and PI3K but not EGF receptor or IGF1R. Prolonged glucose deprivation induces the formation of a complex of AKT, PDK1 and the GRP78 chaperone protein, directing phosphorylation of AKTThr308 but not AKTSer473. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of AKT activation under prolonged glucose deprivation that protects cells from metabolic stress. The selective activation of AKTThr308 phosphorylation that occurs during prolonged nutrient deprivation may provide an unexpected opportunity for the development and implementation of drugs targeting cell metabolism and aberrant AKT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2082353756,"The inducible proto-oncogenic (c-Fos:c-Jun)/AP-1 transcription complex binds 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-responsive elements (TRE) in its target genes. It is tightly controlled at multiple levels to avoid the deleterious effects of its inappropriate activation. In particular, SUMOylation represses its transactivation capacity in transient reporter assays using constitutively expressed proteins. This led to the presumption that (c-Fos:c-Jun)/AP-1 SUMOylation would be required to turn-off transcription of its target genes, as proposed for various transcription factors. Instead, thanks to the generation of an antibody specific for SUMO-modified c-Fos, we provide here direct evidence that SUMOylated c-Fos is present on a stably integrated reporter TPA-inducible promoter at the onset of transcriptional activation and colocalizes with RNA polymerase II within chromatin. Interestingly, (c-Fos:c-Jun)/AP-1 SUMOylation limits reporter gene induction, as well as the appearance of active transcription-specific histone marks on its promoter. Moreover, non-SUMOylatable mutant (c-Fos:c-Jun)/AP-1 dimers accumulate to higher levels on their target promoter, suggesting that SUMOylation might facilitate the release of (c-Fos:c-Jun)/AP-1 from promoters. Finally, activation of GADD153, an AP-1 target gene, is also associated with a rapid increase in SUMOylation at the level of its TRE and c-Fos SUMOylation dampens its induction by TPA. Taken together, our data suggest that SUMOylation could serve to buffer transcriptional activation of AP-1 target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2048607735,"F1-ATPase is the catalytic complex of rotary nanomotor ATP synthases. Bacterial ATP synthases can be autoinhibited by the C-terminal domain of subunit ε, which partially inserts into the enzyme's central rotor cavity to block functional subunit rotation. Using a kinetic, optical assay of F1·ε binding and dissociation, we show that formation of the extended, inhibitory conformation of ε (εX) initiates after ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic dwell step. Prehydrolysis conditions prevent formation of the εX state, and post-hydrolysis conditions stabilize it. We also show that ε inhibition and ADP inhibition are distinct, competing processes that can follow the catalytic dwell. We show that the N-terminal domain of ε is responsible for initial binding to F1 and provides most of the binding energy. Without the C-terminal domain, partial inhibition by the ε N-terminal domain is due to enhanced ADP inhibition. The rapid effects of catalytic site ligands on conformational changes of F1-bound ε suggest dynamic conformational and rotational mobility in F1 that is paused near the catalytic dwell position."

We found that the deletion of p50 (p50-/-) impaired arsenite-induced p53 protein expression, which could be restored after reconstitutive expression of HA-p50 in p50-/- cells, p50-/-(Ad-HA-p50). Further studies indicated that the amounts of p53 mRNA, p53 promoter-driven transcription activity and p53 protein degradation were comparable between wild-type and p50-/- cells. Moreover, we found that p50 was crucial for Akt/S6 ribosomal protein activation via inhibition of the translation of the PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatases 1 (PHLPP1), a phosphatase of Akt. Further studies showed that p50-mediated upregulation of miR-190 was responsible for the inhibition of PHLPP1 translation by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of its mRNA. Collectively, we have identified a novel function of p50 in modulating p53 protein translation via regulation of the miR-190/PHLPP1/Akt-S6 ribosomal protein pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2084412270,"Excitotoxicity resulting from overstimulation of glutamate receptors is a major cause of neuronal death in cerebral ischemic stroke. The overstimulated ionotropic glutamate receptors exert their neurotoxic effects in part by overactivation of calpains, which induce neuronal death by catalyzing limited proteolysis of specific cellular proteins. Here, we report that in cultured cortical neurons and in vivo in a rat model of focal ischemic stroke, the tyrosine kinase Src is cleaved by calpains at a site in the N-terminal unique domain. This generates a truncated Src fragment of ~52 kDa, which we localized predominantly to the cytosol. A cell membrane-permeable fusion peptide derived from the unique domain of Src prevents calpain from cleaving Src in neurons and protects against excitotoxic neuronal death. To explore the role of the truncated Src fragment in neuronal death, we expressed a recombinant truncated Src fragment in cultured neurons and examined how it affects neuronal survival. Expression of this fragment, which lacks the myristoylation motif and unique domain, was sufficient to induce neuronal death. Furthermore, inactivation of the prosurvival kinase Akt is a key step in its neurotoxic signaling pathway. Because Src maintains neuronal survival, our results implicate calpain cleavage as a molecular switch converting Src from a promoter of cell survival to a mediator of neuronal death in excitotoxicity. Besides unveiling a new pathological action of Src, our discovery of the neurotoxic action of the truncated Src fragment suggests new therapeutic strategies with the potential to minimize brain damage in ischemic stroke."

The stringency of start codon selection impacts the efficiency of initiation at near-cognate codons and the efficiency of initiation at AUG codons in different contexts. We used a codon-optimized firefly luciferase reporter initiated with AUG or each of the nine near-cognate codons in preferred context to examine the stringency of start codon selection in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In vivo results indicated that the hierarchy of initiation at start codons in N. crassa (AUG ≫ CUG > GUG > ACG > AUA ≈ UUG > AUU > AUC) is similar to that in human cells. Similar results were obtained by translating mRNAs in a homologous N. crassa in vitro translation system or in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We next examined the efficiency of initiation at AUG, CUG, and UUG codons in different contexts in vitro. The preferred context was more important for efficient initiation from near-cognate codons than from AUG. These studies demonstrated that near-cognate codons are used for initiation in N. crassa. Such events could provide additional coding capacity or have regulatory functions. Analyses of the 5'-leader regions in the N. crassa transcriptome revealed examples of highly conserved near-cognate codons in preferred contexts that could extend the N termini of the predicted polypeptides."

Here, an EF-hand motif substitution that had been presumed to destroy EF-hand function, that of glutamine for glutamate at position 12 of the second cation binding loop domain of Parv (ParvE101Q), markedly inverted relative cation affinities: Mg(2+) affinity increased, whereas Ca(2+) affinity decreased, forming a new ultra-delayed Ca(2+) buffer with favorable properties for promoting cardiac relaxation. In therapeutic testing, expression of ParvE101Q fully reversed the severe myocyte intrinsic contractile defect inherent to expression of native Parv and corrected abnormal myocardial relaxation in diastolic dysfunction disease models in vitro and in vivo. Strategic design of new EF-hand motif domains to modulate intracellular Ca(2+) signaling could benefit many biological systems with abnormal Ca(2+) handling, including the diseased heart."

Previous x-ray crystallographic analyses identified distinct binding sites for YXXØ signals on μ2 and μ4, which were located on opposite faces of the proteins. To elucidate the mode of recognition of YXXØ signals by other members of the μ family, we solved the crystal structure at 1.85 Å resolution of the C-terminal domain of the μ3 subunit of AP-3 (isoform A) in complex with a peptide encoding a YXXØ signal (SDYQRL) from the trans-Golgi network protein TGN38. The μ3A C-terminal domain consists of an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich organized into two subdomains, A and B. The YXXØ signal binds in an extended conformation to a site on μ3A subdomain A, at a location similar to the YXXØ-binding site on μ2 but not μ4.

https://openalex.org/W2161917975,"The voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is used to target symptoms of the neuroinflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS). By blocking Kv channels, 4-AP facilitates action potential conduction and neurotransmitter release in presynaptic neurons, lessening the effects of demyelination. Because they conduct inward Na(+) and Ca(2+) currents that contribute to axonal degeneration in response to inflammatory conditions, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) contribute to the pathology of MS. Consequently, ASICs are emerging as disease-modifying targets in MS. Surprisingly, as first demonstrated here, 4-AP inhibits neuronal degenerin/epithelial Na(+) (Deg/ENaC) channels, including ASIC and BLINaC. This effect is specific for 4-AP compared with its heterocyclic base, pyridine, and the related derivative, 4-methylpyridine; and akin to the actions of 4-AP on the structurally unrelated Kv channels, dose- and voltage-dependent. 4-AP has differential actions on distinct ASICs, strongly inhibiting ASIC1a channels expressed in central neurons but being without effect on ASIC3, which is enriched in peripheral sensory neurons. The voltage dependence of the 4-AP block and the single binding site for this inhibitor are consistent with 4-AP binding in the pore of Deg/ENaC channels as it does Kv channels, suggesting a similar mechanism of inhibition in these two classes of channels. These findings argue that effects on both Kv and Deg/ENaC channels should be considered when evaluating the actions of 4-AP. Importantly, the current results are consistent with 4-AP influencing the symptoms of MS as well as the course of the disease because of inhibitory actions on Kv and ASIC channels, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2024240221,"Prototypic dinuclear metal cofactors with varying metallation constitute a class of O2-activating catalysts in numerous enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase. Reliable structures are required to unravel the reaction mechanisms. However, protein crystallography data may be compromised by x-ray photoreduction (XRP). We studied XPR of Fe(III)Fe(III) and Mn(III)Fe(III) sites in the R2 subunit of Chlamydia trachomatis ribonucleotide reductase using x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Rapid and biphasic x-ray photoreduction kinetics at 20 and 80 K for both cofactor types suggested sequential formation of (III,II) and (II,II) species and similar redox potentials of iron and manganese sites. Comparing with typical x-ray doses in crystallography implies that (II,II) states are reached in <1 s in such studies. First-sphere metal coordination and metal-metal distances differed after chemical reduction at room temperature and after XPR at cryogenic temperatures, as corroborated by model structures from density functional theory calculations. The inter-metal distances in the XPR-induced (II,II) states, however, are similar to R2 crystal structures. Therefore, crystal data of initially oxidized R2-type proteins mostly contain photoreduced (II,II) cofactors, which deviate from the native structures functional in O2 activation, explaining observed variable metal ligation motifs. This situation may be remedied by novel femtosecond free electron-laser protein crystallography techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2051506105,"Kainate receptors exhibit a highly compartmentalized distribution within the brain; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that coordinate their expression at neuronal sites of action are poorly characterized. Here we report that the GluK1 and GluK2 kainate receptor subunits interact with the spectrin-actin binding scaffolding protein 4.1N through a membrane-proximal domain in the C-terminal tail. We found that this interaction is important for the forward trafficking of GluK2a receptors, their distribution in the neuronal plasma membrane, and regulation of receptor endocytosis. The association between GluK2a receptors and 4.1N was regulated by both palmitoylation and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the receptor subunit. Palmitoylation of the GluK2a subunit promoted 4.1N association, and palmitoylation-deficient receptors exhibited reduced neuronal surface expression and compromised endocytosis. Conversely, PKC activation decreased 4.1N interaction with GluK2/3-containing kainate receptors in acute brain slices, an effect that was reversed after inhibition of PKC. Our data and previous studies therefore demonstrate that these two post-translational modifications have opposing effects on 4.1N association with GluK2 kainate and GluA1 AMPA receptors. The convergence of the signaling pathways regulating 4.1N protein association could thus result in the selective removal of AMPA receptors from the plasma membrane while simultaneously promoting the insertion and stabilization of kainate receptors, which may be important for tuning neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity."

Mutations in the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase α3 subunit gene (ATP1A3) cause rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden onset of dystonic spasms and slow movements. In the brain, ATP1A3 is principally expressed in neurons. In zebrafish, the transcripts of the two ATP1A3 orthologs, Atp1a3a and Atp1a3b, show distinct expression in the brain. Surprisingly, targeted knockdown of either Atp1a3a or Atp1a3b leads to brain ventricle dilation, a likely consequence of ion imbalances across the plasma membrane that cause accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricle. The brain ventricle dilation is accompanied by a depolarization of spinal Rohon-Beard neurons in Atp1a3a knockdown embryos, suggesting impaired neuronal excitability. This is further supported by Atp1a3a or Atp1a3b knockdown results where altered responses to tactile stimuli as well as abnormal motility were observed. Finally, proteomic analysis identified several protein candidates highlighting proteome changes associated with the knockdown of Atp1a3a or Atp1a3b.

With the use of specific antibodies, coimmunoprecipitation of p67(phox) and phosphorylated Prdx6 was demonstrated with lysates of mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPMVECs) that were stimulated with angiotensin II; the interaction of p67(phox) with nonphosphorylated Prdx6 was relatively weak. Association of p67(phox) and phosphoPrdx6 in intact MPMVECs after angiotensin II stimulation was demonstrated by proximity ligation assay and was abolished by U0126, a MAP kinase inhibitor. By isothermal titration calorimetry, p67(phox) bound strongly to phosphoPrdx6 but bound poorly to Prdx6; phosphorylated p67(phox) did not bind to either Prdx6 or phosphoPrdx6.

Their functions are closely related to the intracellular spatial organization. The RS domain and phosphorylation status of SR proteins are two critical factors in determining the subcellular distribution. Mammalian Transformer-2β (Tra2β) protein, a member of SR proteins, is known to play multiple important roles in development and diseases. In the present study, we characterized the subcellular and subnuclear localization of Tra2β protein and its related mechanisms. The results demonstrated that in the brain the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Tra2β were correlated with its phosphorylation status. Using deletional mutation analysis, we showed that the nuclear localization of Tra2β was determined by multiple nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the RS domains. The point-mutation analysis disclosed that phosphorylation of serine residues in the NLSs inhibited the function of NLS in directing Tra2β to the nucleus. In addition, we identified at least two nuclear speckle localization signals within the RS1 domain, but not in the RS2 domain. The nuclear speckle localization signals determined the localization of RS1 domain-contained proteins to the nuclear speckle. The function of the signals did not depend on the presence of serine residues.

G., Toretsky, J. A., Uren, A., and Rubin, J. S. (2008) Mol. Cell. Biol. 28, 2368-2379). Subsequently, we observed that Dvl2/3 phosphorylation correlated with neurite outgrowth and that casein kinase 1δ, one of the enzymes that mediate Wnt3a-dependent Dvl phosphorylation, was required for neurite extension (Greer, Y. E., and Rubin, J. S. (2011) J. Cell Biol. 192, 993-1004). However, the functional relevance of Dvl phosphorylation in neurite outgrowth was not established. Dvl1 has been shown by others to be important for axon specification in hippocampal neurons via an interaction with atypical PKCζ, but the role of Dvl phosphorylation was not evaluated. Here we report that Ewing sarcoma family tumor cells express PKCι but not PKCζ. Wnt3a stimulated PKCι activation and caused a punctate distribution of pPKCι in the neurites and cytoplasm, with a particularly intense signal at the centrosome. Knockdown of PKCι expression with siRNA reagents blocked neurite formation in response to Wnt3a. Aurothiomalate, a specific inhibitor of PKCι/Par6 binding, also suppressed neurite extension. Wnt3a enhanced the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous PKCι and Dvl2. Although FLAG-tagged wild-type Dvl2 immunoprecipitated with PKCι, a phosphorylation-deficient Dvl2 derivative did not. This derivative also was unable to rescue neurite outgrowth when endogenous Dvl2/3 was suppressed by siRNA (González-Sancho, J. M., Greer, Y. E., Abrahams, C.

https://openalex.org/W2155150622,"In this study, we addressed the direct effect of leucine on insulin signaling. In investigating the associated mechanisms, we found that leucine itself does not activate the classical Akt- or ERK1/2 MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathways but can facilitate the insulin-induced phosphorylations of Akt473 and ERK1/2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in cultured hepatocytes. The leucine-facilitated insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt at residue 473 was not affected by knocking down the key component of mTORC1 or -2 complexes but was blocked by inhibition of c-Src (PP2), PI3K (LY294002), Gαi protein (pertussis toxin or siRNA against Gαi1 gene, or β-arrestin 2 (siRNA)). Similarly, the leucine-facilitated insulin activation of ERK1/2 was also blunted by pertussis toxin. We further show that leucine facilitated the insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production and expression of key gluconeogenic genes in a Gαi1 protein-dependent manner in cultured primary hepatocytes. Together, these results show that leucine can directly facilitate insulin signaling through a Gαi protein-dependent intracellular signaling pathway. This is the first evidence showing that macronutrients like amino acid leucine can facilitate insulin signaling through G proteins directly.

https://openalex.org/W2039368833,"Genomic instability is a characteristic of most cancers and it is argued that genomic instability is a driving force for tumorigenesis. Data herein demonstrate that genomic instability, as evidenced by microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoter methylation of DNA mismatch repair genes, is common in individual glands of pre-malignant colorectal lesions and raises interesting questions about the role of MSI in the development of colorectal carcinoma."
