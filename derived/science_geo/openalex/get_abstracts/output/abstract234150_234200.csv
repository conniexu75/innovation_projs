https://openalex.org/W2093087387,"In reference to the article ""Chromatographic Analysis of a Mixture of Proteins from Egg White"" (Science, 1949, 110, 564), the cation exchange resin Dowex 50 employed in the experiment cited was obtained in February, 1949, from the Microchemical Specialties Company, Berkeley 3, California, under the name of Ion-X, and not from the Dow Chemical Company as reported in the footnote. We have thus far not obtained satisfactory results with a sample of Dowex 50, (24427), obtained from the Dow Chemical Company on August 8, 1949."

https://openalex.org/W2080838639,"IN the course of a series of experiments on the propagation of transient stress waves in solids, we have developed an optical method of high-speed recording which does not appear to be described in the literature. The duration of the stress pulses is often of the order of 50 microsec., and the only feasible method of recording the phenomena optically is to use a stationary-film camera in conjunction with a mirror rotating at high speed, the recording film being fixed on a circular arc the centre of which lies on the axis of the mirror. If the radius of this arc is 27 cm., a writing speed of 3 mm. per microsec. (measured on the film) will be obtained when the mirror rotates at 1,000 rev. per sec. Rotational speeds of this order of magnitude can be obtained most easily by means of the high-speed air turbines developed for ultracentrifuge work1, and, in our camera, the rotating mirror consists of an octagonal, stainless steel mirror mounted on the rotor of a small turbine of this type."

https://openalex.org/W1565649545,IT was shown by Quastel and Wheatley1 that slices of brain tissue are able to oxidize l-glutamic acid in the absence of glucose. Recent experiments by Mayer-Gross and Walker2 have shown that the injection of glutamic acid and other amino-acids relieves the hypoglycæmic coma produced by insulin—an effect which apparently does not depend entirely upon the associated rise in the blood-glucose level.

https://openalex.org/W1993825838,"THE interpretations which Ogston1 has placed on certain tracer experiments on metabolic processes have aroused widespread interest in the role of tracer elements in stereochemistry. Ogston's concept has recently been substantiated in the case of citric acid by the experiments of Potter and Heidelberger2. It has implications, however, which go beyond the specific biochemical experiments cited by Ogston."

The accompanying reproduction shows a typical one. These chromosomes were fixed with acetic acid and ‘microcentrifuged’2 on the collodion membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2024286880,"In our recent article (""Production of Mesons by X-Rays,"" by Edwin M. McMillan, Jack M. Peterson, and R. Stephen White,"" Science, December 2), the second sentence in the last paragraph on page 581 contains a typographical error. When a negative pi(-)meson is made by a photon striking a neutron, the products are pi(-) and p(+), not pi(-) and pi(+). Also, near the center of page 580, in the third paragraph ""pi=mesons"" was incorrectly printed for ""pi(-)mesons."""
https://openalex.org/W2064787228,"WE have previously shown that para-aminobenzoic acid is transformed into a yellow pigment by various species of mycobacteria1,2,3. The chemical composition of this pigment is unknown; but it has been established as an oxidation product of para-amino-benzoic acid. The pigment is insoluble in water and in most of the usual organic solvents, but is very soluble in phenol and glacial acetic acid. Various substances related to para-aminobenzoic acid, with the exception of procaine, were unable to form this pigment."

There is still, however, no agreement about the number and kinds of micelles which can be present1. Hess and Gunderman2 were the first to explain the X-ray patterns upon the basis of lamellar micelles consisting of double layers of molecules separated by equally spaced layers of water. Harkins3 recently directed attention to a so-called 'M-band' in the pattern and attributed it to diffraction from the double-leaflet alone."

Prof. E. K. Rideal, who was in the chair at the opening meeting, said that this Committee, which has been in existence for a good many years, was originally due to the initiative of Sir William Hardy, and was intended to provide a bridge between the simpler systems with which colloid chemistry was then mostly concerned and the properties of living matter."

https://openalex.org/W1980430678,"IN cutting histological sections in the tropics, the room temperatures during the day are in many cases so high that microtome work has to be done during the evening or at night. With paraffin wax the solution of this difficulty is usually sought in the employment of a wax of a higher melting point than that commonly used in temperate regions, because a higher melting point is usually correlated with a harder wax. Unfortunately, this means that material during infiltration is subjected to a much higher temperature than is desirable, waxes of 60-70° C. (140-158° F.) melting point being necessary."

As a first step in understanding the mechanism of this activation, the synergistic property, if any, possessed by β-methyl anthraquinone, a constituent of teak, was studied."

https://openalex.org/W1977027525,"Fieser and Fieser1 have recently deduced molecular rotation contributions for the various asymmetric centres in the steroid skeleton. Their values for the contribution of C(17) were obtained, in the absence of data permitting direct comparison, from the molecular rotation of cholestane by subtracting the contributions of all the other asymmetric centres, some of which (those of C(9), C(10) and C(13)) appear to be unreliable."

https://openalex.org/W2992869226,"BIOLOGICAL aspects of river pollution were discussed at a joint session of Section D (Zoology) and K (Botany) of the British Association on September 5. Dr. B. A. Southgate, in introducing the subject, described briefly the varied types of domestic and industrial wastes discharged to surface waters. In indusraial districts the sewage treated at municipal sewege disposal works often contains a high proportion of waste liquors from manufacturing processes. Some constituents of these are incompletely removed during treatment of the sewage. For example, effluent from a works treating sewage containing gas liquor usually contains small quantities of thiocyanate and polyhydric phenols."
