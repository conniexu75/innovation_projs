https://openalex.org/W2012142261,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls multiple cellular functions in response to amino acids and growth factors, in part by regulating the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) is a recently identified mTOR binding partner that also binds p70S6k and 4E-BP1 and is essential for TOR signaling in vivo. Herein we demonstrate that raptor binds to p70S6k and 4E-BP1 through their respective TOS (conserved TOR signaling) motifs to be required for amino acid- and mTOR-dependent regulation of these mTOR substrates in vivo. A point mutation of the TOS motif also eliminates all in vitro mTOR-catalyzed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and abolishes the raptor-dependent component of mTOR-catalyzed p70S6k phosphorylation in vitro. Raptor appears to serve as an mTOR scaffold protein, the binding of which to the TOS motif of mTOR substrates is necessary for effective mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation in vivo and perhaps for conferring their sensitivity to rapamycin and amino acid sufficiency.

The activity of p70S6kα1in vivo is most closely related to the phosphorylation at Thr-412, situated in a hydrophobic motif C-terminal to the canonical catalytic domain (18Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B.

The identity of the kinase(s) acting on this site in vivo is uncertain; however, this site can be phosphorylated directly by mTOR in vitro (9Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H.

Recently, site-specific mutagenesis was employed to define a five-amino acid sequence called the TOS (TOR signaling) motif as the minimal functionally important region within this p70S6k noncatalytic N-terminal segment (21Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). As with N-terminal deletion, mutation of a single Phe within the TOS motif to Ala causes marked inhibition of activity of full-length p70S6k and a loss of sensitivity to rapamycin and amino acid withdrawal in the p70S6k-ΔCT104, lacking C-terminal noncatalytic tail, background. In addition, a TOS motif was identified in the 4E-BPs, wherein mutation of 4E-BP1 Phe-114 to Ala inhibits amino acid- and serum-induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Raptor is a recently discovered, highly conserved 150-kDa TOR-binding protein that also binds p70S6k and 4E-BPs (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J.

The binding of TOR to raptor or its S. cerevisiae homologue KOG1 (24Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol.

Moreover, mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in vitro is entirely dependent on the presence of raptor, whereas mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of p70S6k in vitro, although stimulated ∼5-fold by the addition of raptor, proceeds in the absence of raptor (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Herein we show that the TOS motif is necessary for the binding of p70S6k and 4E-BP1 to raptor. Mutation of the TOS motif abolishes mTOR-catalyzed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in vitro in the presence of raptor and eliminates the raptor-dependent stimulation of mTOR-catalyzed p70S6k phosphorylation. Thus the inhibitory effect of TOS deletion or mutation on 4E-BP1 and p70S6k phosphorylation in vivo can be attributed to the inability of these mutants to bind raptor. Moreover we suggest that the binding of these mTOR substrates to raptor may also be necessary for their sensitivity to regulation by amino acids and rapamycin.

A mutant of p70 S6 kinase α1 in which Phe-28 was substituted with Ala (p70S6k-F28A) and a mutant of 4E-BP1 in which Phe-114 was substituted with Ala (4E-BP1-F114A) were created by using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To make the expression vector of FLAG-tagged raptor lacking the N-terminal region (FLAG-raptor-ΔNT), a cDNA fragment encoding bp 2710–4005 was amplified by PCR using pcDNA1-FLAG-raptor as a template and ligated into pcDNA1-FLAG (22Hara K.

Transient transfection was performed by the lipofection method using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The GST pull-down assay was performed as described previously (10Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H.

Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J.

Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). To examine whether the TOS motif in p70S6k is important to the binding of p70S6k to raptor, wild-type GST fusion proteins of full-length p70S6kα1 (GST-p70S6k) or an F28A mutant (GST-p70S6k-F28A) were coexpressed with FLAG-tagged raptor (FLAG-raptor) in HEK293 cells. The F28A mutation of p70S6kα1 corresponds to the F5A mutation of p70S6kα2, a mutation that recapitulates the phenotype of N-terminal deletion (21Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar); thus, like p70S6kΔ2–46 lacking a short segment N terminus (20Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), hemagglutinin-tagged p70S6kα2-F5A is inactive in HEK293 cells, and its activity can be partially rescued by deletion of the p70S6k C-terminal noncatalytic tail. As expected, we find that GST-p70S6k-F28A is also inactive in HEK293 cells (data not shown). Moreover, although p70S6k binds specifically to coexpressed FLAG-raptor (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), p70S6k-F28A does not (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). Inasmuch as p70S6k-F28A is inactive in HEK293 cells, we inquired whether p70S6k activity is required for the association between p70S6k and raptor. We find that the ATP site mutant, p70S6k-KM/ΔCT104, which is kinase-inactive and lacks C-terminal 104 residues (20Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), binds raptor to an extent similar to p70S6k (Fig. 1 B, comparelane 4 with lane 6). These results indicate that the recognition of p70S6k by raptor requires an intact p70S6k TOS motif but neither kinase activity nor the carboxyl-terminal tail of p70S6k. The TOS motif of 4E-BP1 is also required for mTOR signaling to 4E-BP1in vivo (21Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We therefore next examined the effects of TOS motif mutation on the ability of 4E-BP1 to bind raptor; GST fusions of wild-type 4E-BP1 (GST-4E-BP1) or an F114A mutant of 4E-BP1 (GST-4E-BP1-F114A) were coexpressed with FLAG-tagged raptor (FLAG-raptor) in HEK293 cells. As observed with p70S6k (Fig.1 A), wild-type 4E-BP1 binds specifically to raptor (Fig.2, lane 4), whereas 4E-BP1-F114A does not (Fig. 2, lane 5). These results clearly indicate that the TOS motif is critical for the binding of p70S6k and 4E-BP1 to raptor and may be a common recognition element by which raptor couples mTOR targets to the mTOR kinase. To identify the region of raptor that interacts with the TOS motif of p70S6k, we coexpressed several FLAG-tagged raptor fragments with GST-p70S6k or GST-p70S6k-F28A in HEK293 cells. The N-terminal region of raptor (amino acids 1–904, raptor-ΔCT), which contains the unique raptor N-terminal conserved (RNC) region and the HEAT repeats, binds to p70S6k as strongly as does the full-length raptor (Fig.3, lanes 4 and 6); neither bind to p70S6k-F28A (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and7). The C-terminal region of raptor (amino acids 904–1335, raptor-ΔNT) and the isolated WD repeat domain of raptor (amino acids 1009–1335, raptor-WD) do not bind to p70S6k (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 10). These results suggest that the RNC region and/or the HEAT repeats of raptor appear to be involved in the regulation of the TOS motif of p70S6k. The selective binding of p70S6k to the N-terminal portion of raptor contrasts with the requirements for raptor binding to mTOR, which appears to involve multiple sites in raptor (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 23Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar); thus raptor deleted of its N terminus (236–1335) or C terminus (1–904) fails to bind mTOR. We reported previously that the overexpression of the full-length of raptor or raptor-ΔCT-(1–904) in HEK293 cells severely inhibited the kinase activity of coexpressed p70S6k (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In contrast, the overexpression of raptor-ΔNT-(904–1335) or raptor-WD-(1009–1335) in HEK293 cells does not significantly inhibit the kinase activity of coexpressed p70S6k (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitory effect of overexpressed full-length raptor and raptor-ΔCT-(1–904) may be caused by the ability of these elements to bind coexpressed p70S6k and sequester it from endogenous mTOR, thereby disrupting the ternary complex of mTOR-raptor-p70S6k necessary for effective mTOR-catalyzed p70S6k phosphorylation. Moreover, the ability of p70S6k overexpression to interfere with the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is likely to be due to the competition of these elements for a common binding site on raptor. We had shown previously (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar) that the association of raptor with mTOR is absolutely required for the ability of mTOR to catalyze 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in vitro. It was not clear, however, whether this reflected a stimulatory effect of raptor on the catalytic activity of mTOR or on the ability of raptor to properly configure or “present” the 4E-BP1 substrate. The finding that point mutation of the substrate TOS motif eliminates the binding of the substrates to raptor enables a test of these alternatives. Removal of raptor from mTOR by washing with 1% Nonidet P-40 essentially eliminates the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate GST-4E-BP1 in vitro (Fig.4 A, compare lane 6with lane 7), as shown previously (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In addition, it is evident that mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-4E-BP1-F114A is virtually eliminated despite the presence of raptor (Fig.4 A, lane 3). Thus, the ability of 4E-BP1 to bind raptor is indispensable for mTOR-catalyzed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The absolute requirement for raptor is not true for p70S6k (Fig.4 B). As before, endogenous mTOR is immunoprecipitated and washed without or with 1% Nonidet P-40, the latter to remove endogenous raptor. The mTOR kinase activity is assayed using as substrate either recombinant GST-p70S6k or GST-p70S6k-F28A, each purified from rapamycin-treated HEK293 cells; mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation is monitored by both 32P incorporation into the recombinant GST fusion protein and by anti-p70S6k Thr(P)-412 immunoreactivity. As shown previously (22Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), overall mTOR kinase activity toward GST-p70S6k and the specific phosphorylation of Thr(P)-412 (estimated by immunoblot) are enhanced by coimmunoprecipitation of mTOR with raptor (Fig. 4 B,lane 7); washing the mTOR immunoprecipitates with detergent so that endogenous raptor is removed substantially reduces the mTOR-catalyzed overall 32P incorporation into GST-p70S6k as well as the anti-Thr(P)-412 immunoreactivity achieved, as compared with that catalyzed by the same mTOR immunoprecipitate that had not been washed with Nonidet P-40 so as to remove coprecipitating endogenous raptor. In contrast, when GST-p70S6k-F28A is employed as substrate for these same mTOR immunoprecipitates, the overall 32P incorporation and phosphorylation of Thr-412 is low and independent of whether or not raptor had been removed by Nonidet P-40 washing. The phosphorylation catalyzed by the mTOR-raptor complex of GST-p70S6k-F28A is only about 20% that of wild-type GST-p70S6k and very close to the phosphorylation of wild-type GST-p70S6k achieved by the raptor-free mTOR immunoprecipitate. Nevertheless, the inability of raptor to alter the residual mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-p70S6k-F28A establishes that the stimulatory effects of raptor on the phosphorylation of wild-type p70S6k (and probably 4E-BP1) are not due to a stimulation of intrinsic catalytic activity of the mTOR kinase but entirely to the ability of raptor to bind and present these two substrates in a more effective way. The continued ability of mTOR to phosphorylate p70S6k-F28A (or wild-type p70S6k in the absence of raptor) is consistent with the earlier demonstration that mTOR can phosphorylate prokaryotic recombinant fragments of p70S6k that lack entirely the N-terminal region containing the TOS motif on a variety of sites, including Thr-412 (9Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The present demonstration of a persistent TOS- and raptor-independent component of mTOR-catalyzed p70S6k phosphorylationin vitro raises the possibility that this activity may be responsible for the insulin-responsive but rapamycin- and amino acid-insensitive phosphorylation in vivo of the various N-terminal mutant p70S6ks (20Weng Q.P.

Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus the F28A mutation of the TOS motif, like N-terminal deletion, makes p70S6k Thr-412 phosphorylation and thus catalytic activity very low; deletion of the C terminus partially restores Thr-412 phosphorylation, which is now insulin-responsive but insensitive to rapamycin and amino acid sufficiency (12Hara K.

Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The insensitivity to rapamycin and amino acid sufficiency were interpreted initially to indicate that the persistent insulin-responsive Thr-412 phosphorylation could not be due to an insulin-induced increase in mTOR-catalyzed Thr-412 phosphorylation (12Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the present demonstration that mTOR-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-p70S6k-F28A in vitro persists, although at a greatly reduced efficiency as compared with wild-type GST-p70S6k, suggests that such a reaction may account for the low but persistent in vivo activity of the p70S6k Δ2–46/ΔCT104 variant. The p70 variants that are unable to bind to raptor may be very poorly phosphorylated by mTOR in vivo, but the persistent modest ability of mTOR to catalyze this modification is facilitated by deletion of the p70S6k C-terminal tail, as is seen with PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of the p70S6k activation loop (26Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The insulin stimulation of these variants in vivo may reflect disinhibition from the TSC1-TSC2 complex (27Kwiatkowski D.J. Zhang H. Bandura J.L. Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H.

Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Finally, insensitivity to amino acids and rapamycin suggests that the association of p70S6k with raptor is necessary for p70 regulation to be responsive to these inputs. Thus, the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex may interfere with mTOR-catalyzed p70 phosphorylation only when p70S6k is complexed with raptor. This hypothesis implies that the model of action of the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex in vivo at moderately inhibitory concentrations of rapamycin (e.g. 2–20 nm) is not through suppression of the mTOR catalytic activity but by interference with the effective interaction between mTOR and its substrates. Such a proposal has been offered previously, based in part on the nearly hundredfold higher concentrations of rapamycin (in the presence of excess FKBP12) required for inhibition of mTOR kinase activity in vitro (8Brunn G.J.

Evaluating this hypothesis will require much additional insight into the mechanism by which the mTOR-raptor complex interacts with its substrates, as well as an understanding of the contributions of mLst8 (24Loewith R.

The α-subunits of the HIF transcription factors are degraded by proteasomal pathways during normoxia but are stabilized under hypoxic conditions. The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) mediates the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of HIF-α (including HIF-1α and HIF-2α). Post-translational hydroxylation of a proline residue in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-α is required for the interaction between HIF and VHL. It has previously been established that cobalt mimics hypoxia and causes accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. However, little is known about the mechanism by which this occurs. In an earlier study, we demonstrated that cobalt binds directly to the ODD domain of HIF-2α. Here we provide the first evidence that cobalt inhibits pVHL binding to HIF-α even when HIF-α is hydroxylated. Deletion of 17 amino acids within the ODD domain of HIF-2α that are required for pVHL binding prevented the binding of cobalt and stabilized HIF-2α during normoxia. These findings show that cobalt mimics hypoxia, at least in part, by occupying the VHL-binding domain of HIF-α and thereby preventing the degradation of HIF-α."

Cellular hypoxia is an important phenomenon in developmental biology, normal physiology, and many pathological conditions, including cancer. Hypoxia triggers a multifaceted adaptive response that is primarily mediated by the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). 1The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia-inducible factorE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast cellDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleCMVcytomegalovirus HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, the rate-limiting factor HIF-1α and the constitutive expressed HIF-1β (1Wang G.L.

On the other hand, HIF-1α specifically mediates hypoxic responses. In normoxia, HIF-1α is maintained at low and often undetectable levels. HIF-1α is targeted for degradation by the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway through directly binding to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (pVHL), which forms the recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase leading to ubiquitination of HIF-1α (4Maxwell P.H.

This modification is catalyzed by a specific family of enzymes termed HIF-1α-proline hydroxylases (8Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim Av. Hebestreit H.F.

During hypoxia, this specific hydroxylase is inactive since it requires dioxygen for its activity. As a result, HIF-1α accumulates due to the failure of pVHL to recognize its non-hydroxylated form. HIF-1α then translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with the constitutively present HIF-1β (11Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). hypoxia-inducible factor ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase mouse embryonic fibroblast cell dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phosphate-buffered saline 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole cytomegalovirus The importance of the HIF-1α response pathway in human tumorigenesis is underscored by the finding that HIF-1α is overexpressed in multiple human cancers, because tumor cells, unlike normal cells from the same tissue, are often chronically hypoxic (12Harries A.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4287) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 integrates numerous signals that control cell life and death (13Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 is expressed at low levels in most cells because of its short half-life under normal conditions. In contrast, the p53 protein is stabilized, and its level increases in response to various stresses such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and inappropriate oncogene signaling (14Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 15Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Giaccia K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In its active form, p53 can bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and activate transcription of target genes. p53 levels are regulated in large part by Mdm2, the product of a p53-inducible gene. Mdm2 can interact with the N terminus of p53, which also contains the major acidic transcriptional activation domain. The interaction between Mdm2 and p53 can inhibit p53 transcriptional activity by interfering with the ability of p53 to contact transcriptional coactivators such as p300/CBP (16Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Importantly, Mdm2 binding also promotes the ubiquitination of p53 and its export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 is then degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes (17Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Hypoxic induction of p53 requires concomitant induction of HIF-1α, whereby HIF-1α can then bind to and stabilize p53 (18An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M.

However, the molecular mechanism by which HIF-1α stabilizes p53 remains unknown. Moreover, it is not clear whether HIF-1α interacts with p53 directly despite previous indications that p53 associated with HIF-1α in cells. Nevertheless, an array of immobilized peptide assay showed that the core domain of p53 has an affinity for the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α (22Hansson L.O. Friedler A. Freund S. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As described in this report, we have found a strong interaction between HIF-1α and Mdm2, while we failed to detect any direct interaction of p53 with HIF-1α. Our data demonstrate that HIF-1α regulates p53 activity including stability and nuclear export through interactions with Mdm2. These results provide a potential mechanism for p53 stabilization by HIF-1α in response to hypoxia. p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Richmond, VA) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, VA). 1 × 106 or 2 × 105 cells were plated in 10-cm or six-well plates, respectively, and 24 h later transfections were done by calcium phosphate precipitation procedures. After a 24-h incubation with 20% O2, the cells were harvested. Full-length HIF-1α DNA was generated by PCR using hemagglutinin-tagged HIF-1α from David Livingston (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/v5-His-Topo (Invitrogen) or p3×FLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma). Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type p53 was obtained from Yanping Zhang (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Plasmid DNA for transfections was isolated using Qiagen plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). GST fusions of p53 and Mdm2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) (Promega) and induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were lysed in BC500 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, fresh 1 mm PMSF) with sonication. Levels of expressed GST fusion proteins were estimated by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads, washing, and quantification by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin were used as standards. 35S-Labeled in vitro translated HIF-1α was prepared by using the TNT system (Promega). Equal amounts (1 μg) of GST, GST-p53, and GST-Mdm2 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro translated HIF-1α in BC200 for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) with fresh protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Aliquots (30 μg) of cell extracts were resolved in SDS, 8% polyacrymide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm glycine, 20%(v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% (v/v) nonfat dry milk, TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with α-p53 (DO-1) antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-GFP (Clontech), and detected with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described previously (23Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μl of proteasome inhibitorN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal was added to the cotransfected culture 6 h before harvest. 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in BC100 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, fresh 1 mm PMSF) and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, after which the associated proteins were eluted with BC100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 plus 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and Western blot with the anti-p53 or anti-Mdm2 (SMP14, Santa Cruz) monoclonal antibody. Luciferase activity was determined using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells in six-well plates were removed by scraping into 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cell lysate was collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. Luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The in vitroubiquitination assay was performed as previously described (24Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For a standard reactions, the purified FLAG-p53 proteins from H1299 cells were mixed with other purified components, including E1, E2 (GST-UbcH5C), E3 (GST-Mdm2), and His-ubiquitin in reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, pH 7.6). The reaction was stopped after 60 min at 37 °C by additions of SDS sample buffer and subsequently resolved SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analysis with α-p53 (DO-1). H1299 cells were plated on six-well-containing glass coverslips, and GFP-p53 was transfected as described. 50 μm proteasome inhibitorN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal was added for 6 h before fixation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells on the coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed in PBS three times and then permeabilized in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 μg of DAPI (Sigma)/ml at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and the stained cells were mounted with mounting medium (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) and sealed with nail polish. Immunofluorescence was recorded using an immunofluorescence microscope. Although earlier studies indicated that p53 can bind HIF-1α in cells, we repeatedly failed to detect any direct interaction between these two protein in a GST pull-down assay (data not shown), suggesting that HIF-1α may interact with p53 through other factors. To examine the notion that p53 may interact with HIF-1α through Mdm2, we tested whether HIF-1α directly binds Mdm2 in vitro by GST pull-down assays. Both GST-Mdm2 and GST were expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity. As shown in Fig.1a, the35S-labeled in vitro translated HIF-1α strongly bound to immobolized GST-Mdm2 (lane 2) but not to immobilized GST (lane 3). However, using the same assay, no significant interaction was detected between GST-p53 and HIF-1α. Furthermore, we tested the interaction between HIF-1α and Mdm2in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation assays. FLAG-tagged full-length HIF-1α was transiently co-transfected with Mdm2 in H1299 cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Flag M2 beads, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Mdm2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1b, the Mdm2-HIF-1α complexes were readily detected in cells cotransfected with FLAG-HIF-1α and Mdm2 (lane 4) but not by Mdm2 alone (lane 3), indicating that there is a specific in vivo interaction between Mdm2 and HIF-1α. To examine the possibility that the HIF-1α-p53 interaction is mediated by Mdm2, we tested whether Mdm2 expression is required for the HIF-1α-p53 interaction in cells. p53 and FLAG-HIF-1α were transiently transfected with or without Mdm2 in H1299 cells. Immunoprecipitations were carried out from cell extracts using anti-Flag M2 beads. As shown in Fig. 2, p53 was barely detectable in the HIF-1α-associated immunocomplexes in the absence of Mdm2 expression (lane 5), further confirming the idea that p53 cannot directly bind HIF-1α in vivo. In contrast, when Mdm2 was expressed in the cells, p53 was efficiently coprecipitated with HIF-1α by the same method (lane 6). These results indicate that Mdm2 acts as a bridge mediating the binding between HIF-1α and p53. Mdm2 is a key regulator of p53 and can both inhibit p53 transcriptional activity and target it for degradation (24Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50607-50611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We tested the possibility whether HIF-1α could protect p53 from degradation mediated by Mdm2. The p53-null H1299 cells were transfected with CMV-p53, CMV-Mdm2, CMV-GFP, and pTOPO-HIF-1α. 24 h after transfection the cells were lysed in a FLAG lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig.3a, HIF-1α effectively rescues p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation. Overexpression of Mdm2 significantly induced p53 degradation (lane 2 versus lane 1), whereas this degradation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon overexpression of HIF-1α (lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2). Interestingly, HPV E6 protein can induce p53 degradation through the E6/E6 AP ubiquitin ligase complex. However, overexpression of HIF-1α cannot protect p53 degradation mediated by E6 (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these results demonstrated an effect of HIF-1α directly on Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. Furthermore, we used p53 transcriptional activity assay to support the notion. To this end, we cotransfected MEFs (p53−/−) with vectors expressing p53, Mdm2, and HIF-1α, along with a reporter construct containing the minimal p21 promoter (p21min-luc). As indicated in Fig. 3c, cotransfection of Mdm2 with p53 strongly repressed p21 luciferase activity due to p53 degradation. However, HIF-1α significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of Mdm2 in a dose-dependent manner. The above data demonstrate that HIF-1α can strongly stabilize p53 by abrogating Mdm2-mediated effects, which leads to activation of p53-mediated transcription. To investigate whether HIF-1α can suppress p53 ubiquitination mediated by Mdm2, we carried out an in vitro ubiquitination assay. As shown in Fig. 3d, ubiquitinated p53 was easily detected at the reaction with Mdm2 but no HIF-1α (lane 2 versus lane 1). However, in the presence of HIF-1α, the levels of ubiquitinated p53 decreased dramatically (lane 3 versus lane 2). This result demonstrates that HIF-1α can significantly suppress Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Current models indicate that Mdm2 can also induce nuclear export of p53 (25Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,26Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that HIF-1α can block this export, we transfected H1299 cells with vectors expressing GFP-p53, Mdm2 or HIF-1α and examined them by immunofluorescence microscope (Fig.4a). The distribution of GFP-p53 was almost entirely nuclear when expressed alone, but it localized to the cytoplasm to varying extents when coexpressed with Mdm2. We scored the extent by which p53 localized to the cytoplasm when expressed alone or when expressed together with Mdm2 (Fig.4b). Cells cotransfected with p53 and Mdm2 had a 76% cytoplasmic expression versus 24% when p53 was transfected alone, indicating that nuclear Mdm2 can promote the cytoplasmic localization of p53 (25Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only 26% of cytoplasmic expression occurred in cells cotransfected with HIF-1α in addition to p53 and Mdm2 (Fig. 4, a and b). These results indicate that HIF-1α can strongly block Mdm2-mediated p53 nuclear export. How cells sense changes in ambient oxygen is a central question in biology. In mammalian cells, lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, leads to stabilization of a sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional factor called HIF. Downstream genes of HIF are linked to processes such as angiogenesis and glucose metabolism (20Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, hypoxia induces accumulation of the tumor suppressor p53. Earlier studies indicated that HIF-1α interacts with p53 in vivo (18An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar); however, the nature of this interaction has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that HIF-1α directly binds to Mdm2 both in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of Mdm2, the binding between HIF-1α and p53 is almost undetectable. Furthermore, Mdm2 expression significantly induces the indirect interaction between p53 and HIF-1α in cells, indicating that Mdm2 may act as a bridge mediating the p53-HIF-1α interaction. In this regard, we failed to detect any significant interaction between p53 and HIF-1α in MEF Mdm2−/− cells, and stabilization of p53 induced by HIF-1α expression was also severely abrogated (data not shown). Our findings seem at odds with the recent report of tight binding between the ODD domain of HIF-1α and the core domain of p53 by an array of immobilized peptide assay (22Hansson L.O. Friedler A. Freund S. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is likely that the experiment was based on p53 pepetide fragments, which may not be equivalent to the native, folded protein. However, the existence of Mdm2 somehow might cause the conformational change of p53 native protein, thereby favoring the exposure of binding sites of p53 to HIF-1α. In addition, our results demonstrate that HIF-1α protects p53 from degradation mediated by Mdm2 and can abrogate p53 transcriptional repression by Mdm2. Considering that p53 degradation is mainly induced by Mdm2 in normal cells, we also found that Mdm2-mediated ubiqutination of p53 is significantly inhibited by HIF-1α. Since Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination promotes its nuclear export (25Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we further demonstrate that HIF-1α expression can block Mdm-2-mediated nuclear export of p53. Thus, these results have significant implications regarding the molecular mechanism by which HIF-1α modulates p53 function in vivo. Our results are also consistent with published results indicating HIF-1α interacts with the wild-type p53 protein but not the tumor-derived p53 mutant form in cells (18An W.G. Kanekal M. Simon M.C. Maltepe E. Blagosklonny M.V. Neckers L.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Since wild-type p53 protein is capable of inducing Mdm2 expression in cells, the observed interaction between p53 and HIF-1α is most likely mediated by endogenous Mdm2. In contrast, because the tumor-derived p53 mutant is completely inactive in transcriptional activation of endogenous Mdm2, HIF-1α failed to interact with p53 since there is no (or very low levels) Mdm2 in cells expressing mutated p53. Recent studies also indicate that Mdm2 is involved in modulating HIF-1α stability under hypoxic conditions (21Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Redi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 33-44Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that HIF-1α directly interacts with Mdm2 but not p53. Mdm2 is a potent E3 ubiquitin ligase and induces both p53 degradation and nuclear export of p53 through ubiquitination. Therefore, it is possible that Mdm2 also directly mediates degradation and nuclear export of HIF-1α. Our study, together with several other studies (15Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P.

The spread of multidrug resistance in the most pathogenic causative agents, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum, underscores the need to identify active compounds with novel inhibitory properties. Although genetically unrelated, both organisms use a type II fatty-acid synthase system. Enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR), a key type II enzyme, has been repeatedly validated as an effective antimicrobial target. Using high throughput inhibitor screens with a combinatorial library, we have identified two novel classes of compounds with activity against the M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum enzyme (referred to as InhA and PfENR, respectively). The crystal structure of InhA complexed with NAD+ and one of the inhibitors was determined to elucidate the mode of binding. Structural analysis of InhA with the broad spectrum antimicrobial triclosan revealed a unique stoichiometry where the enzyme contained either a single triclosan molecule, in a configuration typical of other bacterial ENR:triclosan structures, or harbored two triclosan molecules bound to the active site. Significantly, these compounds do not require activation and are effective against wild-type and drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum. Moreover, they provide broader chemical diversity and elucidate key elements of inhibitor binding to InhA for subsequent chemical optimization.

Despite the worldwide ravages of tuberculosis and malaria, chemotherapeutic regimens against these two diseases have remained largely unchanged. For over 40 years, isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) 1The abbreviations used are: INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide; ACP, acyl carrier protein; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; ENR, enoyl reductase; FAS-I, fatty-acid synthase type I; FAS-II, fatty-acid synthase type II; InhA, the translation product of the inhA gene; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; PfENR, the translation product of the pfenr gene; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. ) has been utilized as a frontline agent in drug mixtures to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whereas Plasmodium falciparum malaria has primarily been treated with chloroquine or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. The emergence of strains resistant to these and all other widely available and affordable antitubercular and antimalarial drugs, due in part to the limited number of pathways being targeted, makes it essential to identify lead compounds active against novel targets. Of particular interest from a drug discovery perspective, M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum share enzymatic components of the type II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS-II) (1Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar, 2Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12352-12357Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In the case of Mycobacterium, FAS-II co-exists with the type I (FAS-I) pathway, a situation that is unique to this genus. Here FAS-I is responsible for de novo synthesis of the C16–C26 fatty acids, used for production of phospholipids and as primers for complex lipids. The FAS-II system extends these fatty acids up to C56 to make the long chain precursors required for the synthesis of cell wall-associated mycolic acids that are specific to Mycobacteria. For Plasmodium, FAS-II is the only fatty acid pathway whose enzymatic components reside in the apicoplast, a unique plastid organelle that is essential to the development of the parasite (3Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The apicoplast is thought to have derived from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont (4Kohler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W.

Bioessays. 1997; 19: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whose function in plasmodial parasites is still undetermined but appears to include fatty acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis (2Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G. Striepen B. Handman E. Lang-Unnasch N. Cowman A.F. Besra G.S. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The discovery of FAS-II in the malaria parasite was surprising as this pathway had been found previously only in plants, prokaryotes, and Archaea, where it is responsible for the synthesis of fatty acids up to C16 and C18 that are required for membrane biogenesis. No FAS-I homologs can be found in the gene sequence of P. falciparum or, for that matter, in any of the related Apicomplexan parasites. Whereas FAS-II consists of several distinct enzymes, all the enzyme activities required for FAS-I fatty acid elongation reside on a single, large multifunctional enzyme. Several observations demonstrate that the FAS-II enzymes are ideal candidates for drug discovery. First, fatty acid biosynthesis has been validated repeatedly as an effective antimicrobial target. For instance, FAS-II enzymes have been identified as the targets of several widely used antibacterials including INH, diazoborines (8Roujeinikova A. Sedelnikova S. de Boer G.J. Stuitje A.R.

Second, FAS-II is absent in humans, superceded by a FAS-I system that is insensitive to many FAS-II inhibitors. Moreover, the cell wall/membrane component fatty acyl chains appear to be essential to microbe division and metabolism, and microbial pathogens are apparently unable to survive simply by scavenging host fatty acids. The enzyme target of most of the known FAS-II antimicrobial compounds is ENR, which catalyzes the final enzymatic step in the elongation cycle of the FAS-II pathway, converting trans-2-enoyl-ACP to acyl-ACP in a NADH-dependent reaction. The M. tuberculosis ENR, commonly known as InhA or FabI, has been shown to be the target of the first line anti-tubercular INH (14Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). This enzymatic inhibition has been shown in the fast-growing model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis to inhibit mycolic acid synthesis and induce cell lysis (15Vilcheze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The activity of INH is dependent on its activation to an acyl radical by a manganese-dependent reaction catalyzed by the catalase/peroxidase enzyme, KatG (16Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The INH acyl-radical forms a covalent adduct with NADH, producing binding interactions with InhA. Mutations in KatG have been linked to clinical resistance in ∼50% of the newly diagnosed cases of INH-resistant tuberculosis (17Escalante P. Ramaswamy S. Sanabria H. Soini H. Pan X. Valiente-Castillo O. Musser J.M. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 79: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Compounds that do not require activation and that directly target ENR would circumvent this resistance mechanism. Unlike INH, the diazoborines and triclosan do not require activation, although their utility for human treatment is limited due to their respective toxicity (18Grassberger M.A. Turnowsky F. Hildebrandt J. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and poor solubility (19McLeod R. Muench S.P. Rafferty J.B. Kyle D.E. Mui E.J. Kirisits M.J. Mack D.G.

Triclosan has been reported recently (19McLeod R. Muench S.P. Rafferty J.B. Kyle D.E. Mui E.J. Kirisits M.J. Mack D.G. Roberts C.W. Samuel B.U. Lyons R.E. Dorris M. Milhous W.K. Rice D.W. Int. J.

Inhibition with thiolactomycin, a fairly nonspecific inhibitor of the FAS-II condensing enzyme, was also reported, albeit at high (∼50 μm) concentrations (2Waller R.F. Keeling P.J. Donald R.G.

In an extension of this research, the crystal structure of PfENR complexed with triclosan was recently solved, indicating a high degree of structural conservation between this malarial enzyme and microbial and plant ENRs (21Perozzo R.

To extend the range of pharmacophores from which to develop more potent and pharmacologically suitable ENR inhibitors, we have undertaken a high-throughput screen against the M. tuberculosis enzyme, InhA. Here we report the identification and preliminary evaluation of two novel inhibitors derived from this screen, Genz-8575 and Genz-10850, which demonstrate activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of both M. tuberculosis and P. falciparum. We also present structural data on the binding of one of these compounds, and triclosan, to purified InhA and PfENR. These structural data provide insights into the structure-activity relationships of these compounds and serve for further chemical refinement of inhibitors of this established antimicrobial target. Analysis of [14C]NAD+Binding to InhA—Gel filtration chromatography was utilized to separate InhA-bound [14C]NAD+ from free [14C]NAD+ (22Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For this, a 1 × 12-cm Sephadex G-25 column was equilibrated in 0.1 m PIPES, pH 6.8, at 25 °C. Samples (100 μl) containing combinations of InhA, [14C]NAD+, and triclosan were then applied. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and fractions were collected. Fractions were counted in ScintiVerse scintillation solution. Crystallization and Data Collection—Recombinant InhA was produced, purified, and crystallized using methods described previously (23Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1995; 267: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Hanging drop methods were utilized to co-crystallize InhA·inhibitor complexes. For the InhA·Genz-10850 complex, the product analog was solubilized in 100% Me2SO and added dropwise at room temperature to a dilute InhA solution containing NADH. The final molar ratios of the mixture were 1 InhA active site to 100 NADH to 1.5 Genz-10850, in 1% (v/v) Me2SO. The mixture was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and the crystals were produced in wells containing 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 150 mm ammonium acetate, and 100 mm [(carbamoylmethyl)imino]diacetic acid, pH 6.8, using the vapor diffusion method. The crystals were of the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 101.01 Å, b = 83.31 Å, c = 193.07 Å (α = 90°, β = 95.21°, γ = 90°) and contained 6 molecules per asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data of the InhA:Genz-10850 crystal was collected using a MacScience DIP2030 image plate detector coupled to a Rigaku x-ray generator utilizing a copper rotating anode (CuKα, λ = 1.54 Å). The detector was placed 200 mm from the crystal with no offset in the 2θ angle. Each data frame was exposed for 10 min and consisted of a 1.5° rotation of the crystal. For the InhA·triclosan complex, crystals bound to triclosan were formed in the I212121 space group, unit cell a = 94.8 Å, b = 103.9 Å, c = 189.6 Å, α = β = γ = 90°, via hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments, with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, in the well solution. InhA was concentrated to 5 mg/ml and crystallized upon the introduction of triclosan to a solution with a 1:2:1 stoichiometric ratio of InhA, NAD+, and triclosan. Increasing the concentration of triclosan to yield a 1:2:2 (or higher) stoichiometric ratio resulted in microcrystals that did not diffract. Data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution at 120 K. X-ray diffraction data of the InhA:triclosan crystal were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Beamline 14-BM-C) at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The detector was placed 200 mm from the crystal. Each data frame was exposed for 30 s and consisted of a 1.0° rotation of the crystal. All images were autoindexed, integrated, and scaled together using the DENZO and SCALEPACK software packages (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Initial phases were obtained using molecular replacement, with a single subunit of InhA derived from the hexagonal crystal form of InhA (Protein Data Bank code 1ENY) as a search model. Molecular replacement solutions for the translation and rotation function were obtained from Crystallography and NMR software (CNS) (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The CNS software package was utilized for molecular replacement, rigid-body refinement, simulated annealing, minimization, and B-factor refinement. The nucleotide cofactor was easily identified in a symmetry-averaged difference Fourier (Fo - Fc) electron density map, verifying the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied after rigid body refinement and initial simulated annealing. NAD+, triclosan, and water molecules were added during several cycles of minimization followed by B-factor refinement, resulting in an Rfactor of 19% and an Rfree of 28% for the InhA·Genz-10850 complex, and an Rfactor of 22.5% and an Rfree of 28% for the InhA·triclosan complex. Non-crystallographic restraints were removed when significant differences were observed between the individual subunits present in the asymmetric unit. Inspection of Fo - Fc electron density maps calculated from an InhA:NADH model revealed significant additional density in the active sites of some of the subunits in the asymmetric unit. For the InhA·Genz-10850 complex, four of the six subunits contained product analog, whereas the remaining subunits lacked bound inhibitor. For the InhA·triclosan complex, two molecules of triclosan were clearly identified and placed in one subunit of the enzyme, whereas the other subunit contained only one molecule of triclosan. The differences may be related to negative cooperativity (23Dessen A. Quemard A. Blanchard J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C.

Open table in a new tab High Throughput Screening, Synthesis of Inhibitors, and KiMeasurements—The high throughput screen measured the NADH-dependent catalysis of an octenoyl (C8:1 Δ2)-CoA substrate as a decrease in 340 nm absorbance resulting from conversion of NADH to NAD+. This screen was run using samples synthesized as mixtures of up to 100 compounds. For the mixture containing Genz-10850, indole-5 carboxylic acid was reacted with 86 different amines in equimolar and limiting concentration. This mixture showed 40% inhibition when tested at a total concentration of 40 μm. The 86 compounds in this mixture were then individually synthesized and tested. The most potent analogs from this mixture were amides of indole-5-carboxylic acid and 4-aryl-substituted piperazines. Subsequent synthesis of an array of piperazine analogs resulted in Genz-10850, which showed potent inhibition of InhA with an IC50 value of 0.15 μm (Table II). In the case of Genz-8575 (Table III), a mixture of 13 malondialdehydes was reacted with an excess of (4-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidin-2-yl)-hydrazine. The resulting mixture had an inhibition of 38% against InhA at 40 μm. Deconvolution of this mixture yielded several active pyrazoles, the best of which (Genz-5542, 2-[3-(4-chloro-2-nitrophenyl)-pyrazol-1-yl]-4-trifluoromethyl-pyrimidine) showed 82% inhibition at 40 μm. Several analogs of this compound were prepared, among them Genz-8575, the result of replacing the chlorine atom with a nitro group. Genz-8575 displayed 91% inhibition at 40 μm against InhA (Table III). Substrate and co-enzyme concentrations in these screens were 250 and 100 μm, respectively. IC50 values were determined by measuring the initial velocity over a broad range of inhibitor concentrations, plotting the fractional activity as a function of the log of the inhibitor concentration, and curve-fitting with a sigmoidal function.Table IIGenz-10850 structure-activity relationship data Open table in a new tab Table IIIGenz-8575 structure-activity relationship dataView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Inhibition constants were determined under conditions of saturating substrate (200 μm substrate and 600 μm NADH) and variable inhibitor concentrations. Ki values were determined from the x intercept of a Dixon plot, assuming uncompetitive inhibition. For triclosan binding of InhA, we found a Ki of 8.5 μm, which differs from an earlier measurement of 0.22 μm (26Parikh S.L. Xiao G. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7645-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These discrepant results may in part be due to differences in the assay conditions, including the use of different chain length acyl-CoA substrates (C12:1 CoA versus C8:1 CoA). Minimal Inhibitory Concentration Determination—Serial 10-fold dilutions of each M. tuberculosis culture were prepared in 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 0.05% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 80, and 10% oleate-albumin dextrose complex/saline. Each dilution was then plated on Middlebrook 7H10 medium containing 0.05% glycerol, and 10% oleate-albumin dextrose. Test compounds were added across a range of concentrations. The MIC99 value was defined as the lowest concentration of the test compound that resulted in <1% growth as compared with drug-free controls. Mycobacterial Growth Inhibition Experiments—Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC-12658), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC-27853), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC-33400), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-29213), Candida albicans (ATCC-10231), and Aspergillus niger (ATCC-16404) were obtained from the ATCC. To determine bacterial growth inhibition, fresh cultures were grown at 37 °C in TB broth to an optical density of 0.2 at 550 nm. By using 96-well plates, 100 μl of this culture was added to 100 μl of TB broth containing compounds dissolved in 2 μl of Me2SO. When the optical density of the control wells reached 0.9, the optical density of experimental wells was determined and used to derive percent inhibition of growth. Plasmodial Growth Inhibition Assays—P. falciparum asexual blood-stage parasites were assayed in vitro in RPMI 1640-based culture medium containing 2.5 mg/ml hypoxanthine and 0.5% albumax (In-vitrogen). Parasite cultures were then exposed to serial drug dilutions over a 72 h period, with addition of tritiated hypoxanthine (7.5 μCi/ml) after 48 h (27Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After accounting for background counts/min with uninfected red blood cell controls, the percentage reduction in tritiated hypoxanthine equaled 100 ×(mean cpm of samples without drug - mean cpm of drug dilution samples)/(mean cpm of samples without drug). This measurement represents a standard surrogate marker of growth inhibition. The IC50 and IC90 values were calculated by curve fitting and regression analyses. Characteristics of Triclosan Binding to InhA—To investigate the mode of triclosan binding to InhA, we purified and expressed this enzyme, performed initial velocity experiments, and measured the inhibition constants for triclosan. These experiments showed that triclosan binding was reversible and promoted by NAD+ binding, suggesting that triclosan was uncompetitive with respect to NAD+ and competed with the fatty acyl substrate. Previous studies with Escherichia coli FabI have used gel filtration experiments to investigate whether triclosan is a slow binding inhibitor (22Heath R.J. Rubin J.R. Holland D.R. Zhang E. Snow M.E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11110-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To test whether the same holds true for triclosan inhibition of InhA, we performed similar experiments, testing [14C]NAD+, InhA, and triclosan in co-elution assays (Fig. 1). These showed that [14C]NAD+ co-eluted with InhA only in the presence of triclosan. In the absence of triclosan, [14C]NAD+ eluted in the included volume. These results demonstrate that the ternary inhibitory complex is in fact triclosan, NAD+, and InhA, consistent with our previously published Km data that compared NAD+ with NADH (28Quemard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilcheze C. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). These data indicate that triclosan is a slow binding inhibitor of InhA, by nature of its requirement to form a complex with NAD+ in order to bind to the active site. These findings are consistent with earlier reports (9Heath R.J. Yu Y.T. Shapiro M.A. Olson E. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30316-30320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) of similar Ki values of triclosan inhibition of InhA and E. coli FabI, which were in the low micromolar range. In vitro whole-cell assays demonstrated good activity of triclosan against INH-resistant and -sensitive M. tuberculosis strains (Table IV). Consistent with triclosan acting without the requirement for KatG-mediated activation, this compound was as effective against a strain carrying the KatG mutation S315T (conferring high-level INH resistance) as it was against wild-type strains. When tested against a low level, INH-resistant line containing an inhA promoter mutation leading to enzyme overexpression, triclosan activity was partially compromised at 35 μm; however, this compound remained fully active at 70 μm. These data indicated that triclosan acts against InhA, as has now been confirmed by structural analysis (see below).Table IVTriclosan is active against isoniazid-susceptible and -resistant M. tuberculosisStrainMutationIsoniazid MICaMIC, minimal inhibitory concentration, expressed in μM.Triclosan MICM305Wild type1.520M306Wild type1.525M290inhA promoter7.560M307bThis strain is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, and kanamycin.katG S315T20020a MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration, expressed in μM.b This strain is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, and kanamycin. Open table in a new tab Development of Chemically Tractable Inhibitors—To identify additional lead compounds that act directly on M. tuberculosis InhA without the requirement for activation, we performed a high-throughput screen of ∼500,000 compounds from a combinatorial library, using purified InhA as a target. This screen resulted in the identification of Genz-8575 and Genz-10850, which represent two new classes of InhA inhibitors (Table II and Table III; Fig. 2). In testing a series of about 300 Genz-10850 analogs, a structure-activity relation emerged whereby substitution was not allowed at carbon positions 2 or 3 of the piperazine ring (suggesting a steric clash with this part of the molecule) and where polar substitutions were allowed at the 2-position of the fluorenyl group (suggesting that this site is exposed to solvent). Alkylation or acylation of the indole nitrogen was not tolerated, in agreement with the role of this moiety as a hydrogen-bonding group. For the Genz-8575 analogs, a stringent requirement was detected at the trifluoromethylpyrimidine substituent, with more latitude available at the dinitrophenyl site. When tested against purified InhA, Genz-8575 and Genz-10850 displayed I"
https://openalex.org/W2045452812,"The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is often overexpressed by tumors and mediates growth and apoptosis protection. We previously showed that antisense reagents complementary to the <i>IGF1R</i> translation start site enhance radio- and chemosensitivity and impair Atm function. However these agents induce relatively modest IGF1R down-regulation and affect insulin receptor levels. To identify alternative sites for molecular targeting, we utilized scanning oligonucleotide arrays to probe the secondary structure of <i>IGF1R</i> mRNA. This strategy enabled selection of antisense oligonucleotides that generated high heteroduplex yield with IGF1R but not insulin receptor transcripts. Antisense oligonucleotides that hybridized strongly to<i>IGF1R</i> mRNA caused IGF1R down-regulation within intact tumor cells, whereas weakly hybridizing oligonucleotides were inactive. Furthermore, the ability of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to block IGF1R expression correlated with the accessibility of the target sequence within the transcript. Thus, siRNAs corresponding to weakly hybridizing oligonucleotides caused minor IGF1R down-regulation, whereas siRNAs homologous to accessible targets induced profound sequence-specific <i>IGF1R</i> gene silencing, blocked IGF signaling, and enhanced tumor cell radiosensitivity. This indicates that secondary structure in the target transcript has a major effect on siRNA efficacy. These findings have implications for siRNA design and suggest that IGF1R-targeting agents incorporating this mode of action have potential as anticancer therapy."

We have identified Aha1 (activator of Hsp90 ATPase) and its relative Hch1 (high copy Hsp90 suppressor) as binding partners of Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using genetic and biochemical approaches, the middle domain of Hsp90 (amino acids 272–617) was found to mediate the interaction with Aha1 and Hch1. Data base searches revealed that homologues of Aha1 are conserved from yeast to man, whereas Hch1 was found to be restricted to lower eukaryotes like S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans. In experiments with purified proteins, Aha1 but not Hch1 stimulated the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp90 5-fold. To establish their cellular role further, we deleted the genes encoding Aha1 and Hch1 in S. cerevisiae. In vivo experiments demonstrated that Aha1 and Hch1 contributed to efficient activation of the heterologous Hsp90 client protein v-Src.

It is specifically involved in the folding and conformational regulation of a limited subset of proteins. Almost all natural substrates of Hsp90 are medically relevant signal transduction molecules, including the nuclear receptors for steroid hormones, several protooncogenic kinases, and disparate proteins such as nitric-oxide synthase (1Smith D.F.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Several Hsp90-associated cofactors contain tetratricopeptide repeat motifs, a degenerate 34-aa sequence, that mediate binding to the C-terminal EEVD motif of the molecular chaperone (10Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Other cofactors of Hsp90, like Sba1/p23 and cdc37/p50, lack tetratricopeptide repeats and are believed to use unique sequences to associate with the molecular chaperone. The basic mechanism of Hsp90 function is still not fully understood. Recent crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 (11Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Based on this structural evidence for nucleotide binding, it was demonstrated that Hsp90 can hydrolyze ATP and that this activity of the molecular chaperone is essential in vivo (13Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsp90 was unequivocally identified as an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone. Here we demonstrate binding of the novel cofactors Aha1 and Hch1 to the middle domain of Hsp90, currently a poorly investigated region in the molecular chaperone. The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp90 can be stimulated 5-fold by the cofactor Aha1. Deletion of the genes encoding Aha1 and Hch1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae impaired activation of the heterologous Hsp90-dependent substrate protein v-Src and interfered with cell viability under non-optimal conditions. Yeast Hsp90 (yHsp90) and fragments thereof were amplified from pTGPD/P82 (a gift from S. Lindquist) and yeast Aha1 (yAha1); Hch1 and Sti1 were amplified from wild type yeast DNA. PCR products were inserted into pProExHTa expression vector to generate an N-terminal His6sequence followed by a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. The point mutation E381K was generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Desired exchanges were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human Aha1 (hAha1) was amplified from a human brain cDNA library and cloned into pAS2-1 vector (Clontech). Human Hsp90FL (hHsp90) and hHsp90 fragments were amplified from human Hsp90α cDNA (StressGen, accession number X15183) (15Aligue R. Akhavan-Niak H. Russel P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6099-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and cloned into pACT2 vector (Clontech). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (13Obermann W.M.

Positive candidate cDNA inserts were further analyzed by analytical PCR and by nucleotide sequencing. For assaying protein-protein interactions, cotransformants were grown on SD/−Trp, −Leu plates. The interaction of the bait construct with the target construct was judged by the ability of cotransformants to grow on SD/−Trp, −Leu, −His plus 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole selection plates. Expression constructs in pProExHTa were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Bacteria were grown at 18 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol toA600 = 1, and protein expression was induced for 5 h with 0.25 mmisopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside. After harvesting, proteins were enriched from cell pellets by Ni-NTA chromatography at pH 8.0 essentially as described (13Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Proteins were further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on ResourceQ and by gel filtration on Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences). For gel filtration analysis, 500-ॖl samples containing the indicated combinations of yeast proteins yHsp90 (5 ॖm), yHsp90NM (5 ॖm), yHsp90N (10 ॖm), yAha1 (5 ॖm), Hch1 (5 ॖm), or Sti1 (5 ॖm) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and then separated on a Superose 12 HR10/30 or on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column equilibrated in the same buffer using an ÄKTA chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). 500-ॖl fractions were collected for analysis beginning at 6 ml of elution volume. For pull-down assays, yHsp90 protein fragments (10 ॖm) were bound to Ni-NTA resin in buffer PB (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 57 glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.27 Tween 20, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with 27 (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 27 fish skin gelatin to minimize unspecific protein interactions. yAha1 or Hch1 proteins (10 ॖm), which had been cleaved off from their His6 tags by tobacco etch virus protease treatment, were added, and the mixture was agitated at 4 °C for 30 min. After two washes with buffer PB, specifically bound protein was eluted from yHsp90 fragments with 500 mm KCl in the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant yHsp90 protein (5 ॖm) or the mutant yHsp90 E381K (5 ॖm) were incubated at 30 °C or at temperatures indicated with or without addition of yAha1 or Hch1 in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2 supplemented with 2 mm[α-32P]ATP (4 ॖCi/mm, Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min in a final volume of 20 ॖl. Aliquots of each reaction were stopped at time points by the addition of 5 mm EDTA and freezing in liquid nitrogen (13Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Separation of ADP from ATP was achieved by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets (Merck) in 0.5 m LiCl and 0.5 m formic acid. ATPase activity was monitored by quantitation of [α-32P]ADP in a liquid scintillation counter. Steady state ATPase rates were calculated from the linear range of the reactions, and ATP hydrolysis activity of 5 ॖm yHsp90 at 30 °C was set to 1007. For specific inhibition of the ATPase activity, geldanamycin was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 180 ॖm in 17 Me2SO. Control reactions received Me2SO alone.

Cells were grown on YPD or on SD, SRaf, and SGal selective minimal medium (0.677 yeast nitrogen base supplemented with 27 glucose, raffinose, or galactose, respectively, and with nucleotides and amino acids depending on auxotrophy). The HCH1 gene was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pBluescript vector via SacI/XhoI. A disruption allele was generated by cutting a substantial part of the ORF and inserting the TRP1 gene viaStyI/HincII. The disruption fragment was released from the plasmid by digestion with SacI/XhoI and transformed into haploid ILEP1 (a gift from Susan Lindquist) or haploid W303 cells. Transformants were selected on SD/−Trp plates. TheAHA1::KanMX4 disruption cassette was generated by PCR amplification from genomic DNA isolated from theAHA1 knockout strain Y03573 (EUROSCARF), and transformants were selected on YPD agar plates containing 200 mg/l G418. After isolation of genomic DNA from transformants and from wild type cells, disruption of wild type alleles was analyzed by PCR using specific flanking primers. The correct replacement of the respective target gene by its deletion allele in transformed cells was verified by the appearance of PCR products of the expected size and absence of PCR products corresponding to the wild type allele as described (18Giaever G.

Yeast cells were grown overnight in SRaf/−Ura medium, diluted to A600= 0.3 into the same medium, and supplemented with 27 galactose for 6 h at 25 °C to induce v-Src expression. Cell viability was assessed by spotting serial dilutions onto SD/−Ura plates at 25 °C. Cultures were collected by centrifugation, resuspended for 10 min in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 17 Triton X-100, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 units/ॖl lyticase and lysed by ultrasonification for 10 s on ice. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.57 gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed following the protocol of Towbin et al. (20Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). Antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and EC10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were used to detect phosphotyrosine residues or v-Src protein, respectively. The ECL reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize immunocomplexes. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. HCH1 (ORF YNL281w) had been identified as ahigh copy Hsp90 suppressor of the temperature-sensitive Hsp90 mutant E381K in S. cerevisiae(21Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We used the 153-aa sequence of the Hch1 protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P53834) as a bait to screen the EMBL and NCBI protein data bases with the Blast and Fasta3 server. As a result, we found that Hch1 shares sequence homology to a short 151-aa protein present inCandida albicans (Swiss-Prot accession number O93993) and to the N-terminal half of the 350-aa S. cerevisiae protein Aha1 (activator of Hsp90 ATPase, Swiss-Prot accession number Q12449, ORF YDR214w), which is conserved from yeast to mammals (Swiss-Prot accession numbers Q9P782 for Schizosaccharomyces pombe, 336 aa; Q93168 forCaenorhabditis elegans, 343 aa; Q9LHL7 for Arabidopsis thaliana, 360 aa; Q9V9Q4 for Drosophila melanogaster, 361 aa; Q8R3E6 for Mus musculus, 338 aa; and O95433 forHomo sapiens, 338 aa). Aha1 proteins therefore consist of a putative N-terminal domain, which is homologous to Hch1 and an additional putative C-terminal domain. Human Aha1 (hAha1) shares 237 sequence identity and 387 sequence homology to S. cerevisiae Aha1 (yAha1) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, S. cerevisiae is unique in a way that it harbors Hch1 and Aha1, whereas all other organisms investigated, with the exception of C. albicans, contain only homologues of Aha1. In their original study, Lindquist and co-workers (21Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suspected that Hch1 might act as a cochaperone or modulator of the Hsp90 system. This idea implies that Hch1 and possibly Aha1 due to its sequence similarity could interact with Hsp90. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the cDNA for human Aha1 (hAha1) into the pAS2-1 vector and used it as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen against a human brain cDNA library. Screening of ∼1.5 million cotransformants yielded 129 positive clones, all of them harboring hHsp90 sequences as demonstrated by analytical PCR using Hsp90-specific primers. Strikingly, besides hHsp90, no other interacting proteins were identified. Similarly, when recombinant yAha1 or hAha1 was added to S. cerevisiae or mammalian cell extracts, yHsp90 or Hsp90 could be coprecipitated (data not shown). Sequencing of 16 of the 129 positive hHsp90 cDNA clones revealed 10 sequences starting within a region (aa 220–291) that links the N-terminal and the middle domain of hHsp90 (Fig.2A). This result proposed that regions in the middle domain or in the C-terminal domain of hHsp90 were involved in binding to hAha1. The remaining cDNAs were full length or started very close to the N terminus. To delineate the binding site further, we tested hHsp90FL and the fragments hHsp90N, hHsp90M, and hHsp90C by yeast two-hybrid analysis for binding to hAha1 and to Hch1 (Fig. 2B). Although hHsp90FL and hHsp90M exhibited binding to hAha1, hHsp90N and hHsp90C did not. A similar result was obtained for Hch1 (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the interaction with hAha1 and Hch1 is mediated by the middle domain of hHsp90 and therefore distinct from the binding of TPR-containing cofactors like Sti1/p60/Hop to the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 (10Scheufler C.

Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Biochemical binding assays using purified yAha1 protein were performed to support and extend the outcome of our two-hybrid experiments. First, we tested yHsp90FL and the protein fragment yHsp90NM for their ability to interact with the yAha1 protein by gel filtration chromatography. yAha1, clearly migrating as a monomer, yHsp90FL, and yHsp90NM showed different elution profiles on a Superose 12 column (Fig.3, A, B, andD). We combined yHsp90FL and yHsp90NM with yAha1 and analyzed the mixtures for protein interactions (Fig. 3, Cand E). When a mixture of yHsp90FL and yAha1 was run on a Superose 12 gel filtration column, a significant amount of yAha1 coeluted with yHsp90FL (Fig. 3C, fractions 7–12), consistent with the formation of a complex between the two proteins. This binding was independent of ATP and could be disrupted by increasing the salt concentration to 500 mm KCl (not shown). When yHsp90NM and yAha1 were incubated together and run on a Superose 12 column, again a certain amount of yAha1 comigrated with this yHsp90 fragment (Fig. 3E, fractions 10–12) indicating that the C-terminal domain of the molecular chaperone is dispensable for the interaction. Binding of yAha1 to yHsp90 M is not shown in Fig.3, and because complexes could not be resolved from either protein alone, we instead used a pull-down experiment to demonstrate this interaction (see below). However, when using a Superdex 75 column instead of a Superose 12 column, yAha1 could be separated from yHsp90N (Fig. 3, F and G). A mixture of the two proteins was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, but no shift in the migration of yHsp90N was observed (Fig. 3H), consistent with the view that the N-terminal domain of yHsp90 is not involved in binding to yAha1. As an independent verification of these domain mapping studies, yAha1 was assayed for interacting with purified N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal domains of yHsp90 immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose in a pull-down experiment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mixtures of yAha1 and yHsp90 fragments were incubated to allow binding and were finally recovered by centrifugation. Protein that had specifically bound to yHsp90 fragments was eluted by 500 mmKCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. yAha1 bound to yHsp90M and could be specifically eluted from this protein fragment but was not retained on yHsp90N or on yHsp90C (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when Hch1 or the corresponding N-terminal fragment yAha1-(1–156) was used in this pull-down experiment. In contrast, the C-terminal yAha1-(157–350) fragment did not bind to yHsp90 (data not shown). Thus, the biochemical data are in full agreement with the observation of our yeast two-hybrid assays and demonstrate that the middle domain of Hsp90 is necessary and sufficient to bind Aha1 and Hch1. Sti1/p60/Hop is bound in “intermediate” Hsp90 chaperone complexes to the C-terminal domain of the molecular chaperone by one of its TPR clamp domains and also contacts the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 thereby blocking access to the ATP-binding site (23Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to ask whether Sti1 interferes with binding of yAha1 to yHsp90, and we therefore analyzed a mixture of Sti1, yHsp90, and yAha1 for complex formation by gel filtration chromatography. Sti1 and the yHsp90-yAha1 complex showed different elution profiles on a Superose 12 column (Fig.5, A and B). Upon addition of Sti1 to yHsp90FL and yAha1 at equimolar amounts, the yHsp90FL-yAha1 complex was apparently almost completely disrupted (Fig.5C). This situation resembles the competition of cdc37/p50 by Sti1/p60/Hop (24Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

ATP hydrolysis has been shown to be essential to the in vivofunction of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (13Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were curious as to whether this capacity of yHsp90 could be affected by yAha1. We titrated increasing amounts of yAha1 into 5 ॖmyHsp90 (corresponding to 2.5 ॖm dimer) and measured ATPase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ATP hydrolysis rate for various combinations of yHsp90 and yAha1 is plotted in Fig. 6A. Obviously, yAha1 was able to stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of yHsp90 up to 5-fold. Next we asked whether Hch1, which is homologous to the putative N-terminal domain of yAha1, would also be able to influence yHsp90 ATPase activity. Interestingly, although Hch1 bound to Hsp90 (Fig. 2B), it was not able to stimulate yHsp90 ATPase activity significantly even at 50 ॖm, a 10:1 molar ratio relative to yAha1 (Fig. 6B). Moreover, when yAha1 was dissected into two fragments, one comprising the putative N-terminal domain (aa 1–156) and the other one encompassing the putative C-terminal domain (aa 157–350), the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis rate of yHsp90 could not be stimulated by any of these truncated proteins (Fig.6B). This result indicates that the entire yAha1 polypeptide is required for stimulating the ATPase activity of yHsp90. Since Hch1 was not able to stimulate the ATP hydrolysis rate of yHsp90 but suppressed the temperature-sensitive yHsp90 mutant E381K (21Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we assumed that the defect of this mutant at the non-permissive temperature is not due to a major reduction of ATPase activity. To test this assumption rigorously, we determined the rate of ATP hydrolysis for the E381K mutant at 25 and 37 °C, the non-permissive temperature, and compared it to wild type yHsp90. The shift to 37 °C did not harm the ATPase activity of the E381K mutant. Instead, the ATPase activity of the E381K mutant was raised with temperature and reached a value comparable with wild type yHsp90 (Fig. 6C). Thus, the loss of function due to the E381K mutation at the non-permissive temperature presumably results from defects in other aspects of Hsp90 biochemistry, which can be restored by the assistance of Hch1. Due to the relationship of both proteins (Fig. 1), Hch1 and Aha1 could serve overlapping functions and be redundant in S. cerevisiae. Therefore, we created knockouts ΔHCH1, ΔAHA1,and the ΔHCH1/ΔAHA1 double knockout in the wild type yeast strain W303 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative growth rate of wild type cells and of these three knockout strains was assessed using a plate assay. There was no obvious difference in the growth rate at 25, 35.5, or at 37 °C on YPD agar plates (Fig. 7). Thus a complete loss of Hch1 and Aha1 protein activity did not affect viability of W303 cells at normal and at elevated temperatures. A comparable mild effect at 37 °C has been described previously for the deletion of the gene encoding Sba1/p23 (26Fang Y.F. Fliss A.E. Rao J. Caplan A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We next asked whether deletions of Hch1 and Aha1 would harm cells more severely if intracellular levels of Hsp90 were significantly reduced. To investigate such a situation we made use of the W303-derived strain ILEP1, a kind gift from Susan Lindquist. In ILEP1 cells expression of Hsp90 was controlled by a partially deleted promoter, which results in a reduction of Hsp90 to ∼1/20 of the normal level (17Xu Y. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The same deletions as described above for W303 were generated in ILEP1, and cells were again assessed for viability. No difference in growth phenotype was observed at 25 and at 35.5 °C. However, when viability was tested at 37 °C, the ILEP1 ΔHCH1/ΔAHA1double knockout cells exhibited obvious growth defects compared with the parental strain and with the single knockout strains (Fig.7). The tyrosine kinase v-Src is active in a manner that is dependent on the molecular chaperone Hsp90 and its cofactors/cochaperones. In wild type cells like W303, expression of v-Src leads to greatly increased levels of phosphotyrosine. Mutations affecting Hsp90 itself or deletions of genes encoding cofactors of the Hsp90 system resulted in a decrease of v-Src activity accompanied with lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (28Chang H.C. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Dey B. Caplan A.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol.

Since v-Src expression is toxic in yeast cells, v-Src was expressed from a galactose-regulated plasmid. We observed in a control experiment that most of the strains generated in this study grew equally well on glucose, galactose, and raffinose medium. As an exception, ΔHCH1/ΔAHA1 double deletion cells displayed a clearly delayed growth phenotype on galactose as the sole carbon source. When theseΔHCH1/ΔAHA1 cells were transformed with the v-Src expression plasmid and induced by transfer from SRaf/−Ura to SGal/−Ura medium, v-Src levels were strongly decreased compared with wild type or to the single deletion strains (data not shown). In contrast, addition of galactose toΔHCH1/ΔAHA1 cells growing on raffinose medium had no negative effect on their growth rate. Therefore, W303 and ILEP1 wild type and deletion strains were transformed with the v-Src expression plasmid, grown in SRaf/−Ura medium overnight,"
https://openalex.org/W2135634425,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently identified human homolog of ACE, is a novel metallocarboxypeptidase with specificity, tissue distribution, and function distinct from those of ACE. ACE2 may play a unique role in the renin-angiotensin system and mediate cardiovascular and renal function. Here we report the discovery of ACE2 peptide inhibitors through selection of constrained peptide libraries displayed on phage. Six constrained peptide libraries were constructed and selected against FLAG-tagged ACE2 target. ACE2 peptide binders were identified and classified into five groups, based on their effects on ACE2 activity. Peptides from the first three classes exhibited none, weak, or moderate inhibition on ACE2. Peptides from the fourth class exhibited strong inhibition, with equilibrium inhibition constants (K(i) values) from 0.38 to 1.7 microm. Peptides from the fifth class exhibited very strong inhibition, with K(i) values < 0.14 microm. The most potent inhibitor, DX600, had a K(i) of 2.8 nm. Steady-state enzyme kinetic analysis showed that these potent ACE2 inhibitors exhibited a mixed competitive and non-competitive type of inhibition. They were not hydrolyzed by ACE2. Furthermore, they did not inhibit ACE activity, and thus were specific to ACE2. Finally, they also inhibited ACE2 activity toward its natural substrate angiotensin I, suggesting that they would be functional in vivo. As novel ACE2-specific peptide inhibitors, they should be useful in elucidation of ACE2 in vivo function, thus contributing to our better understanding of the biology of cardiovascular regulation. Our results also demonstrate that library selection by phage display technology can be a rapid and efficient way to discover potent and specific protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1980034972,"The formation of RAD51 foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR) represents an important step in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RAD51 foci also appear during S phase and are thought to be required for the restart of stalled or broken replication forks. The RAD51 recombinase interacts directly with the breast cancer-associated tumour suppressor BRCA2, an interaction that is required for normal recombination proficiency, radiation resistance and genome stability. In CAPAN-1 cells, which express a truncated form of BRCA2 that is cytoplasmic because of loss of the nuclear localization signal, the formation of IR-induced RAD51 foci is impaired. In this work, we show that S-phase RAD51 foci form normally in CAPAN-1 cells expressing truncated BRCA2. Moreover, we find that RAD51 specifically associates with chromatin at S phase in a reaction that is BRCA2-independent. The observed BRCA2-dependent and independent formation of RAD51 foci shows that intact BRCA2 is not required for RAD51 focus formation per se, leading us to suggest that S phase and IR-induced RAD51 foci assemble by distinct pathways with defined protein requirements."

Reduced collagen fibril diameter is also observed in the sclera of eyes with high myopia. The present study investigated aspects of scleral collagen synthesis and degradation, in a mammalian model of high myopia, to elucidate the factors underlying scleral changes. General synthesis and degradation of scleral collagen was investigated in monocularly deprived tree shrews, through the in vivoadministration of [3H]proline and subsequent assay of scleral tissue for [3H]collagen. In addition, PCR enriched cDNA, produced from tree shrew scleral mRNA, was used to synthesize probes for hybridization to custom gene arrays consisting of partial sequences for 11 collagen subtypes. Finally, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was employed to investigate collagen type I, III, and V mRNA expression in the sclera of myopic, contralateral control, and normal tree shrew eyes. Scleral [3H]proline incorporation was reduced at the posterior pole of myopic eyes following 5 days of monocular deprivation (−36 ± 47), whereas [3H]proline content was similar in treated and control eyes before myopia induction (−1 ± 87) but was reduced in myopic eyes following 5 (−8 ± 27), 12 (−15 ± 47), and 24 (−10 ± 47) days of myopia induction. The majority of the collagens investigated were found to be expressed in the sclera, with 11 subtypes being identified. Collagen type I mRNA expression was reduced in the sclera of myopic eyes (−20 ± 77), however, collagen type III (+2 ± 97) and type V (−1 ± 67) expression was unchanged relative to control, resulting in a net increase in the ratio of expression of collagen type III/type I and collagen type V/type I (22 and 257, respectively). These results show that reduced scleral collagen accumulation in myopic eyes is a result of both decreased collagen synthesis and accelerated collagen degradation. Furthermore, changes in collagen synthesis are driven by reduced type I collagen production. Short term increases in the ratio of newly synthesized collagen type III/type I and type V/type I are likely to be important in the increasing frequency of small diameter scleral collagen fibrils observed in high myopia and may be important in the subsequent development of posterior staphyloma in humans with pathological myopia.

The Myopias: Basic Science and Clinical Management. Harper ' Row, Philadelphia, PA1985Google Scholar). Studies, in humans and animal models, have shown how this increased axial length is predominantly a consequence of increased vitreous chamber depth, rather than marked changes in any other ocular component parameter such as anterior chamber depth or lens thickness (2Sorsby A. Leary G.A. Med. Res. Counc. (G. B.) Spec. Rep. Ser. 1969; 309: 1-41PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wiesel T.N. Raviola E. Nature. 1977; 266: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The prevalence of human high myopia (usually defined as eyes with >6 dioptres (D) of myopia, or >26 mm in length) is ∼27 in the general population (1Curtin B.J. The Myopias: Basic Science and Clinical Management. Harper ' Row, Philadelphia, PA1985Google Scholar) and it is well documented that individuals with high myopia have a greatly increased risk of ocular pathology (4Grossniklaus H.E. Green W.R. Retina. 1992; 12: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Current thinking holds that excessive elongation of the vitreous chamber is the causative factor in the development of chorioretinal pathology, likely because of the increased biomechanical stresses that are placed on the retina and choroid in an enlarged eye. The development of high myopia in humans is associated with marked thinning of the sclera, the tough outer coat of the eye that facilitates any change in eye size. Scleral thinning is greatest at the posterior pole of the eye, the anatomical region of greatest retinal photoreceptor density and vital to detailed visual discrimination (5Curcio C.A. Sloan K.R. Packer O. Hendrickson A.E. Kalina R.E. Science. 1987; 236: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,6Müller B. Peichl L. J. Comp.

This altered scleral morphology is associated with local changes in collagen fibril ultrastructure and increased numbers of small diameter collagen fibrils. In addition, there is a more lamellar organization of posterior scleral collagen fibril bundles (7Curtin B.J. Teng C.C. Trans. Am. Acad. Ophthalmol. Oto-laryngol. 1957; 62: 777-788Google Scholar, 9Curtin B.J. Iwamoto T. Renaldo D.P. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1979; 97: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Similar characteristics are reported in the sclera of mammalian models of myopia progression, such as the tree shrew, where scleral thinning and tissue loss precede the appearance of more small diameter collagen fibrils and altered fibril bundle morphology (10McBrien N.A. Cornell L.M. Gentle A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2179-2187PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen accounts for 907 of scleral dry weight, the majority of this being collagen type I (11Norton T.T. Miller E.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: S760Google Scholar, 12Zorn N. Hernandez M.R. Norton T.T. Yang J. Ye H.O. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: S1053Google Scholar). Mammalian sclera also contains small amounts of other fibrillar and fibril-associated collagens (13Marshall G.E. Konstas A.G. Lee W.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Tamura Y. Konomi H. Sawada H. Takashima S. Nakajima A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Sci. 1997; 38: 2408-2422PubMed Google Scholar) and studies have shown that scleral fibrils are heterologous, comprising collagen types I, III, and V (13Marshall G.E. Konstas A.G. Lee W.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To date, at least 21 different collagen subtypes have been identified (16Fitzgerald J. Bateman J.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with subtype expression patterns tissue- and structure-specific. As a result, it is likely that additional collagen subtypes to those already identified are expressed in the mammalian sclera. Of particular note is the fact that in tissues such as the cornea, minor fibrillar collagen subtypes, particularly collagen type V, are important in regulating lateral accretion of collagen, thus controlling fibril diameter (17Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian models of myopia have shown that scleral thinning and tissue loss occur rapidly in myopia development (10McBrien N.A. Cornell L.M. Gentle A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2179-2187PubMed Google Scholar). Scleral tissue loss occurs in conjunction with increased expression and activation of collagen-degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (18Guggenheim J.A. McBrien N.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1380-1395PubMed Google Scholar), decreased production of glycosaminoglycans (19McBrien N.A. Lawlor P. Gentle A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3713-3719PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rada J.A. Nickla D.L. Troilo D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2050-2058PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased proliferative activity of scleral cells (21Gentle A. McBrien N.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The net result is a decrease in scleral collagen content (22Norton T.T. Rada J.A. Vision Res. 1995; 35: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), as also found in human high myopia (23Avetisov E.S. Savitskaya N.F. Vinetskaya M.I. Iomdina E.N. Metab. Pediatr. Syst. Ophthalmol. 1984; 7: 183-188Google Scholar). However, there has to date been no explicit demonstration of the process of collagen degradation in eyes with progressive myopia. Scleral remodeling accompanies alteration in its material properties, with the sclera becoming more extensible in myopic eyes. Studies show that increased extensibility is not solely accounted for by scleral thinning, suggesting that altered scleral biochemistry results in changes to the physical properties of the matrix (24Phillips J.R. McBrien N.A. Ophthalmic Physiol. Opt. 1995; 15: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Siegwart J.T. Norton T.T. Vision Res. 1999; 39: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The majority of scleral thinning and tissue loss occur well before the increased frequency of smaller collagen fibrils (10McBrien N.A. Cornell L.M. Gentle A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2179-2187PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that changes in fibril diameter are secondary to the initial process of scleral thinning in myopic eyes. However, given that collagen turns over relatively slowly in mature tissues (26Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W. Lafeber F.P. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39027-39031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), it is likely that the immediate effects of altered scleral biochemistry on collagen fibril morphology do not manifest for some time. This study investigated two important issues relating to the role of scleral collagen in the development of high myopia, using the well characterized tree shrew model of myopia (27McBrien N.A. Norton T.T. Vision Res. 1992; 32: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). First, it was established whether general collagen synthesis, collagen degradation, or a combination of the two, underlies reduced scleral collagen accumulation and tissue loss in eyes with progressive myopia. Second, expression of a range of collagen subtypes was demonstrated in the sclera, before short term expression patterns of collagen subtypes III and V, in conjunction with those of type I, were investigated in myopic eyes, to determine their possible role in fibril diameter changes. Tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) pups were maternally reared in our breeding colony before being transferred to individual cages and assigned to one of the experimental groups. Following the commencement of experimental procedures, animals were maintained on a 15/9 h light/dark cycle and food and water were available ad libitum. Myopia was induced monocularly, using a translucent occluder attached to a head-mounted durilium goggle, which was fitted to animals under anesthesia (ketamine, 90 mg/kg; xylazine, 10 mg/kg) using the procedure previously described (28Siegwart J.T. Norton T.T. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1994; 44: 213-215Google Scholar). The unoccluded eye served as a paired control. The myopia-inducing goggle was always fitted 15 days after natural eye-opening, the start of the period where tree shrews have been found to be most susceptible to the inducement of myopia (27McBrien N.A. Norton T.T. Vision Res. 1992; 32: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Siegwart J.T. Norton T.T. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 3505-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Numbers of right or left eye treatments were as balanced as possible within each group. All of the procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia's Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals in Research. General scleral collagen production was investigated in one group of animals (n = 6) that had myopia induced for 5 days before newly synthesized collagen was labeled via delivery of a radiolabeled collagen precursor ([3H]proline) and the scleral tissue was collected and assayed. Four groups of animals (n = 5 each group) were used to investigate the elimination of collagen from the sclera. Animals were injected with the radiolabeled collagen precursor, allowed a suitable period for collagen labeling (24 h), then scleral tissue was collected (time 0) or myopia was induced for periods of 5, 12, or 24 days before the tissue was collected. Scleral tissue was then assayed for the amount of labeled collagen remaining in the sclera. One group of untreated animals (n = 2) was used to determine collagen expression profiles in the sclera. Whole scleral tissue was collected from these animals 20 days after natural eye opening, representing an equivalent age to the animals that underwent 5 days of myopia induction. Scleral collagen mRNA expression in myopia was investigated in one group of animals that had myopia induced for 5 days (n = 8), whereas one group of age-matched untreated animals (n = 4) were employed as a control for this study. Ocular axial dimensions and ocular refraction were measured at the end of the treatment period in all animals, using A-scan ultrasonography and streak retinoscopy, respectively, as has previously been reported (30McBrien N.A. Moghaddam H.O. Reeder A.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were taken after the animals had been placed under anesthesia (ketamine, 90 mg/kg; xylazine, 10 mg/kg). Following ocular measurements, eyes were enucleated with animals under terminal anesthesia (120 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital). In animals used to investigate general collagen synthesis and degradation, both eyes were enucleated and the left eye was dissected before the right eye, thus randomizing whether the treated or control eye was dissected first. Following enucleation, extraneous orbital tissue was cleaned away and the anterior structures were removed with scissors cutting close to the limbus. The posterior segment was flat-mounted and a 7-mm trephine, centered on the posterior pole of the eye, was used to separate the sample into posterior and anterior/equatorial samples. These samples were cleaned of retina and choroid. The optic nerve head was removed from the posterior sample using a 1.5-mm trephine. The lens and ciliary body were removed from the anterior ocular structures and a 5-mm trephine was used to isolate the central cornea for use as a control. The corneal stroma is a collagenous extracellular matrix that is continuous with the sclera but does not alter its rate of matrix turnover during myopia progression (19McBrien N.A. Lawlor P. Gentle A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3713-3719PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until assayed. In animals utilized for mRNA expression studies, the dissection process was essentially identical, except the fact that the left eye was removed and dissected while the animal was maintained under deep anesthesia on a heating pad, following that the right eye was removed and dissected. The scleral samples were the only tissues collected from these animals and all samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 6 min of enucleation. In the group of animals that provided information regarding collagen production, an intraperitoneal injection of 300 ॖCi ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (1 mCi/ml, 3.7 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was administered on the final morning of the procedure. Proline is a relatively specific collagen precursor, accounting for ∼47 of non-collagenous proteins and 147 of collagen (31Laurent G.J. Sparrow M.P. Bates P.C. Millward D.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, when proline is assayed in a tissue such as the sclera, which comprises around 907 collagen (11Norton T.T. Miller E.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: S760Google Scholar), almost all of that assayed will represent collagen. A period of 9 h was allowed for incorporation of the label into newly synthesized collagen before ocular measurements were taken and the tissue was collected for assay. Pilot studies suggested that peak label incorporation was reached by this point. In the four groups of animals that provided information of general collagen degradation, an intraperitoneal injection of 300 ॖCi ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline was delivered 24 h prior to the onset of monocular occlusion, the literature suggesting that even in a rapidly remodeling tissue such as the neonatal cornea, 24 h is sufficient for peak incorporation of label incorporation to have passed (32Lee R.E. Davison P.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the time of fitting of the occluder, a dose of “cold” proline (7 mmol/kg l-proline in 0.97 saline) was administered, the dose being 100 times that of the radiolabeled proline, with the intention of diluting intracellular proline precursor pools and limiting the potential for reutilization of label (33Laurent G.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MultiScreen filtration plates (0.65 ॖm pore size, Durapore membrane, number MANP N6510) were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA); cytoscint liquid scintillation fluid from ICN (Irvine, CA); pepsin, l-hydroxyproline, chloramine T, andp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde were from Sigma; Macro arrays were custom made to our design by the Australian Genome Research Foundation (AGRF, Melbourne, Australia); SMART cDNA synthesis kit and the Advantage 2 PCR kit were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA); Micro Bio-Spin 30 columns were obtained from Bio-Rad; [α-32P]dCTPs, Rapid Hyb buffer, and Megaprime labeling kits were obtained from Amersham Biosciences; PCR primers were obtained from Genset (South La Jolla, CA); guanidine thiocyanate, DNase I, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, dNTPs, and RNasin were obtained from Promega; FastStart DNA Master Mix was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany); QIAquick PCR purification kits were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); CEQ DTCS Quick Start sequencing kits were obtained from Beckman; All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Tissue was homogenized in sterile de-ionized water using a freezer mill. The homogenate was then mixed with pepsin and acetic acid to give final concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 0.5 m, respectively. The samples were gently agitated at 4 °C for 48 h. The digested samples were then centrifuged to pellet insoluble material and the supernatant was collected for assay. Connective tissues contain collagen fractions that are variously soluble under specific conditions. Our pilot studies and previous reports indicated that the above method gave the best recovery of collagen for minimal processing (34Newsome D.A. Gross J. Hassell J.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1982; 22: 376-381PubMed Google Scholar), however, to control for variations in extraction efficiency, raw data were always normalized to hydroxyproline content of the homogenate. The [3H]proline assay was adapted from a previous report with slight modifications to suit this experiment (35Koyano Y. Hammerle H. Mollenhauer J. BioTechniques. 1997; 22 (710–712, 714): 706-708PubMed Google Scholar). Filters of the multiwell plate were wetted with 100 ॖl of 257 trichloroacetic acid. Triplicates (100 ॖl) of each corneal, anterior/equatorial, or posterior scleral sample were added to the wells with 100 ॖl of 507 trichloroacetic acid. The plates were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation to precipitate the macromolecules. The precipitate was collected on the filter membrane by draining thoroughly on a vacuum manifold, then washed 3 times with 300 ॖl of 107 trichloroacetic acid to remove the unincorporated label. The filters were allowed to air dry before being punched into plastic scintillation vials containing 500 ॖl of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride in 337 isopropyl alcohol. The vials were incubated overnight with gentle agitation to dissociate the collagen from the filter. The radiolabel was quantified through the addition of 10 ml of cytoscint and scintillation counting. Data (disintegrations/min) were corrected for isotope counting efficiency using the internal standard and isotope library of the machine. Hydroxyproline content, a highly specific indicator of collagen content in each sample, was determined using a previously described assay (36Reddy G.K. Enwemeka C.S. Clin. Biochem. 1996; 29: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Standards of hydroxyproline were prepared (0.5–8.0 ॖg in 40 ॖl) and 10 ॖl of sodium hydroxide (10 m) was mixed with 40 ॖl of sample or standard in autoclavable tubes. Each sample and standard was hydrolyzed by autoclaving at 120 °C for 20 min. Chloramine-T solution (0.056 m in 107 1-propanol and acetate citrate buffer, 450 ॖl) was added to each hydrolysate after cooling and, after mixing gently, the oxidation reaction proceeded for 25 min at room temperature. Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent (1 mp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 1-propanol/perchloric acid, 2:1, v/v) was freshly prepared and added to each vial (500 ॖl) and mixed gently. All samples and standards were then incubated in a water bath at 65 °C for 20 min to develop the color change. The color density was quantified at 550 nm using a spectrophotometer. The 40,000 Human Unigene clone library at the AGRF was searched to find available IMAGE clone sequences for the various collagen subtypes. Where multiple α-subunit clones were available for a given collagen subtype, the most common naturally occurring α-subunit, usually α1, was selected. The sequence associated with the accession number of each selected clone was confirmed using the BLAST facility at the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/BLAST). Once clones had been validated (subunits representing collagens I-IX, XI, and XIII–XVIII) the custom array was produced and included two ubiquitously expressed genes as positive controlsHPRT1 and GAPDH. The final array had each selected clone represented in duplicate. Colonies were grown, transferred onto membranes, and lysed at the AGRF. The colony plates were supplied with the arrays to allow sequence validation. Following delivery of the arrays, it was found that the colonies containing COL2A1 and COL14A1 had not grown and further investigation, through colony PCR, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing with the Beckman Coulter CEQ 8000, revealed that “COL4A1,” “COL5A2,” and “COL11A1” were not the sequences anticipated. As a result of these findings, positive hybridization signals to any of these positions on the array could not be considered to represent the collagen subtype of interest. Tissues were homogenized (4m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate) in a freezer mill, then total RNA was isolated using a standard method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Phenol:chloroform reagent (Sigma number P1944) was added to the samples, RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase using isopropyl alcohol, then the resultant pellet was washed twice with 707 ethanol. Glycogen (10 ॖg) was added prior to isopropyl alcohol precipitation to maximize RNA recovery. The resuspended pellet was protected with RNasin and treated with DNase I to remove potential genomic DNA contamination. The RNA was repurified as before. The RNA content of the resuspended pellet was quantified and checked for purity and condition by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. SMART cDNA synthesis was carried out using 1 ॖg of total RNA isolated from whole sclera. SMART technology produces cDNA libraries with common primer sites, thus allowing amplification of the library via PCR. The reaction was carried out using the reagents, and in accordance with the protocol, supplied with the kit. The cDNA library generated was then enriched through PCR with the Advantage 2 PCR system and the SMART primer. PCR products were monitored through agarose gel electrophoresis and 30 cycles of PCR was found to be optimal for the amplification of this library. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit, quantified, and stored for use as probe templates. Posterior scleral sample mRNA from myopic and normal animals was reverse transcribed using a standard technique. Amounts of 100–500 ng of total RNA were used depending on the amount recovered from each eye. Identical amounts of RNA were always reverse transcribed from scleral RNA samples of paired treated and control eyes. Standard reverse transcriptase reactions for paired samples were carried out from the same reagent master mix (containing Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, RNasin, and dNTPs) and at the same time. Radiolabeled probes were prepared from 100 ng of the PCR-enriched cDNA library using the Megaprime DNA labeling system, [α-32P]dCTPs, and the protocol supplied. The synthesized probes were purified by application to Micro Bio-spin P-30 columns, checked for activity by scintillation counting, and stored at −20 °C before use. Using a hybridization oven, macroarrays were prehybridized for 30 min at 45 °C in Rapid Hyb buffer, then the probes were denatured and added to the hybridization bottle at 68 °C. The hybridization was carried out for 24 h and was followed by one wash at room temperature (20 min), then two washes at 68 °C (15 min) in 2× SSC, 0.17 SDS. The array was visualized using a PhosphorImager. Gene array hybridizations were screened using an RT-PCR and sequencing protocol developed in this laboratory (38Gentle A. Anastasopoulos F. McBrien N.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (504–506, 508): 502Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were designed against areas of the coding regions of COL1A1,COL2A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, andCOL8A1 that were found to be well conserved across species. Each primer was also checked to ensure there was little or no cross-subtype specificity. These primers were then used to perform PCR reactions on scleral SMART cDNA and amplified fragments were purified and sequenced to confirm their identity. Scleral tissue samples were processed for gene expression analysis using real-time PCR. Data was collected from treated and control eyes of 8 myopic and 4 age-matched normal animals. Semiquantitative real-time PCR was carried in paired treated and control or right and left eyes for COL1A1,COL3A1, and COL5A1, and HPRT, a housekeeping gene whose expression was found not to be changed during the development of, or recovery from, myopia (39Gentle A. McBrien N.A. Cytokine. 2002; 18: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tree shrew sequence-specific primers were generated from the sequence information obtained in previous experiments. Final primer sequences and product sizes are given in Table I. The PCR assays were carried out in triplicate to improve the accuracy of estimates. Templates (2–4 ॖl) were mixed with primers (1 ॖm) and the FastStart DNA master mixture containing FastStart Taq polymerase, SYBR gre"

We employed the yeast two-hybrid system and used perlecan domain V as bait to screen a human keratinocyte cDNA library. Among the strongest interacting clones, we isolated a ∼1.6-kb cDNA insert that encoded extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), a secreted glycoprotein involved in bone formation and angiogenesis. The sequencing of the clone revealed the existence of a novel splice variant that we name ECM1c. The interaction was validated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, using both cell-free systems and mammalian cells, and the specific binding site within each molecule was identified employing various deletion mutants. The C terminus of ECM1 interacted specifically with the epidermal growth factor-like modules flanking the LG2 subdomain of perlecan domain V. Perlecan and ECM1 were also co-expressed by a variety of normal and transformed cells, and immunohistochemical studies showed a partial expression overlap, particularly around dermal blood vessels and adnexal epithelia. ECM1 has been shown to regulate endochondral bone formation, stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells, and induce angiogenesis. Similarly, perlecan plays an important role in chondrogenesis and skeletal development, as well as harboring pro- and anti-angiogenic activities. Thus, a physiological interaction could also occur in vivo during development and in pathological events, including tissue remodeling and tumor progression.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5771-5774PubMed Google Scholar). The effects exerted by perlecan are thought to be in part indirect, because of its ability to bind several molecules via the heparan sulfate chains (32Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

A similar distribution in a number of tissues and some aspects of the functionality are shared by extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), a secreted glycoprotein containing six cysteine doublets, with a CC-(X7–10)-C pattern (44Mathieu E.

This cysteine arrangement, which is also found in serum albumin and the sea urchin Endo16 protein (45Brown J.R. Fed. Proc. 1976; 35: 2141-2144PubMed Google Scholar, 46Godin R.E. Urry L.A. Ernst S.G.

Two splice variants have been described so far: ECM1a, encoded in humans by a 1.8-kb mRNA, and ECM1b, encoded by a 1.4-kb mRNA lacking exon 7 (48Smits P. Ni J. Feng P. Wauters J. Hul W.V. Boutaibi M.E. Ilon P.J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 1997; 45: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). ECM1a is expressed by the highly vascularized heart and placenta. It is also present in liver, ovary, kidney, lung, pancreas, testis, muscle, and colon, while ECM1b expression is confined to skin and tonsils (48Smits P. Ni J. Feng P. Wauters J. Hul W.V.

ECM1 has been shown to play an important role in endochondral bone formation by inhibiting alkaline phosphatase activity and bone mineralization (50Deckers M.M.L. Smits P. Karperien M. Ni J.

ECM1 can be detected in close association with the embryonic endothelial cells and has been shown to trigger the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro (51Han Z. Ni J. Smits P. Underhill C.B. Xie B. Chen Y. Liu N. Tylzanowski P. Parmelee D. Feng P. Ding I. Gao F. Gentz R. Huylebroeck D. Merregaert J. Zhang L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More recently, ECM1 has been associated to the lipoid proteinosis, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thickening of the skin, mucosae, and certain viscera (52Hamada T. McLean W.H.I. Ramsay M. Ashton G.H.S. Nanda A. Jenkins T. Edelstein I. South A.P. Bleck O. Wessagowit V. Mallipeddi R. Orchard G.E. Wan H. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J.C. Mellerio J.E. Whittock N.V. Munro C.S. van Steensel M.A.M. Steijlen P.M. Ni J. Zhang L. Hashimoto T. Eady R.A.J. McGrath J.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Loss of functionality of this ECM1, induced by point mutations, leads to thickening of the basement membrane at the dermal-epidermal junction, around blood vessels and adnexal epithelia. In this paper we discovered a specific binding of the perlecan C terminus to the corresponding C terminus of ECM1, we identified a novel splice variant (ECM1c), and demonstrated co-expression and partial co-distribution of these two molecules in both cells and tissues. We propose that perlecan/ECM1 interactions could be physiological and could potentially influence endochondral bone formation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. To lessen the number of false positives we employed the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which adopts three independent reporter genes for the selection, His,Ade, and α- or औ-galactosidase. A keratinocyte library (Clontech) constructed in the pACT2 vector was amplified and the plasmids were extracted employing the NucleoBond AX Giga plasmid purification kit (Clontech). Perlecan domain V was subcloned into the pGBKT7 vector from a previous construct available in our laboratory (42Mongiat M. Taylor K. Otto J. Aho S. Uitto J. Whitelock J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites and the construct was used as a bait to screen the keratinocyte library (complexity ∼0.5 × 106). The transfected yeast cells were plated onto quadruple minus plates lacking Trp and Leu to select for the presence of both plasmids, and His and Ade that are selective for the putative interactions. The yeast cell clones growing in selective medium were re-plated in quadruple minus plates containing X-α-gal. The plasmids from the blue colonies were extracted using the Yeast Plasmid Isolation Kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA) and employed to transfect DH5α cells. The pACT2 clones only would grow on ampicillin LB plates. The plasmids were extracted and the inserts were analyzed on agarose gels after restriction digestion with BglII. The inserts were identified by automatic sequencing as described before (43Mongiat M. Otto J. Oldershaw R. Ferrer F. Sato J.D. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10263-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For the α-galactosidase assays, 100-ॖl aliquots of a X-α-gal solution (20 mg/ml) in N,N-dimethylformamide were spread in 10-cm quadruple minus plates. The yeast clones transfected with putative interactive molecules would turn blue (the α-galactosidase is a secreted enzyme unlike the औ-galactosidase). For औ-galactosidase assays, the grown yeast colonies were transferred onto Whatman 3MM paper filters, soaked in Z buffer/X-gal solution (0.1m Na2HPO4, 45 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.37 औ-mercaptoethanol, and 3.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-औ-d-galactopyranoside), frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and incubated at 30 °C for ∼8 h to visualize the blue colonies. To verify that the ECM1c variant was actually being expressed, RNA from HT1080 and A431 cancer cell lines was extracted employing the TRI-Reagent (Sigma). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase for 10 min at 37 °C and reverse transcribed using the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random primers. The following oligonucleotides were used in the RT-PCR: forward 5′-CTCTGAGGGAGGCTTCACG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGGATCCATAGTTGGGGTAAGGAGCC-3′. For the nested PCR the reverse oligonucleotide 5′-ATCTCCTCCTGATATGGAAGAGGT-3′ specific for the splice variant was used. The PCR products were then analyzed on agarose gels. Real time PCR was performed on the RNA samples as well. Ten serial 1:1 dilutions of the extracted RNAs were carried out and the samples were reverse transcribed as before. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: forward 5′-ACCAAAGAGTTCTCACCAAGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GCAGTCATGTTGTGGATCAGC-3′, common to all three variants, and forward 5′-GCACCCCAATGAACAGAAGGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGCATGGAATGGATGATTATC-3′, specific of the ECM1c variant. औ-Actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as a control. The experiments were performed using the QuantiTectTM SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and the PCR was performed using an ABI PRISMTM 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA). The real time PCRs were run in 27 agarose gels to confirm the specificity of the fluorescent detection system. The relative amounts of ECM1c were identified using the comparative method (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence bulletin 2) employing the formula 2 − ΔΔCT, where the ΔCTwas determined by subtracting the average औ-actin CT (threshold cycle) value from the average ECM1c CT value. The ΔΔCT value was finally calculated by subtracting the ΔCT calibration value (ΔCT of all the ECM1 splice variants). A validation experiment was performed prior to the calculations and the absolute value of the slope of the log input amounts of RNA usedversus ΔCT values was found to be <0.1. For the comparative expression of ECM1 and perlecan in different cell lines the following oligonucleotides were used: forward 5′-GGATACCCTTGACAAATACTGTG-3′ and reverse 5′-ATTCTTCCTTGGGCTCAGA-3′, forward 5′-GCGGGTGAATGGTGGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGGAAGGCGAGGAAGC-3′, respectively. RNA was extracted from the different cell lines and reverse transcribed as described previously. The amplified products were separated onto 17 agarose gels. Seven deletions of perlecan domain V were cloned into the pGBKT7 vector. For deletions Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3, the following forward primer was used: 5′-GGAATTCGAGATCAAGATCACCTTC-3′. The reverse oligonucleotides for these deletions were: Δ1 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCCAGAGCCTTGTTG-3′, Δ2 5′-CGGGATCCTGTCACACCTTCCTCACA-3′, and Δ3 5′-CGGGATCCGGTGGGGCAGTGGGAGAT-3′. The forward oligonucleotide for deletion Δ4 was 5′-GGAATTCTGTCGGGACCGGCCCTGC-3′ and the reverse primer corresponded to the one used for deletion Δ2. For deletion Δ5 the forward oligonucleotide was 5′-GGAATTCGTGACCACCCCCTCGCTG-3′ and the reverse primer corresponded to the one used for deletion Δ1. The reverse primer for deletions Δ6 and Δ7 was 5′-CGGGATCCCGAGGGGCAGGGGCGTGT-3′, and the normal nucleotides were 5′-GGAATTCTGTGAGCGCCAGCCTTGC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCGGCATAGCAGAGTCCGAC-3′, respectively. In all the forward nucleotides an EcoRI site was introduced and aBamHI site introduced in the reverse primers. The ECM1 construct was subcloned into the pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors by PCR using the pACT2 construct as a template. The forward primer was 5′-GGAATTCCCCGAAGCCTCCCCATGGAT-3′, which introduced anEcoRI site, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGGATCCCCAAATCCAAGAGGTGTTTAGG-3′, which introduced aBamHI site. The forward primers used to amplify the deletion fragments of ECM1 were 5′-GGAATTCGGAACGCCAGCTCCATTT-3′, 5′-GGAATTCTGGGAGGAAGCAATGAGC-3′, 5′-GGAATTCTGGGAGGATACCCTTGACAAA-3′, 5′-GGAATTCGACCGGGACATCTTGACCAT-3′ for deletions ΔE1, ΔE2, ΔE3, ΔE4, respectively. For deletion ΔE5 the same oligonucleotide used to amplify the entire ECM1 fragment was employed and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGGATCCATAGTTGGGGTAAGGAGCC-3′. For all the PCR amplifications the GC-Rich Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Diagnostics GmbH) was used. To corroborate the interaction between ECM1 and perlecan domain V we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies. The two proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) employing the TnTTM reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). One ॖg of the pGBKT7 or pGADT7 constructs was employed and the reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions in a total volume of 50 ॖl. An amount of 15 ॖl of each translated protein was employed for the co-immunoprecipitation, the proteins were co-incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer was added (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfoniyl fluoride, and 0.17 Tween 20 (v/v)). About 2 ॖg of the anti-hemagglutinin antibody (the pGADT7 vector carries the hemagglutinin tag sequence) or the anti-c-Myc antibody (the pGBKT7 vector carries the c-Myc tag sequence) were added and the samples were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. The immune complexes were captured with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). The beads were washed three times with HNTG buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 Triton X-100, 107 glycerol, 200 ॖm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF), and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Diagnostics GmbH). The bands were separated in polyacrylamide gels and, after fixation, enhanced with AMPLIFYTM (Amersham Biosciences AB). The gels were then exposed to Eastman Kodak films. To investigate the interaction between ECM1 and perlecan in mammalian cells we stably transfected 293 EBNA cells (human embryonic kidney cells expressing the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen) with 4 ॖg of pCEP-Pu vector harboring the full-length domain V as described before (53Mongiat M. Sweeney S.M. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The EBNA cells allow high episomal replication of the transfected pCEP-Pu vector. Stable clones were obtained by culturing cells in puromycin (1 ॖg/ml) for at least 4 weeks. Following verification of domain V expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microsequencing (53Mongiat M. Sweeney S.M. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

As a further control, we transfected wild type 293-EBNA cells with the ECM1 construct as above. After 48 h of incubation, the serum-free conditioned medium was collected and filtered, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ECM1 antiserum (51Han Z. Ni J. Smits P. Underhill C.B. Xie B. Chen Y. Liu N. Tylzanowski P. Parmelee D. Feng P. Ding I. Gao F. Gentz R. Huylebroeck D. Merregaert J. Zhang L.

Sepharose G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for another 4 h with rocking, and subsequently washed four times with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 Triton X-100, 107 glycerol, 200 ॖmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF. The final pellet was boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblotting was performed using anti-His monoclonal antibodies (Qiagen), followed by horseradish-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection as described before (53Mongiat M.

Incubations were for either 1 or 18 h and dilutions, all in the presence of 57 goat serum, ranged between 1:200 and 1:500 for each antibody. The sections were washed again, incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Envision, DAKO), and finally developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Paraffin sections of skin were also tested after various antigen retrieval including pretreatment with 17 protease type XXIV, citrate antigen retrieval (S30), 0.17 Pronase (Calbiochem) for 20 min each, or without any pretreatments. Peroxidase blocking, serum blocking, and antibody incubations were the same as described above for the frozen sections.

To identify new partners for the perlecan protein core, we employed perlecan domain V as a bait (Fig.1A) and screened a human keratinocyte cDNA library. This domain is located at the C-terminal end of the protein core and harbors a tandem array of three laminin-G type (LG1–LG3) modules separated by four EGF-like (EG1–EG4) modules, in an arrangement highly conserved across species (1Dunlevy J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2066827957,"Cadherins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. A number of changes occur during cadherin-mediated junction formation, one of which is a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in cells are the Rho family of GTPases. We have demonstrated in previous studies that cadherin signaling suppresses RhoA activity and activates Rac1. The signaling events downstream of cadherins that modulate the activity of Rho family proteins remain unknown. Here we have identified a pathway by which RhoA becomes inactivated by cadherins. To determine whether cadherins regulate RhoA through activation of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RhoA, we used constitutively active RhoA to isolate activated GAPs. Using this assay, we have identified the RhoA-specific GAP, p190RhoGAP, downstream from engaged cadherins. We found that cadherin engagement induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and increased its binding to p120RasGAP. The increased precipitation of p190RhoGAP with 63LRhoA was blocked by addition of PP2 suggesting that Src family kinases are required downstream from cadherin signaling. The inhibition of RhoA activity by cadherins was antagonized by expression of a dominant negative p190RhoGAP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that p190RhoGAP activity is critical for RhoA inactivation by cadherins.

Rho family members are also negatively regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which remove Rho proteins from the plasma membrane (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Rac1 and Cdc42 activation result in lamellipodial and filopodial extension, respectively, and RhoA regulates stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (3Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 87-92Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, Rac1 and Cdc42 activity are required for cadherin-mediated adhesion (4Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Micheilis F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Here we have explored the mechanism by which RhoA becomes inactivated by cadherins. Since Rho proteins are negatively regulated by GAPs, we examined whether cadherins regulate RhoA via activation of a GAP. To identify activated GAPs, we developed an assay that exploits the interaction of GAPs with the GTP-bound form of RhoA. This analysis identified p190RhoGAP downstream of cadherin engagement. We show that p190RhoGAP is necessary and sufficient for inactivating RhoA in response to cadherin engagement. To generate pEGFP-p190RhoGAPR1283A the p190RhoGAP mutant was excised from pKH3-p190RhoGAP-R1283A (17Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) that had been digested withBglII and EcoRI. The bacterial expression vectors for GST-tagged nucleotide-free RhoA (17ARhoA), wild type RhoA (WTRhoA), and constitutively active RhoA (63LRhoA) have been described previously (18Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J. Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing C-cadherin (C-Cad) or C-cadherin with a cytoplasmic truncation (C-CT) were generated and cultured as described previously (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-p190RhoGAPR1283A using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RhoA activity assays were performed and quantified as described previously (19Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 20Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). For GST precipitations, C-Cad or C-CT cells were starved overnight in 0.5% fetal bovine calf serum. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended with 0.2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and suspended for 1.0 h prior to plating in 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For PP2 experiments, suspended cells were treated for 30 min with Me2SO or PP2 (0.5 μm, Calbiochem) and plated in the presence of the inhibitor. Cells were plated on fibronectin (25 μg/ml), polylysine (10 μg/ml), or C-cadherin extracellular domain 1–5 (20 μg/ml; CEC) for the indicated times. The CEC was purified as described previously (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After plating for the indicated times, cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in 50 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads equilibrated with the above lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. Beads were pelleted, and the supernatants were incubated with 10–30 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein. The samples were washed at least three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antibodies against p120RasGAP, p190RhoGAP, phosphotyrosine (PY20), ROCKα and -β (all from BD Biosciences), Lsc, RhoGDI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PSGAP (Dr. Wen-Cheng Xiong, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (20Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and probed with monoclonal antibodies against p190RhoGAP or phosphotyrosine (PY20). Densitometric analysis of films was performed as described previously (20Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The relative amount of phosphorylated p190RhoGAP was determined by measuring the amount of phosphorylated p190RhoGAP immunoprecipitated relative to the total amount of p190RhoGAP. In previous work, we demonstrated that direct cadherin engagement suppresses RhoA activity (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Since Rho family proteins are negatively regulated by GAPs, we wished to examine whether cadherin engagement regulates RhoA through activation of a RhoA-specific GAP. We developed an assay to detect activated GAPs in cell lysates. Because GAPs bind with a high affinity to activated Rho proteins, we assessed whether a GST fusion with the constitutively active 63LRhoA is able to bind to GAPs. WTRhoA, nucleotide-free RhoA (17ARhoA), and 63LRhoA were expressed as GST fusion proteins, and affinity precipitations were performed on lysates of CHO cells. The 17ARhoA mutant was generated based on the analogous G15A mutation in Ras and has previously been shown to bind with high affinity to GEFs (18Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J. Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Chen S.Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar). Pull-downs were immunoblotted with antibodies against the GAP p190RhoGAP, the effector ROCK (ROK or Rho kinase), a GEF Lsc, and RhoGDI to assess the ability of these GST fusion proteins and GST to bind to known regulators of Rho proteins. This analysis revealed that constitutively active RhoA selectively bound the RhoA-specific GAP p190RhoGAP, whereas it could not be detected in control precipitations (Fig.1A). Additionally the effector ROCK was detected in 63LRhoA precipitations. Although WTRhoA and 17ARhoA did not bind to p190RhoGAP, these fusion proteins bound to RhoGDI and GEFs, respectively, and as expected (Fig. 1A) (18Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J. Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The finding that 63LRhoA is able to bind GAPs led us to investigate whether we could use 63LRhoA to identify activated GAPs. To test this approach, we examined a pathway in which a GAP is known to be activated. Previous studies demonstrated that adhesion to fibronectin and integrin engagement inhibit RhoA by activating p190RhoGAP (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To establish whether increased quantities of GAPs are precipitated by 63LRhoA upon GAP activation, we investigated the binding of p190RhoGAP to 63LRhoA in response to adhesion to fibronectin. We performed these experiments in C-Cad cells because these cells were to be used in experiments examining cadherin signaling (see Fig.2) (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Additionally these cells exhibit a transient inhibition of RhoA by integrin engagement (data not shown), similar to that previously described for other cell lines (16Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Burridge K. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Ren X. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In suspension, trace levels of p190RhoGAP were co-sedimented with 63LRhoA, whereas adhesion to fibronectin greatly increased the amount of p190RhoGAP recovered (Fig. 1B). As a control, 63LRhoA precipitations were probed with antibodies against PSGAP, another GAP for RhoA present in these cells (24Ren X.R. Du Q.S. Huang Y.Z. Ao S.Z. Mei L. Xiong W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PSGAP, however, was not detected in 63LRhoA precipitations in response to fibronectin adhesion (Fig.1B). Recent evidence suggests that p190RhoGAP activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In response to both epidermal growth factor stimulation and integrin engagement increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP correlates with its activation (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 25Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,26Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To examine whether the p190RhoGAP sedimented with 63LRhoA is tyrosine phosphorylated, we immunoblotted precipitations with antibodies against phosphotyrosine. This analysis revealed that the p190RhoGAP precipitated with 63LRhoA is tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig.1C). Active, tyrosine phosphorylated p190RhoGAP has been shown to bind to p120RasGAP (27Hu K.Q. Settleman J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Roof R.W. Haskell M.D. Dukes B.D. Sherman N. Kinter M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7052-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and this binding is thought to be important in regulating cell adhesion and migration (29Kulkarni S.V. Gish G. van der Geer P. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consequently we analyzed whether p120RasGAP could be detected together with p190RhoGAP in 63LRhoA precipitations. Increased amounts of p120RasGAP were detected in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 1C). Additionally the p120RasGAP precipitated was tyrosine phosphorylated (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the p190RhoGAP sedimented with 63LRhoA is active. The above results validate the use of 63LRhoA to bind active RhoA GAPs. We wanted to apply this technique to sediment RhoA GAPs activated by cadherin engagement. Src family kinases localize to and regulate AJs (30Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and Src activates p190RhoGAP (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 28Roof R.W. Haskell M.D. Dukes B.D. Sherman N. Kinter M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell.

These findings led us to examine whether p190RhoGAP is downstream from cadherin engagement. Previously we used a model system for studying direct cadherin engagement in the absence of cell-cell contact (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cadherin engagement was stimulated by plating C-Cad cells on the CEC immobilized on tissue culture plates. Using this system, we determined that cadherin signaling inhibits RhoA (12Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Here we have exploited the same system to address whether cadherin engagement regulates p190RhoGAP. We found that direct cadherin engagement increased the amount of p190RhoGAP precipitated by 63LRhoA (Fig. 2). Moreover, the p190RhoGAP precipitated by 63LRhoA is tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig.2A). Increased levels of p120RasGAP were also sedimented by 63LRhoA in response to cadherin engagement (Fig. 2A), and the p120RasGAP precipitated was tyrosine phosphorylated (data not shown). PSGAP could not be detected in 63LRhoA precipitations after cadherin engagement suggesting that this GAP is not regulated by cadherin engagement (data not shown). To determine whether increased p190RhoGAP binding to 63LRhoA is specific to cadherin-mediated adhesion and not a general adhesion effect, we plated C-Cad cells on either polylysine or the CEC and analyzed the levels of p190RhoGAP that were pulled down by 63LRhoA. The engagement of cadherins stimulated the association of p190RhoGAP with 63LRhoA, whereas p190RhoGAP was not detected in precipitates from cells adhered to polylysine or in precipitates obtained with GST alone (Fig.2B). To determine whether cadherin engagement activates p190RhoGAP, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation levels of immunoprecipitated p190RhoGAP from C-Cad cells in response to cadherin engagement. Cadherin signaling induced a 2-fold increase in p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation relative to suspended cells (Fig. 2C). We observed no increase in p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation when cells expressing a cytoplasmic deleted C-cadherin were plated on the CEC suggesting that an intact cytoplasmic domain is required for p190RhoGAP phosphorylation and activation by cadherin engagement (data not shown). Since p190RhoGAP is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by Src (35Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 37Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we examined whether Src family kinase activity is required for the increased precipitation of p190RhoGAP with 63LRhoA in response to cadherin engagement. C-Cad cells were treated with vehicle alone (Me2SO) or the Src inhibitor PP2 (0.5 μm). Cadherin engagement increased precipitation of p190RhoGAP with 63LRhoA, while PP2 treatment abolished this association (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that Src family kinases are required for activation of p190RhoGAP by cadherin engagement. To establish whether p190RhoGAP mediates the depression of RhoA activity induced by cadherin engagement, we transiently expressed a GAP-deficient, GFP-tagged mutant of p190RhoGAP (p190RhoGAPR1283A), or GFP alone in C-Cad cells (17Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar,23Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This p190RhoGAP mutant lacks the arginine that is essential for its GAP activity (17Tatsis N. Lannigan D.A. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and expression of this mutant acts as a dominant negative toward endogenous p190RhoGAP and blocks inhibition of RhoA by integrin signaling (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Blotting cell lysates with antibodies against p190RhoGAP revealed that the expression level of p190RA is typically 2–3-fold higher than that of endogenous p190RhoGAP (Fig.3). Transient expression of this mutant antagonized RhoA inactivation in response to cadherin engagement (Fig.3), consistent with p190RhoGAP mediating RhoA inhibition in response to cadherin engagement. In this study we found that cadherins signal to RhoA through the GAP p190RhoGAP. Our previous work indicated that direct cadherin engagement was sufficient to inactivate RhoA and stimulate Rac1. At that time it was unclear how cadherins signal to Rho proteins. Our current results provide insight into the signaling downstream from cadherins. Additionally we describe here an assay to sediment active GAPs using constitutively active RhoA. We tested this assay on the pathway in which adhesion to fibronectin activates p190RhoGAP. At time points where p190RhoGAP is activated by integrins, more p190RhoGAP was precipitated with 63LRhoA. Using this assay to identify GAPs activated by cadherins, we found that cadherin engagement also increased the precipitation of p190RhoGAP with 63LRhoA. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of p190RhoGAP that inhibits endogenous p190RhoGAP activity blocks cadherin-mediated depression of RhoA activity. Together these results suggest that p190RhoGAP is downstream from cadherin engagement. Several lines of evidence raised the possibility that p190RhoGAP might be responsible for depressing RhoA activity downstream from cadherins. Thus, p190RhoGAP is a substrate for and activated by Src family kinases (35Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 36Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and these kinases localize to and regulate AJs (30Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Van Roy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Moreover the depression of RhoA activity in response to integrin engagement has been shown to be due to Src-induced activation of p190RhoGAP (22Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Additionally p120RasGAP was shown to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to AJ formation (38Kinch M.S. Petch L. Zhong C. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and p120RasGAP is a binding partner of activated p190RhoGAP. We have found that p190RhoGAP becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cadherin engagement and that this is blocked by treatment of cells with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (data not shown). This treatment also diminishes the binding of p190RhoGAP to 63LRhoA, consistent with its activity being regulated by cadherin-mediated Src family phosphorylation. We have also found that p120RasGAP binding to p190RhoGAP is induced by cadherin engagement, further supporting a role for p190RhoGAP activation downstream from cadherins. Together these results suggest a pathway by which cadherin engagement stimulates activation of Src family kinases, which, in turn, phosphorylate and activate p190RhoGAP. The active p190RhoGAP, targeted in some manner to the AJs, promotes GTP hydrolysis by RhoA in this region. In future work, it will be interesting to explore how Src family kinases become activated downstream from cadherin engagement. However, our preliminary data indicate that the cadherin cytoplasmic domain is critical for this to occur. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, specific localization of p190RhoGAP is thought to be important for its regulation. p190RhoGAP localizes to protrusive structures, such as the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts and to growth cones in neurons (26Nakahara H. Mueller S.C. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Hu K.Q. Delalle I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both of these regions are highly dynamic and protrusive. It has been proposed that Rho inhibition by p190RhoGAP is critical in the leading edge of fibroblasts to promote protrusion and thus cell migration (23Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The formation of cell-cell AJs is also a dynamic process where the cells extend many protrusive structures to initiate cell-cell contact. We propose that p190RhoGAP inactivation of RhoA is needed to reduce tension and contractility, thereby promoting the formation of cell-cell AJs (16Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Burridge K. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally Rac1 localizes to both the leading edge of fibroblasts and to initiating sites of cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells. Since Rac1 is important for E-cadherin localization and actin polymerization at cell-cell junctions, we can envision that local Rac1 activation is also critical for the formation of AJs. Interestingly we and others have found that cadherin engagement is sufficient to activate Rac1 (11Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Recently, we observed that mice deficient in mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels, the outer component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, have impairments in learning and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, suggesting that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. In this study, we examined the effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity of blocking the permeability transition pore with low doses of cyclosporin A and found a deficit in synaptic plasticity and an increase in base-line synaptic transmission. Calcium imaging of presynaptic terminals revealed a transient increase in the resting calcium concentration immediately upon incubation with cyclosporin A that correlated with the changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The effect of cyclosporin A on presynaptic calcium was abolished when mitochondria were depolarized prior to cyclosporin A exposure, and the effects of cyclosporin A and mitochondrial depolarization on presynaptic resting calcium were similar, suggesting a mitochondrial locus of action of cyclosporin A. To further characterize the calcium dynamics of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, we used anin vitro assay of calcium handling by isolated brain mitochondria. Cyclosporin A-exposed mitochondria buffered calcium more rapidly and subsequently triggered a more rapid mitochondrial depolarization.

Although the majority of research on the function of the MPT and its components has focused on apoptosis (1Kroemer G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 2Shimizu S. Matsuoka Y. Shinohara Y. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the MPT has recently been shown to play a role in learning and synaptic plasticity in mice (4Weeber E.J. Levy M. Sampson M.J. Anflous K. Armstrong D.L. Brown S.E. Paylor R.E. Sweatt J.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol.

Broekemeier K.M. Gunter K.K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In both pathological and physiological functions, the induction of the MPT is mediated by mitochondrial calcium influx above a certain threshold, and once opened, the MPT conducts small substrates and ions out of the mitochondrial matrix (6Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that following physiologic calcium influx into the mitochondrial matrix, formation of the MPT might be a physiological mechanism of mitochondrial calcium release (5Pfeiffer D.R. Gunter T.E. Eliseev R. Broekemeier K.M. Gunter K.K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We are interested in determining the role of mitochondrial calcium regulation in synaptic function. The most extensively characterized synapses in the mammalian central nervous system are the Schaffer collateral synapses between CA3 pyramidal axons and their postsynaptic targets on the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. As mitochondria are typically found in CA3 presynaptic terminals as well as CA1 dendrites, we hypothesized that CA3-CA1 hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and paired pulse facilitation (PPF) would be sensitive to alterations in mitochondrial calcium regulation by the MPT because both depend on calcium-dependent processes within synaptic terminals. In this study, we examined the effect of blocking the MPT on LTP and PPF using low doses of cyclosporin A (CsA). In addition, we monitored the changes in calcium dynamics caused by CsA by imaging presynaptic terminals loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-2. We found that blocking the MPT caused a transient increase in the resting calcium in presynaptic terminals, correlating with changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The increase caused by CsA was abolished by depolarizing mitochondria with tetraphenylphosphate (TPP+) prior to CsA exposure indicating a common target,i.e. mitochondria. In addition, the characteristics of the effects of TPP+ and CsA on resting calcium were similar, suggesting the possibility of a common mechanism of action. To more precisely determine the effect of blocking the MPT on mitochondrial calcium handling, we employed an in vitroassay to study calcium handling in isolated brain mitochondria and found that CsA induces earlier and more rapid mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release, which may explain the transient increase of calcium in presynaptic terminals. Similarly, VDAC1-deficient mitochondria depolarized and subsequently released their mitochondrial calcium stores more readily than wild-type littermate controls, which may explain their similar electrophysiological deficits (4Weeber E.J. Levy M. Sampson M.J. Anflous K. Armstrong D.L. Brown S.E. Paylor R.E. Sweatt J.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on these results we propose a model to explain how the MPT serves to help prevent mitochondrial calcium overload and subsequent depolarization. Overall, our studies are consistent with an important role for synaptic mitochondria in calcium regulation and specifically suggest a role for the MPT in neuronal calcium regulation. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared as previously described (7Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices were bathed (1 ml/min) with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.24 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mmd-glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm cyclosporin A as indicated) in an interface chamber maintained at 30 °C bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The Schaffer collateral axons were stimulated with a bipolar electrode, and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was recorded in the stratum radiatum of area CA1. Responses were monitored every 20–30 s for 20 min to ensure a stable base line. Measurements are shown as the average slopes of the fEPSP from four to six individual traces and are normalized to 10 min of base-line recordings. Base-line stimulus intensities were adjusted to produce an fEPSP at 50% of the maximal response. 100 Hz LTP was induced by stimulating twice at high frequency (100 Hz) at base-line intensity for 1 s each, 20 s apart. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) consisted of three trains of stimuli delivered at 20-s intervals, each train composed of 10 stimulus bursts delivered at 5 Hz, with each burst consisting of four pulses at 100 Hz. PPF was induced by two single stimuli at base-line intensity, 30 milliseconds apart. CsA (Alexis Pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in 99% ethanol (final ethanol concentration, 0.1%) and added to artificial cerebrospinal fluid while stirring for 10 min to increase solubilization. Thorough rinsing of all plastic tubes and parts exposed to CsA with ethanol and water prevented contamination of control slices. The hippocampal slices were prepared as described above, submersed in artificial cerebral spinal fluid, and maintained with 95% O2, 5% CO2bubbling at 30 °C. As described in detail in Wu and Saggau (8Wu L.G. Saggau P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 645-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) dissolved in 80:20 Me2SO:pluronic acid was pressure-injected in the stratum radiatum of area CA1 where the AM-ester dye is taken up by CA3 axons, the AM-ester was cleaved, and the cell-impermeable Fura-2 was transported to the presynaptic terminals. An area in stratum radiatum of CA1 about 1 mm away from the injection site was illuminated at a single excitation wavelength, 340 or 380 nm as indicated. Fluorescence was collected with a 50× objective, filtered by a long pass filter (490 nm), and converted into an electrical signal by a single photodiode. The resting presynaptic calcium was determined by ratiometric measurements of fluorescence excited at both 340 and 380 nm in the absence of CA3 stimulation. For PPF measurements, two traces recorded 1 min apart were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Hippocampal slices were prepared and incubated in an interface chamber as described above. High doses of CsA (250 μm), low doses of CsA (10 μm), or no CsA in 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% ethanol was added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 30 min. The slices were removed from the interface chamber and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na4P2O7, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.25 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. The homogenates were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane (Millipore), and probed with phosphospecific antibodies to phosphorylated synapsin I (αSer603 and αSer62/67 phosphospecific antibodies were generous gifts from the lab of Paul Greengard; αSer553 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and total synapsin (α-synapsin was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology). The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Mouse hippocampal slices were prepared and maintained as previously described for electrophysiological experiments. The slices were exposed to 50 mm KCl for 10, 2, or 0 min before perchlorate extraction. A luciferase-based assay from Molecular Probes was used to quantify the ATP concentration and normalized to protein concentration, as determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Mouse brain mitochondria were isolated by Percoll centrifugation as outlined in Ref. 9Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar. One mouse forebrain was minced on ice and homogenized in a small glass homogenizer with 3 ml of a 12% Percoll solution in isolation buffer composed of 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm K-EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.1. The Percoll homogenate was carefully added on top of 3.5 ml of 26% Percoll, which was layered over 3.5 ml of 40% Percoll in a tube and centrifuged at 30,700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cloudy layer at the interface of the lower two Percoll solutions was aspirated, washed 1:4 (v/v) with isolation buffer, and centrifuged at 16,700 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1% bovine serum albumin (in isolation buffer) and spun at 8,000 ×g for 12 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then washed in 900 μl of bovine serum albumin-free isolation buffer, centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C and finally resuspended in 750 μl of bovine serum albumin-free isolation buffer. Isolated mitochondria were tested for respiration using an oxygraph (biological oxygen monitor, YSI model 5300) and a Clark-type electrode (oxygen probe, YSI model 5331) as described in Ref. 10Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Only mitochondria with a respiratory ratio of >2 on succinate were used for the in vitro assays. In addition, only mitochondria that possessed an intact outer membrane, as tested indirectly by the cytochrome c assay (11Miro O. Casademont J. Grau J.M. Jarreta D. Urbano-Marquez A. Cardellach F. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 37: 1047-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used. Isolated mitochondria stored on ice can be reliably used for experiments for up to 3 h. 300 μl of buffer (125 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm glutamic acid, 5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mm succinic acid, 5 mm malic acid; pH adjusted with KOH to 7.3; osmolarity = 300 mosmol) was prewarmed in a stirring measurement chamber for 1 min at 32 °C. To the warming buffer, ADP was added to a final concentration of 100 μm and CsA (dissolved in 99% EtOH), or an equivalent volume of EtOH for control was added to a final concentration of 1 μm as indicated. Mitochondria were added to a final protein concentration of 60–70 μg/ml (∼50 μl of mitochondrial preparation) and incubated for 2 min to warm up to 32 °C. Extramitochondrial calcium was monitored using a calcium-selective electrode (World Precision Instruments) and recorded every 20 s. A CaCl2 bolus was added to reach the desired calcium concentration as indicated. CsA and other drugs were added either 2 min before the calcium bolus or after calcium was maximally buffered, defined as 40 s of zero net flux. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial proton uncoupler, and TPP+ were purchased from Sigma. In these experiments, we observed that there is a range of calcium release rates that varies between mitochondrial preparations and depends partly on the initial calcium bolus, the mitochondrial concentration, the background strain of mouse, and the degree of mitochondrial depolarization. The traces we show represent the average release rates for one set of experiments, where each set was run at least three times with different mitochondrial preparations. Approximately half of all CA3 presynaptic terminals contain at least one mitochondrion (26Ventura R. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6897-6906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mitochondria are also typically found in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig.1). We investigated the role of these mitochondria in synaptic transmission and plasticity. As previously reported in Weeber et al.(4Weeber E.J. Levy M. Sampson M.J. Anflous K. Armstrong D.L. Brown S.E. Paylor R.E. Sweatt J.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we found that 10 μm CsA significantly attenuates hippocampal 100 Hz LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus (Fig.2A). We sought to investigate the basis of this effect by assessing acute changes caused by CsA. Immediately upon the addition of CsA, synaptic transmission began to increase and reach a plateau at ∼25% above base line (Fig.2B, also evident in the base lines of panels Aand C). Interestingly, although CsA attenuated LTP induced by a 100 Hz stimulating protocol (Fig. 2A), it did not appear to attenuate LTP induced by TBS (Fig. 2C), even when the increase in base-line synaptic transmission is subtracted from the theta burst-induced potentiation (139% potentiation in controlsversus 128% in CsA-exposed slices, p = 0.11). 100 Hz stimulation (Fig. 2A) and TBS (Fig.2C) are believed to differ in their mechanism of LTP induction because of differences in the characteristics of calcium influx into synaptic terminals (12Cavus I. Teyler T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3038-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which may affect different biochemical pathways. For example, theta burst LTP involves the MAPK pathway in the mouse hippocampus, whereas 100 Hz LTP does not (27Selcher J.C. Weeber E.J. Christian J. Nekrasova T. Landreth G.E. Sweatt J.D. Learn Mem. 2003; 10: 26-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus our studies suggest that the effect of CsA on synaptic plasticity affects biochemical pathways that are important for 100 Hz LTP but not theta burst LTP; however, it is important to note that the CsA-elicited increase in base-line synaptic transmission complicates interpretation of our TBS-induced LTP result. One question that arises from our CsA experiments is whether the locus of action is mitochondrial as opposed to other potential sites of action. TPP+ has been shown to attenuate post-tetanic potentiation at the crayfish neuromuscular junction by causing presynaptic mitochondrial depolarization (22Tang Y. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In the mouse hippocampal area CA1, exposure to TPP+ 20 min prior to a 100 Hz LTP simulation paradigm caused a marked reduction in LTP induction, not unlike CsA exposure (Fig. 2D). Although the mechanisms of action of TPP+ and CsA are different, the similarity of the effect of TPP+ and CsA on early LTP insinuates a common final effect on mitochondrial calcium handling. Unlike CsA, however, sustained mitochondrial depolarization by TPP+ eventually causes swelling and alterations in metabolic activity (see Fig. 5), resulting in a loss of synaptic activity (Fig. 2D). Overall, however, our data indicating that TPP+ application blocks LTP induction in a fashion reminiscent of CsA is consistent with our interpretation that CsA acts at a mitochondrial locus. We also assessed the effects of MPT inhibition on shorter term forms of synaptic plasticity, in particular PPF. We particularly followed PPF because it is generally held to involve presynaptic calcium handling. The effect of CsA exposure on PPF, becoming evident ∼20 min after the addition of CsA, was a reduction in the second fEPSP compared with the first fEPSP such that PPF was attenuated (Fig.3). These findings are consistent with our previous observations of the effect of CsA on hippocampal synaptic plasticity (4Weeber E.J. Levy M. Sampson M.J. Anflous K. Armstrong D.L. Brown S.E. Paylor R.E. Sweatt J.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In summary, our electrophysiologic studies indicate that CsA has both an immediate effect to increase synaptic transmission, followed by a delayed attenuation of two forms of synaptic plasticity, PPF, and 100 Hz LTP. We hypothesized that the effect of CsA in synaptic terminals is in part caused by inhibition of the MPT and subsequent alterations in mitochondrial calcium handling. One specific concern with the use of CsA to block the MPT is the possibility of inhibition of the protein phosphatase, calcineurin. Typically, the concentrations of CsA used to block calcineurin are at least 10–25-fold greater than used in this study (13Lu Y.F. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki A. Hayashi Y. Tokuda M. Itano T. Hatase O. Matsui H. Brain Res. 1996; 729: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In addition, several considerations suggest that calcineurin is not inhibited in our studies. Hippocampal slices from mice lacking calcineurin exhibit enhanced PPF (15Malleret G. Haditsch U. Genoux D. Jones M.W. Bliss T.V. Vanhoose A.M. Weitlauf C. Kandel E.R. Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M. Cell. 2001; 104: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and FK506, another calcineurin inhibitor, does not affect PPF (16Lu Y.F. Hayashi Y. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 205: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FK506 also reduces base-line synaptic transmission (16Lu Y.F. Hayashi Y. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 205: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). None of these effects of calcineurin inhibition are observable in our experiments with low doses of CsA. Nevertheless, to confirm that low doses (10 μm) of CsA do not inhibit calcineurin in the hippocampal slice to the same extent as high doses (250 μm) of CsA do, we used phosphospecific antibodies to detect the phosphorylation state of a calcineurin substrate, synapsin I. Hippocampal slices incubated under the same conditions as for electrophysiology, in the presence or absence of high or low doses of CsA, were harvested for Western blotting with phosphospecific antibodies to synapsin I phosphorylated at Ser603, Ser553, and Ser62/67, all of which have been shown to be sensitive to calcineurin (17Jovanovic J.N. Sihra T.S. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7944-7953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation in 250 μm CsA resulted in dramatically enhanced phosphorylation of all three synapsin I phosphorylation sites, which is likely due to inhibition of dephosphorylation by calcineurin (Fig. 4). Equally dramatic is the lack of phosphorylation in slices exposed to 10 μm or no CsA (Fig. 4). Taken together with our electrophysiological observations, these findings indicate that the low doses of CsA used in this study do not cause calcineurin inhibition and suggest that low doses of CsA are acting via a different mechanism. Among the known targets of CsA, mitochondrial cyclophilin-D has one of the lowest Kivalues in vitro (18Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and has been shown to mediate the functional inhibition of the MPT by CsA in isolated mitochondria (19Crompton M. Virji S. Doyle V. Johnson N. Ward J.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 66: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, our prior studies of hippocampal slices from VDAC-deficient mice showed a similar electrophysiological phenotype to CsA-exposed wild-type slices. Thus, it is likely that the effect of CsA on hippocampal electrophysiology results from inhibition of the MPT. Inhibition of the MPT by CsA may perturb the mitochondrial proton gradient important in ATP production (20Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the possibility that CsA may alter hippocampal ATP concentrations, we measured total ATP concentration in hippocampal slices in the presence and absence of 10 μm CsA and found no significant change in ATP concentration caused by 10 μm CsA (Fig.5). To induce synaptic calcium influx as might occur during synaptic activity, hippocampal slices were exposed to 50 mm KCl for 2–10 min and then harvested for ATP quantification. Interestingly, ATP levels dropped to the same extent after KCl depolarization in both CsA-exposed slices and controls and stayed constant throughout KCl exposure (Fig. 5A). Thus, CsA did not affect ATP concentration before or after KCl depolarization, which suggests that changes in synaptic function caused by CsA are not due to altered ATP availability. Sustained exposure to 100 μm TPP+ caused a significant decline in levels of ATP in the hippocampal slice after 40 min of incubation (Fig. 5B). The decline in ATP correlated with the degradation of electrophysiological signals in hippocampal slices continuously exposed to 100 μm TPP+(Fig. 2D). In contrast, hippocampal slices exposed to 10 μm CsA did not show altered ATP levels and accordingly maintained electrophysiological integrity (Fig. 5B). The effect of CsA on synaptic function suggested a two-phase mechanism: an immediate increase in base-line synaptic transmission, followed ∼20 min later by an attenuation in synaptic plasticity (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that the changes in synaptic function might be due to secondary changes in mitochondrial calcium handling. To determine the effect of CsA on calcium handling, we monitored cytosolic calcium within presynaptic terminals exposed to CsA in acute hippocampal slices using an adaptation of our previously published protocol (8Wu L.G. Saggau P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 645-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the calcium indicator Fura-2 was applied to the axons of the Schaffer collateral pathway and transported to presynaptic terminals in CA1. This allowed us to measure relative changes in fluorescence caused by calcium binding to Fura-2 (Fig.6A). Using this approach, we were able to monitor the real time effects of CsA on presynaptic calcium. Immediately upon exposure to 10 μm CsA, resting presynaptic calcium was rapidly increased, followed by a more gradual return to base line by 30 min (Fig. 6B). Application of the vehicle, ethanol, had no effect (Fig. 6C). Thus, the increase in base-line synaptic transmission that we observed in Fig. 2B correlates with a transient increase in resting calcium over the same time period. Interestingly, the return of resting calcium to base-line levels occurs at about the same time that the PPF deficit began (Fig. 3). To confirm the target of CsA on mitochondrial calcium stores, we performed the same experiment using TPP+ to depolarize mitochondria. By depolarizing mitochondria, we effectively remove the ability of mitochondria to take up calcium. As expected, exposure to 100 μm TPP+ immediately caused mitochondrial depolarization and consequent calcium release (Fig. 6D) caused by loss of the mitochondrial proton gradient. When CsA was added to the TPP+ bath 30 min later, there was no effect (Fig.6D), suggesting that the target of CsA and TPP+are the same, i.e. mitochondrial calcium stores. When the TPP+ was washed out for 10 min, mitochondria recovered, and CsA regained its ability to cause an increase in resting calcium (Fig. 6E). CsA did not measurably affect stimulus-evoked calcium transients using the paired pulse protocol (Fig. 6F), suggesting that rather than participating in the dynamic handling of calcium during paired pulse stimulation, the MPT is more involved in regulating resting presynaptic calcium concentration. Thus, we can now correlate changes in resting presynaptic calcium handling with alterations in synaptic function in hippocampal slices exposed to CsA. Surprisingly, the effect of TPP+ on resting presynaptic calcium remarkably resembled the effect of CsA (Fig. 6E), again suggesting a common mechanism. Because TPP+ is known to depolarize mitochondria as part of its mechanism of causing calcium release, we used an in vitro assay of calcium handling in isolated mitochondria to determine whether CsA might be affecting mitochondrial calcium handling as well. Intact and functional isolated brain mitochondria rapidly buffered extramitochondrial calcium via the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, which could be blocked by ruthenium red (Fig.7A). Calcium influx is driven by a respiration-dependent electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. CCCP, which dissipates the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient, also blocked calcium influx and, in addition, induced mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release when added at the point of maximal buffering (Fig.7A). Overwhelmed by the amount of calcium used in thisin vitro assay, control mitochondria eventually depolarized and subsequently released their stores of calcium. These observations are consistent with previously published studies on mitochondrial calcium handling (21Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and indicate that our isolated mitochondrial preparation contains intact and functional mitochondria capable of sequestering calcium. Exposure of mitochondria to CsA prior to a 5–10 μmcalcium bolus resulted in an increased rate of calcium influx (Fig.7B) and an earlier and more rapid mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release (Fig. 7C). CsA exposure to at least three different mitochondrial preparations consistently resulted in an increased influx rate and more rapid calcium release (1.6–2.0-fold faster influx and release in each preparation) and consequently greater extramitochondrial calcium. Thus, the transient increase in cytosolic calcium observed in presynaptic terminals exposed to CsA (Fig. 6B) may have been due to triggering of mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release. Mitochondrial depolarization by CsA is not a direct effect, as with TPP+ and CCCP, because CsA added after maximal calcium buffering did not induce mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release (Fig. 7D). For CsA to depolarize mitochondria, it had to be present before calcium influx. One interesting possibility is that the increased rate of calcium influx caused by CsA triggered an earlier and more rapid mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release. We interpreted the effect of CsA on mitochondrial calcium handling as being due to inhibition of the MPT. To confirm this interpretation, we evaluated the effects of genetic deletion of an outer pore component of the MPT, VDAC1, using the in vitromethod above. Similar to CsA-exposed wild-type mitochondria, VDAC1-deficient mitochondria depolarized and released calcium more rapidly compared with littermate controls (Fig. 7E), which ultimately resulted in greater extramitochondrial calcium. This common feature of mitochondrial depolarization and increased extramitochondrial calcium may explain the electrophysiological similarity of CsA exposed wild-type hippocampal slices and VDAC-deficient hippocampal slices in synaptic plasticity (4Weeber E.J. Levy M. Sampson M.J. Anflous K. Armstrong D.L. Brown S.E. Paylor R.E. Sweatt J.D. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our data along with other recent reports suggest that mitochondrial calcium buffering is an important regulator of synaptic function (22Tang Y. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 23Billups B. Forsythe I.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5840-5847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular field recordings in hippocampal slices exposed to low doses of CsA, which functionally inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, showed significant deficits in PPF and 100 Hz LTP and an increase in base-line synaptic transmission. Calcium imaging of presynaptic terminals loaded with Fura-2 demonstrated that CsA induces an increase in resting calcium that may account for the acute change in synaptic transmission. Although the changes in presynaptic calcium and base-line synaptic transmission were acute effects of CsA, the deficits in short term synaptic plasticity began as the resting presynaptic calcium returned to base line, ∼20 min after CsA exposure. This delayed outcome of the synaptic plasticity deficit might be due to a secondary effect of the transient calcium increase or to prolonged mitochondrial depolarization. The former possibility is supported by previous studies showing that elevated presynaptic calcium can activate calcium-calmodulin kinases that phosphorylate the vesicle-associated protein synapsins; synapsin phosphorylation may result in impaired presynaptic plasticity (17Jovanovic J.N. Sihra T.S. Nairn A.C. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7944-7953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as indicated in Fig. 4, 10 μm CsA exposure does not result in phosphorylation of synapsin I at any of the sites tested, suggesting that synapsin phosphorylation is not likely mediating the changes in synaptic plasticity caused by CsA. Nevertheless, there are numerous other calcium-sensitive pathways within synaptic terminals that may impinge on mechanisms important in synaptic plasticity. Alternatively, the transient increase in calcium may represent a more generalized mitochondrial malfunction resulting from prolonged depolarization. In support of this idea are recent studies showing that respiratory chain uncouplers affecting mitochondrial calcium handling disrupt synaptic plasticity in the calyx of Held (23Billups B. Forsythe I.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5840-5847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the crayfish neuromuscular junction (22Tang Y. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The location of mitochondria in presynaptic terminals does not lend itself well to buffering calcium influx from the extracellular space during single synaptic depolarizations (24Brocard J.B. Tassetto M. Reynolds I.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) because this type of calcium influx may cause calcium elevations restricted to a smaller submembranous space. Rather, mitochondria appear to be more important in regulating the overall resting calcium level. To understand the role of the MPT and VDACs in regulating the resting calcium level, we employed an in vitro assay of mitochondrial calcium buffering. Studies of calcium buffering in isolated mitochondria are useful for understanding the roles of channels, exchangers, and pores in calcium influx and/or efflux, but their behavior in vivomight differ from their function in vitro. For example, although a calcium bolus of low micromolar concentration is necessary to observe the effect of CsA in isolated mitochondria, resting calcium levels in presynaptic terminals do not likely reach these levels. In addition, isolated mitochondria include those from both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments as well as glia. For these reasons, this assay only serves as a model for the role of the MPT in calcium regulation, which might help to explain the function of mitochondrial buffering in the intact presynaptic terminal in synaptic transmission and plasticity. It appears that in vitro mitochondrial calcium handling can be functionally divided into two stages, the uptake phase and the release phase. The uptake phase is dominated by calcium uptake by the uniporter. Blocking the MPT with CsA resulted in an increased net uptake during this phase. There are two workable hypotheses to explain this effect of CsA. First, if CsA hyperpolarizes the mitochondrial membrane, the drive for calcium influx would be greater and would thus cause increased calcium influx. Alternatively, one could suppose that the MPT conducts calcium release and, if blocked by CsA, would lead to a greater net influx. Either mechanism is plausible to explain the results of this assay but more importantly, the upshot is the same, that is, excessive calcium influx caused by blockage of the MPT results in calcium overload and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization. The result of mitochondrial depolarization is rapid calcium release from isolated mitochondria, as observed with CCCP. Consistent with this mechanism, adding CsA at the point of maximal calcium buffering did not have any effect (Fig. 5), indicating that the effect of CsA is dependent on calcium influx specifically. It is not yet known how calcium exits the mitochondria during the release phase, but based on our studies, it is not likely to be via the MPT or the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (data not shown) because inhibitors of these pathways did not affect calcium release during this phase. The trigger for calcium release appears to be mitochondrial depolarization by cation overload. Although there is a correlation between increasing the rate of calcium uptake by adding CsA and inducing earlier calcium release, mitochondria can buffer anywhere from 5 to 75 μm total calcium before releasing it. Thus, it is not the total calcium uptake, but the rate of calcium uptake, that appears to play a role in triggering calcium release in ourin vitro preparation. The increase in resting calcium stimulated by CsA strongly resembles the increase stimulated by TPP+, suggesting at least a common locus of action and possibility a common mechanism of action in the presynaptic terminal. TPP+, a lipophilic cation, works by carrying its positive charge across mitochondrial membranes into the negatively charged matrix and depolarizing it by virtue of overloading the matrix with positive charges. CsA is believed to work by binding to cyclophilin-D, the matrix component of the MPT, and functionally blocking the pore. The in vitro assay results suggest that blockage of the MPT leads to calcium (or other cation) overload and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization, complete with rapid calcium release. Thus, we can now speculate why CsA and TPP+ have the same effect on resting presynaptic calcium. They both cause mitochondrial depolarization leading to calcium release; TPP+ does it by virtue of loading positive charges into the matrix, whereas CsA does it by overloading the matrix with calcium or other cations such as potassium, sodium, and/or protons. Mitochondria lacking VDAC1 were also more likely to depolarize and subsequently release their calcium stores. VDAC1-deficient mitochondria may be more vulnerable to calcium overload, resulting in more rapid calcium release as observed in in vitro assays of VDAC1-deficient isolated mitochondria. Although previously known mitochondrial calcium-specific transporters and channels have only been observed on the mitochondrial inner membrane, the mechanism of calcium transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane is not known. VDACs are the only known channels that may be able to conduct calcium into the intermitochondrial space (25Gincel D. Zaid H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and therefore may play an important function in calcium influx into the mitochondrial matrix. Although calcium flux into the mitochondrial matrix has hitherto been attributed solely to the calcium uniporter of the mitochondrial inner membrane, we think it is interesting that VDAC-1-deficient mitochondria were impaired in mitochondrial calcium uptake in this assay (Fig. 7F). This finding is consistent with the growing notion that the mitochondrial outer membrane is not simply a molecular sieve but rather a regulated barrier that is involved in calcium flux into the intermitochondrial space, the source of calcium for the uniporter. Thus, the role of VDACs in calcium flux may not only be as a component of the MPT but also as calcium regulators across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Putting all the clues together, our study defines the roles of VDACs and the MPT in synaptic function. Based on the in vitroassay results, the MPT and VDACs serve to regulate the release of cations from mitochondria to prevent overload and subsequent depolarization. VDAC deficiency is detrimental for the proper function of the MPT because the absence of VDAC1 resulted in an increased likelihood of mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent calcium release as well. The overall result of mitochondrial depolarization in presynaptic terminals, induced by TPP+, CsA, or the absence of VDACs, is dysregulation of resting calcium, which may impinge on signal transduction pathways important in synaptic transmission and plasticity."

Despite considerable attention, the molecular identity of SOCs and their gating mechanism(s) remain unknown. Two major hypotheses for the mechanism of activation of CCE have been proposed. The first involves the release of a soluble factor from the endoplasmic reticulum (4Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 5Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The second, the “conformational coupling” model, proposes a direct interaction of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum with SOCs in the plasma membrane (2Berridge M.J.

The latter hypothesis has gained widespread support in the last few years. TRPC3 is a member of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) family of Ca2+-permeant, non-selective cation channels (7Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D.

These authors suggested that TRPC3 activation involves interaction with IP3 receptors in their ligand-bound state, consistent with the conformational coupling hypothesis. Ma et al. (17Ma H.-T.

Finally, Boulay et al. (18Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, conflicting results from different laboratories have generated a controversy as to the physiological mode of activation of TRPC3 channels. It is possible that different backgrounds of expression or different expression levels may produce different behaviors of TRPC3 (for example, see Refs. 19Vazquez G. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G. St J.

In addition, studies examining single channel behavior in excised patches may suffer from loss of cellular components essential for cellular signaling. Therefore, in the current study, we have re-examined the role of IP3 in regulation of TRPC3 channels, by utilizing whole cell patch clamp and single cell microfluorimetry. We have also utilized two HEK293 cell lines stably expressing TRPC3, one of which has been used in previous studies by other groups to provide evidence for a role of IP3 and the IP3 receptor. Our findings indicate that receptor activation of TRPC3 in intact HEK293 cells does not require activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins or the formation of IP3. Rather, it appears that, in intact HEK293 cells, receptor activation of TRPC3 is mediated by DAG in a protein kinase C (PKC)-independent manner. Thapsigargin, methacholine, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), IP3, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2,4,5)IP3), phorbol 12-myristoyl 13-acetate (PMA), and DAG kinase inhibitor II, R59022, were all purchased from Calbiochem. The 1-(α-glycerophosphoryl)-d-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (GPIP2) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, low molecular weight heparin and atropine from Sigma, the DAG lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 from Alexis Biochemicals, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and were transfected, using Superfect reagent (Qiagen), with pcDNA3 vector containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence added in-frame to the C terminus of human TRPC3 (11McKay R.R. Szmeczek-Seay C.L. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G. St J. Zitt C. Jüngling E. Lückhoff A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing TRPC3-GFP fusion protein (HEK-TRPC3) were selected first by antibiotic resistance and second by GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. Cells were maintained in culture as described previously (21Trebak M. Bird G. St J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). An HEK293 cell line expressing human TRPC3 with the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) fused to its C terminus (HEK-T3, clone 9) were generated and grown as previously described (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Coverslips with attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing 1 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed and bathed in Hepes-buffered saline solution (HBSS; in mm, 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.13 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4) for at least 15 min before Ca2+ measurements were made. In some experiments, reagents were introduced into the cell through patch pipettes (2–5 MΩ, Corning glass, 7052). The cells for these experiments had membrane capacitances of 10–25 picofarads. The pipette solution (P1) contained in mm: 140 K+gluconate, 0.1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 2 MgATP, 0.075 Fura-2, pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH. Various concentrations of IP3, IP3 analogues, or heparin were included in the pipette when indicated. The bath solution was HBSS or (nominally Ca2+-free) HBSS with no added Ca2+. Whole cell mode was achieved by gentle suction and giga-ohm-seal quality was monitored throughout the recordings using pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Single cell Ca2+measurements in patch clamp experiments were made with a photomultiplier-based system mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope (×40 Neofluor objective). The cells were excited alternatively by 340 and 380 nm wavelength light from a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ) light source equipped with a light-patch chopper and dual excitation monochromators. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was recorded by a photomultiplier tube (omega Optical). A constant holding potential of −60 mV was applied to the cells. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. The data are expressed as the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence because of excitation at 340 nm to that because of excitation at 380 nm. For Ca2+ measurements after application of external stimuli only (i.e. not involving patch clamp), fluorescence images of the cells were recorded and analyzed with a digital fluorescence imaging system (InCyt Im2, Intracellular Imaging Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Fura-2 fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm was induced by exciting Fura-2 alternately at 340 and 380 nm. The 340/380 nm ratio images were obtained on a pixel by pixel basis and converted to absolute Ca2+ concentrations by in vitrocalibration. Average Ca2+ values per cell are reported. For dose-response experiments with methacholine (Fig. 1), Ca2+ measurements were performed on attached populations of cells in polylysine-coated 96-well plates with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were prepared, loaded with 4 μm Fluo-4 AM in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min at 37 °C, and analyzed as previously described (21Trebak M. Bird G. St J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature. For whole cell TRPC3 current measurements, coverslips of TRPC3-expressing HEK293 cells were prepared and mounted in a perfusion chamber. Electrophysiological measurements were made at room temperature 24–72 h after cells have been seeded on coverslips. The cells studied had membrane capacitances of 10–25 picofarads. Patch pipettes (Corning glass, 7052) with a resistance of 2–5 MΩ were generated using an automatic micropipette puller (model P-97, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). An agar bridge served as the electrical connection between the bath and the signal ground. Whole cell currents were elicited by voltage stimuli lasting 250 ms, delivered every 2 or 10 s, with voltage ramps from −120 to +80 mV. Data were sampled at 2 KHz, filtered at 1 KHz, recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), and analyzed using pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). The internal pipette solution (P2) was buffered to 125 nm free Ca2+ and contained (in mm): 140 CsCl2, 10 BAPTA (cesium salt), 5 CaCl2, 2 MgATP, 0.1 GTP (sodium salt), 10 Hepes, pH 7.2, with Tris base. The bath solution was (in mm): 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CsCl2, 2.0 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 2.0 CaCl2, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The osmolarity of these solutions was adjusted to 290–310 milliosmole with glucose. Bath solution change was accomplished by perfusion and the time required for a complete solution change was around 2 s. All voltages were corrected for liquid junction potential. Cells were microinjected with (2,4,5)IP3 together with Fura-2 (as a marker for injection), or with Fura-2 alone as described previously (22Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B.

However, the exact mechanism through which agonists activate TRPC3 remains controversial. To gain further insights into the mechanism of TRPC3 activation, we explored the concentration dependence of TRPC3 activation by the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine, which activates PLC-β through a heterotrimeric G-protein-dependent pathway. HEK293 cells express muscarinic receptors, and respond to muscarinic agonists with a robust IP3-mediated release of Ca2+, and subsequent store-operated Ca2+ entry (23Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5613-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In these experiments, an automated real-time fluorescence plate reader system was utilized (see “Materials and Methods”), and background controls (i.e.Ca2+ additions in the absence of agonist) were carried out in parallel and subtracted from the conditions with agonist. Gadolinium (Gd3+, 5 μm) was included in the media in some wells to inhibit endogenous agonist-induced Ca2+entry, as described previously (21Trebak M. Bird G. St J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown previously (21Trebak M. Bird G. St J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), TRPC3 expressing cells showed a larger influx of Ca2+ than did wild-type cells in response to muscarinic receptor activation. This TRPC3-dependent influx was unaffected by Gd3+, whereas it was completely blocked in the wild-type cells. The concentration-effect relationships for release of Ca2+ in both cell types, as well as for the entry of Ca2+ in the wild-type cells, were very similar. However, interestingly, the relationship for TRPC3-dependent Ca2+ entry was left-shifted, such that concentrations of methacholine that produced little or no Ca2+ store release were able to substantially activate TRPC3-dependent Ca2+ entry (Fig.1). This is not likely because of a temporal delay in accumulation of IP3, because this should have resulted in a leftward shift of the wild-type cells as well. This result means either that, unlike SOCs, TRPC3 is sensitive to very low concentrations of IP3, or that IP3 is not involved in TRPC3 activation. To address this issue, we next decided to directly introduce IP3 into cells and determine its effect on TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry. TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry in response to introduction of IP3into stable TRPC3-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells (HEK-TRPC3) was assessed by Fura-2 imaging of single cells as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Five μm Gd3+ was used throughout these experiments to fully inhibit the endogenous CCE pathway in response to store depletion induced by intracellular introduction of IP3 or external application of methacholine. Surprisingly, IP3 did not activate TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry over a wide range of concentrations (2–400 μm). Even at very high concentrations (400 μm; Fig.2 a), IP3 failed to activate TRPC3 while subsequent addition of methacholine (100 μm) consistently activated TRPC3 in the same cells (n = 58). The Ca2+ rise seen after methacholine addition resulted entirely from Ca2+ entry rather than release from internal stores, because when we added methacholine after IP3 introduction into the cell in the absence of external calcium, we observed no additional Ca2+release (Fig. 2 b). Thus, these concentrations of IP3 were sufficient to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores completely (n = 10; Fig.2 b). Similar concentrations of IP3 in the absence of external Gd3+ maximally activated CCE in wild-type cells, as methacholine did not induce a further increase of Ca2+ entry, and also induced a complete depletion of internal Ca2+ stores in wild-type HEK293 cells (data not shown). To rule out possible complications because of metabolism of IP3, we also used high concentrations of (2,4,5)IP3 and GPIP2, two non-metabolized analogues of IP3 (22Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 24Bird G. St J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17722-17725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 1 mm(2,4,5)IP3 (Fig. 2 c) or 1 mmGPIP2 (Fig. 2 d) were introduced into HEK-TRPC3 cells, no TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry was seen when Ca2+ was restored to the external medium, while again methacholine (100 μm) activated TRPC3 in the same cells. These findings are clearly inconsistent with the previously published findings of Kiselyov et al. (15Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 16Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These authors observed activation of TRPC3 single channel currents in the cell-attached configuration after stimulation with carbachol. These TRPC3 currents declined when the patch was excised, and were restored upon addition of IP3 and the IP3 receptor to the patch (but not the IP3 receptor alone), leading to the conclusion that IP3 was the mediator of TRPC3 activation. These authors used a clonal HEK293 cell line stably expressing TRPC3 (T3-9) (10Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To ensure that our apparently discrepant findings could not be attributed to the use of a different cell line, we examined the activation of TRPC3 in response to introduction of IP3 into T3-9 cells using the same protocol in Fig. 2 a. As shown in Fig.2 e, 400 μm IP3 did not induce any TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry in T3-9 cells, whereas methacholine substantially activated TRPC3 in the same cells (n = 9). This concentration of IP3 was sufficient to induce complete store depletion in T3-9 cells, showing that the Ca2+ signal in response to methacholine was because of entry rather than Ca2+ release from internal stores (n = 4, Fig. 2 f). To ensure that the failure of IP3 to activate TRPC3 was not because of the loss of some necessary co-factor because of diffusion from the patch-clamped cells, we also microinjected (2,4,5)IP3 into TRPC3-GFP expressing HEK293 cells as described earlier (22Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In TRPC3 cells, (2,4,5)IP3activated Ca2+ entry in the absence of Gd3+, indicating that microinjection of this poorly metabolized inositol trisphosphate efficiently discharges stores and activates CCE, but fails to activate TRPC3 channels (data now shown). We next investigated the regulation of TRPC3 expressed in HEK293 cells by examining ionic currents with the whole cell patch clamp technique. After establishing the whole cell configuration, cell membrane potential was clamped to a holding potential of +30 mV, and 250-ms voltage ramps from −120 to +80 mV were applied every 2 s. Following break-in, the whole cell currents measured at −60 mV were greater in TRPC3 expressing cells than in wild-type (Fig.3 a). Addition of methacholine (100 μm) resulted in the development of larger inward currents in TRPC3-expressing cells, whereas control cells showed no detectable response to the same concentration of methacholine (Fig.3 b). The failure to detect agonist-activated currents in wild-type cells allows us to examine the activation of TRPC3 in the absence of the CCE blocker, Gd3+. A typical current-voltage relationship curve (I-V curve) before and after addition of methacholine to a HEK-TRPC3 cell is shown in Fig. 3 c. We examined the ability of IP3 to induce TRPC3 current in HEK-TRPC3 cells by including 400 μm IP3 in the patch pipette. Consistent with the Fura-2 experiments in Fig. 2, no current developed after IP3 introduction into HEK-TRPC3 cells, and the steady-state current was not significantly different from TRPC3 cells without IP3 (Fig. 3 a). Again, 100 μm methacholine induced large inward currents in the IP3-treated cells (Fig. 3 d). A lower, perhaps more physiological concentration of IP3 (20 μm), as used by Kiselyov et al. (16Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), was also inefficient in activating TRPC3 currents (data not shown, and see Fig.6 c). Methacholine increased inward and outward whole cell currents as seen in the I-V curves (Fig. 3, c ande). These effects were highly reproducible; IP3introduction into HEK-TRPC3 cells never resulted in the development of current, whereas methacholine consistently yielded a substantial increase in TRPC3 current amplitude.Figure 6Methacholine (MeCh) and OAG activate TRPC3 non-additively. a, HEK-TRPC3 cells were incubated in the presence of 2 mmCa2+. 5 μm Gd3+ was present throughout the experiment to inhibit endogenous CCE. 100 μm MeCh was added to the cells and when a sustained plateau of Ca2+ entry was reached, 300 μm OAG was added as indicated. b, HEK-TRPC3 cells were treated in a similar protocol to a, with OAG added first followed by MeCh as indicated. c, inward TRPC3 currents, measured every 10 s (at −60 mV) are plotted as a function of time. 20 μm IP3 was included in the patch pipette and 100 μm MeCh was added to the cells followed by 300 μm OAG (red trace) or inversely, OAG was added before MeCh (blue trace). A control trace (black) where only MeCh was added is also shown. d, representative currents elicited by 250-ms voltage ramps ranging from −120 to +80 mV, after the whole cell mode was established with IP3 in the pipette (black), after MeCh addition (red), and after OAG addition (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One point of evidence supporting the requirement of IP3 receptors in TRPC3 activation was the sensitivity of TRPC3 to the membrane permeant IP3 receptor antagonist 2-APB (17Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). 2-APB was subsequently shown to block CCE in response to store depletion by ionomycin in the DT40 B-cell line, and this compound was equally effective on DT40 cells lacking the three isoforms of the IP3 receptor (25Broad L.M. Braun F.-J. Lièvremont J.-P. Bird G. St J. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 2-APB was shown to be more efficient from the outside of the cell suggesting that it is likely inhibiting SOC channels through a direct action (26Braun F.-J. Broad L.M. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Heparin is a competitive IP3 receptor antagonist that has been previously reported to inhibit Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry in response to agonist or to direct introduction of IP3 into the cell, but has no effect on CCE induced by passive depletion of Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin or ionomycin (22Bird G.

St J. Kurosaki T. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Unlike 2-APB, heparin is membrane-impermeant and so we introduced it into the cell through the patch pipette. An effective concentration clearly entered the cell, because ∼300 s after forming the whole cell mode, external application of methacholine failed to release stored Ca2+ or activate CCE in wild-type HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 a). In HEK-TRPC3 cells, Ca2+ release because of methacholine was also blocked (Fig. 4, b and d), whereas thapsigargin-induced release was unaffected (Fig. 4 d). The same protocol was used to examine the effect of heparin on TRPC3 activation in HEK-TRPC3 and T3-9 cells. In these experiments, 5 μm Gd3+ was included in all solutions to inhibit endogenous CCE. In HEK-TRPC3 (Fig. 4 b) and T3-9 (Fig. 4 c) cell lines, introduction of heparin (10 mg/ml) into the cell completely blocked Ca2+ release in response to external application of methacholine. However, TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry in both cell lines was unaffected. These results show that neither IP3 receptor activation, nor discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores is involved in agonist-induced activation of TRPC3. To determine whether heterotrimeric G proteins play an obligatory role in TRPC3 activation, we tested whether TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry can be activated through the tyrosine kinase-PLC-γ pathway. We serum-starved HEK-TRPC3 cells to boost EGF receptor expression. Stimulation of the EGF receptor by EGF activates PLC-γ through receptor tyrosine kinase (27Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M.

https://openalex.org/W2091030555,"Signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) is essential for many cellular processes including proliferation and migration as well as differentiation events such as angiogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis. Recently, genetic screens in Drosophila and gene expression screens in zebrafish have resulted in the identification of several feedback inhibitors of FGF signaling. One of these, Sef (similarexpression to fgf genes), encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the FGF synexpression group. Here we show that like zebrafish Sef (zSef), mouse Sef (mSef) interacts with FGFR1 and that the cytoplasmic domain of mSef mediates this interaction. Overexpression of mSef in NIH3T3 cells results in a decrease in FGF-induced cell proliferation associated with a decrease in Tyr phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2. As a consequence, there is a reduction in the phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser338, MEK1/2 at Ser217 and Ser221, and ERK1/2 at Thr202 and Tyr204. Furthermore, mSef inhibits ERK activation mediated by a constitutively activated FGFR1 but not by a constitutively active Ras and decreases FGF but not PDGF-mediated activation of Akt. These results indicate that Sef exerts its inhibitory effects at the level of FGFR and upstream of Ras providing an additional level of negative regulation of FGF signaling.

FGFs play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and embryonic pattern formation. FGFs elicit their effects on cells by forming a ternary complex that includes the ligand, a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, and a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (2Friesel R. Maciag T. Thromb.

Upon ligand binding, FGF receptors dimerize, resulting in autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for SH2 domain containing polypeptides such as phospholipase Cγ (2Friesel R.

The PTB-domain containing adaptor protein FRS2 (SNT1) binds to the FGFR in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation of FGFRs (3Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Front.

Once FRS2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, it binds the SH2 domain containing adaptor protein Grb2 as well as the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (3Naski M.C. Ornitz D.M. Front.

Grb2 recruits SOS to the plasma membrane where it participates in activation of Ras and subsequently ERK1/2.

Based upon similarities in spatial and temporal patterns of expression as well as functioning in a common pathway, FGF8, FGF3 and Spry have been placed in the FGF synexpression group (11Minowada G.

Sef is a transmembrane protein whose embryonic expression pattern is similar to that of other members of the FGF synexpression group, and its expression is regulated by FGF. Furthermore, overexpression studies in zebrafish and Xenopus show that Sef inhibits FGF signaling (15Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the inhibitory function of Sef is unclear. It has been reported that Sef co-immunoprecipitates with FGFR1 and FGFR2 (15Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but it has also been reported that Sef functions at or downstream of MEK (18Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To establish the functional significance of the physical association of Sef with FGFRs, we overexpressed mouse Sef (mSef) in NIH3T3, COS7, and HEK293 cells and examined the effects of mSef on FGF signaling. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of mSef inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and reduces FGF-induced cell proliferation. These effects are accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylation of FRS2 and a reduction in the activation of components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as well as of Akt. Thus, Sef functions by binding to and inhibiting the activation of FGFR1 at the cell membrane. mSef was cloned by PCR using primers designed to amplify the open reading frame using the published sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF459444) and cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of mSef was confirmed using an ABI 310 automated DNA sequencer. The deletion mutants mSefECTM (amino acids 1–325) and mSefIC (amino acids 301–738) were constructed by PCR in a similar manner. The Sef transmembrane domain was replaced by the PDGFR transmembrane domain by cloning the Sef extracellular domain into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) followed by subsequent subcloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (mSefEC). For the preparation of mSef or GFP (hrGFP, Stratagene) expressing adenoviruses (AdmSef, AdGFP) a Cre-lox-based system was employed (19Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (gift from P. Robbins, University of Pittsburgh). Plasmids encoding FGFRs were described previously (20Neilson K.M. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25049-25057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). ERK2-HA was from S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health) and RasQ61L was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (pUSE H-RasL61). COS7 and HEK293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). NIH3T3 cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum (CS). For transient transfection experiments, cells were plated at 60–70% confluence in either 10-cm culture dishes or six-well plates and grown overnight in growth medium. Transfections were carried out in 0.1% CS or Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) serum-free medium with the Genejuice reagent (Novagen). Eighteen to twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with FGF2, PDGF-BB (R & D Systems) or EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for the indicated times. NIH3T3 cells were transduced with AdGFP or AdmSef (104viral particles/cell) complexed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (21Fasbender A. Zabner J. Chillon M. Moninger T.O.

Infection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy of AdGFP-infected cells and was usually greater than 80%. Cells that were either transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids or transduced with adenoviruses and treated as described above were lysed in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaVO4) as described (22Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Lysates were either subjected directly to immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitated overnight with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were captured on protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) washed extensively in HNTG buffer, eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, separated on 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Biosciences) followed by immunoblotting as previously described (22Friesel R.

Ras activation was assessed using Raf-1 RBD (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the bands was determined by scanning with a Canon scanner (model N1220) and analysis with NIH image software. Antibodies used in this study were rabbit anti-FGFR FB817 (22Friesel R.

NIH3T3 cells were plated in 12-well plates (Costar) at 2 × 104 cells/ml, transduced with the indicated adenoviruses, and made quiescent in DMEM containing 0.1% CS for 36 h. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml FGF2 and incubated with [3H]thymidine (ICN) (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h, followed by fixing with 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilization in 0.5m NaOH prior to scintillation counting. It was reported previously that zSef co-immunoprecipitated with FGFRs from lysates of transfected COS7 cells (15Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine whether mSef associates with FGFR1 and to elucidate which structural domains of the mSef protein mediate the interaction, we have prepared full-length and deletion mutants of mSef (Fig. 1A) and co-transfected them with FGFR1 constructs (Fig. 1, B–D). Full-length mSef and mSefIC co-immunoprecipitated with FGFR1 but not mSefECTM or mSefEC. mSef co-immunoprecipitated with both unstimulated and FGF-stimulated FGFR1 with equal efficiency (Fig. 1B). mSef also associated with a constitutively activated form of FGFR1 (FGFR1-K562E) (Fig. 1C) as well as a kinase inactive form of FGFR1 (FGFR1-KD) (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of mSef mediates, at least in part, the association between FGFR1 and mSef. In addition, these data indicate that the association between mSef and FGFR1 is independent of FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity. It has been shown that in zebrafish embryos, overexpression of zSef inhibits MAPK activation, although the mechanism for this inhibition was not determined (18Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To explore the ability of mSef overexpression to inhibit FGF-induced ERK activation, NIH3T3 cells were transduced with AdGFP or AdmSef, and after serum starvation, were stimulated with FGF2 for 10 min. Activation of ERK1/2 was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated (activated) form of ERK1/2 (p42/44 MAPK) (Fig.2A). Adenovirus-mediated expression of mSef but not GFP resulted in a reduction in the levels of activated ERK1/2, whereas overall levels of ERK1/2 were unaffected (Fig. 2A). Adenovirus-mediated expression of mSef was confirmed by immunoblotting for the V5 epitope tag on the C terminus of mSef. Immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated (activated) forms of MEK1/2 reveals that mSef inhibited FGF-induced MEK activation (Fig. 2A). In addition, immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize the Ser338 phosphorylation site of activated Raf-1 reveals a reduction in FGF-induced activation of Raf-1 by mSef (Fig. 2A). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots of three independent experiments showed that FGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, MEK1/2, and Raf-1 was reduced by an average of 86 ± 3%, 61 ± 5%, and 59 ± 9%, respectively, by mSef overexpression. These data indicate that the site of action of mSef is likely to be upstream of Raf-1. The mitogenic action of the FGFs is mediated in part by the activation of ERK1/2 (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of ERK activation by mSef correlates with inhibition of FGF-mediated cell proliferation, we transduced NIH3T3 cells with either AdGFP or AdmSef followed by stimulation with FGF2 and tritiated-thymidine incorporation assay. Transduction with AdmSef resulted in a decrease in FGF-stimulated DNA synthesis consistent with a reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). To further establish whether mSef mediated inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway occurs at the level of Ras or upstream of it, we assayed for ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells transduced with either AdGFP or AdmSef followed by stimulation with FGF2, PDGF-BB, EGF, or calf serum. Overexpression of mSef does not inhibit ERK1/2 activation by PDGF-BB, EGF, or calf serum in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.3A), indicating that signaling from Ras is intact in mSef overexpressing cells. In addition, co-transfection of HEK293 cells with ERK2-HA and either a constitutively activated form of FGFR1 (C289R) (19Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or an activated form of Ras (RasQ61L) with or without mSef demonstrates that mSef effectively decreases ERK phosphorylation induced by a constitutively active FGFR1 but not by activated RasQ61L (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, employing RBD-GST pull-downs, we show that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of mSef inhibits FGF-induced activation of Ras in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3C). Since FGF and PDGF have been shown to activate the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade albeit by different mechanisms (7Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 28Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether mSef inhibits FGF-induced Akt activation. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-Akt antibodies that specifically recognize activated Akt. Lysates from NIH3T3 cells transduced with either AdGFP or AdmSef and stimulated with either FGF2 or PDGF-BB were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt antibodies (Fig. 3D). AdmSef inhibited FGF-induced, but not PDGF-induced, activation of Akt. These results indicate that mSef inhibits multiple FGF-induced signaling pathways and that this inhibition occurs upstream of Ras. Since mSefIC mediates binding to FGFR1, we next sought to determine whether mSefIC was sufficient to inhibit FGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with ERK2-HA, FGFR1 with or without mSef or mSefIC (Fig. 3E). mSefIC was able to inhibit FGF-induced ERK2-HA phosphorylation, but to a lesser extent when compared with full-length mSef. These results indicate that while mSefIC is sufficient to interact with FGFR1, the inhibitory effect of mSefIC on FGF signaling is reduced. Since mSef co-immunoprecipitates with FGFR1, we next sought to determine whether mSef affects FGFR1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Lysates of NIH3T3 cells transduced with either AdGFP or AdmSef and treated with or without FGF2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with FGFR antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-FGFR, and V5 (Sef) antibodies. These data indicate that adenovirus-mediated expression of mSef reduced FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR without affecting the overall level of FGFR expression (Fig.4A). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots from three independent experiments indicates that overexpression of mSef mediates a greater than 70% decrease in ligand-induced FGFR1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Since FRS2 is a major substrate of FGFR1, we immunoprecipitated FRS2 from lysates of NIH3T3 cells transduced with AdmSef or AdGFP with or without FGF2 stimulation. Overexpression of mSef in NIH3T3 cells results in a decrease in FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 (Fig. 4C). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots indicates that mSef reduces FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation by almost 70% (Fig.4D). These data strongly indicate that the interaction of mSef with FGFR1 mediates a reduction in FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2. Taken together these data indicate that mSef binds to FGFR1 and mediates a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and its immediate downstream target, FRS2, thereby modulating multiple FGF-mediated signaling pathways. zSef was shown to inhibit FGF signaling in zebrafish andXenopus embryos (15Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), at least in part by inhibiting activation of MAPK (ERK1/2); however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. It has also been reported that zSef associated with FGFR1and FGFR2 in co-immunoprecipitation assays (15Tsang M. Friesel R. Kudoh T. Dawid I.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to establish a functional link between these two observations. To begin to address potential mechanisms for Sef function in FGF signaling, we have examined its effects on FGF-mediated cell proliferation in vitro. We show that overexpression of mSef in NIH3T3 cells results in inhibition of FGF-induced cell proliferation. This inhibition is mediated at least in part by a reduction in ERK1/2 activation. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies that recognize the activated forms of Raf-1 and MEK reveals that activation of these effectors is also reduced by forced expression of mSef and indicates that mSef most likely acts upstream of Raf-1. Overexpression of mSef in the presence of a constitutively activated FGFR1 resulted in a reduction in ERK activation, whereas in the presence of an activated Ras, mSef had no effect on ERK activation. Indeed, overexpression of mSef in NIH3T3 cells results in an inhibition of FGF-induced activation of Ras. The unanticipated result that mSef overexpression did not affect ERK activation by PDGF, EGF, or CS suggests that Ras signaling is intact in mSef overexpressing cells and that mSef functions upstream of Ras specifically at the level of the FGFR. Further support for the specificity of mSef for FGF-mediated signaling was demonstrated by a reduction in activation of Akt by FGF but not by PDGF. The inhibition of Raf/MEK/ERK by mSef is often incomplete but is consistent with the level of inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 and FRS2. Failure of mSef to completely inhibit all FGFR1 signaling indicates that either mSef is not a high affinity antagonist and/or that mSef may require another protein to exert complete inhibition of signaling through FGFR1. Since mSef interacts with FGFR1, we examined the effect of mSef on FGF-induced FGFR1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Overexpression of mSef reduces FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR1 suggesting that mSef inhibits, at least in part, receptor activation. Although the cytoplasmic domain of mSef is necessary for efficient binding to FGFR1, its inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activation was reduced when compared with full-length mSef. These data suggest a mechanism that requires the extracellular domain of mSef for full inhibitory activity of FGFR-mediated cell signaling. One possibility is that mSef interferes with receptor dimerization and subsequent transphosphorylation. Another potential mechanism might involve modification of FGFR interaction with its ligands by mSef resulting in attenuation of FGFR-mediated signal transduction. FGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 is decreased in mSef overexpressing cells. Inhibition of FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation is consistent with mSef inhibiting multiple FGF signaling pathways. This suggests that the observed inhibition of activation of the ERK pathway is due to reduced recruitment of Grb2 to FRS2. Furthermore, the mSef-mediated reduction in Akt activation is also most likely due to reduced recruitment of Grb2 to FRS2, since Grb2 mediates binding of Gab1 to FRS2, which results in activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt (7Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These results also address the issue of the specificity of mSef for FGFR signaling. FGF-mediated activation of both ERK and Akt requires tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 and subsequent binding of Grb2 (7Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), whereas Grb2 and PI 3-kinase bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR to activate the ERK pathway and Akt (28Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). These differences may explain in part the ability of mSef to inhibit FGF-mediated ERK and Akt activation but not PDGF-mediated ERK and Akt activation. In a previous report, data were presented to indicate that in zebrafish embryos, overexpression of zSef was able to inhibit MAPK activation induced by FGF8 as well as constitutively activated Ras, Raf, and MEK, indicating that Sef acts downstream or at the level of MEK (18Furthauer M. Lin W. Ang S.L. Thisse B. Thisse C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that mSef acts at a point upstream of Ras at the level of FGFR1 and not at the level of MEK. It is unlikely that these differences are due to difference in zSef and mSef, since zSef also inhibits FGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). The differences could arise from differences in assays using zebrafish embryos or cell culture systems. It is also possible that the function of endogenous Sef may differ from that of overexpressed Sef. For example, if Sef acts as a scaffolding protein, overexpressed Sef may compete for a limited pool of interacting proteins, thus preventing assembly of functional signaling complexes. Further work in this area will reveal the reason for these differences. We thank P. Robbins, S. Gutkind, I. Daar, A. Yoshimura, and Viktoria Andreeva for reagents. We thank T. Maciag, J. Verdi, C.

Laser scanning microscopy of different tissues from the tobacco hornworm revealed co-localization of the holoenzyme and F-actin close to the apical membranes of the epithelial cells. In midgut goblet cells, no co-localization was observed under conditions where the V1 complex detaches from the apical membrane. Binding studies, however, demonstrated that both the V1 complex and the holoenzyme interact with F-actin, the latter with an apparently higher affinity. To identify F-actin binding subunits, we performed overlay blots that revealed two V1subunits as binding partners, namely subunit B, resembling the situation in the osteoclast V-ATPase (Holliday, L.

Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). They comprise at least 12 subunits that are part of two different subcomplexes, i.e. a peripheral, catalytic V1 complex with subunits A3B3CDEXFGYH and a membrane-bound, proton-conducting V0 complex with subunits ac6de. In the midgut of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) they are localized in the apical membrane of goblet cells where they exclusively energize all secondary active transport processes across the epithelium (3Wieczorek H. Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During starvation or molt, pump activity abolishes due to the dissociation of the V1complex from the membrane (4Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the tobacco hornworm as well as in yeast, where reversible dissociation occurs upon the withdrawal of glucose, subunit C seems to be released into the cytoplasm because the purified V1 complex contains not more than substoichiometric amounts of this polypeptide (5Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys.

The regulatory mechanisms responsible for reversible V-ATPase dissociation are not understood, although it seems likely that interactions of V-ATPase subunits with other cellular proteins control this process. In fact, several proteins have already been identified that bind to subunits of the V-ATPase and thus may link this enzyme to a comprehensive cellular network. Among recently discovered candidates is the yeast RAVE complex (8Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which associates with the cytosolic V1 complex via its rav1p component and is apparently essential for stable assembly of the V-ATPase holoenzyme (9Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Another example is the plasma membrane V-ATPase in osteoclasts, which may be linked to glycolysis via the interaction of its subunit E with aldolase, an enzyme of the glycolytic pathway (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn Jr., W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The involvement of proteins interacting with V-ATPases may also be relevant to sorting processes within the cell. In clathrin-coated vesicles, V-ATPase seems to be associated with the 50-kDa polypeptide of the AP-2 complex (11Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9184-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is involved in the internalization of proteins from the plasma membrane (12Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Even more, this interaction may be necessary for activity and in vitro reassembly of the V-ATPase (13Liu Q. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31592-31597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of V-ATPase to AP-2, however, may also be linked to the mechanisms of pathogenicity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1infection. Direct interaction between the HIV accessory protein Nef and the V-ATPase subunit H was correlated with the ability of Nef to internalize CD4, the primary receptor for HIV (14Yu X. Lu H. Liu S.H. Brodsky F.M. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 647-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More detailed investigations revealed that Nef contacts the endocytotic machinery and therefore suggested an important role for subunit H of the V-ATPase in viral infectivity (15Mandic R. Fackler O.T. Geyer M. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was demonstrated that subunit H, which shows structural and functional similarities to β-adaptins (16Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), binds in vitro and in vivo to the C-terminal flexible loop of Nef as well as to AP-2 (17M. Yu Geyer H. Mandic R. Linnemann T. Zheng Y.H. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28521-28529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, subunit H may function as an adaptor for interactions between Nef and AP-2. Binding of cellular proteins may also link V-ATPases to the cytoskeleton. In vivo experiments indirectly suggested that microtubules might be involved in glucose-dependent dissociation of the yeast V-ATPase (18Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24855-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, V-ATPases are also associated with the actin-based cytoskeleton. During osteoclast activation ruffled membrane V-ATPase directly binds to F-actin, evidently linking V-ATPase transport to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (19Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Binding to F-actin is mediated by the amino-terminal domain of the V1 subunit B (20Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The interaction of actin and V-ATPase may occur only in systems where the V-ATPase is sorted into the plasma membrane of a cell; latrunculin, which disrupts actin filaments, had no effect on glucose-dependent dissociation of the V-ATPase from the endomembranes (18Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24855-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the interaction between actin and plasma membrane V-ATPases reflects a general phenomenon, we performed co-localization studies, co-pelleting assays, and overlay blots using the plasma membrane V-ATPase of Manduca midgut goblet cells. We show that, in vitro, both the V1 complex and the V1V0 holoenzyme bind directly to F-actin.In vivo, however, this interaction seems to be restricted to the holoenzyme. The interaction is mediated by subunits B and C; the latter subunit may function as a regulatory linker protein between the V-ATPase and the actin-based cytoskeleton. Larvae of M. sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) were reared under long day conditions (16 h of light) at 27 °C using a synthetic diet modified according to Bell and Joachim (21Bell R.A. Joachim F.G.

After excision of longitudinal muscles, the tissue was stretched, cut into small pieces of about 5 mm2 and fixed for 90 min at room temperature in PLP fixative (0.1 m sodium meta-periodate, 75 mml-lysine, 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1m Sørensen phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Tissue embedding, cryosectioning, and immunostaining were performed as described previously (22Klein U. Löffelmann G. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1991; 161: 61-75Google Scholar). For labeling of the V1 complex, the cryosections were treated with a 1:10 dilution of monoclonal antibody 221-9 to subunit A of the Manduca V-ATPase (22Klein U. Löffelmann G. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1991; 161: 61-75Google Scholar). Soluble subunit C was labeled with a 1:2000 dilution of monospecific, polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant protein (6Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Visualization of the primary antibodies was performed with a 1:1000 dilution of Cy3- or TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-guinea pig F(ab′)2-fragments (Sigma). To test for unspecific binding of the secondary antibody, control reactions were carried out without primary antibodies. For labeling of the actin filaments, cryosections were treated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% bovine serum albumin) for 40 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were covered by Mowiol (Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) and viewed with either an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM 410). Double-labeling with FITC-phalloidin and monoclonal antibody 221-9 was performed for co-localization studies; antibody 221-9 was detected with TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse F(ab′)2-fragments (Sigma). To exclude mutual co-excitation, detection of fluorescence signals was performed by using two lasers with excitation wavelengths of λ = 488 nm for the FITC-signal and λ = 568 nm for the TRITC-signal and long pass emission filters of 515 and 595 nm, respectively. For in vitro binding studies, rabbit skeletal muscle actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was dissolved in water and depolymerized at 0 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation for 30 min at 200,000 × g and 4 °C, G-actin (70 μm) was polymerized for 1 h at 30 °C in buffer P (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, and 1.2 mm ATP). Binding studies and determination of stoichiometries were performed at monomer concentrations below the critical concentration for actin polymerization. For this purpose, F-actin was stabilized with 10 μm phalloidin and then diluted to 200 nm in buffer P containing 10 μm phalloidin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and varying concentrations of V1 or V1V0 ATPase, respectively. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g and 20 °C. Protein amounts of the supernatant and the dissolved pellets were determined, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining. Five micrograms of the purified V1 complex or the V1V0 holoenzyme, respectively, or 1 μg of aldolase or the recombinant subunit C, respectively, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blocking was performed for 1 h in a buffer containing 3% gelatin in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. The membrane was equilibrated three times for 5 min in buffer F (5 mmTris-HCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 200 mm KCl, pH 8.0) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in buffer F containing 1% gelatin and F-actin at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After washing the membrane three times for 5 min with F buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound actin filaments were detected by incubating the membrane in buffer F containing 1% gelatin and rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibodies (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:200. Afterward, the membrane was rinsed three times for 5 min in buffer F containing 0.05% Tween. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in buffer F containing 1% gelatin and anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase at a dilution of 1:30,000. Following a third washing step that was performed as above, decorated protein bands were detected after rinsing the membrane in 0.34‰ nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)/0.18‰ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mmMgCl2. Two hundred microliters of Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad) were washed three times with 4 ml of H20 and then three times with 4 ml of coupling buffer consisting of 0.1 m MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5), 9.6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% C12E10. Afterward the Affi-Gel was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C in coupling buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml recombinant subunit C. Following three further washing steps with coupling buffer, the beads were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in 4 ml of 20 mmethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) to block any remaining active esters. Ethanolamine-HCl was removed by washing the beads three times with 4 ml of 0.1 m MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 9.6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Cytoplasmic extracts from the midgut of fifth instar larvae were prepared as follows. Midgut tissue isolated from ten 5th instar larvae was washed three times in TEK buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl, 0.32 mm EDTA, 200 mmKCl, pH 8.1) and carefully broken up on ice in 4 ml of TEK buffer containing 5 mm Pefabloc (Biomol) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Insoluble cell compounds were removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. The remaining supernatant containing the cytosolic extract was supplemented with 9.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were incubated with 4 ml of the cytosolic extract by rotating the suspension slowly for 2 h at 4 °C. Unspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with 4 ml of 0.1 m MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 9.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. As a positive control, rabbit muscle actin (Cytoskeleton) was dissolved in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 24 μm and tested for binding to the beads as described above. For analyzing bound proteins, the beads were spun down in a microfuge, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 5% sucrose, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 1 min. Identification of actin was performed by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE using polyclonal antibodies directed to a highly conserved actin domain (Sigma, A-2066). The V1complex was purified according to Gräf et al. (23Gräf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) except for the presence of 25% methanol during the last purification step on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Bioscience), which led to complete removal of residual C subunits (24Huss M. Structure, Function, and Regulation of the Plasmamembrane V-ATPase from Manduca Sexta. University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany2001Google Scholar). Binding of recombinant subunit C to the C-depleted V1 complex was performed by incubating 100 μg of the V1 complex with a 10-fold molar excess of recombinant subunit C for 16 h at 4 °C in a buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 9.6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the V1 complex containing recombinant subunit C (V1C) was isolated by gel permeation chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. To analyze actin-binding properties, the V1 complex lacking subunit C as well as V1Cwere incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 200 nmof phalloidin-stabilized F-actin in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 1 h, the proteins in the pellet were quantified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The V1 complex and the V1V0 holoenzyme were purified from M. sexta larval midgut according to published protocols (23Gräf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20908-20913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Wieczorek H. Cioffi M. Klein U. Harvey W.R. Schweikl H. Wolfersberger M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recombinant subunit C was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified by nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography as described previously (6Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Amido Black method (26Schweikl H. Klein U. Schindlbeck M. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11136-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absolute protein concentrations were calculated based on the molar extinction coefficients of the proteins at 280 nm; respective absorption measurements were preceded by treatment of the proteins with 6m guanidine hydrochloride (27Price N.C. Engel P.C. Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 34-41Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunostaining were performed as described previously (25Wieczorek H. Cioffi M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15340-15347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The midgut epithelium of the tobacco hornworm consists of columnar cells forming an extensive microvillar brush border, goblet cells with large cavities, and pluripotent stem cells from which both cell types derive (29Cioffi M. Tissue Cell. 1979; 11: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The microvilli of columnar cells are supported by actin filaments that are arranged along their longitudinal axes. Because the goblet cell apical membrane is also organized in a microvillus-like fashion (30Klein U. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 345-354PubMed Google Scholar), we looked for actin filaments using FITC-labeled phalloidin that exclusively binds to F-actin. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), a strongly developed fluorescence signal was observed in the brush border membrane of columnar cells as had been observed previously (31Bonfanti P. Colombo A. Heintzelman M.B. Mooseker M.S. Camatini M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a previously unrecognized labeling in the region of goblet cell apical membranes was observed, although it was not as intense as the signal of the columnar cell brush border. Because it is known that V-ATPase resides in the goblet cell apical membranes, we also examined the subcellular V-ATPase distribution using the monoclonal antibody 221-9 to V-ATPase subunit A (22Klein U. Löffelmann G. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1991; 161: 61-75Google Scholar). As indicated by the yellow color of the merged images in themiddle panel of Fig. 1A and the right panel of Fig. 1B, V-ATPase co-localized with actin filaments at the goblet cell apical membrane. Apical brush border membranes of epithelial cells from Malpighian tubules and salivary glands, which are known to contain V-ATPase as well (1Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), also exhibited co-localization of V-ATPase and F-actin (Fig. 1, C andD). Thus, in all three cases where V-ATPase is present in the apical plasma membrane, it seems to be in a close neighborhood with bundled actin filaments of microvilli or with the loose network of actin filaments underneath the membrane. Co-localization of V-ATPase and F-actin suggested that the plasma membrane V-ATPase may be associated with the actin cytoskeleton. To examine this possibility, we performed in vitro co-pelleting assays using the purified V1V0 ATPase and F-actin from rabbit muscle. For this purpose, we used phalloidin-stabilized F-actin at a concentration which was below the critical concentration for actin polymerization. The critical concentration in our assays was about 0.4 μm, a value that is in good agreement with previously published concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm (32Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h, the proteins in the pellet were separated by SDS-PAGE and silver stained. In contrast to controls without actin, a significant portion of the holoenzyme was found in the pellet together with F-actin (Fig.2A). The same result was obtained when we used the purified V1 complex instead of the holoenzyme (Fig. 2B). In both cases, binding to F-actin was a saturable process. Our findings imply that both the holoenzyme and the V1 complex bind directly to F-actin. To evaluate the stoichiometries of the interaction with actin, we determined molar protein concentrations after co-pelleting, taking into account the known actin amounts of the pellet. Although actin appeared to exhibit a slightly higher (2–3-fold) affinity to the V1V0 holoenzyme as compared with the V1 complex, binding reached its saturation at concentrations of about 50 nm for both the V1V0 holoenzyme and the V1 complex if the concentration of F-actin monomers was 200 nm (Fig.2C). Thus, the molar ratio was estimated to be about 1 V-ATPase to 4–5 F-actin monomers. Because the V1V0 holoenzyme as well as the V1complex have more than 10-fold molecular masses as compared with the actin monomer, these results suggest that maximum binding capacity is limited, which is likely due to steric hindrance of F-actin binding to the V-ATPase. The determined stoichiometry was in the same range as those reported previously for the bovine V-ATPase, which was estimated to be 1:8 (19Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, Holliday et al. (20Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the bovine V-ATPase subunit B contains an F-actin binding site. To determine whether subunit B is responsible also for the binding of F-actin to theManduca V-ATPase, we performed overlay blots. For that purpose, we separated the subunits of the V1V0holoenzyme and the V1 complex by SDS-PAGE and stained them, after transfer onto nitrocellulose, with either Ponceau S or F-actin (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). Immunodetection of bound F-actin revealed a protein band of 56 kDa for both enzyme preparations, confirming that subunit B interacted with actin filaments. To our surprise, we found an additional polypeptide of ∼40 kDa in the V1V0holoenzyme preparation that was intensively labeled by anti-actin antibodies. Control reactions performed in the absence of F-actin showed no labeled protein bands (Fig. 3C). Based on the observed molecular mass, we assumed that the labeled polypeptide was the V1 subunit C, which we had identified previously to be part of the Manduca V-ATPase (6Merzendorfer H. Reineke S. Zhao X.F. Jacobmeier B. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because this subunit is present in preparations of the Manduca V1complex in substoichiometric amounts at the most (7Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V. Grüber G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17659-17663Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we were not astonished to observe labeling only in the V1V0holoenzyme. To confirm our assumption and to discriminate the labeled band from the V0 subunit d, which has a similar molecular mass (33Merzendorfer H. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we also tested the recombinant subunit C (Crec) for F-actin binding. As expected, Crec reacted with actin filaments in the overlay blots (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Moreover, it co-pelleted together with F-actin in a saturable manner (Fig. 4A). Estimation of the binding stoichiometry revealed a molar Crec/F-actin-monomer ratio of ∼1:1 (Fig. 4B).Figure 4Recombinant subunit C binds to F-actin.A, phalloidin-stabilized F-actin (200 nm) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of recombinant subunit C (Crec) for 2 h at room temperature.

Data were collected from three independent experiments and depicted as means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To date, we have demonstrated that subunit C of the purified V1V0 ATPase as well as the recombinant subunit C bind to rabbit muscle actin. However, binding between V-ATPase and actin may depend on the source of the microfilaments, although rabbit skeletal muscle actin shares more than 93% identical amino acids with Manduca non-muscle actin, whose sequence (submitted to the EMBL/GenBankTM data base under accession no. AJ519536) we have recently deduced from a λ-Zap clone isolated from a Manduca midgut cDNA library (34Gräf R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To confirm that subunit C also binds to Manduca non-muscle actin, we covalently coupled the recombinant subunit C to beads of Affi-Gel 10 and incubated them with a cytoplasmic extract from the larval midgut. SDS-PAGE of proteins attached to subunit C revealed one major band that was identified immunologically in a Western blot as actin (Fig. 5). Thus, we could show that Crec not only binds to rabbit muscle actin but also to non-muscle actin from the midgut of the tobacco hornworm. This finding also suggests that the described interaction between Crecand actin may occur in vivo in the Manducamidgut. The isolated V1 complex does not contain subunit C in significant amounts (see also Fig.2B) and thus lacks one of the F-actin binding subunits. Therefore we hypothesized that the evidently lower affinity of the V1 complex to F-actin as compared with that of the V1V0 holoenzyme (see Fig. 2C) might be due to the lack of subunit C. Because the V1 complex can be supplemented by incubation with Crec resulting in a V1C complex containing significant amounts of subunit C (Ref. 24Huss M. Structure, Function, and Regulation of the Plasmamembrane V-ATPase from Manduca Sexta. University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany2001Google Scholar; see also Fig. 6A), we tested the capability of V1C to bind F-actin. For this purpose, we performed F-actin co-pelleting assays with either the V1C complex or the V1 complex lacking subunit C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Rec"

Multiple models have been proposed for the ternary complex. However, major discrepancies exist among those models, and none of these models have evaluated the functional importance of the interacting regions on the HS chains. To resolve the discrepancies, we measured the size and molar ratio of HS in the complex and showed that both FGF1 and FGFR1 simultaneously interact with HS; therefore, a model of 2:2:2 FGF1·HS·FGFR1 was shown to fit the data. Using genetic and biochemical methods, we generated HSs that were defective in FGF1 and/or FGFR1 binding but could form the signaling ternary complex. Both genetically and chemically modified HSs were subsequently assessed in a BaF3 cell mitogenic activity assay. The ability of HS to support the ternary complex formation was found to be required for FGF1-stimulated cell proliferation. Our data also proved that specific critical groups and sites on HS support complex formation. Furthermore, the molar ratio of HS, FGF1, and FGFR1 in the ternary complex was found to be independent of the size of HS, which indicates that the selected model can take place on the cell surface proteoglycans. Finally, a mechanism for the FGF·FGFR signaling complex formation on cell membrane was proposed, where FGF and FGFR have their own binding sites on HS and a distinct ternary complex formation site is directly responsible for mitogenic activity.

Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Sulfation can occur at 2-O of the uronic acid and 3-O, 6-O, and N of thed-glucosamine and is catalyzed by a variety of sulfotransferases. Each modification is incomplete, which leads to sequence variation on HS, and it is very likely that critical sulfate groups determine the specificity of HS-protein interactions (2Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Along the HS chain, the majority of sulfated residues are clustered in short functional domains separated by relatively less sulfated oligosaccharide sequences (3Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Heparin resembles these functional domains and is widely used for the functional study of HS. One major function of HS is to interact with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) and form FGF·HS·FGFR signaling complexes (4Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P.

The involvement of HS in the FGF molecular signaling complex suggests that FGF activity and specificity may be modulated by HS and in turn by enzymes that synthesize and degrade HS. FGFs and FGFRs play critical roles in the control of many fundamental cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (10Schlessinger J.

Studies performed primarily on FGF2 have identified a stretch of basic residues in the polypeptide chain as participating in the heparin-binding site (15Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J.

The Ig domain I has been shown to be dispensable, and receptor variants containing only the Ig domain II and III (औ form) have been found to exhibit an equivalent degree of binding to FGFs as the variants containing all three domains (α form). Ig domain III can undergo differential splicing and thereby exhibits IIIb and IIIc forms (16Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). All receptors show redundant specificity for ligand binding (i.e. one receptor may bind to several FGFs, and one FGF may bind to more than one receptor) (12Galzie Z. Kinsella A.R. Smith J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). FGF1 interacts with almost all FGFRs, and FGFR1 is a common receptor for many ligands; thus, we have chosen FGF1 and FGFR1 to carry out our studies. Although the importance of HS in FGF signaling is well documented, the exact roles of HS in the signaling complex are less well characterized. One key issue concerns the minimum size of HS in the signaling complex. This size of HS reflects the spatial arrangement of FGF and FGFR in the complex; thus, this parameter is critical for modeling the FGFR signaling complex. Basically, there are three modes of interaction between multiple proteins and a single chain of HS (Fig. 1), designated as the cis, trans, and mix mode. Mix mode contains both cis and trans modes. Different modes of interaction require HS with different lengths to participate. So far, various models with different modes of HS-protein interactions and thus different HS length requirements have been proposed. For example, hexasaccharide (dp6) was found to be able to link two FGF1 in a trans mode (18DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, IV); dodecasaccharide (dp12) was thought to be the minimum length for linking one FGF2 and one FGFR1 in a cis mode (19Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1A, I); and hexadecasaccharide (dp16) was proposed to be able to fully span a heparin binding site created by a 2:2 FGF1·FGFR2 complex in a mix mode (Fig. 1C,VI) (20Stauber D.J. DiGabriele A.D. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the shortest biologically active heparin oligosaccharide has been reported to be an octasaccharide (dp8) (21Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), hexasaccharide (dp6) (22Gambarini A.G. Miyamoto C.A. Lima G.A. Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar), trisaccharide, or even disaccharide (dp2) (24Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These contradictory findings prompted us to design a more accurate method to determine the size of HS in FGFR signaling complex. A second key issue that remains controversial concerns the stoichiometry of HS in the FGF·FGFR signaling complex. Intracellular signaling is believed to be initiated from receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation (10Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 26Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), but models with different stoichiometry for HS and FGF have been proposed (Fig. 1). For example, a single HS chain binds one FGF and two FGFRs (27Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A,III); a single HS chain binds two FGFs, which in turn bind two FGFRs (18DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, IV); and one each of FGF, HS, and FGFR first form an FGF·HS·FGFR half-complex, two of which then dimerize (28Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) (Fig.1C, VII). Because the size of HS can be up to 150 disaccharide repeats, and only shorter oligosaccharides no more than 7 disaccharide repeats (dp14) were used for modeling study in most cases, one unresolved question is whether the models established with shorter oligosaccharides can be extended to the cell surface HS proteoglycans. HSs from different tissues or developmental stages have different fine structures (29Allen B.L. Filla M.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol.

It is believed that this phenomenon is caused by replacing of critical functional groups during the synthesis of the HSs (2Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin.

For example, 2-O sulfation at an iduronic acid was found critical for FGF2 binding (38Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 6-O-sulfation was found to be important for FGFR1 binding (37McKeehan W.L. Wu X. Kan M. J. Biol.

However, less information about the relationship between critical groups on HS mediating FGF·HS·FGFR ternary complex formation to the groups required for FGF or FGFR binding has been available. With in vitro modification of HS and a gel mobility shift assay (40Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have measured the minimum HS size and the molar ratio among FGF1, HS, and FGFR1 as a function of HS size and showed that both FGF1 and FGFR1 interact with HS in the complex. Based upon these results, we suggest that a 2:2:2 FGF1·HS·FGFR1 model best fits the data. In addition, utilizing a cell genetic study, we have found that there are different critical groups at different sites on HS involved in the ternary complex formation and FGF and FGFR binding interactions. We also find that the ability of HS to form a ternary complex with FGF1 and FGFR1 is a prerequisite for FGF1-stimulated mitogenic activity. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism showing how the FGF1·FGFR1 signaling complex is formed on HS cell surface proteoglycan. Heparin oligosaccharides (dp4 to dp24) were purchased from Iduron (Manchester, UK). Completely desulfated andN-sulfated heparin sulfate (DSNS) and completely desulfated and N-acetylated heparin (DSNAc) were from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA). FGF1 and FGFR1b (IIIc)/Fc were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). 3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate was fromCalbiochem. 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST-1) and 6-OST-1 were prepared as previously described (40Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The CHOpgsA-745 cell line and 6-O-desulfated heparin (6ODS) were kind gifts from Dr. Jeffrey D. Esko (University of California, San Diego). Preparation of35S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate, radiolabeling of HS, autoradiograph, and gel analysis were the same as previously described (40Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B.

The CHO-K1 cell line was from ATCC (Manassas, VA). 2-OST-deficient cell CHOpgsF-17 was prepared as described (41Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

Protein A, Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The heparin sample (20 mg) was digested with a mixture of heparinase and heparantinase I and II (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 ml of buffer of 2 mm Ca(Ac)2, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0. The digestion products were separated with a C18-reversed phase column (IPRP-HPLC) (Vydac, Lake Forest, CA). The sample was eluted with 2.5, 6, 10.5, 18, and 507 acetonitrile in 40 mmNH4H2PO4 and 1 mmtetrabutylammonium dihydrophosphate (Sigma) for 15, 15, 45, 25, and 20 min, respectively, and was monitored with light absorbance at 232 nm (41Zhang L.

The extracellular domain of FGFR1, including Ig domain II and IIIc (from residue 142 to 365) (42Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L.

Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) was PCR-cloned from a Human Placenta Quik-clone TM cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, California). The PCR forward primer was GATAACACCAAACCAAACCG, and the backward primer was CCTCTCTTCCAGGGCTTCCA. The PCR product was expressed in a pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion TM Expression System (Invitrogen). The expressed protein was a fusion protein with thioredoxin at the C-terminal and was refolded in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 107 glycerol, 1 mml-cysteine. For a typical 20-ॖl binding reaction, 1 ॖl of FGF1, 1 ॖl of FGFR1, and 0.1 ॖl of HS or heparin were added into an appropriate volume of binding buffer. The concentrations of FGF1, FGFR1, and HS were adjusted as needed before the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. The binding buffer contained 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm of MgCl2, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4 and 127 glycerol. Half of the reaction was loaded onto a native 4.57 polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 6 V/cm for 70 min. After the run, the gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to a phosphor imager plate. Suspension cultures of FGFR1a (IIIc)-expressing BaF3 cells (a generous gift from professor D. M. Ornitz) were maintained in AIM V medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5 nm recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (R&D Systems). For mitogenic assays, 50 ॖl of AIM V medium (serum-free) containing HSs and FGF-1 at final concentrations of 1 ॖg/ml and 5 nm, respectively, were plated into a 96-well assay plate. Cells were washed and resuspended in AIM V medium (serum-free), and 2,500 cells were added to each well for a total volume of 100 ॖl. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 57 CO2 for 24 h; afterward, 100 ॖl of Syto-11 dye (Molecular Probes), which was prepared in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The sample was excited at 508 nm, and the fluorescence emission at 527 nm was then measured using the SpectraMax Gemini XS (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The data were analyzed with Softmax software, and each data point presented was the average of a triplicate determination. Nearly confluent monolayers of cells in a T-75 flask were detached by adding 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 107 fetal bovine serum and 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged. The cell pellets were placed on ice. About 1 × 106 cells were first mixed with 20 ॖl of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4) and 1 ॖg of FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc, and then 4 ॖg of protein A-Alexa Fluor® 647 conjugate was added. Protein A binds to the Fc region of FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc. In a separate experiment, 0.5 ॖg of FGF1 was also added at this point. After 15 min of incubation, the cells were washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 300 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 107 fetal bovine serum. Flow cytometry was performed with FACScan and FACStar instruments (Becton Dickinson). Previously, we applied gel mobility shift assay to study antithrombin III/HS interaction (40Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The same method was applied to study FGF/HS/FGFR interactions. A ladder of defined lengths of oligosaccharides from dp2 to dp24 was first radiolabeled with 6-OST-1 sulfotransferases (40Wu Z.L. Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Kuberan B. Rosenberg R.D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and examined on a 157 PAGE gel (Fig.2A). The labeled ladder was then applied to gel mobility shift assays with FGF1 or FGFR1 (Fig.2B). FGF1 could bind to tetrasaccharide (dp4) and longer chains, whereas FGFR1 only showed significant binding to octasaccharide (dp8) and longer chains. The mobility of the binary complex FGF1·HS was greater than that of FGFR1·HS. When equivalents of FGF1 and FGFR1 were mixed with excess dp18 and applied to the assay, a distinct band, with mobility greater than FGFR1·HS but less than FGF1·HS, was observed (Fig. 3A), suggesting the formation of a ternary complex among FGF1, FGFR1, and HS. This ternary complex could be observed when the concentrations of FGF1 and FGFR1 were as low as 128 nm, although either no or less binary complexes of HS·FGFR1 and FGF1·HS could be observed at this concentration, suggesting the cooperative binding among HS, FGF, and FGFR. Cooperative binding is a characteristic of FGF·HS·FGFR ternary complex formation (44Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R.

After the sample was heated at 47 °C, the binary complex of HS·FGFR1 significantly decreased, whereas the binary complex of FGF1·HS was stable. Heating at 60 °C caused the disappearance of both of the binary complexes but not the ternary complex. Heating at 100 °C caused the disappearance of all of the complexes. This experiment suggests that the native state of the proteins is required for the ternary complex formation, and the order of the thermal stability of the complexes is FGF1·HS·FGFR1 > FGF1·HS > HS·FGFR1. To determine whether the observed ternary complex can form on cells with membrane HS proteoglycan under similar binding conditions, we carried out flow cytometry assays with CHO cells and FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc in the presence or absence of FGF1. FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc contained the same functional domains as the FGFR1 used in the gel shift assays, except for the inclusion of an Fc region of IgG. The binding of FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc to CHO cells was monitored (Fig. 3C). The HS-deficient CHOpgsA-745 cell showed no binding, even in the presence of FGF1. On the other hand, HS-expressing wild type CHO-K1 cells had weak binding, but this binding was greatly enhanced when FGF1 was added. These experiments suggest that FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc can bind to the HS proteoglycan on the cell membrane and form a much tighter ternary complex together with FGF1. Interestingly, a 2-OST-deficient cell CHOpgsF-17 did not bind to FGFR1औ (IIIc)/Fc alone but also showed a much stronger binding in the presence of FGF1, suggesting the formation of the ternary complex in the absence of 2-O-sulfation (Fig. 3C). To determine the minimum oligosaccharide that can initiate the ternary complex with FGF1 and FGFR1, the labeled ladder (Fig. 2A) was applied to a gel shift assay with both FGF1 and FGFR1 (Fig. 4A). The ternary complex could be observed with tetrasaccharide and larger oligosaccharides but not with disaccharide. To confirm the above observation, another gel was visualized with anti-FGF1 antibody (Fig. 4B). FGF1 had a low mobility in a native gel electrophoresis. The binding of HS to FGF1 added negative charges to FGF1, and the resulting FGF1·HS complex moved faster than the free FGF. The further addition of FGFR1 slowed FGF1·HS complex because of the formation of the ternary complex. The ternary complexes were observed with tetrasaccharide and longer oligosaccharides but not with disaccharide. This experiment confirmed that tetrasaccharide was the minimum HS required for the formation of a ternary complex of FGF1, HS, and FGFR1. First, we determined the ratio of FGF1 and FGFR1 in the ternary complex. In this experiment, a fixed amount of FGF1 but increasing amounts of FGFR1 were added to a series of binding reactions (Fig.5A). The bands of the ternary complexes were subjected to densitometry analysis (Fig. 5B), and the band density was plotted against the molar equivalents of FGFR1 to FGF1 (Fig. 5C). The slope of the curve declined sharply when FGFR1 was equivalent to FGF1, suggesting that FGF1 and FGFR1 have a 1:1 ratio in the ternary complex. The continuing increase in band intensity above equivalence might be caused by a shift of equilibrium, since excess FGFR1 (the reactant) generated more product (the ternary complex) formation and caused the disappearance of the FGF1·HS. At the level of 4 eq of FGFR1, there was almost no FGF1·HS observed. We further measured the molar ratio of HS in the ternary complex. In a series of binding reactions with the oligosaccharide ladder (Fig.1A), each reaction contained 250 ng of oligosaccharide (from dp4 to dp24), 16 pmol of FGF1, and 64 pmol of FGFR1. The 4:1 molar concentration ratio of FGFR1 to FGF1 overwhelmingly favored the formation of FGF1·HS·FGFR1, so that almost all the FGF1 was incorporated into the ternary complex (Fig. 5A). After electrophoresis, the amount of the oligosaccharide present in the ternary complex in each reaction was calculated by densitometry analysis, and the molar ratio between the oligosaccharide and FGF1 in the ternary complexes was then determined (see Table II). It was surprising to find that, independent of the size of HS, the ratio was consistently near 1:1. Considering the 1:1 ratio between FGF1 and FGFR1, this result suggests that the ternary complex has a molar ratio"
https://openalex.org/W1985329934,"The production of cAMP is controlled on many levels, notably at the level of cAMP synthesis by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. We have recently identified a new regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity, RGS2, which decreases cAMP accumulation when overexpressed in HEK293 cells and inhibits the in vitroactivity of types III, V, and VI adenylyl cyclase. In addition, RGS2 blocking antibodies lead to elevated cAMP levels in olfactory neurons. Here we examine the nature of the interaction between RGS2 and type V adenylyl cyclase. In HEK293 cells expressing type V adenylyl cyclase, RGS2 inhibited Gαs-Q227L- or β2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Deletion of the N-terminal 19 amino acids of RGS2 abolished its ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation and to bind adenylyl cyclase. Further mutational analysis indicated that neither the C terminus, RGS GAP activity, nor the RGS box domain is required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Alanine scanning of the N-terminal amino acids of RGS2 identified three residues responsible for the inhibitory function of RGS2. Furthermore, we show that RGS2 interacts directly with the C1 but not the C2domain of type V adenylyl cyclase and that the inhibition by RGS2 is independent of inhibition by Gαi. These results provide clear evidence for functional effects of RGS2 on adenylyl cyclase activity that adds a new dimension to an intricate signaling network.

Appropriate agonist-bound, heptahelical receptors activate Gs by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. The GTP-bound α subunit of Gs in turn activates AC, increasing the rate of synthesis of cyclic AMP from ATP (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 2Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All isoforms of mammalian AC are stimulated by the heterotrimeric G protein Gs. Many other regulatory influences including RGS (regulators of Gprotein signaling) proteins have crucial effects on various AC isoforms (3Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These enzymes thus serve critical roles as integrators of diverse inputs. RGS2 is a 211-amino acid protein that like other members of this family mediates its GAP activity via its core domain (4Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using recombinant RGS2 and membranes prepared from insect cells (Sf9) expressing different AC isoforms indicate that RGS2 suppresses the activity of AC III, the predominant isotype in the olfactory system, and the cardiac isoforms, V and VI (3Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). RGS2 has also been shown to decrease cAMP accumulation in βTC3 insulinoma cells (7Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). When added to purified recombinant type V AC cytoplasmic domains, recombinant RGS2 decreases cAMP production stimulated by either Gαs or forskolin. The structural basis for the inhibitory effect of RGS2 remains unknown, although it is likely a direct effect. In vivo, odorant-elicited cAMP stimulation resulted in the opening of cyclic nucleotide gated channels. The microinjection of RGS2 antibody into olfactory neurons dramatically augments the currents observed in whole cell voltage clamp recordings of odorant-stimulated olfactory neurons. These results indicate that the level of RGS2 in an olfactory neuron may regulate the responsiveness of that neuron to olfactory stimulants (3Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This study provided evidence for a novel role of RGS proteins as direct regulators of AC activity. The mechanisms for RGS2 regulation are as yet unclear (8Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RGS2 by protein kinase C decreases its capacity to negatively regulate phospholipase Cβ activation (9Cunningham M.L. Waldo G.L. Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Signal-induced redistribution may also regulate RGS2 function (10Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and have important effects on cellular signaling. RGS2 shares with RGS4 and RGS16 a conserved N-terminal domain that is necessary and sufficient for plasma membrane targeting (10Heximer S.P. Lim H. Bernard J.L. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14195-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Until recently, most reports of the intracellular localization of members of the RGS family of proteins have found them to be associated with the membrane fraction or distributed between the membrane and cytosolic fractions (11Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

In human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells, increases in cAMP and phosphoinositide signaling gives rise to a rapid and transient increase in RGS2 expression (15Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Harkins L. Cobbs C.S. Jope R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In these cells both endogenous and transfected RGS2 is found largely, although not entirely, localized in the nucleus (15Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Harkins L. Cobbs C.S. Jope R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the localization of RGS2 may in fact be controlled in ways not yet appreciated. The list of non-G protein-binding partners for RGS proteins continues to grow (8Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan B.M.

It remains to be determined whether interactions of RGS2 with Gαq/11, Gαi, AC, and coat protein (β-COP) can explain the putative roles for RGS2 in control of behavior, T cell function, and synaptic development in hippocampal CA1 neurons as revealed by RGS2-deficient mice (17Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J.

In addition, we report the nature of the AC-binding site on RGS2. The anti-HA (hemagglutinin A) and Ni-NTA-horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Qiagen, respectively. Anti-Gαi, anti-Gαs, and anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-RGS2 antiserum was generated in rabbits against a C-terminal peptide (PQITTEPHAT) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin followed by affinity purification using immunizing peptide. Goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was obtained from Bio-Rad, and sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase was from Amersham Biosciences. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and all other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The cyclic AMP enzyme immunoassay kit was purchased from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). The expression vector for Gαs-Q227L was provided by S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health), and the expression vector for RGS2 has been described (18Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

RGS2 N-terminal truncations were created using PCR by deletion of DNA encoding amino acid residues 1–19 (ΔNT1), 1–39 (ΔNT2), and 1–62 (ΔNT3). All of the truncations contain an N-terminal initiating methionine and were created using the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). RGS2-ΔBox was created by deletion of DNA encoding amino acid residues 72–211 employing the following forward and reverse primers, 5′-GCCACCATGCAAAGTGCTATG-3′ and 5′-GTTGCGGCCGCTACTTGATGAAAGCTTGCTGTTG-3′. RGS2-ΔC was constructed by deleting the last 12 residues at the C terminus of RGS2. Mutations within RGS2 were generated using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Asparagine at position 149 of RGS2 was mutated to alanine using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCCAAAAGAGATAGCCATAGATTTTCAAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTGAAAATCTATGGCTATCTCTTTTGGAGC-3′. Four mutants were generated in the first 19 amino acids at the N terminus of RGS2, namely RGS2-MFL, RGS2-VQH, RGS2-DCR, and RGS2-PMD (see Fig. 6 A). Residues MFL, VQH, DCR, and PMD were mutated to alanine using the following oligonucleotides: for RGS2-MFL, 5′-ATGCAAAGTGCTGCGGCCGCGGCTGTTCAACAC-3′ and 5′-CGTGTTGAACAGCCGCGGCCGCAGCACTTTGCAT-3′; for RGS2-VQH, 5′-GCTATGTTCTTGGCTGCTGCTGCTGACTGCAGACCCATG-3′ and 5′-CATGGGTCTGCAGTCAGCAGCAGCAGCCAAGAACATAGC-3′; for RGS2-DCR, 5′-GGCTGTTCAACACGCCGCCGCACCCATGGACAAGAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTTGTCCATGGGTGCGGCGGCGTGTTGAACAGCC-3′; and for RGS2-PMD, 5′-ACACGACTGCAGAGCCGCGGCCAAGAGCGCAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCGCTCTTGGCCGCGGCTCTGCAGTCGTGT-3′. The veracity of all of the DNA constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing. A schematic showing the expected RGS proteins expressed from the constructs used is shown (Fig. 1). All of the RGS2 plasmids and Gαs-Q227L were tagged at their C termini, with the exception of two mutants of RGS2, Δ box (Δ72–211) and ΔC (Δ199–211), which were tagged at the N terminus with three copies of the HA epitope. Wild type RGS2 was obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center.Figure 1Representation of truncated RGS2 constructs. Wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient expression of proteins, subconfluent HEK293 cells were plated on 6-well plates and transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol with constructs expressing either β2-adrenergic receptor (0.5 μg/well) or Gαs-Q227L (0.5 μg/well) along with RGS2 (1.0 μg/well) and type V AC (0.2 μg/well). The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used to normalize all of the DNA concentrations to 1.7 μg/well. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were starved overnight in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, followed by starvation in medium devoid of serum for 2 h. To measure cAMP accumulation in cells transfected with Gαs-Q227L or corresponding control DNA constructs, the cells were treated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 15 min and subsequently harvested in 250 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors). A portion of the cell lysate (50 μl) was used for Western blotting to monitor protein expression, and the remaining lysate was boiled for 10 min at 100 °C and spun at 14000 ×g for 10 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was used to measure the total cAMP accumulation by cAMP enzyme immunoassay detection. For β2-adrenergic receptor activation and corresponding controls, the cells were treated with isoproterenol (0.1 μm) for 15 min before subsequent harvesting, lysis, and cAMP detection. The data are represented as the means ± S.E., and statistical significance is determined by Student's t test (p < 0.05 is considered significant). The cell lysates were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and sonicated. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The protein expression levels were determined by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. RGS2 polymerase chain fragments digested with BspHI and BamHI were inserted in-frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag in pQE60 usingNcoI and BamHI. The proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified under nondenaturing conditions using Ni-NTA-agarose beads (24Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The purified protein fractions were dialyzed in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 200 mmNaCl, pooled, concentrated, and stored at −70 °C. Type V AC domains were expressed with an N-terminal (VC2) or C-terminal (VC1) hexahistidine tag and purified as previously described (25Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GST-VC1 was purified using glutathione affinity resin. BL21(DE3) cells containing the GST-VC1expression plasmid were grown at 30 °C in T7 medium until theA 600 reached 1.0. Synthesis of GST-VC1 was induced with 0.5 mmisopropylthiogalactoside, and incubation continued for 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 120 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors prior to incubation with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C and then subsequent incubation with 5 mmMgCl2 and DNase (0.01 mg/ml) for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was applied to a glutathione column, which was first washed with lysis buffer containing 400 mm NaCl (25 column volumes) followed by lysis buffer without NaCl (5 column volumes). The protein was eluted with 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 12 mm glutathione. The protein was then concentrated and dialyzed overnight in elution buffer lacking glutathione. All G protein α subunits were synthesized in E. coli and purified as described (26Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified α subunits were activated by incubation with [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 min (Gαs) or 2 h (Gαi) (21Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Free GTPγS was removed by gel filtration. Adenoviruses for RGS2 and RGS4 were generated as described (28McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 29Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-128Google Scholar). RGS2 and RGS4 were cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pACsk2.cmv using the restriction enzymes KpnI and XbaI. Both constructs contained C-terminal HA tags. To obtain recombinant viruses, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the recombinant shuttle vector and pJM17. Viral plaques were isolated and propagated, and viral DNA was sequenced. HEK293 cells (∼70% confluent) were infected with HA-tagged RGS2 and RGS4 adenoviruses (multiplicity of infection = 2). The cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested 24 h post-infection in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were subjected to 50 strokes of Dounce homogenization on ice, followed by low speed centrifugation for 5 min to eliminate cellular debris, and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was checked for RGS protein expression using anti-HA antibody and used for AC binding assays as described below. Note that the high overexpression resulting from adenoviral expression often leads to a doublet for both RGS2 and RGS4. This is most likely due to proteolytic cleavage of the triple HA tag present at the C terminus. This does not occur with lowered expression of RGS2 and RGS4 in transient transfections. Pull-down assays were conducted with pure recombinant proteins as well as with HEK293 cell lysates. The lysates were obtained by infecting cells with recombinant adenoviruses encoding RGS2 or RGS4 or by transfecting subconfluent HEK293 cells with constructs expressing wild type or mutant RGS2. Cells at 36 h post-transfection were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 300 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors), followed by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation to remove cellular debris. The lysates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing RGS proteins (50 μg) were incubated with 15 μg of VC1(670)-H6 or H6-VC2 for 30 min and then layered over Ni-NTA-agarose beads. When purified RGS proteins were utilized, GST or GST-VC1 (15 μg) was first bound to glutathione beads. The beads were then washed and mixed with H6-RGS2 or H6-RGS4 (2 μm). The reactions were incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C on a rotating mixer, washed twice with wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% C12E10), boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE (13% gel), and analyzed by immunoblotting employing the appropriate antibody. HEK293 cells (∼70% confluent) were transfected with wild type, mutant, or truncated RGS2 constructs. After 36 h, the cells were harvested, briefly sonicated, and subjected to a low speed spin to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The lysate was then subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min to separate membranes and cytosol. The crude membranes thus obtained were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-HA antibody for detection of RGS2 distribution in the cytosol and membrane. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured as described (30Dessauer C.W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2. A limiting concentration of the full-length C1 domain from type V adenylyl cyclase was reconstituted with the C2 domain (final concentration, 0.5 μm) in buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (21Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). RGS proteins or control buffer were preincubated with adenylyl cyclase domains for 20 min on ice, followed by the addition of GTPγS-Gαs and 0.5 mm[α-32P]ATP to start the reaction. The reactions were terminated after 10 min, and the products were separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex-50 and Al2O3. Mammalian AC consists of a short N terminus, a set of six transmembrane spans, a cytoplasmic domain (designated C1), followed by a second set of six transmembrane spans, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (C2) (2Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the activities of types III, V, and VI AC reported earlier (3Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) could be attributed to the direct binding of RGS2 with either cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme. To demonstrate that RGS2 directly binds to AC, we performed binding assays using hexahistidine-tagged C1 and C2 domains of type V AC. These cytoplasmic domains are fully active when reconstituted with each other and retain most of the properties of the native enzyme (21Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Yan S.Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.H. Tang W.-J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An excess of His-tagged C1 and C2domains from type V AC were incubated with HEK293 extracts containing C-terminal HA-tagged RGS2 or RGS4 (Fig.2 A). Nontagged GTPγS-Gαi or GTPγS-Gαs were used as positive controls for the C1 and C2 domains, respectively. Ni-NTA resin was used to pull down the interacting proteins that were eluted with SDS sample buffer, followed by immunoblotting for the respective proteins. Approximately 30% of the HA-tagged RGS2 present in the HEK293 extracts was bound to the C1 domain of type V AC. No binding of RGS4 to the C1 domain was observed, although the C1 domain tightly bound Gαi. Neither RGS2 nor RGS4 bound to Ni-NTA beads alone or to the C2 domain, although this protein was capable of binding Gαs (22Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the above experiment utilized HEK293 extracts, it was still possible that a second protein was required to mediate this binding event. Therefore, we tested the direct interaction of E. coli purified His-tagged RGS proteins with the C1domain fused to GST versus GST alone. Glutathione resin was used to pull down the interacting proteins that were detected by immunoblotting with the Ni-NTA-horseradish peroxidase antibody or an antibody directed against GST. Because of the limited expression of GST-VC1, an excess of purified RGS proteins was used in these reactions. RGS2 associated with GST-VC1 but not with GST alone (Fig. 2 B). No interaction was observed with RGS4. These results further support our hypothesis of a direct interaction between RGS2 with type V AC. Previous studies have shown that RGS2 inhibits Gαs-induced type III AC activation in vivo(3Sinnarajah S. Dessauer C.W. Srikumar D. Chen J. Yuen J. Yilma S. Dennis J.C. Morrison E.E. Vodyanoy V. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To verify that RGS2 inhibits Gαs-induced type V activation in vivo, we transfected HEK293 cells with the expression vectors for type V AC and a GTPase-deficient form of Gαs, Gαs-Q227L, in the presence or absence of RGS2. Co-expression of Gαs-Q227L and type V AC increased cAMP accumulation 3-fold (Fig.3 A). Additional expression of RGS2 reduced Gαs-Q227L-stimulated cAMP accumulation to near basal levels. A similar result was obtained with nontagged RGS2, ruling out any possible unwarranted effects of the HA tag (data not shown). The inhibition by RGS2 is unusual because many RGS proteins including RGS1, RGS4, and GAIP have no effect or show increased cAMP accumulation (34Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P.

Here, we identify the arginine/serine-rich SRp30c protein as an interacting protein of YB-1 by performing a two-hybrid screen against a human mesangial cell cDNA library. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirm a direct interaction of tagged proteins YB-1 and SRp30c in the absence of RNA via two independent protein domains of YB-1. A high affinity interaction is conferred through the N-terminal region. We show that the subcellular YB-1 localization is dependent on the cellular SRp30c content. In proliferating cells, YB-1 localizes to the cytoplasm, whereas FLAG-SRp30c protein is detected in the nucleus. After overexpression of YB-1 and FLAG-SRp30c, both proteins are co-localized in the nucleus, and this requires the N-terminal region of YB-1. Heat shock treatment of cells, a condition under which SRp30c accumulates in stress-induced Sam68 nuclear bodies, abrogates the co-localization and YB-1 shuttles back to the cytoplasm. Finally, the functional relevance of the YB-1/SRp30c interaction for in vivo splicing is demonstrated in the E1A minigene model system. Here, changes in splice site selection are detected, that is, overexpression of YB-1 is accompanied by preferential 5' splicing site selection and formation of the 12 S isoform."

The goal of the present study was to further understand the sequence of events that leads to the formation of a functional cadherin-catenin-p120ctn complex.Cadherins are synthesized as precursor proteins that must be proteolytically cleaved to generate functional, mature proteins (20Posthaus H. Dubois C.M. Laprise M.H. Grondin F. Suter M.M. Muller E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,21Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). All of the classical cadherins have similar proteolytic cleavage sites within the proregion, suggesting that each is processed by proteases with similar specificities. Ozawa and Kemler (21Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) showed that mutant forms of E-cadherin missing the proteolytic cleavage sites were transported to the cell surface when transfected into cadherin-negative cells but were not active in cell-cell adhesion. These precursor forms could be converted to active molecules by exogenous cleavage of the proregion at the cell surface. An emerging idea in the cadherin field is that cadherin family members promote cell type-specific phenotypes. For example, we have presented evidence suggesting that N-cadherin expression can promote motility in epithelial cells, whereas E-cadherin suppresses motility in the same cells (22Islam S. Carey T.E. Wolf G.T. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1643-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 23Kim J.B. Islam S. Kim Y.J. Prudoff R.S. Sass K.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J.

To facilitate these studies, we developed monoclonal antibodies against the proregion of N-cadherin that would allow us to define the sequence of events that occur during the synthesis, processing, and transport to the cell surface of an endogenous N-cadherin-catenin-p120ctn complex.DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to investigate endogenous N-cadherin processing and cadherin-catenin complex formation. We chose to use HeLa cells that endogenously express N-cadherin and catenins and form N-cadherin-containing cell-cell junctions. To monitor the processing of N-cadherin, we generated monoclonal antibodies specific for the proregion of N-cadherin. Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cell extracts with the proN-cadherin antibodies revealed two major bands. Immunoblots of extracts prepared from other cells expressing endogenous N-cadherin (HT1080 and VA13) gave similar results (data not shown). Metabolic labeling of HeLa cell cultures with 33P identified the faster migrating form of proN-cadherin as a non-phosphorylated form and the slower migrating form as a phosphorylated form. In pulse-chase experiments, the earliest (non-phosphorylated) form of proN-cadherin that we could detect rapidly chased into the slower migrating (phosphorylated) form. It was this slower migrating form that co-immunoprecipitated with औ-catenin and plakoglobin. In addition to the experiments with HeLa cells, the experiments with the N/E5a-myc chimeric cadherin showed that catenins could associate with cadherins that are in the endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of proN-cadherin and the subsequent assembly of the cadherin-catenin complex occurs while the cadherin is in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Fig. 8 presents a model depicting the sequence of events leading to N-cadherin-catenin complex localization at the plasma membrane.The proregion of cadherins must be removed in order to generate functional adhesion molecules (21Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, Ozawa (32Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) used L cells to show that the proregion of E-cadherin not only prevented cell aggregation (which requires the formation of adhesion dimers) but also prevented the formation of lateral dimers. The fact that we found catenins complexed with proN-cadherin suggests that the catenins can load onto the monomeric form of this cadherin. Because our pulse-chase experiments showed that the earliest detectible form of proN-cadherin chases into a slower migrating form that co-immunoprecipitates all the catenins, it is likely that the proN-cadherin-catenin complex forms in the endoplasmic reticulum.The furin subgroup of subtilisin-like proprotein convertases is thought to be responsible for cadherin processing. E-cadherin has been shown to be a furin protease substrate in a baculovirus system, and the consensus sequence for furin protease in E-cadherin is identical to that of N-cadherin (20Posthaus H. Dubois C.M. Laprise M.H. Grondin F. Suter M.M. Muller E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The furin convertases have been shown to be proteolytically active in the trans-Golgi network (33Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our immunofluorescence experiments using anti-proN-cadherin antibodies revealed a staining pattern consistent with proN-cadherin localization to the ER and Golgi network. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a 15-kDa fragment, corresponding to the cleaved proregion, was present in HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that the proregion of N-cadherin can be removed in one step, most likely by the furin convertases. The detection of the 15-kDa pro-peptide raises the possibility that it could be secreted and may have some yet to be identified function outside the cell. In permeabilization experiments, proN-cadherin was not present at the plasma membrane of HeLa cells, consistent with the proregion of N-cadherin being removed prior to transport to the plasma membrane.Studies focusing on E-cadherin-catenin complex formation in L cells suggested that α-catenin was added to the cadherinऔ-catenin complex after the cadherin proregion was removed (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on the assembly of E-cadherin complexes in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells suggested that α-catenin was added to the adherens junction complex after localization at the plasma membrane (31Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that this is not the case for N-cadherin in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitations showed that औ-catenin, plakoglobin, p120ctn, and α-catenin were all found in a complex with proN-cadherin. The studies with E-cadherin raise the possibility that, although we could find the catenins associated with proN-cadherin, only a small fraction of the total proN-cadherin is actually complexed with the catenins. However, the experiment shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the association of α-catenin with proN-cadherin is not a rare event; the α-catenin-proN-cadherin complex has the same stoichiometry as the α-catenin-mature N-cadherin complex. The cadherin-औ-catenin-α-catenin complex has been estimated to have molar ratios of 1:1:1 (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), a conclusion that is supported by recent structural studies (34Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 35Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is likely that proN-cadherin binds the catenins in the same ratios as does mature N-cadherin.To date, p120ctn association with unprocessed cadherin has not been investigated. Our data show that p120ctn, but not औ-catenin or plakoglobin, can bind to non-phosphorylated proN-cadherin, which is the earliest form of N-cadherin we can detect. Taken together, our results suggest a model where, following synthesis, proN-cadherin associates immediately with p120ctn. Following phosphorylation of the cadherin, possibly by casein kinase II (36Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), औ-catenin or plakoglobin then associates with the cadherin (Fig. 8). Our data also show that औ-catenin-α-catenin complexes can form in the cytosol, raising the possibility that औ-catenin and α-catenin may simultaneously load onto proN-cadherin. The complex is then transported to the plasma membrane where linkage to the actin cytoskeleton occurs. The mechanism of cadherin-catenin complex transport to the plasma membrane is unknown, although recent work suggests a microtubule-dependent mechanism for the formation of N-cadherin cell-cell contacts (37Mary S. Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Travo P. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Understanding the sequence of events leading to the formation of the N-cadherin-catenin complex and its localization at the plasma membrane will help clarify the regulation of N-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion and identify new mechanisms for controlling N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.

Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recently, Ozawa (32Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19600-19608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) used L cells to show that the proregion of E-cadherin not only prevented cell aggregation (which requires the formation of adhesion dimers) but also prevented the formation of lateral dimers. The fact that we found catenins complexed with proN-cadherin suggests that the catenins can load onto the monomeric form of this cadherin. Because our pulse-chase experiments showed that the earliest detectible form of proN-cadherin chases into a slower migrating form that co-immunoprecipitates all the catenins, it is likely that the proN-cadherin-catenin complex forms in the endoplasmic reticulum.The furin subgroup of subtilisin-like proprotein convertases is thought to be responsible for cadherin processing. E-cadherin has been shown to be a furin protease substrate in a baculovirus system, and the consensus sequence for furin protease in E-cadherin is identical to that of N-cadherin (20Posthaus H. Dubois C.M. Laprise M.H. Grondin F. Suter M.M. Muller E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The furin convertases have been shown to be proteolytically active in the trans-Golgi network (33Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our immunofluorescence experiments using anti-proN-cadherin antibodies revealed a staining pattern consistent with proN-cadherin localization to the ER and Golgi network. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a 15-kDa fragment, corresponding to the cleaved proregion, was present in HeLa cell extracts, suggesting that the proregion of N-cadherin can be removed in one step, most likely by the furin convertases. The detection of the 15-kDa pro-peptide raises the possibility that it could be secreted and may have some yet to be identified function outside the cell. In permeabilization experiments, proN-cadherin was not present at the plasma membrane of HeLa cells, consistent with the proregion of N-cadherin being removed prior to transport to the plasma membrane.Studies focusing on E-cadherin-catenin complex formation in L cells suggested that α-catenin was added to the cadherinऔ-catenin complex after the cadherin proregion was removed (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on the assembly of E-cadherin complexes in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells suggested that α-catenin was added to the adherens junction complex after localization at the plasma membrane (31Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that this is not the case for N-cadherin in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitations showed that औ-catenin, plakoglobin, p120ctn, and α-catenin were all found in a complex with proN-cadherin. The studies with E-cadherin raise the possibility that, although we could find the catenins associated with proN-cadherin, only a small fraction of the total proN-cadherin is actually complexed with the catenins. However, the experiment shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates that the association of α-catenin with proN-cadherin is not a rare event; the α-catenin-proN-cadherin complex has the same stoichiometry as the α-catenin-mature N-cadherin complex. The cadherin-औ-catenin-α-catenin complex has been estimated to have molar ratios of 1:1:1 (30Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), a conclusion that is supported by recent structural studies (34Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 35Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is likely that proN-cadherin binds the catenins in the same ratios as does mature N-cadherin.To date, p120ctn association with unprocessed cadherin has not been investigated. Our data show that p120ctn, but not औ-catenin or plakoglobin, can bind to non-phosphorylated proN-cadherin, which is the earliest form of N-cadherin we can detect. Taken together, our results suggest a model where, following synthesis, proN-cadherin associates immediately with p120ctn. Following phosphorylation of the cadherin, possibly by casein kinase II (36Lickert H. Bauer A. Kemler R. Stappert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), औ-catenin or plakoglobin then associates with the cadherin (Fig. 8). Our data also show that औ-catenin-α-catenin complexes can form in the cytosol, raising the possibility that औ-catenin and α-catenin may simultaneously load onto proN-cadherin. The complex is then transported to the plasma membrane where linkage to the actin cytoskeleton occurs. The mechanism of cadherin-catenin complex transport to the plasma membrane is unknown, although recent work suggests a microtubule-dependent mechanism for the formation of N-cadherin cell-cell contacts (37Mary S. Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Travo P. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Understanding the sequence of events leading to the formation of the N-cadherin-catenin complex and its localization at the plasma membrane will help clarify the regulation of N-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion and identify new mechanisms for controlling N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. The goal of the present study was to investigate endogenous N-cadherin processing and cadherin-catenin complex formation. We chose to use HeLa cells that endogenously express N-cadherin and catenins and form N-cadherin-containing cell-cell junctions. To monitor the processing of N-cadherin, we generated monoclonal antibodies specific for the proregion of N-cadherin. Immunoblot analysis of HeLa cell extracts with the proN-cadherin antibodies revealed two major bands. Immunoblots of extracts prepared from other cells expressing endogenous N-cadherin (HT1080 and VA13) gave similar results (data not shown). Metabolic labeling of HeLa cell cultures with 33P identified the faster migrating form of proN-cadherin as a non-phosphorylated form and the slower migrating form as a phosphorylated form. In pulse-chase experiments, the earliest (non-phosphorylated) form of proN-cadherin that we could detect rapidly chased into the slower migrating (phosphorylated) form. It was this slower migrating form that co-immunoprecipitated with औ-catenin and plakoglobin. In addition to the experiments with HeLa cells, the experiments with the N/E5a-myc chimeric cadherin showed that catenins could associate with cadherins that are in the endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of proN-cadherin and the subsequent assembly of the cadherin-catenin complex occurs while the cadherin is in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex.

https://openalex.org/W2070352761,"l-Type calcium channels are multiprotein complexes composed of pore-forming (CaV1.2) and modulatory auxiliary alpha2delta- and beta-subunits. We demonstrate expression of two different isoforms for the beta2-subunit (beta2a, beta2b) and the beta3-subunit (beta3a, beta3trunc) in human non-failing and failing ischemic myocardium. Quantitatively, in the left ventricle expression of beta2b transcripts prevails in the order of > beta3 >> beta2a. The expressed cardiac full-length beta3-subunit is identical to the beta3a-isoform, and beta3trunc results from deletion of exon 6 (20 nn) entailing a reading frameshift and translation stop at nucleotide position 495. In failing ischemic myocardium beta3trunc expression increases whereas overall beta3 expression remains unchanged. Heterologous coexpression studies demonstrated that beta2 induced larger currents through rabbit and human cardiac CaV1.2 pore subunits than beta3 isoforms. All beta-subunits increased channel availability at single channel level, but beta2 exerted an additional, marked stimulation of rapid gating (open and closed times, first latency), leading to higher peak current values. We conclude that cardiac beta-subunit isoforms differentially modulate calcium inward currents because of regulatory effects within the channel protein complex. Moreover, differences in the various beta-subunit gene products present in human heart might account for altered single channel behavior found in human heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2038430130,"Altered chondrocyte differentiation, including development of chondrocyte hypertrophy, mediates osteoarthritis and pathologic articular cartilage matrix calcification. Similar changes in endochondral chondrocyte differentiation are essential for physiologic growth plate mineralization. In both articular and growth plate cartilages, chondrocyte hypertrophy is associated with up-regulated expression of certain protein-crosslinking enzymes (transglutaminases (TGs)) including the unique dual-functioning TG and GTPase TG2. Here, we tested if TG2 directly mediates the development of chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. To do so, we employed normal bovine chondrocytes and mouse knee chondrocytes from recently described TG2 knockout mice, which are phenotypically normal. We treated chondrocytes with the osteoarthritis mediator IL-1β, with the all-trans form of retinoic acid (ATRA), which promotes endochondral chondrocyte hypertrophy and pathologic calcification, and with C-type natriuretic peptide, an essential factor in endochondral development. IL-1β and ATRA induced TG transamidation activity and calcification in wild-type but not in TG2 (–/–) mouse knee chondrocytes. In addition, ATRA induced multiple features of hypertrophic differentiation (including type X collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and MMP-13), and these effects required TG2. Significantly, TG2 (–/–) chondrocytes lost the capacity for ATRA-induced expression of Cbfa1, a transcription factor necessary for ATRA-induced chondrocyte hypertrophy. Finally, C-type natriuretic peptide, which did not modulate TG activity, comparably promoted Cbfa1 expression and hypertrophy (without associated calcification) in TG2 (+/+) and TG2 (–/–) chondrocytes. Thus, distinct TG2-independent and TG2-dependent mechanisms promote Cbfa1 expression, articular chondrocyte hypertrophy, and calcification. TG2 is a potential site for intervention in pathologic calcification promoted by IL-1β and ATRA.

TG2 is a potential site for intervention in pathologic calcification promoted by IL-1β and ATRA. In physiologic endochondral growth plate mineralization, chondrocytes undergo a multi-step differentiation process in which there is ordered progression from a resting to proliferative state followed by maturation to a terminally differentiated hypertrophic state (1Erlebacher A. Filvaroff E.H. Gitelman S.E. Derynck R. Cell. 1995; 80: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Hypertrophic chondrocytes are specialized to remodel and mineralize their matrix (2Alini M. Kofsky Y. Wu W. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For example, hypertrophic chondrocytes demonstrate up-regulated expression of MMP-13, a mediator of matrix degradation in osteoarthritis (OA) 1The abbreviations used are: OA, osteoarthritis; AP, alkaline phosphatase; ATRA, all-trans form of retinoic acid; Cbfa1, core binding factor alpha 1; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; NPP, nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TG, transglutaminase; RT, reverse transcription; FXIIIA, factor XIIIA.1The abbreviations used are: OA, osteoarthritis; AP, alkaline phosphatase; ATRA, all-trans form of retinoic acid; Cbfa1, core binding factor alpha 1; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; NPP, nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TG, transglutaminase; RT, reverse transcription; FXIIIA, factor XIIIA. (3Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 31-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, hypertrophic chondrocytes demonstrate altered patterns of collagen subtype generation that include stereotypic up-regulated type X collagen expression, and hypertrophic chondrocytes show markedly increased release of mineralization-competent secretory vesicles (2Alini M. Kofsky Y. Wu W. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, hypertrophic chondrocytes demonstrate increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and other alterations in the metabolism of Pi and PPi (4Gerstenfeld L.C. Shapiro F.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Alini M. Carey D. Hirata S. Grynpas M.D. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this context, Pi and PPi mediate both calcification and growth plate organization (5Hessle L. Johnson K.A. Anderson H.C. Narisawa S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Terkeltaub R. Millan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), and Pi promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy (6Alini M. Carey D. Hirata S. Grynpas M.D. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast to chondrocytes in growth plate cartilage, chondrocytes in normal articular cartilage remain largely in a resting state and do not undergo terminal differentiation or mineralize their matrix (7Goldring M.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). But in OA, foci of articular chondrocyte hypertrophy develop, typically near sites of cartilage surface lesions (8Poole A.R. Matsui Y. Hinek A. Lee E.R. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9von der Mark K. Kirsch T. Nerlich A. Kuss A. Weseloh G. Gluckert K. Stoss H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte hypertrophy in OA may function partly to modulate matrix remodeling and repair (10Vignon E. Arlot M. Hartmann D. Moyen B. Ville G. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1983; 42: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and partly to promote calcification, as hypertrophic chondrocytes are commonly co-localized with deposits of hydroxyapatite and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the disease (11Ishikawa K. Masuda I. Ohira T. Yokoyama M. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 1989; 71: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Significantly, deposits of hydroxyapatite and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals crystals can stimulate intra-articular inflammation and further damage to cartilage in OA (12McCarthy G.M. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 1999; 1: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 13Terkeltaub R.A. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 411-415PubMed Google Scholar). One of the shared features of hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth plate and articular cartilages is up-regulated expression of two transglutaminase (TG) isoenzymes (14Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These are factor XIIIA (FXIIIA), a distinct tissue homodimeric form of the circulating heterotetrameric coagulation factor XIII, and TG2 (also termed tissue TG and Gh), which is unique among the human TG isoenzymes in being a dual function TG and GTPase/ATPase (16Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). TGs catalyze a calcium-dependent transamidation reaction that produces covalent cross-linking of available substrate glutamine residues to a primary amino group (EC 2.3.2.13). TGs thereby can modify the matrix through effects including protein cross-linking and stabilization (16Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and OA cartilage contains a variety of potential TG substrates including several collagen subtypes, fibronectin, and the mineralization-regulatory protein osteopontin (17Kaartinen M.T. El-Maadawy S. Rasanen N.H. McKee M.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 2161-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TG transamidation catalytic activity has been shown to increase in both an OA severity-dependent and age-dependant manner in joint cartilages (18Rosenthal A.K. Derfus B.A. Henry L.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Pritzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 149-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We recently observed that certain mediators implicated in OA, including IL-1β (20Attur M.G. Patel I.R. Patel R.N. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar) stimulates chondrocyte matrix calcification (19Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Pritzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 149-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). IL-1β also induces TG transamidation catalytic activity in cultured chondrocytes (19Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Pritzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 149-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, selective “gain-of-function” of either chondrocyte TG2 or FXIIIA TG transamidation activity via transfection was associated with potent up-regulation of the capacity of chondrocytes to calcify their matrix (19Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Pritzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 149-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TG2 was recently observed to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation (21Vincan E. Neylon C.B. Jacobsen A.N. Woodcock E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 157: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In mononuclear phagocytes and fibroblasts, TG2 regulates adhesion and migration (22Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus, we directly tested the role of TG2 in IL-1β-induced calcification by chondrocytes. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that TG2 is not simply a marker of chondrocyte hypertrophy but also a direct mediator of the development of chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. To directly probe TG2 functions in chondrocyte differentiation and calcification we have taken advantage of the recent generation of TG2 knockout mice, which are phenotypically normal (23Nanda N.

CNP is expressed in developing long bones, and the stimulatory effects of CNP on chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy are essential for normal growth plate development (25Chusho H. Tamura N.

In addition, hypervitaminosis A and toxicity of certain other retinoids is associated with accelerated terminal differentiation of endochondral chondrocytes and premature epiphyseal closure in vivo (28Cuny J.F.

Pontarelli G. Tavassi S. Gentile V. Cozzolino A. Porta R. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) in vitro. Chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation in both the growth plate and in OA articular cartilage has been heretofore linked closely with a state in which matrix calcification is up-regulated (2Alini M. Kofsky Y. Wu W. Pidoux I. Poole A.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Gerstenfeld L.C. Shapiro F.D. J. Cell.

However, it has not been clarified if there is an obligate linkage of up-regulated calcification with chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate, using IL-1β and CNP-stimulated cells, that chondrocyte hypertrophy and up-regulated matrix calcification are dissociable states. We also establish TG2 to be an essential mediator of IL-1β-induced calcification, as well as ATRA-induced Cbfa1 expression, hypertrophic differentiation, and calcification in articular chondrocytes. In contradistinction, we establish that CNP-induced Cbfa1 expression and hypertrophic differentiation do not require TG2 in articular chondrocytes. Reagents—Human recombinant IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). ATRA, CNP, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. TG2 Null Mice—We established a breeding colony of TG2 (+/+) and TG2 (–/–) mice as previously described (23Nanda N. Iismaa S.E. Owens W.A. Husain A. Mackay F. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20673-20678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The C57BL6/129SVJ heterozygote TG2 (–/–) mice were bred to generate homozygous TG2 (–/–) and congenic wild-type founders. Each set of founders was used for only 5 generations to avoid breeding artifacts. Cell Isolation, Culture Conditions, and Assessment of Matrix Calcification—Primary articular chondrocytes from normal bovine knees (Animal Technologies, Tyler, TX) were isolated after dissection by collagenase digestion of the tibial plateau and femoral condyle articular cartilage (58Johnson K. Farley D. Hu S.H. Terkeltaub R. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Primary mouse articular chondrocytes were isolated by dissection of the tibial plateaus and femoral condyles of the TG2 wild-type and knockout mice at two months of age. The articular cartilage was carefully peeled off with a scalpel under a dissecting microscope to avoid disruption of the subchondral bone. The cartilage was subsequently digested with 2 mg/ml clostridial collagenase at 37 °C for 2 h and then plated in monolayer culture. Subconfluent chondrocytes were shown to express type II collagen in > 95% of the cells by immunocytochemistry. Approximately 2500 primary chondrocytes were obtained initially from a pair of knee joints from each two-month-old mouse. Mouse chondrocytes were allowed to proliferate for 5 days, which yielded ∼10,000 cells per pair of knees from an individual mouse. For the described experiments, knees from 30 mice of each genotype were harvested, and the chondrocytes of each genotype were pooled upon isolation and plated at 70% confluency. Primary chondrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml Streptomycin (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA) and maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 7 days prior to the initiation of each experiment. Functional studies on chondrocytes were performed in either Medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium phosphate, and 50 g/ml of ascorbic acid) or Medium B (which had the same composition as Medium A except for a lack of sodium phosphate), unless otherwise indicated. To quantify matrix calcification by the primary articular chondrocytes, we used a previously described Alizarin Red S binding assay, which was further validated in each experiment by direct visual observation of Alizarin Red S staining in each plate (5Hessle L. Johnson K.A. Anderson H.C. Narisawa S. Sali A. Goding J.W. Terkeltaub R. Millan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Here, aliquots of mouse chondrocytes (1 × 103 cells/well) were plated in individual wells of 96-well plates in a volume of 0.2 ml of Medium A. SDS-PAGE/Western Blotting and RT-PCR—For SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, conditioned media was collected at the designated time points and concentrated with cold tricholoracetic acid (final concentration of 15%) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates and protein pellets from the concentrated media were resuspended in 4% SDS, 0.2 m Tris, pH 6.8, and 40% glycerol, and the protein was determined with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Aliquots of 0.01 mg protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose (31Johnson K. Vaingankar S. Chen Y. Moffa A. Goldring M.B. Sano K.

TG Activity, PPi, Nucleotide Pyrophosphohydrolase (NPP), AP, and Cellular DNA Assays—Cell-associated TG activity was determined by a modification of a previously described method (35Slaughter T.F. Achyuthan K.E. Lai T.S. Greenberg C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.02 mg of cell lysate was extracted and sonicated for 10 s in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.4% Triton X-100, and was then loaded to Nunc-Immuno Module plates previously coated with 20 mg/ml N,N′-dimethylcasein. The lysates were incubated for 1 h in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20 mm CaCl2, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (BP) (Pierce), and detection of the bound BP was performed as described (35Slaughter T.F.

Extracellular PPi was determined radiometrically and equalized for the DNA concentration in each well, as described (31Johnson K. Vaingankar S. Chen Y. Moffa A. Goldring M.B. Sano K. Jin-Hua P. Sali A. Goding J. Terkeltaub R. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1986-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We determined specific activity of NPP and AP as described, with units of NPP and AP designated as moles of substrate hydrolyzed/h/g protein in each sample (31Johnson K. Vaingankar S. Chen Y.

Statistical Analyses—Where indicated, error bars represent S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test (paired 2-sample testing for means). Expression and Activation of TG2 in Articular Cartilage Chondrocytes—To determine which TG isozymes other than TG2 might modulate stimulated changes in articular chondrocyte TG activity, we first tested for expression of TG2 relative to other TG isozymes in situ in mouse knee articular cartilages, using RT-PCR (Fig. 1). In normal cartilages, TG2 and FXIIIA mRNA expression were detectable in this manner, but not the mRNAs for the fibroblast-expressed TG isozymes TG1, TG3, and TG5. Even in the presence of IL-1β, ATRA, or CNP, no expression of these isozymes was found (data not shown). Absent expression of TG2 was confirmed in the TG2 (–/–) mouse knee cartilages (Fig. 1). Qualitative expression of FXIIIA mRNA was detected in the TG2 (–/–) mouse knee cartilages (Fig. 1). There was a small reduction of the total FXIIIA mRNA level seen in the TG2 (–/–) cartilages, but no apparent adaptive changes in expression of the other TG isozymes tested. Next, we assessed and compared TG catalytic activity in articular chondrocytes in response to ATRA, IL-1β, and CNP. In unstimulated primary knee chondrocytes from the TG2 (+/+) and TG2 (–/–) mice we observed a ∼50% reduction in basal TG activity (Fig. 2A). IL-1β and ATRA treatment, but not CNP treatment, induced doubling of TG activity in primary TG2 (+/+) mouse articular chondrocytes (Fig. 2A). The respective findings for chondrocyte TG activity in response to the same agonists were confirmed when primary normal bovine knee articular chondrocytes were studied (Fig. 2B). In articular chondrocytes from TG2 (–/–) mice, IL-1β and ATRA failed to significantly increase TG activity (Fig. 2A). Thus, TG2 accounted for the majority of up-regulated TG2 catalytic activity in knee articular chondrocytes in response to both IL-1β and ATRA. Essential Role of TG2 in IL-1β- and ATRA-induced Chondrocyte Matrix Calcification—We confirmed that IL-1β and ATRA induced matrix calcification by chondrocytes, first using normal bovine knee cells carried for 14 days in a mineralization-promoting culture medium (Fig. 3A). Under the same conditions, CNP failed to significantly induce matrix calcification in bovine knee chondrocytes. To assess if the differential changes in matrix calcification were the result of altered generation of PPi, we measured extracellular PPi, which has been described to rise in association with chondrocyte hypertrophy (36Rosenthal A.K. Henry L.A. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 395-401PubMed Google Scholar). We also quantified cell-associated PPi-generating NPP activity (36Rosenthal A.K. Henry L.A. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 395-401PubMed Google Scholar), which modulates growth plate chondrocyte differentiation in vivo (37Boskey A.L. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2002; 4: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, B–C). Under these conditions, CNP failed to significantly alter either PPi levels or NPP activity in bovine chondrocytes (Fig. 3, B–C). We confirmed (38Rosenthal A.K. Henry L.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 59: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that ATRA increased extracellular PPi and cell-associated NPP activity by 2-fold in normal bovine chondrocytes (Fig. 3, B–C). We also confirmed (39Hashimoto S. Ochs R.L. Rosen F. Quach J. McCabe G. Solan J. Seegmiller J.E. Terkeltaub R. Lotz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3094-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) that IL-1β significantly decreased both extracellular PPi and NPP activity in the normal bovine chondrocytes. Thus, opposite changes in PPi generation occurred as a component of chondrocyte differentiation in response to ATRA and IL-1β. Parallel experiments using TG2 (+/+) articular chondrocytes treated with ATRA and IL-1β gave comparable results to bovine chondrocytes for stimulation of calcification, NPP-specific activity, and extracellular PPi (Fig. 4, A–C). But in the absence of TG2, mouse chondrocytes stimulated with IL-1β or ATRA failed to carry out significantly increased matrix calcification relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). ATRA increased extracellular PPi by more than 3-fold and NPP activity by more than 4-fold basal levels, and IL-1β significantly decreased both extracellular PPi and NPP activity in TG2 (+/+) mouse chondrocytes (Fig. 4, B–C). TG2 (–/–) mouse chondrocytes had a less pronounced up-regulation of PPi and NPP in response to ATRA than in wild-type cells (Fig. 4, B–C). But the TG2 (–/–) mouse chondrocytes significantly responded to ATRA and IL-1β with regulatory changes in extracellular PPi and NPP activity in the same respective directions as in wild-type cells (Fig. 4, B–C). Because changes in PPi generation appeared less likely than TG2 to be a major force in driving calcification in response to ATRA and IL-1β, we next tested for potential effects of TG2 in modulating altered states of chondrocyte maturation differentially linked to calcification. TG2-dependent and -independent Chondrocyte Hypertrophy—We determined that ATRA-induced type X collagen expression, the cardinal marker for chondrocyte hypertrophy (40Pacifici M. Golden E.B. Iwamoto M. Adams S.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was markedly reduced in primary TG2 (–/–) mouse chondrocytes (Fig. 5A). Induction by ATRA of additional markers of chondrocyte hypertrophy (i.e. AP activity (41Iwamoto M. Yagami K. Shapiro I.M. Leboy P.S. Adams S.L. Pacifici M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 28: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and MMP-13 expression (42Iwamoto M. Kitagaki J. Tamamura Y. Gentili C. Koyama E. Enomoto H. Komori T. Pacifici M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M.

Mice homozygous for a null mutation of the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2.2 develop severe hyperglycemia and die shortly after birth (12Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant embryos lack insulin-producing औ-cells and have fewer α-cells and PP cells. Remarkably, in these mutants there remains a large population of islet cells that do not produce any of the four endocrine hormones. These cells express some औ-cell markers, such as islet amyloid polypeptide and PDX-1, but lack other definitive औ-cell markers including GLUT2, glucokinase, and the औ-cell-specific homeodomain factor Nkx6.1. These mice demonstrate that Nkx2.2 is necessary for the final differentiation of औ-cells. The onset of Nkx2.2 expression in mouse endoderm is coincident with the onset of dorsal pancreatic bud evagination at embryonic day 9.5. Most or all of the epithelial cells of the pancreas express Nkx2.2 from the onset of bud formation until embryonic day 12.5; thereafter, Nkx2.2 expression becomes more restricted. During the peak period for औ-cell neogenesis, from embryonic day 13.5 to 18.5 (13Pictet R. Rutter W.J. Society A.P. Steiner D.F. Frenkel N. Handbook of Physiology. 1. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1972: 25-66Google Scholar), Nkx2.2 is expressed in a subset of incompletely differentiated endocrine precursor cells that coexpress the bHLH1proendocrine transcription factor neurogenin-3 (12Sussel L.

Conners J.R. Kalamaras J. Lee J.E. Anderson D.J. Sussel L. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Development. 2000; 127: 3533-3542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike neurogenin-3, which is expressed exclusively in precursor cells, Nkx2.2 is expressed also in differentiated endocrine cells. In the mature pancreas, Nkx2.2 expression is limited to the differentiated endocrine cells including α-, औ-, and PP cells, but not δ-cells. Therefore, Nkx2.2 is expressed at least three distinct stages in islet cell differentiation: in the broad initial pancreatic precursor population, in a subset of the neurogenin-3-expressing islet progenitor cells, and in differentiated islet cells. In addition, Nkx2.2 is expressed in the developing ventral neural tube and mature neurons in the central nervous system (15Shimamura K. Hartigan D.J. Martinez S. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L. Development. 1995; 121: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that control Nkx2.2 expression in these different populations are unknown. To understand the mechanisms that regulate the expression of Nkx2.2, we outline here the structure of the mouse nkx2.2 gene and identify the regions that direct cell type-specific expression. Thenkx2.2 gene has three alternative first exons (exons 1a, 1b, and 1c). We found that the 5′-flanking region of exon 1a drives the expression of Nkx2.2 predominantly in differentiated islet cells and is activated by cooperative interactions between HNF3औ and either neurogenin-3 or the related bHLH factor NeuroD1. On the other hand, the 5′-flanking region of exon 1b directs expression predominantly to islet precursor cells. These data reveal distinct mechanisms regulating Nkx2.2 expression in progenitor cells and in mature islet cells and support a model in which HNF3औ and neurogenin-3 lie upstream from Nkx2.2 in the hierarchy of औ-cell differentiation factors. Plasmids containing mouse nkx2.2 genomic DNA were kindly provided by L. Sussel (University of Colorado, Denver (12Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A.

Using this cDNA pool as a template, we carried out 30 cycles of PCR using the GeneRacer 5′-primer and HW323 (5′-CACTTGGTCAATTCGTGG CTCTCC-3′) as primers. For nested PCR, we used the GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and HW324 (5′-CACGCAGAAATGTAGGCTGTGACTGG-3′) as primers and performed 25 cycles of PCR. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To generate reporter plasmids, fragments of the 5′-region of the mouse nkx2.2 gene obtained by restriction digestion or PCR were ligated upstream from the luciferase gene in the pFOXLuc1 plasmid or upstream from the thymidine kinase minimal promoter in the pFOXLuc1TK (17Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the reporter gene constructs was performed using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The औTC3 cell line and the α-cell tumor line αTC1.6 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.57 fetal bovine serum and 157 horse serum. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 calf serum. The rat floor plate cell-derived line Z13 (a generous gift from T. Jessell, Columbia University, New York) was grown in OptiMEM with 107 fetal bovine serum. For transient mammalian cell transfections, cells were plated in six-well tissue culture plates 24 h before transfection. For standard reporter gene analyses, 1.8 ॖg of each luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.2 ॖg of the CMVऔ-Gal plasmid were cotransfected into cells using the TRANSFAST cationic lipid reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For assessing the effect of each transcription factor on the Nkx2.2 promoter, we cotransfected 10 ng of the expression vector with 1.8 ॖg of the reporter gene vector. Controls for transcription factor experiments always contained equal amounts of the empty CMV expression vector (pBAT12). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase and औ-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (17Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were performed in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by dividing by the औ-galactosidase activity. The HNF3औ deletion mutant constructs were generated by PCR starting with the CMV-HNF3औ plasmid (a generous gift from M. Stoffel, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York (18Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar)) as a template and subcloned into either the pBAT11 T7 in vitro transcription vector (17Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the pBAT12 CMV expression vector, or the pPIG11 glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector. The truncated neurogenin-3 constructs were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pCITE4a T7 in vitrotranscription vector (Amersham Biosciences), pBAT12, or pPIG11. HNF3औ, E47, NeuroD1, and neurogenin-3 proteins were produced in vitro using the TNT Quick Coupled Lysate System®(Promega) and the in vitro expression vectors as templates. Nuclear extracts from αTC1.6 cells, औTC3 cells, and NIH3T3 cells were prepared following the procedure described by Sadowski and Gilman (19Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences in the mouse Nkx2.2 promoter were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotide was column purified and annealed to an excess of complementary strand. EMSA buffers and electrophoresis conditions were as described previously (17Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Leung J. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34224-34230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One ॖl of in vitro reaction mixture or 2 ॖg of nuclear extract was used for each 10-ॖl binding reaction. For antibody experiments, 1 ॖl of antiserum was added to each binding reaction, and the mix was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before PAGE. The antisera directed against HNF3α, औ, and γ were generous gifts from R. H. Costa (University of Illinois at Chicago (20Qian X. Samadani U. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The following oligonucleotides along with their complementary strands were used as binding probes: H31, CGGGCTAGAAAAACAAACAGAGCGCTGCGC; E4, GATCCATTGGCCATATGTTCAGCGGTAATAAATTGA. The FLAG-fused HNF3औ expression plasmids were generated using the pcDNA3FLAG plasmid (a generous gift from S. Tomita, University of California, San Francisco (21Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)). The FLAG-fused HNF3औ and neurogenin-3 expression plasmids were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, nuclear extracts were isolated, and 50 ॖg of each nuclear extract was used for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation procedures were performed using FLAG-tagged protein immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 competent cells via the pPIG plasmid system (22Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were prepared using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 25 ॖl of35S-labeled protein was mixed with 10 ॖg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads in a total volume of 600 ॖl of interaction buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.57 Nonidet P-40). Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, and the beads were washed three times with interaction buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by autoradiography. We isolated 1.8 kb and 0.2 kb of thenkx2.2 exon 1a promoter (from −1754 to +85 bp relative to the 1a transcription start site and from −247 to +85 bp), 0.7 kb of the exon 1b promoter (from −665 to +109 bp relative to the 1b transcription start site), and 3.6 kb of the exon 1c promoter (from approximately −3600 to +106 bp relative to the 1c transcription start site) using suitable restriction enzymes or PCR. After cloning into the pऔgal-Enhancer vector (Clontech, CA), we obtained pऔgal.Nkx2.2E1a-1800, pऔgal.Nkx2.2E1a-200, pऔgal.Nkx2.2E1b-700, and pऔgal.Nkx2.2E1c-3600. Each plasmid was purified using Endo Free Plasmid kit (Qiagen), linearized, and microinjected (1.5 ng/ॖl) into oocyte pronuclei from C3FeB6 mice. The injected embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant BDF1 female mice. After checking the genotype with PCR primers for the lacZsequence, we established multiple mouse lines with each construct by crossing each founder with C57B6 mice. For the Nkx2.2 1a −1754 bp construct we characterized five independent lines, three gave detectable expression of औ-galactosidase in identical patterns. For the Nkx2.2 1a −247 bp construct we characterized six independent lines, two gave detectable expression in the same patterns. For the Nkx2.2 1b construct we characterized 15 independent lines, four gave detectable expression in the same pattern. For the Nkx2.2 1c construct, we examined eight lines, and none gave detectable expression. The embryonic, neonatal, and adult tissues were harvested from the established mouse lines. The pancreases from adult mice were harvested after heart perfusion with 47 paraformaldehyde. Harvested tissues were prefixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 47 paraformaldehyde. Tissues were incubated overnight with 400 ॖg/ml X-gal substrate at room temperature. Gross embryos and dissected pancreases were visualized using a Leica dissecting microscope and imaged with a Spot RT digital camera and Openlab software. The tissues were fixed again in 47 paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, and sectioned at 5 ॖm. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses were performed on paraffin sections as described previously (8Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: guinea pig anti-insulin (Linco), 1:5,000; guinea pig anti-glucagon (Linco), 1:10,000; rabbit anti-neurogenin-3 (14Schwitzgebel V.M.

Hartigan-O'Connor D. Jessell T.M. Rubenstein J.L. Ericson J. Nature. 1999; 398: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), 1:10. For immunohistochemistry, biotinylated anti-rabbit, anti-guinea pig or anti-mouse antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution (Vector) and were detected with the ABC Elite immunoperoxidase system (Vector). The secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were as follows: FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or anti-guinea pig diluted 1:100 (Jackson Laboratory); Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit diluted 1:800 (Jackson Laboratory). Fluorescence and brightfield images were visualized with a Zeiss axioskop II and imaged with a Hamamatsu ORCA100 digital camera and Openlab software. As an initial step in assessing its regulation, we identified the transcription initiation sites in the mouse nkx2.2 gene using 5′-RACE. Using primers complementary to the 5′-end of the known nkx2.2 cDNA sequence (12Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-RACE was performed with cDNA from fetal mouse pancreas at embryonic day 11.5, neural tube at day 10.5, adult pancreatic islets, the औ-cell tumor line औTC3, and the fibroblast line NIH3T3. Sequencing of the PCR products revealed three major transcription start sites (Fig.1A), which produce three different splice products (Fig. 1B). Two novel exons, 1a and 1b, each are spliced upstream from exon1c. Exon 1b is located ∼8 kb upstream from exon 1c and the translation initiation site, and exon 1a is located ∼0.7 kb farther upstream. Although the 5′-RACE results are not quantitative, the adult islet and औTC3 RNA produced predominantly exon 1a-containing products, whereas the pancreatic bud and neural tube RNA produced predominantly exon 1b products, suggesting that transcription initiating from these exons is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Products starting with exon1c were found at low abundance in औTC3 cells and all four tissues but not in NIH3T3 cells. To identify sequences that might control transcription of thenkx2.2 gene, we sequenced the regions flanking each major transcription start site in both the mouse and human genes (Fig. 1,C–E). As shown in Fig. 1, promoter 1a contains no TATA box although it has a conserved GC-rich region that is frequently observed in non-TATA box promoters (24Reynolds G.A. Basu S.K. Osborne T.F. Chin D.J. Gil G. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Cell. 1984; 38: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Promoters 1b and 1c each have a TATA box sequence 30 bp upstream from the major transcription start site. The proximal sequences of promoters 1a and both 1c are highly conserved between mouse and human and contain multiple potential binding sites for bHLH proteins (E boxes), homeodomain proteins, and nkx2 class homeodomain proteins (25Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalamaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Promoter 1a also contains a conserved consensus binding site for HNF3 (26Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The proximal region of promoter 1b is less well conserved and contains two conserved E boxes but no other identifiable pancreatic transcription factor binding sites. To test for the ability to drive transcription in cell lines, we constructed a series of plasmids with upstream fragments of the mouse nkx2.2 gene linked to the firefly luciferase gene. As shown in Fig.2A, the relative activities of the three promoters were compared in the औ-cell-derived line औTC3, the α-cell-derived line αTC1.6, the rat fetal floor plate cell-derived line Z13, and the fibroblast line NIH3T3. These cell lines were chosen because Nkx2.2 protein was detected by Western blot analysis in औTC3 cells, αTC1.6 cells, and Z13 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). In agreement with the 5′-RACE results, the nkx2.2 1a promoter drove luciferase expression only in islet cell lines, whereas the nkx2.2 1b promoter functioned in Z13 cells. The nkx2.2 1c promoter showed minimal activity in all cell lines. Although the longest construct, containing sequences from promoter 1a through 1c, produced less absolute activity than the shorter constructs, all transfections were performed with the same mass of DNA, so that the molar concentration for this large plasmid was 2–3-fold lower than for the shorter promoters. Because, in addition, the transfection efficiencies of such large plasmids may be decreased, relative activity of this very large construct can best be judged by comparing the औTC3 cells and NIH3T3 cells infected with the same construct. Using that comparison, the activity of the longest construct was not significantly different from the construct with the isolated 1a promoter in औTC3 cells. Focusing on the Nkx2.2 1a promoter, we mapped sequences within the proximal 2,800 bp important for expression in islet cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2B, a series of truncations of the promoter demonstrated that removal of the sequence between −247 and −121 bp completely disrupted the activity of the promoter in औTC3 cells. Within this region, we identified seven potentially important elements based on their similarity to known transcription factor binding sites. Mutations were introduced into each of these sites in the context of the −247 bp reporter gene construct and tested in औTC3 cells (Fig.3, A andB). Mutations introduced into the homeodomain binding site (Ho), or the two 5′-E boxes (E1 and E2) singly or together had modest effects on promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of either the HNF3 (recently renamed FoxA) binding site (H3) or the adjacent E box (E4) blocked promoter activity almost completely. The fact that both mutations can independently abolish promoter activity suggests that these two elements may work synergistically. Next, we generated reporter gene constructs containing three tandem repeats of the H3/E4 region inserted upstream from the minimal promoter. As shown in Fig. 3C, this small mini-enhancer is capable of activating transcription in a cell type-specific and orientation-independent manner. Together with the mutation data, these results demonstrate that the H3 and E4 elements are both necessary and sufficient for nkx2.2 1a promoter activity in the transfected cell lines. To identify factors that bind to H3 and E4, we performed EMSAs using double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to H3 and E4 as probes. The H3 site conforms to an HNF3 binding consensus (26Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The three member of the HNF3 family of winged helix transcription factors play key roles in development and gene expression in endoderm-derived tissues (27Monaghan A.P. Kaestner K.H. Grau E. Schutz G. Development. 1993; 119: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HNF3औ (FoxA2) is a key regulator of the pancreatic/duodenal homeobox gene pdx-1 (28Wu K.L. Gannon M. Peshavaria M.

A complex of similar mobility was detected in nuclear extracts from αTC1.6 cells and औTC3 cells, but not in NIH3T3 cell, and this complex was recognized by antiserum to HNF3औ but not to HNF3α or HNF3γ. E boxes contain the consensus sequence CANNTG, bind to dimers of the bHLH class of transcription factors, and mediate cell-specific gene expression. Among the bHLH proteins expressed in the pancreas, neurogenin-3 and NeuroD1 play critical roles in islet development and gene expression (2Gradwohl G. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Guillemot F. Proc. Natl.

As shown in Fig. 4B,in vitro translated neurogenin-3 and NeuroD1 can bind to E4 when dimerized with the ubiquitous bHLH protein E47. A complex of similar mobility detected in nuclear extracts from αTC1.6 cells and औTC3 cells, but not NIH3T3 cells, was recognized by antisera to NeuroD1 and E47. To test the ability of the bHLH proteins and HNF3औ to activate the islet-specific H3/E4 element in non-islet cells, we expressed various bHLH factors in NIH3T3 cells along with a luciferase construct driven by either the −247 bp nkx2.2 1a promoter (Fig. 5A) or by three copies of the H3/E4 element from the 1a promoter upstream from a minimal THYMIDINE KINASE promoter (Fig. 5D). As shown in Fig.5A, HNF3औ or E47 alone activated the nkx2.2 1a promoter modestly; and coexpression of HNF3औ with E47 did not provide any further activation. On the other hand, the addition of NeuroD1 or neurogenin-3 to E47 and HNF3औ synergistically activated the promoter. Activity of the three factors transfected together was significantly greater than the combined activities of the individual transcription factors. To keep all transfections comparable, no attempt was made to optimize relative synergistic activity by varying plasmid concentrations. In contrast, the related non-pancreatic bHLH factors MyoD and Tal1 did not synergize with HNF3औ, although MyoD significantly activated the promoter and mini-enhancer construct in the absence of HNF3औ.

Kasper M. Miosge N. Hughes R.C. Differentiation. 1997; 62: 149-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aubin et al. (16Aubin J.E. Gupta A.K. Bhargava U. Turksen K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported galectin-3 expression in rat osteoblasts. In addition, its expression was shown in the epiphyseal cartilage and bone of neonatal mice (17Colnot C. Sidhu S.S. Poirier F. Balmain N. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 1191-1202PubMed Google Scholar). The human galectin-3 gene LGALS3 (lectin,galactoside binding, soluble 3) was mapped to chromosome 14 at band 14q21–22. The human and murineLGALS3 genes are organized in six exons, with the translation start site located in exon 2 (18Kadrofske M.M. Openo K.P. Wang J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Rosenberg I.M. Iyer R. Cherayil B. Chiodino C. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12393-12400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic fragments encompassing nucleotides −836 to +141 relative to the transcription start site of human LGALS3 show significant promoter activity in reporter assays (18Kadrofske M.M. Openo K.P. Wang J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for transcription factors within the promoter region have been identified by sequence analysis in the same study. Nevertheless, factors regulating galectin-3 expression in vivo are still to be defined. Runx2 is one of three mammalian members of the runt family of transcription factors that bind to the consensus motif 5′-ACCPuCPu-3′ (20Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar-Am I. Avivi L. Groner Y.

Crute B.E. Speck N.A. Lenz J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2898-2906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Runx2 is a key regulator of osteoblast differentiation. The expression of Runx2 is restricted to osteoblasts, epiphyseal cartilage, nucleus pulposus, and mammary gland (24Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W.

Mice deficient in Runx2 expression are devoid of osteoblasts and bone (24Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R.

Expression of several osteoblast-specific genes is regulated by Runx2 (26Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcription factor has been implicated to play a role in chondrocyte maturation (27Enomoto H. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Nomura S. Himeno M. Kitamura Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T.

Dev. 1999; 80: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that galectin-3 expression in these tissues might be controlled by Runx2. The data presented in this study support the finding of an involvement of galectin-3 in bone and cartilage development. We provide evidence for an up-regulation of galectin-3 transcription after constitutive and inducible forced expression of Runx2 in C3H10T1/2 cells. Furthermore we show the presence of several Runx consensus binding sites in the galectin-3 promoter and the ability of Runx2 to physically interact with some of these sites. Finally we show by in situhybridization that in contrast to wild type mice, Runx2-deficient mice lack expression of galectin-3 in long bones. The murine embryonic calvaria cell line MC3T3-E1 was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany) (29Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in α-modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen). The conditions for osteogenic differentiation were adopted from those reported for differentiation of fetal rat calvaria cells (30Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). When cells reached confluency, medium supplemented with 10 mm औ-glycerophosphate and 50 ॖg/ml ascorbic acid was used (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was changed every 2 days. Osteogenic differentiation was monitored by alkaline phosphatase staining using Naphtol AS-TR phosphate and Fast Red RC tablets (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer's instructions. C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. The C3H10T1/2 cells were subcultured before reaching confluency. For stably transfected C3H10T1/2 cells (C3H10T1/2-Runx2) medium was supplemented with G418 at 600 ॖg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich). Stably transfected C3H10T1/2 clones with inducible Runx2 expression were grown with the addition of 150 ॖg/ml zeocin and 200 ॖg/ml hygromycin (both from Invitrogen). Cell clones with inducible expression of Runx2 were generated using the mifepristone-regulated expression system GeneSwitch (all of components were from Invitrogen). For stable transfections, 105C3H10T1/2 cells were incubated with 2.5 ॖg of plasmid DNA and 5 ॖl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After transfection with pSwitch, the clones were selected with 200 ॖg/ml hygromycin. Individual clones expressing the regulatory protein encoded by pSwitch were identified by transient transfection with pGene/V5 His/lacZ. 24 h after incubation in the presence of 30 nm mifepristone, the cells were stained for औ-galactosidase. The cells were fixed in 27 formaldehyde and 0.27 glutardialdehyde for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently stained using 5 mm K3Fe[CN]6, 5 mm K4Fe[CN]6, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-Gal. Two of the clones that proved to be inducible were stably transfected with pGene-Runx2 as described with the addition of 150 ॖg/ml Zeocin. The clones were screened for inducible expression of Runx2 by Western blotting after induction with 30 nm mifepristone for 24 h. For expression analysis in induced C3H10T1/2 clones, the medium was supplemented with 30 nm mifepristone (dissolved in ethanol), and the cells were harvested after 24–40 h. Control cells were grown for the same period in medium supplemented with the respective volume of ethanol. Pretreatment of inducible C3H10T1/2 cells with trichostatin A (TSA)1 was performed in standard medium supplemented with 25–200 nm TSA. After 20 h mifepristone was added to a final concentration of 30 nm to induce cells. All cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA purified from limbs of newborn mice. Reverse transcription was carried out using 2 ॖg of total RNA, random hexamer primers, and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Prior to PCR the cDNA was treated with ribonuclease H (Invitrogen). PCR reagents were from Qiagen. The primers used for reverse transcriptase-PCR were as follows: Runx2expressfor, 5′-TCACTACCAGCCACCCAGACCAA-3′; Runx2expressrev, 5′-CACTTATGAAAACAGACCAGACAACACCTT-3′; Runx2hybfor, 5′-AACCCACGGCCCTCCCTGAACTCT-3′; Runx2hybrev, 5′-TGACGTGACTGGCGGGGTGTAGGT-3′; Gal3for, 5′-TGGGAAAAGGAAGAAAGACAGTC-3′; and Gal3rev, 5′-GTTTCCCACTCCTAAGGCACAC-3′. Sequences of औ-actin primers were adopted from Gessner et al. (31Gessner A. Schroppel K. Will A. Enssle K.H. Lauffer L. Rollinghoff M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4112-4117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers from a PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction kit (BD Clontech) and osteocalcin primers from Desboiset al. (32Desbois C. Hogue D.A. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were cloned into TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and inserts were sequenced by a TaqDyeDeoxy Sequencing system (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany). Runx2 cDNA was subcloned into expression vector pCMVऔ (BD Clontech) replacing the lacZ gene to generate pCMV-Runx2. Likewise, Runx2 cDNA was subcloned into inducible expression vector pGene/V5-His A (GeneSwitch System, Invitrogen). This vector is referred to as pGene-Runx2. The murine galectin-3 promoter from −1867 to +50 nucleotides relative to the transcription start site was amplified from Fvb murine genomic DNA and cloned into pBlue-TOPO (Invitrogen) 5′ to the lacZgene. The following primers were used: LGALS3p2000for, 5′-CTCTGCGAGCTTGTAAGTCTATCCTA-3′, and LGALS3rev, 5′-CGCTCACCTGATTAGTGCTCC-3′. Screening of DNA sequences for putative transcription factor-binding sites was performed using the web-based prediction programs MatInspector (Transfac; transfac.gbf.de/) and TFSEARCH (www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html). The MatInspector thresholds for core similarity and matrix similarity were set to 0.85 and 0.90, respectively. The TFSEARCH minimum score was set to 90.0 points. Putative Runx-binding sites were identified by searching for sequences matching the published consensus motif (21Kamachi Y. Ogawa E. Asano M. Ishida S. Murakami Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4808-4819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Melnikova I.N. Crute B.E. Wang S. Speck N.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zaiman A.L. Lewis A.F.

Thus the sequence was searched for the motif ACCPuCPu, and positions 2 and 3 (CC) were considered to be most important. Total RNA (15 ॖg/lane) was resolved on a 17 formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using 10× SSC. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were prehybridized and hybridized at 65 °C in Church buffer (500 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 77 (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 100 ॖg/ml salmon sperm DNA, adapted from Church et al. (34Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7275) Google Scholar)). The blots were washed in 2× SSC, 0.17 SDS at room temperature for 15 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.17 SDS at 60 °C for 20 min. The blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C using two intensifier screens. For Western blot analysis of Runx2 expression, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Laemmli buffer. The protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE through denaturing 107 polyacrylamide gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207843) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the protein was transferred onto Hybond P membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry electroblotting (36Maniatis T.F. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Afterward the membranes were blocked in 57 skimmed milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.057 Tween 20, pH 8.0) overnight. For immunodetection of Runx2 protein, the blots were incubated in 57 skimmed milk in TBST buffer with 70 ॖg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-Runx2 antibody (anti-AML3 Ab-1; Calbiochem Corp., San Diego, CA) for 90 min. The blots were washed in TBST and incubated in 57 skimmed milk in TBST buffer with a 1:2000 dilution of secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 60 min. After washing with TBST and Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mmNaCl, pH 8.0) specific protein was visualized by chemiluminiscence using the ECLplus system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in vitro translation Runx2 cDNA was subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(+). In vitro translation was carried out using TnT-coupled wheat germ Extract system (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. In vitro translated protein was analyzed by Western blot. Double-stranded galectin-3 promoter-derived oligonucleotides were designed with 5′-G overhangs for labeling with [α-32P]dCTP, and oligonucleotide Oligo A for binding control was adopted from Tahirov et al. (33Tahirov T.H. Inoue-Bungo T. Morii H. Fujikawa A. Sasaki M. Kimura K. Shiina M. Sato K. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K. Cell. 2001; 104: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For oligonucleotide sequences, please refer to Fig. 6A. Labeling reactions were performed using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified by column chromatography using Sephadex G25 Quickspin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For binding reactions, 20-ॖl samples were prepared containing 3 ॖl in vitro translation reaction, 5 ॖl of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (20000–25000 cpm), 1 or 4 ॖl of respective unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (resulting in 15- or 60-fold molar excess of competitor, respectively), 1 ॖl of pepstatin, and 1 ॖl of poly(dI-dC) (1A260/ॖl) in 27 glycerol, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.017 Nonidet-P 40, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 17.5 mm NaCl, 10 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5. The binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and resolved on a 57 polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The gels were dried and then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C using intensifier screens. In situ hybridizations using 33P-labeled antisense riboprobes were carried out as previously described (37Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, pretreated with proteinase K (3 min, 10 ॖg/ml at room temperature), and hybridized overnight at 70 °C. The next day the slides were washed and dipped in photoemulsion (Kodak), dried, and exposed for 2–8 days at 4 °C. The slides were counterstained with Toluidine blue-O mounted with entellan. MC3T3-E1 is a pre-osteoblastic cell line derived from murine calvaria cells. These cells have been demonstrated to undergo osteogenic differentiation in response to prolonged confluent culture (29Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). To investigate galectin-3 gene expression during osteogenesis, we performed an in vitro differentiation assay based on MC3T3-E1 cells. The cells were grown in nonsupplemented medium until confluency. (The first day of confluent culture is referred to as day 0.) From day 0, osteogenic differentiation was supported by medium supplemented with औ-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were harvested at days 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, and the total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis. In parallel, the cells were stained for alkaline phosphatase protein as a marker for the intermediate stage of osteogenic differentiation. Histochemically distinct alkaline phosphatase-positive cells were seen as early as day 4 post-confluence (Fig.1A). As specific marker for late stages of osteogenic differentiation, osteoclacin mRNA synthesis was assessed by Northern blot. Osteocalcin mRNA became detectable at very low levels already at day 4 post-confluence and is expressed at highest levels on day 20 post-confluence, indicating efficient development of the mature osteoblastic phenotype at this late stage of cultivation (Fig. 1B). Galectin-3 mRNA was expressed in vitro at any time point during the differentiation kinetics in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, galectin-3 mRNA levels increased continuously during ongoing osteoblastic differentiation up to day 8 post-confluence when expression levels reached a maximum during central matrix maturation stage of the osteoblast developmental sequence. Thereafter, galectin-3 mRNA expression persists at considerable levels into later stages of osteogenic differentiation (day 20 post-confluence) (Fig.1B). Thus galectin-3 mRNA expression paralleled the transition of the cell line MC3T3-E1 from the fibroblastic to a distinct osteoblastic phenotype as assessed by the expression of markers typical for osteoblastic differentiation in these cells. Although already present at the preosteoblastic stage, galectin-3 expression increases during ongoing osteogenic differentiation and persists at high levels late into the osteoblast developmental sequence in vitro. To elucidate the mechanism by which galectin-3 expression is up-regulated during osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells, we directly sequenced 2.0 kb of the promoter region of the murine galectin-3 (Fvb mouse strain; pGal3–2000) and screened for transcription factor-binding sites in the promoter region that might be involved in establishing or maintaining the osteoblastic lineage. To elucidate biologically relevant transcription factor-binding sites, we scanned 900 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the murine and 836 bp of the corresponding 5′-flanking region of the human LGALS3 gene (GenBankTM accession number AF031421.1). The sequences were examined using the prediction programs MatInspector and TFSEARCH and were compared with find binding motifs conserved between both the human and murine promoters. As reported previously, the promoter regions of either species do not contain a TATA box, and CAAT motifs are missing. A GC-rich region harboring an SP1-binding site is located immediately upstream the transcription start site in both murine and human promoters, which is typical for TATA-less promoters (18Kadrofske M.M. Openo K.P. Wang J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Rosenberg I.M. Iyer R. Cherayil B. Chiodino C. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12393-12400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified additional putative binding sites for AP1, AP4, C/EBPऔ, CDP CR, c-Ets, CP2, c-Rel, GATA proteins, GFI1, HNF3b, Ikaros factors, Lmo2 complex, MyoD, MZF1, NF1, NF-AT, NF-κB, NFY, Nkx-2.5, Runx factors, S8, and USF in the LGALS3 promoter regions of both species (Table I and Fig. 2). Of special interest with respect to osteogenesis are five binding sites for Runx, one for Ets factors, four for C/EBPऔ, and three for SP1 in the murine promoter. In the murine promoter one additional Runx-binding site was identified further upstream at −1477 nucleotides relative to the transcription start. Runx2, Ets-1, and C/EBPऔ are bone-related transcription factors that control the transcription of several bone-specific genes (26Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

A recombinant murine C3H10T1/2 cell line was established harboring an expression vector mediating constitutive Runx2 expression (C3H10T1/2-Runx2). The murine cell line C3H10T1/2 has properties of mesenchymal stem cells. These cells differentiate into adipocytes, myoblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts dependent on the culture conditions (41Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schroder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G.

SMN2, a nearly identical copy gene, differs from SMN1 only by a single nonpolymorphic C to T transition in exon 7, which leads to alteration of exon 7 splicing; SMN2 leads to exon 7 skipping and expression of a nonfunctional gene product and fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1. The exclusion of SMN exon 7 is critical for the onset of this disease. Regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing was determined by analyzing the roles of the cis-acting element in intron 7 (element 2), which we previously identified as a splicing enhancer element of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. The minimum sequence essential for activation of the splicing was determined to be 24 nucleotides, and RNA structural analyses showed a stem-loop structure. Deletion of this element or disruption of the stem-loop structure resulted in a decrease in exon 7 inclusion. A gel shift assay using element 2 revealed formation of RNA-protein complexes, suggesting that the binding of the trans-acting proteins to element 2 plays a crucial role in the splicing of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition.

A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The critical difference between SMN1 and SMN2 is a silent nucleotide transition in SMN exon 7. SMN1 contains a C located six nucleotides inside exon 7, whereas SMN2 contains a T at this position. This transition is believed to inhibit one of the splicing regulatory elements, called exonic splicing enhancers (ESE), within exon 7 (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). A previous report demonstrated the presence of an ESE within exon 7 and that human Tra2-β1, a member of the serine-arginine-related proteins of splicing factors, binds to the elements and stimulates an ESE (22Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that a single nucleotide change occurs within a heptamer motif of the ESE, which in SMN1 is recognized directly by SF2/ASF (23Cartegni L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The abrogation of the SF2/ASF-dependent ESE is considered to be the basis for the inefficient inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2. However, it is unclear whether Tra2-β1 and SF2/ASF functionally cooperate to promote the inclusion of the exon and whether other factors are involved in the regulation of the splicing of SMN exon 7. Previously, we tried to determine the critical cis-acting elements on the SMN pre-mRNA responsible for the aberrant splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition (24Miyajima H. Miyaso H. Okumura M. Kurisu J. Imaizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23271-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We identified two cis-acting elements (elements 1 and 2) responsible for the regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing. The mutation in element 1, which is composed of 45 bp in intron 6, or treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed toward element 1 caused an increase in exon 7 inclusion. The ∼33-kDa protein was demonstrated to associate with element 1 in the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition, suggesting that the binding of the ∼33-kDa protein to element 1 plays crucial roles in the skipping of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. Element 2 was composed of 66 bp in intron 7 and plays roles in the inclusion of exon 7, but the detailed mechanisms responsible for the splicing regulation of this element were unclear. In this report, we investigate the functions of element 2, which we identified previously as being involved in the regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing. COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells were used forin vivo splicing assays. COS-7 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and SK-N-SH cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to transfection, the cells were plated at a density of 60–80% confluency on 3.5-cm dishes. Constructs of SMN1 and SMN2 mini-genes containing exons 6–8 in a pCI mammalian expression vector were gifts from Drs. Elliot Androphy (Tufts University) and Christian Lorson (Arizona State University) (21Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Mini-genes containing SMN 1 exons 6–8 and the C to T transition in exon 7 cloned into the pCI vector were mutated in element 1 by site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs (1.0 μg) were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE reagent or LipofectAMINE ACE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were lysed in buffer RLT (Qiagen), and the total cellular RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction volume using a random primer (TaKaRa) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplification analysis of the plasmid-derived cDNAs was performed using the primer set, pCI forward (5′-GCT AAC GCA GTC AGT GCT TC-3′) and pCI reverse (5′-GTA TCT TAT CAT GTC TGC TCG-3′). PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl that contained 1.2 μg of first strand cDNA, 0.4 μmof each primer, 0.2 μm dNTPs supplemented with trace amounts of [α-32P]dCTP, 5 units of rTaq DNA polymerase, and 10× PCR buffer (TaKaRa). The amplification conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step (94 °C for 2 min), 30 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min), and a final extension step (72 °C for 10 min). The reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis through a 5% acrylamide gel. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. Quantification of the density of each band was carried out using a densitography program (ATTO). The ratios of inclusion of exon 7 were quantified and expressed as percentages of inclusion relative to the total intensities. Various deletion mutants of SMN1 containing intron 6, exon 7, and intron 7 were generated by PCR using the following primer sets: 600Fwd (5′-AAG CTT GGC ATG AGC CAC TGC AAG AAA AC-3′) and OR (5′-GGA TCC GAG AAT TCT AGT AGG GAT GTA G-3′) for I7DM1, 600Fwd and OR-IR (5′-AAG CTT GTT TTA CAT TAA CCT TTC AAC T-3′) for I7DM2, 600Fwd and DR-11R (5′-GGA TCC GAA CTT TTT AAA TGT TCA AAA AC-3′) for I7DM3, and 600Fwd and IR (5′-GGA TCC CAC AAA CCA TAA AGT TTT AC-3′) for I7DM4 (see Fig. 1 B). These PCR products were digested with NotI and BamHI and inserted into the exon trapping vector pSPL3 (Invitrogen) (25Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The mutation of the stem-loop structure was generated by PCR using the template as an I7DM1-T exon trapping vector with mutagenized oligonucleotides (5′-CCC CTG AAC ATT TAA AAA GTT CAG ATG-3′ and 5′-CAT TTG TTT TCC ACA AAC CAT AAA GTT TTA-3′). The constructs of tandemly repeated element 2 were generated by PCR using the I7DM-1T vector with mutagenized oligonucleotides (5′-GTG GAA AAC AAA TGT TTT TGA ACA GTG GAA AAC AAA TGT TTT TGA ACA GTG GAA AAC AAA TGT TTT TGA ACA TTT AAA AAG TTC-3′ and 5′-AAA CCA TAA AGT TTT ACA AAA GTA AGA TTC AC-3′). These PCR products were ligated by a BKL kit (Takara, Japan). All of the constructs were sequenced before use in the experiments. Total cellular RNA was isolated from transfected COS-7 cells 24 h after the transfection using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Aliquots of 3.0 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed using the SA2 primer (5′-ATC TCA GTG GTA TTT GTG AGC-3′) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Splicing products were detected by PCR using a pSPL3 vector-specific primer set, SD6 (5′-TCT GAG TCA CCT GGA CAA CC-3′) and SA2. PCR was performed in a total volume of 40 μl. Amplification was conducted as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 5% acrylamide gel. For the collection of nuclear extracts, SK-N-SH cells were homogenized in 50 volumes of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9) containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. Buffers and any other solutions used in this study were sterilized before each use by filtration through a Steritop (Millipore Corp.) with a pore size of 220 nm. Following the addition of 10% Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.6%, the homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants thus obtained were stored at −80 °C as nuclear extracts for gel mobility shift assay. For gel mobility shift assays, the reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl (binding buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 72 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.78 mm magnesium acetate, 0.52 mm dithiothreitol, 3.8% glycerol, 0.75 mm ATP, and 1 mm GTP) by mixing various concentrations of nuclear extracts with radioisotope-labeled RNA oligonucleotide (present at a final concentration of 6 nm). The oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-GUG GAA AAC AAA UGU UUU UGA ACA-3′ (oligo-element 2), and 5′-GUG GAA AAC AAA UGC CCC UGA ACA-3′ (oligo-mutant element 2). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min and were then loaded on a 4% native acrylamide gel in a loading buffer (37.5 mmTris-HCl, 315 mm glycine, and 1.5 mm EDTA), which was run at a constant 100 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. All of the antisense oligonucleotides containing 2′-O-methyl and phosphorothioate backbone modifications were synthesized by Japan Bio Service Inc. The sequences of the antisense oligonucleotides were 5′-GAU AGC UAU AUA UAG AU-3′ (As-con), 5′-GAU AGC UAU AUA UAG AU-3′ (As-pyr), and 5′-UGU UCA AAA ACA UUU GUU UUC-3′ (As-element2). Antisense oligonucleotides and exon trapping vectors were co-transfected into COS-7 by lipofection. The final concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides in the culture medium ranged from 5 to 25 nm. The RNA secondary structures and free energies were predicted using the GCG version of the MFOLD program (26Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). The most stable structures of element 2 are presented in Fig.1 D. It is well known that SMN1 mRNA expresses a full-length transcript, whereas SMN2 produces low levels of the full-length transcript and high levels of an isoform lacking exon 7 (SMNΔ7). Indeed, the phenomena were confirmed by the transient transfection of SMN1 and SMN2 mini-gene constructs, including the genomic exons 6–8 in a pCI mammalian expression vector (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, the substitution of C to T located six nucleotides inside exon 7 of SMN1 led to the exclusion of exon 7, and the splicing patterns of exon 7 were similar to those of wild type SMN2. In contrast, the mutant SMN2 (substitution of T to C in SMN2) mini-gene produced full-length SMN transcripts (Fig. 1 A). To determine thecis-acting elements responsible for the skipping of SMN exon 7, we constructed various deletion mutants of both wild type SMN1 and mutant SMN1 (C to T transition in exon 7) mini-genes that contain exon 7 with flanking introns 6 and 7, and they were cloned into the exon trapping vector, pSPL3 (Fig. 1 B). Previously, we identified a cis-acting element for the regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing in the intron 6 (element 1) (24Miyajima H. Miyaso H. Okumura M. Kurisu J. Imaizumi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23271-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Element 1 has been demonstrated to be composed of 45 bp, and the core was a pyrimidine-rich sequence responsible for the negative regulation of SMN exon 7 splicing. Further, we also found element 2, which was composed of 66 bp in the intron 7 and plays roles in the inclusion of exon 7, but the detailed mechanisms responsible for the splicing regulation of this element remain unclear. In the present study, we first tried to identify the minimum sequence of element 2 essential for the activation of the splicing of SMN exon 7. When the various deletion mutants of wild type SMN1 (I7DM1∼4-C) were transfected into COS-7 cells, all of the constructs expressed the full-length type of mRNA including SMN exon 7 (Fig. 1 C, +Exon7) but never expressed isoforms lacking exon 7 (Fig. 1 C, −Exon7). In contrast, the longest construct of mutant SMN1 (I7DM1-T), which contained a C to T transition in the SMN1 exon 7 with 235 bp of the flanking intron 6 and 124 bp of the flanking intron 7, expressed mRNAs with both the inclusion and exclusion of exon 7 (51% inclusion) (Fig. 1 C). The ratios of exon inclusion using mini-genes containing the C to T transition in exon 7 cloned into exon trap vectors were higher than those using the SMN mini-genes containing exons 6–8 cloned into the pCI vector. The differences indicate that there may be some cis-acting elements that regulate the splicing of SMN exon 7 in regions that are different from the mini-gene sequences (about 400 bp) cloned into the exon trap vector. However, because the mini-genes containing the C to T transition in SMN1 exon 7 cloned into the exon trap vector (pSPL3) showed a significant increase in the exclusion of exon 7, these constructs are thought to be useful for determining the cis-elements responsible for the exclusion of exon 7 in the 400-bp mini-gene. For the deletion mutants in the flanking intron 7, the deletion mutant I7DM4-T, which contained a deletion of 66 bp at the 3′-flanking regions from I7DM1-T, increased the exclusion of SMN exon 7 (23% inclusion), whereas the splicing pattern of deletion of the mutant I7DM3-T, which contained a deletion of 52 bp from I7DM1-T, was similar to that of I7DM1-T (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the 14-bp region from +59 to +72 of the flanking intron 7 may be a critical element for the inclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. The position of this element within intron 7 is presented in Fig. 1 D. Analysis of the higher order structure by the MFOLD program (26Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar) showed that element 2, composed of 24 nucleotides, possessed a unique stem-loop structure (Fig. 1 D). The sequence showed a complete matching between SMN1 and SMN2, suggesting that element 2 may be important for the regulation of the splicing of the SMN 1 exon 7 containing the C to T transition and wild type SMN2. To determine whether the stem-loop structure in element 2 is important for regulation of the splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing C to T transition, we variously mutated the stem-loop structure in element 2 of I7DM1-T (Fig.2 A). Mutation or deletion of the loop region did not affect the splicing of exon 7 (constructs A and B in Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the loop structure of element 2 is not important for the splicing regulation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, disruption of the stem structure caused a significant decrease of exon 7 inclusion compared with the original structure of I7DM1-T (constructs C andD in Fig. 2 A), and the effects on the decrease in exon 7 inclusion were similar to those of the deletion mutant I7DM4-T (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the stem structure is important for the activities of element 2. Furthermore, a C-G base pair in the stem structure is also essential for splicing activity of element 2 because one point mutation of G to C in the stem caused a dramatic decrease in exon 7 inclusion (construct E in Fig.2 A). When A-U base pairs in the stem were substituted to G-C base pairs, inclusion of exon 7 was slightly decreased (construct F in Fig. 2 A). This finding suggests that the higher ordered stem structure in element 2 is important, but the sequences of the A-U base pairs are not very important. To test whether element 2 can activate the splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition, we constructed exon trap vectors containing three or four repeats of element 2 that were tandemly inserted into the I7DM1-T vector, as shown in Fig.3 A. The insertion of multiple element 2 in the intron 7 of SMN increased the inclusion of SMN exon 7 in an inserted number-dependent manner (Fig.3 B). Altogether, it is demonstrated that element 2 is an intronic splicing enhancer of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. Data base analysis showed there were several genes containing similar sequences to element 2 in its intron. Some genes that reveal complete matching to the stem-loop structure within element 2 are listed in the Table I. As shown in the table, these elements listed are positioned relatively close to the 5′ splice sites of each intron similar to element 2 of the SMN gene. Furthermore, we found expressed sequence tag clones of MRPS35 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S35) and RDGBB (retinal degeneration Bβ) that have alternative splicing variants both including and excluding its exon close to the stem-loop structure, suggesting that the stem-loop structure within element 2 could play a role in the alternative splicings of several genes.Table IGenes containing the stem-loop structure similar to that of element 2 in SMNThe black box shows the position of the stem-loop structure similar to element 2 in SMN. In the sequence, the capital letters are matching and the small letters are nonmatching nucleotides to element 2 of SMN. Underlining indicates the positions of the stem-loop regions in each sequence. Open table in a new tab The black box shows the position of the stem-loop structure similar to element 2 in SMN. In the sequence, the capital letters are matching and the small letters are nonmatching nucleotides to element 2 of SMN. Underlining indicates the positions of the stem-loop regions in each sequence. Because a disruption of element 2 revealed dynamic changes in the splicing patterns of SMN exon 7, it is possible that trans-acting factors specifically bind to element 2 and regulate its splicing through direct binding. Therefore, we performed gel shift assay using32P-labeled oligo-element 2 and nuclear extracts of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Efficient binding was observed, and the binding activity was increased corresponding to the amounts of nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 A). To confirm that the binding was specific, competition studies with unlabeled oligo-element 2 were performed. Preincubation of nuclear extracts with 25-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligo-RNAs resulted in a nearly complete elimination of the activity, whereas preincubation of the extracts with equivalent amounts of unlabeled mutated oligonucleotides of element 2 (oligo-mutant element 2), which were mutated by substitution of T to C (construct C), as shown in Fig. 2 A, did not inhibit the binding of the RNA-nuclear proteins (Fig.4 B). These data demonstrate that a trans-acting factor specifically binds to element 2 in the intron 7 of SMN pre-mRNA and that binding to the cis-acting element 2 may enhance the splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. We performed UV cross-linking experiments using SMN pre-mRNA, but we could not detect any difference in proteins binding to SMN pre-mRNA between wild type and mutant SMN pre-mRNA, which deleted element 2. Because many bands were detected in both binding assays and bands of interest may be hidden in the many bands, we could not obtain further information concerning putativetrans-acting factor(s) bound to this enhancer element, such as the molecular weight(s) of the factor(s). Having demonstrated that element 2 in intron 7 of the SMN gene plays a crucial role in the regulation of exon 7 splicing and thattrans-acting proteins could directly bind to this element, it was of interest to examine whether the treatment of cells transfected with I7DM1-T exon trapping vectors with antisense oligonucleotides was sufficient to lead to a decrease in the inclusion of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. We thus synthesized antisense oligonucleotides directed toward element 2 (Fig.5 A, As-element2). We further synthesized antisense oligonucleotides that were directed toward the polypyrimidine tract on intron 6 of SMN1 (Fig.5 A, As-pyr) and another sequence in the intron 6 (Fig. 5 A, As-con) as controls. These antisense oligonucleotides were co-transfected with an exon trapping vector cloned I7DM1-T into COS-7 cells, and total RNA was extracted 24 h after the transfection. RT-PCR was performed to examine the effects of these antisense oligonucleotides on the in vivo splicing of SMN exon 7. Treatment with As-element2 led to a decrease in the inclusion of SMN exon 7, which was dependent on the amount of antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 5 B). Treatment with the As-con showed no change in the splicing of SMN exon 7 (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, treatment with As-pyr showed a slight decrease in the inclusion (data not shown). The polypyrimidine tract is essential for the pre-mRNA splicing. Therefore, the As-pyr was expected to work effectively as the antisense oligonucleotides that blocked itscis-acting element. Similarly, the As-element 2 caused an inhibition of the splicing of SMN exon 7, suggesting that the results supported the above findings that element 2 is an importantcis-acting for the splicing of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. SMN1 mRNA expresses a full-length transcript, whereas SMN2 produces a low level of full-length transcript predominantly as an isoform lacking exon 7 (2Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O.

Deletion analysis of SMN1 pre-mRNA sequences showed that the regions from +59 to +72 of the flanking intron 7 are significant elements for the inclusion of the SMN1 exon 7 containing the C to T transition. However, deletion of these elements from wild type SMN1 pre-mRNA did not affect the splicing of SMN exon 7. Therefore, although element 2 does not play a role in exon 7 splicing of the wild type SMN, it is necessary for enhancing the exon 7 splicing of the mutant type SMN. It is not known why element 2 affects only the splicing of SMN exon7 containing the mutation. A possible mechanism is that the alteration of the splicing patterns of the SMN exon 7 may result from the binding of a specific regulatory factor, as shown in Fig. 4 A, to element 2 caused by changes in the higher order structure of the pre-mRNA containing the C to T transition in exon 7, and the binding of the regulatory factor may activate the recognition or usage of 3′ or 5′ splice sites by splicing machineries such as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins or serine-arginine-related proteins (27Blencowe B.J.

Genet. 2002; 3: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that the binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to the enhancer pyrimidine tract is functional in that the exon inclusion increases when in vivo levels of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein increase (29Lou H. Helfman D.M. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Members of the CELF family of RNA-binding proteins, including CUG-BP, have also been known to bind to a conserved intronic splicing element (MSE containing CUG motif) and positively regulate alternative splicing (30Ladd A.N. Charlet N. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 31Charlet B.N. Logan P. Singh G. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Element 2, identified in the present study, is considered to act for an intronic splicing enhancer because of the decrease in SMN splicing by deletion or mutation of this element. However, element 2 does not contain the consensus sequences to which the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein or the CELF family bind, although it contains the unique stem-loop structure. Therefore, element 2 could not be regulated by these proteins. However, a novel molecule may associate with the element to enhance the splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. Indeed, we found specific interactions of element 2 oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts. The element that we identified in the present study has not been shown to be critical for splicing or for the specific binding site of splicing factors. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for the regulated splicing of SMN exon 7 by the cis-acting element remain unknown. Identification and characterization of the trans-acting factors that bind to the element are needed to elucidate the mechanisms. Data base analysis showed a complete matching of the stem-loop structure of the element 2 nucleotide sequence to the intron sequences of several genes. Although a detailed analysis of the splicing of these genes is needed, it raises the possibility that these genes may also be regulated by an alternative splicing by this cis-acting element and itstrans-acting proteins. In summary, we found a stem-loop structure within element 2 in the intron 7 of SMN that enhances the splicing of the SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition. In addition to element 1, which has been demonstrated to be a negative regulator of the splicing, it is important for an understanding of the mechanisms of splicing of SMN exon 7 containing the C to T transition to identify thetrans-acting RNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with these elements. Experimental manipulation to modify the function of the cis-acting elements or the trans-acting factors might allow the development of therapeutic strategies for SMA. We thank K. Otori for technical support in this study. We are grateful to Drs. E. Androphy and C. Lorson for the constructs of SMN1 and SMN2 mini-genes in pCI vector."

We show here that the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) interacts with p75NTR upon nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation. TRADD could be immunodetected after p75NTRimmunoprecipitation from MCF-7 breast cancer cells stimulated by nerve growth factor. In addition, confocal microscopy indicated that NGF stimulation induced the plasma membrane localization of TRADD. Using a dominant negative form of TRADD, we also show that interactions between p75NTR and TRADD are dependent on the death domain of TRADD, thus demonstrating its requirement for binding. Furthermore, the p75NTR-mediated activation of NF-κB was inhibited by transfection with a dominant negative TRADD, resulting in an inhibition of NGF antiapoptotic activity. These results thus demonstrate that TRADD is involved in the p75NTR-mediated antiapoptotic activity of NGF in breast cancer cells.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In addition to its neurotrophic function, other activities of NGF have been described. For example, NGF can modulate gene expression in monocytes (2Ehrhard P.B. Ganter U. Bauer J. Otten U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5423-5427Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), is chemotactic for melanocytes (3Yaar M. Grossman K. Eller M. Gilchrest B.A. J.

Neurobiology. 1994; 91: 2795-2799Google Scholar). NGF also stimulates the proliferation of lymphocytes (5Otten U. Ehrhard P. Peck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), keratinocytes (6Di Marco E. Mathor M. Bondanza S. Cutuli N. Marchisio P.C. Cancedda R. De Luca M. J. Biol.

Cellular responses to NGF are elicited via two specific cell surface receptors: TrkA tyrosine kinase receptors (p140TrkA) and the common neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor gene family. Although NGF binding to p140TrkA is known to activate its kinase domain, thus triggering various downstream Ras signaling pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases, the function of p75NTR and how it signals remain controversial. p75NTR has been shown to regulate the activation of TrkA receptors but is also capable of triggering cellular responses independent of them (9Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 10Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell. Mol.

Res. 2001; 63: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In breast cancer cells, the mitogenic activity of NGF is mediated through activation of p140TrkA, whereas p75NTR is required for its antiapoptotic effect, independent of p140TrkA (12Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E. Pawlowski V. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V. Le Bourhis X. Boilly B. Peyrat J.P. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17864-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). There is evidence that NGF can both positively and negatively regulate cell death and differentiation, depending on the cell type examined. In some cases, p75NTR is an inducer of apoptosis, even without NGF stimulation (13Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T. Yang J. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 346-356Crossref Scopus (750) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, the activation of p75NTR results in a protection from cell death (14Gentry J.J. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7558-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p75NTR initiates such signaling is poorly described, but the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, particularly TRAF2 and TRAF6, as well as the receptor-interacting protein 2 have been shown to interact with p75NTR and differentially modulate both the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and cell survival in response to NGF (15Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. VanArsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J.L. Leo E. Zapata J. Hauser C.A. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5854-5863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first protein recruited to TNF-receptor 1 is the TNF-R1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), which serves as a platform to recruit additional mediators such as the TRAF proteins (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of TRAF proteins in the p75NTR signaling complex has been described, the requirement for TRADD has not been reported. Here we show that TRADD functionally associates with p75NTR in breast cancer cells. The interaction between p75NTR and TRADD is required for activation of NF-κB, which controls the antiapoptotic effect of nerve growth factor. Cell culture reagents were provided by Bio-Whittaker except insulin (Organon), transferrin (Sigma), and fibronectin (Falcon-Biocoat). Recombinant NGF and other neurotrophins (BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4) were purchased from R&D Systems. C2 ceramide analogue (N-acetyl-d-sphingosine), Hoechst 33258, and electrophoresis reagents were from Sigma. The ExGen 500 transfectant and the Opti-MEM were from Euromedex. Protein A-agarose was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-NGF receptor p75NTR antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The goat and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (IgG) raised against TRADD and TRAF2, respectively, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the corresponding secondary antibodies were from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was from Jackson Laboratories. Polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG, both coupled to Alexa 568, and polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa 488 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Full-length TRADD cDNA or truncated cDNA lacking the sequence coding the death domain (TRADDΔDD:Δ195–312) were cloned into a PRK5-derived vector containing a Myc tag. To obtain the Myc tag (MASMEQKLISEEDLGIP), the oligonucleotides 5′-GGATGGCATCAATGGAGCAGAAGCTTATCTCAGAGGAAGATCTGGGAATACCGTGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCACGGTATTCCCAGATCTTCCTCTGAGATAAGCTTCTGCTCCATTGATGCCATCCTGCA-3′ were annealed and inserted in PstI/NotI-digested PRK5 (Pharmingen). Human TRADD cDNA was obtained by PCR with the oligonucleotides 5′-TGCGGCCGCATGGCAGCTGGGCAAA-3′ and 5′-TGCGGCCGCTAGGCCAGGCCGCCATT-3′ and was cloned in pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). This insert was recovered after NotI digestion and was cloned in PRK5 tag-Myc digested by NotI. Truncated TRADD cDNA (TRADDΔDD:Δ195–312) was cloned in PRK5 tag-Myc vector with the same strategy. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-TGCGGCCGCATGGCAGCTGGGCAAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCGGCGGCGGCGGCTTCA-3′. A p75NTR dominant negative, coding only the first 276 amino acids (corresponding to the extracellular and plasma membrane region) of human p75NTR was cloned into an episomic vector under CMV promoter control; the membrane association has been assessed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells using immunocytochemistry. The activation of the NF-κB pathway was assessed using a pNF-κB luciferase construct (Stratagene), which contains five tandem repeats of consensus NF-κB binding site sequence. The control was realized with pLuc-MCS from Stratagene. pCMVऔ-galactosidase vector was from Clontech. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and routinely grown as monolayers. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Earle's salts) supplemented with 20 mmHepes, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 17 non-essential amino acids, 5 ॖg/ml insulin, 107 fetal calf serum, 40 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 ॖg/ml gentamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 57 CO2. Apoptosis of MCF-7 cells was induced by treatment with ceramide analogue C2 (10 ॖm for 24 h), previously described as a proapoptotic agent for human breast cancer cells (18Gill Z.P. Perks C.M.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 890-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For determination of the proportion of cells in apoptosis, cells were fixed with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before staining with 1 ॖg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and mounted using Glycergel (Dako). The apoptotic cells exhibiting condensed and fragmented nuclei were counted with an Olympus-BH2 fluorescence microscope over randomly selected fields. A minimum of 1000 cells were examined for each condition, and the results are expressed as a percentage of apoptotic cells observed of the total number of cells counted. Transfection assays were carried out for 3 h in Opti-MEM transfection medium using ExGen 500 reagent, as described by the manufacturer. To analyze the interaction of TRADD with p75NTR by Western blotting, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either 1 ॖg of PRK5 control vector or Myc-TRADD- or Myc-TRADDΔDD-carrying vector. Cells were then grown for 24 h in 107 fetal calf serum minimal essential medium, serum-rinsed (2 h), and then incubated with or without 200 ng/ml NGF for 24 h. To analyze NF-κB activation, cells were co-transfected with 0.2 ॖg of pCMVऔ-galactosidase, 1.2 ॖg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter, and 0.5 ॖg of expression plasmids encoding either the wild type TRADD, the mutant TRADDΔDD, or the mutant p75NTR. Cells were then grown in fetal calf serum minimal essential medium, serum-rinsed, and incubated in the presence of 10 ॖm C2 with or without 200 ng/ml NGF for another 24 h. For the study of the NGF antiapoptotic effect, MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with 0.6 ॖg of green fluorescent protein-carrying vector with either 0.8 ॖg of the PRK5 control vector or wild type TRADD- or dominant negative TRADDΔDD-carrying vector. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 47 (4 °C, 30 min), and the percentage of apoptosis in green fluorescent protein-stained cells was determined as described above. The interaction of TRADD with p75NTR was assessed after NGF stimulation by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Time course analysis was monitored at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min; dose dependence was assessed for 5, 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml. The effect of other neurotrophins (BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4) was tested at concentrations of 50 and 100 ng/ml, after 10 min of stimulation. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in the following buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysate (1.5 mg) was precleared with protein A-agarose (10 ॖl/250 ॖl, 60 min, 4 °C). After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min), the supernatant was incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-p75NTR (20 ॖl/500 ॖl) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads (10 ॖl, 1 h, 4 °C), which were then pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min). The pellet was rinsed three times with lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) were blocked with 37 bovine serum albumin. Membranes were then incubated with appropriate antibodies (1 ॖg/ml anti-p75NTR, 1:500 anti-TRADD) overnight at 4 °C, rinsed, and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies diluted at 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. To assess the requirement of TRADD death domain interactions with p75NTR, endogenous p75NTR was immunoprecipitated from 1.5 mg of total protein extracted from MCF-7 cells transfected with 1 ॖg of Myc-tagged-TRADD, Myc-tagged-TRADDΔDD, or PRK5 empty vector. Immunoblotting was done as described above with 1:500 anti-Myc antibody. Membranes were washed extensively at room temperature, and the antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) with Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat AR film. Cells, cultured onto glass coverslips coated with collagen, were treated for 15 min with NGF (200 ng/ml). Cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with PBS containing 47 paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with ammonium chloride (10 min at room temperature), cells were permeabilized with 0.057 saponin in PBS (10 min) and blocked for 10 min in permeabilizing buffer (PBS containing 27 BSA and 0.057 saponin). Cells were then successively incubated for 1 h, at room temperature, with primary antibodies (anti-p75 and then anti-TRADD). After five washes with permeabilizing buffer, cells were incubated with both the secondary antibodies (30 min at 37 °C at a 1:100 dilution). Cells were washed twice with permeabilizing buffer, twice with PBS plus 27 BSA, and then with PBS alone. Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence-stained slides were examined under a Leica (TCS NT) laser-scanning confocal microscope comprising a krypton/argon laser. Simultaneous two-channel recording was performed. Frame scanning was performed at ×1000 magnification, and a single optical section was collected per field. After 24 h of NGF treatment, transfected cells (TRADD, TRADDΔDD, PRK5, NF-κB-Luc, pLuc-MCS, and pCMVऔ-galactosidase) were harvested with a reporter lysis buffer (Promega). NF-κB activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and measured with a luminometer (Lumat 9501; Berthold). The induction of NF-κB was calculated by assessing the luciferase expression by luminometer in cells expressing NF-κB promoter element construct or control vector (pLuc-MCS from Stratagene) lacking the NF-κB binding sequences. NF-κB activity was normalized with the pCMVऔ control vector coding the औ-galactosidase protein. To investigate possible interactions between p75NTR and TRADD, MCF-7 cell lysates were prepared from NGF-treated cells followed by immunoprecipitation with p75NTR antibody and Western blotting with TRADD antibody. The results (Fig. 1) indicate that TRADD co-immunoprecipitates with p75NTR when cells have been stimulated with NGF. NGF concentration of 5–50 ng/ml was sufficient to induce the interaction between p75NTR and TRADD; a clear dose-dependent effect was observed (Fig.1A). A study in which TRADD immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with p75NTR, was performed at 100 ng/ml NGF. The time course study (Fig. 1B) indicated that p75NTR/TRADD interaction can be detected as soon as 5 min of NGF stimulation; the maximum effect was obtained after 10 min of stimulation. Other neurotrophins (BDNF, NT-3, NT-4) also mediate p75NTR/TRADD interaction (Fig. 1C); 50 ng/ml was a sufficient dose for each tested neurotrophin. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that TRADD shifted to a plasma membrane localization upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 1D). This co-localization was demonstrated by the appearance of a merged fluorescence at the plasma membrane. The nuclear translocation of TRADD has recently been reported (20Morgan M. Thorburn J. Pandolfi P.P. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and in order to investigate this possibility in the case of NGF stimulation, a measurement of the intensity of staining for TRADD in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus has been performed using the LSM-Image Browser (Zeiss) software. Our results show that the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic staining does not vary significantly upon NGF stimulation (data not shown). Altogether, these results indicate a p75NTRinteraction with TRADD, which is regulated by NGF; in addition, no interaction between TRADD and TrkA was ever detected (data not shown). To further confirm the p75NTR/TRADD interaction, MCF-7 cells were transfected with a vector coding Myc-TRADD or Myc-TRADDΔDD, the latter a dominant negative form lacking the death domain (Fig.2A), and the association was determined as above. The results (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that the association between p75NTR and TRADD requires the death domain of TRADD, since its deletion clearly impairs the association.Figure 2p75NTR/TRADD interaction requires the death domain of TRADD. Subconfluent MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 1 ॖg of expression plasmid coding several constructs (A): Myc-tagged TRADD, Myc-tagged TRADDΔDD, or control vector PRK5. Transfection was followed by stimulation with NGF (200 ng/ml) for 24 h before immunoprecipitation of endogenous p75NTR from 1.5 mg of cell lysate and immunoblot against anti-Myc (B). Control to assess the levels of expression of the transfected products was performed with anti-Myc immunoblot of total cell lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of p75NTR is known to activate the transcription factor NF-κB in breast cancer cells so that it translocates to the nucleus (12Descamps S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), it was important to determine whether TRADD was also involved in the activation of NF-κB mediated through p75NTR. The results (Fig.3) demonstrated that TRADD wild type control vector strongly enhanced the NGF-mediated induction of NF-κB. Furthermore, this induction was inhibited by p75NTR dominant negative (lacking the cytoplasmic tail) or by TRADDΔDD dominant negative, thus demonstrating the involvement of TRADD in the activation of NF-κB in breast cancer cells. We have previously shown that p75NTR-mediated activation of NF-κB results in the survival of breast cancer cells (12Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E. Pawlowski V. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V.

We show here that transfection with TRADDΔDD prevents the antiapoptotic effect of NGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig.4A). However, the antiapoptotic activity of NGF was not totally inhibited with TRADDΔDD, since transfection with a vector coding a mutated form of IκB suggests that TRADD is not the only intermediate associating with p75NTR to activate NF-κB. In contrast, transfection with TRADD enhances the antiapoptotic effect of NGF, confirming the involvement of TRADD in p75NTR-mediated survival activity. The morphology of cell nuclei observed after Hoescht staining is shown in Fig. 4B. We have shown here for the first time that nerve growth factor stimulation of the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR results in the recruitment of TRADD. It has previously been shown that p75NTR interacts with TRAF protein family members (15Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. VanArsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J.L. Leo E. Zapata J. Hauser C.A. Reed J.C.

However, these experiments were carried out in immortalized human epithelial kidney HEK 293T cells in which p75NTR stimulation by NGF resulted in cell death induction. In contrast, for breast cancer cells, p75NTRstimulation by NGF has been shown to be antiapoptotic and mediated by the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (12Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E.

TRADD is a multifunctional intracellular signaling adaptor protein that is recruited by TNFR1, leading to IKK activation and so to NF-κB nuclear translocation (22Jones E.Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that, in breast cancer cells, TRADD is also recruited by p75NTR, resulting in an activation of NF-κB, similar to the signaling initiated by TNFR1. Cell survival induced by NGF was observed from 50 ng/ml, and the maximum effect was obtained at 200 ng/ml, providing a coherence between the p75NTR/TRADD interaction and the biological effect of NGF in breast cancer cells. In addition, it should be emphasized that our experiments were performed without transfection of p75NTR or TRADD, strengthening the physiological relevance of the p75NTR/TRADD interaction in breast cancer cells. Two intracellular domains have been identified within p75NTR. The first one is homologous to the binding domain for TRAF proteins, and the second is homologous but distinct from the death domain of TNFR1 (23Sukits S.F. Lin L.L. Hsu S. Malakian K. Powers R. Xu G.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TRADD death domain has been reported to bind to the death domain of TNFR1 (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the death domain of TRADD was required for interaction with p75NTR, suggesting that the death domain of p75NTR is involved in TRADD binding. Therefore, the activation of p75NTR and TNFR1 appears to involve a similar mechanism of interaction with TRADD, further suggesting similar downstream signaling pathways. Interestingly, it has been shown by NMR spectroscopy and crystal structure determination that TRAF2 has a higher affinity for TRADD than it has for TNFR1 itself (24Tsao D.H. McDonagh T. Telliez J.B. Hsu S. Malakian K. Xu G.Y. Lin L.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Park Y.C. Ye H. Hsia C. Segal D. Rich R. Liou H.C. Myszka D.G. Wu H. Cell. 2000; 101: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TRAF2 has been shown to interact with p75NTR, an interaction we have confirmed in breast cancer cells (data not shown); these data suggest that TRADD linked to p75NTR might interact with TRAF2. However, further structural analyses are required to define the precise molecular mechanism involved in TRADD interaction with p75NTR. The role of NF-κB activation is well established for the survival of breast cancer cells, and its involvement in the antiapoptotic effect of NGF is clearly related to p75NTR signaling (12Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E. Pawlowski V. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V. Le Bourhis X. Boilly B. Peyrat J.P. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17864-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). TRADD is a potent activator of the IκB kinase, IKK, which leads to the ubiquitination/degradation of IκB and nuclear translocation of the free NF-κB (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). We have shown that transfection of breast cancer cells with a dominant negative form of TRADD resulted in an inhibition of the NGF-mediated antiapoptotic effect, demonstrating the involvement of TRADD in the NF-κB-mediated survival pathway. The trophic function of NGF for breast cancer cells, involving both mitogenic and antiapoptotic activities, has recently been shown (8Descamps S. Le Bourhis X. Delehedde M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16659-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Descamps S. Toillon R.A. Adriaenssens E. Pawlowski V. Cool S.M. Nurcombe V. Le Bourhis X. Boilly B. Peyrat J.P. Hondermarck H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17864-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The prognostic value of both p75NTR and TrkA receptors has also secondarily been reported (26Descamps S. Pawlowski V. Revillion F. Hornez L. Hebbar M. Boilly B. Hondermarck H. Peyrat J.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4337-4340PubMed Google Scholar), as has the possibility of targeting p140TrkA-mediated mitogenic signaling with tamoxifen, a drug commonly used in breast cancer therapy (27Chiarenza A. Lazarovici P. Lempereur L. Cantarella G. Bianchi A. Bernardini R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3002-3008PubMed Google Scholar). Our present data also suggest that targeting the p75NTR/TRADD/NF-κB signaling pathway may be a promising avenue for future treatment of breast cancer. In conclusion, the findings reported here provide new insights into the proximal elements of the p75NTR signaling pathway by demonstrating the involvement of TRADD as a critical intermediary for NF-κB activation. In immortalized striatal neurons, p75NTRwas found to induce apoptosis without the participation of TRADD as an adaptor protein (28Wang S. Bauer J.H. Li Y. Shao Z. Zetoune F.S. Cattaneo E. Vincenz C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33812-33820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whether or not the interaction of TRADD with p75NTR provides a more specific pathway for NGF-induced antiapoptotic activity remains to be determined, but TRADD should now be considered as a significant influence in the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways initiated by p75NTR.

https://openalex.org/W2062602311,"Numerous environmental signals regulate the production of virulence factors and the composition of the outer membrane of Vibrio cholerae. In particular, bile promotes the ToxR-dependent expression of the porin OmpU. Strains expressing solely OmpU are more resistant to bile, are better able to colonize the intestine, and produce more cholera toxin than strains expressing solely the OmpT porin. To gain some understanding in the physiological relevance and the molecular mechanism underlying these porin-dependent phenotypes, we have undertaken a thorough electrophysiological characterization of the channel properties of the two porins. Purified OmpU or OmpT was reconstituted in liposomes suitable for patch clamp and in planar lipid bilayers. The high resolution of the patch clamp technique allowed us to analyze in detail the behavior of single OmpU and OmpT channels. Both channels exhibit closing transitions to various conductance states. OmpT is a much more dynamic channel than OmpU, displaying frequent and prolonged closures, even at low transmembrane potentials. With a critical voltage for closure Vc of approximately ±90 mV, OmpT is much more voltage-sensitive than OmpU (with aVc of approximately ±160 mV), a feature that is also readily apparent in the voltage dependence of closing probability observed in patch clamp in the ±100 mV range. OmpT has low ionic selectivity (PK/PCl = ∼4), whereas OmpU is more cation-selective (PK/PCl = ∼14). The distinct functional properties of the two porins are likely to play an integrated role with environmental regulation of their expression. For example, the higher selectivity of OmpU for cations provides a possible explanation for the protective role played by this porin in a bile-containing environment, because this type of selectivity would restrict the flux of anionic bile salts through the outer membrane and thus would reduce the exposure of the cytoplasmic membrane to this natural detergent.

N-octyl-oligo-oxyethylene picosiemens Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium causing cholera, a several diarrheal disease in humans. After ingestion and passage through the gastric acid barrier, this bacterium colonizes the small intestine, where it produces virulence factors such as cholera toxin. There is much evidence that the production of virulence factors is under a complex array of environmental stimuli that influence the activity of regulators, such as the transmembrane protein ToxR (1Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Examples of factors that modulate expression of the ToxR regulon include pH, salt, amino acids, and bile. As bacteria progress through different microenvironments during the infection process, it is likely that they sense and respond to these, and maybe some yet unknown, stimuli to maximize survival, colonization, and virulence. Little is known about the importance of the outer membrane composition in these processes. Because the expression of outer membrane proteins is itself regulated by many of the environmental conditions that also influence virulence factor production (1Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 3Gupta S. Chowdhury R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1131-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Provenzano D. Schuhmacher D.A. Barker J.L. Klose K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is clear that there is a need for a thorough characterization of the function of outer membrane proteins to elucidate the reason for this parallel regulation. In particular, much would be learned from investigating the role that outer membrane proteins may play in allowing specific chemical environmental signals to reach ToxR and other cytoplasmic membrane regulators, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate circumstances. Six major outer membrane proteins have been reported in V. cholerae (5Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 45-kDa protein OmpS is a maltoporin induced upon growth on maltose and similar to the LamB porin ofEscherichia coli (6Lång H. Palva E.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). OmpV (25 kDa) is a heat-induced, highly immunogenic protein associated with peptidoglycan (7Sahu G. Chowdhuri R. Das J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5624-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 35-kDa outer membrane protein (OmpA) is heat modifiable and reminiscent of OmpA of E. coli (8Alm R.A. Braun G. Morona R. Manning P.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1986; 37: 99-104Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The OmpX protein (27 kDa), although osmoregulated and trypsin-resistant, does not have pore-forming properties and is not classified as a porin (5Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Finally, OmpU (38 kDa) and OmpT (40 kDa) have been shown to allow the transport of hydrophilic solutes in liposome swelling assays (5Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and are considered general diffusion porins. Similar proteins have also been described in otherVibrio species and shown to have expression patterns that are sensitive to medium composition or external conditions (4Provenzano D. Schuhmacher D.A. Barker J.L. Klose K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,9Koga T. Takumi K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 38: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Davey M.L. Hancock R.E.W. Mutharia L.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nitzan Y. Gribun A. Pechatnikov I. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 38: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The expression of the ompU and ompT porin genes is regulated by ToxR in opposing ways; ToxR activates ompUtranscription but represses ompT transcription (2Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 12Crawford J.A. Kaper J.B. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Li C.C. Crawford J.A. DiRita V.J. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Levels of OmpU and OmpT porins are also affected by changes in osmolarity and by other environmental signals (2Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 5Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the stimulation by bile of the ToxR-dependent transcription of ompU (4Provenzano D. Schuhmacher D.A. Barker J.L. Klose K.E. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), because it has also been shown that cells expressing only OmpU porin are more resistant to bile than cells expressing solely OmpT (14Provenzano D. Klose K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10220-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These types of OmpU-expressing cells also have a greater ability to colonize the small intestine and to express virulence factors than cells expressing solely OmpT (14Provenzano D. Klose K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10220-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the OmpU-mediated flux of औ-lactam antibiotics is also impervious to the presence of bile in the external solution, whereas permeability through OmpT is reduced by bile in a concentration-dependent manner (15Wibbenmeyer J.A. Provenzano D. Landry C. Klose K. Delcour A.H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). With the long-term goal of identifying the molecular basis for this difference in bile sensitivity between the two porins and in the spirit of establishing correlations between porin function and the ability of external stimuli to activate cytoplasmic membrane sensors, we have undertaken a detailed biophysical study of the pore properties of the OmpU and OmpT porins by electrophysiology. Comparative studies between these two porins have been so far limited to a description of their sugar and antibiotic permeability (5Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Wibbenmeyer J.A. Provenzano D. Landry C. Klose K. Delcour A.H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This type of data only provides some very general characterization of pore properties. Electrophysiological techniques can provide more precise and more extensive knowledge on parameters such as selectivity, modulation, probability of being in the open state, etc. A previous electrophysiological analysis was performed on OmpU reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers, but a comparison with OmpT was not provided (16Benz R. Maier E. Chakraborty T. Microbiologia Semin. 1997; 13: 321-330PubMed Google Scholar). The 40-kDa MOMP (major outer membrane protein) ofVibrio anguillarum was investigated with a similar technique (17Simón M. Mathes A. Blanch A. Engelhardt H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4182-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The work presented here provides the first detailed characterization of purified OmpU and OmpT by two complementary electrophysiological techniques, namely patch clamp and planar lipid bilayers. The former approach allows the detection of single channels and provides high resolution analysis of channel behavior (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar); the latter allows the investigation of population of channels and is particularly useful in the study of voltage dependence (19Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Winterhalter M. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 85: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together, these two techniques have allowed us to highlight a number of distinctive functional features of the OmpU and OmpT porins, which may shed some light on the impact of regulation of outer membrane composition on cell survival and pathogenesis. The strains used wereV. cholerae KKV1107 and KKV1108, expressing onlyompU or ompT, respectively (15Wibbenmeyer J.A. Provenzano D. Landry C. Klose K. Delcour A.H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in LB broth (17 tryptone, 0.57 NaCl, and 0.57 yeast extract) with 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco Laboratories. N-Octyl-oligo-oxyethylene (Octyl-POE)1 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher. The cells were grown in LB broth to an OD600 of ∼0.8, harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g, washed with cold 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), and resuspended at a concentration of 20 g of wet weight/100 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) containing 0.4 mg/ml DNase. The cells were subsequently broken with a French press at 16,000 p.s.i. The unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and a total membrane fraction was obtained after ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at 350,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended with a glass-Teflon homogenizer in 20 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 10 mm NaCl and 17 Octyl-POE and stirred for 30 min at 4 °C (first extraction). The suspension was then ultracentrifuged at 350,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Another extraction at 17 Octyl-POE, followed by two extractions at 37 Octyl-POE, was performed on the samples. OmpU and OmpT porins were specifically extracted at 37 Octyl-POE. The 37 extracts were subjected to dialysis (Spectra/Por 7, VWR) against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 50 mmNaCl, 0.57 Octyl-POE, and the proteins were quantified with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Five mg of proteins were applied to an anion exchange column (Mono Q HR5/5; Pharmacia Corp.) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 0.57 Octyl-POE. The proteins were eluted with a salt gradient (final concentration, 1 m NaCl). In some cases, fractions containing the protein of interest were concentrated on a Centriprep or Microcon (Amicon) unit (10,000 molecular weight cut-off), and subsequently purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Corp.). Protein visualization and purity were assessed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. The samples were either left at room temperature or heated at 96 °C for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. The OmpU or OmpT bands were identified by Western blot using rabbit antibodies. For N-terminal sequencing, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and sequenced at the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). Planar lipid bilayers were formed with azolectin, a lipid preparation containing essentially phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), as described (20Dé E. Baslé A. Jaquinod M. Saint N. Malléa M. Molle G. Pagès J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of channels was performed by adding 1–2 ॖg of pure porin into ∼4 ml of 1 m KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) in each compartment. Voltage ramps were applied with an Agilent function generator at a rate of 1.6 mV/s. The critical voltage for voltage dependence (Vc) was defined as the highest voltage at which the slope of the curve tangent reverses sign. Patch clamp experiments were performed on blisters induced from giant liposomes containing the reconstituted pure porin (21Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Kung C. Adler J. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Reconstitution into azolectin multi-lamellar liposomes was performed by a 1-h incubation of the lipids and pure protein at room temperature followed by a 3-h incubation of this mixture in the presence of 40 mg/ml BioBeads (Bio-Rad) (22Jacob-Dubuisson F. El-Hamel C. Saint N. Guédin S. Willery E. Molle G. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37731-37735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Protein:lipids ratios of 1:6,000 to 1:14,000 (w:w) were typically used. Following this step, the beads were removed by sedimentation, and blister formation was obtained according to previously published methods (21Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Kung C. Adler J. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The patches were obtained as described with 10-megohm pipettes (21Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Kung C. Adler J. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Patch clamp experiments were performed with the following buffers in the pipette and/or the bath, as dictated by the experimental protocol: Buffer A (150 mmKCl, 5 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, 0.01 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2) or Buffer C (50 mm KCl, 5 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, 0.01 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2). The currents were recorded with an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments), using the CV-4 headstage for patch clamp experiments and the CV-4B headstage for bilayer experiments. The current was first filtered at 1 KHz. Continuous recordings were digitized (VR-100, Instrutech), and data acquisition was done with the Acquire program (Bruxton) at 84.75-ॖs sampling intervals for patch clamp experiments or at 1.356-ms sampling intervals for bilayer experiments. Analysis was done with a Windows-based program developed in the laboratory. For OmpT, single channel currents were measured from the Gaussian fit of amplitude histograms (Igor, Wavemetrics). The peaks were well defined and gave current values that were identical to those measured by fitting lines directly on the computer screen through the open and closed current levels of individual events. Because the gating transitions are too infrequent and short-lived in OmpU to give reliable amplitude histograms, single channel currents were obtained from individual events and averaged. Measurements of average closed times or average time at the base line and calculation of closing probability were obtained from kinetic analysis of the closures (23Liu N. Benedik M.J. Delcour A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Closing probability was defined as the ratio of the total time spent at any closed level to the total duration of the analyzed trace. The solubilization of OmpU and OmpT from V. cholerae outer membranes was performed by using Octyl-POE, a detergent successfully used for the crystallization and functional studies on E. coli and V. anguillarum porins (17Simón M. Mathes A. Blanch A. Engelhardt H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4182-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). After solubilization and dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), a single anion exchange chromatography step was sufficient to obtain OmpU in a pure form. Although the protein elutes over a wide range of salt concentrations (from 150 to 230 mm NaCl), it was typically found as a single protein species in two or three fractions eluting at 150 mm NaCl in the elution buffer. These fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig.1. The sample heated at 96 °C ran as a single band in a gel containing 0.17 SDS (Fig. 1A,lane 96), as revealed by silver staining. This single band migrates at a molecular mass of 38 kDa and represents the denatured monomer of OmpU. If not heated, the same sample shows the expected trimeric form, running as a ladder of bands at 97 kDa and above (labeled trimer in Fig. 1A, lane RT). The ladder is due to the association of the protein with various amounts of tightly bound lipopolysaccharide molecules, as seen for OmpF (25Fourel D. Bernadac A. Pagès J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, two other bands of lower molecular masses also appear at 66 and 31 kDa. Because the same heated sample contains no other protein except OmpU, the 66- and 31-kDa bands represent other forms of OmpU, namely the dimer and a monomeric form with a distinct migration pattern relative to the denatured monomer (labeledfolded monomer in Fig. 1A, because it is likely to have retained some secondary structure at room temperature). In addition, these bands were also revealed in a Western blot with an anti-OmpU antibody (not shown). The existence of a folded monomer has been seen in MOMP, a porin from Campylobacter jejuni, and demonstrated to originate from an SDS sensitivity of the trimer even at room temperature (26Bolla J.-M. Loret E. Zalewski M. Pagès J.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4266-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As done for MOMP, we have repeated the SDS-PAGE procedure, but this time with 10 times less SDS (Fig. 1B). When the sample is not heated, the protein migrates only as a trimer, and no dimer or folded monomers are observed, confirming that the migration pattern observed in 0.17 SDS is due to a loss of tertiary structure of OmpU. This behavior is unusual for most porins, which are characterized by their resistance to SDS at room temperature (27Nikaido H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). A similar anion exchange protocol was applied to the purification of OmpT, extracted with 37 Octyl-POE, and subsequently diluted to 0.57 Octyl-POE. The protein eluted at NaCl concentrations ranging from 180 to 210 mm but was never found in a pure form. Fractions containing OmpT associated with the least number of contaminants were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (70 kDa cut-off). The void volume was collected (sample TQS3) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). The nonheated sample (Fig. 1C,lane RT) shows some high molecular mass bands that disappear upon denaturation at 96 °C, revealing the presence of trimeric and dimeric forms of OmpT. The heated sample (lane 96) contains three polypeptides identified by N-terminal sequencing as OmpT, OmpV, and the heat-modifiable OmpA, indicating that these proteins migrated as a complex on the size exclusion column. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain pure samples of OmpT, either by performing two consecutive anion exchange chromatography steps (Fig. 1C, sample TQQ3) or by extraction of OmpT with 17 Octyl-POE followed by single anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1C, sample TQ1). Samples TQQ3 and TQ1 were used for electrophysiology. For patch clamp experiments, the purified porins in 0.57 Octyl-POE were reconstituted into liposomes. Control experiments were performed where the same volume of a protein-free 0.57 Octyl-POE solution was added to liposomes, and no channel activity was detected. In the presence of OmpU or OmpT, current fluctuations are readily observed. The electrophysiological signatures of OmpU and OmpT are quite different. Both display a typical porin pattern, i.e. a predominance of channels in the open state, but vary in the frequency and average dwell time of the closing transitions. The traces of OmpU activity shown in Fig.2 are similar to typical OmpF or OmpC traces (23Liu N. Benedik M.J. Delcour A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28Iyer R. Delcour A.H. J. Biol.

The current level labeled BL (base line) corresponds to the total current flowing through all the channels of the patch (macroscopic current). Departures from the base line, seen as downward or upward deflections at positive or negative pipette potentials, respectively, represent transient closing events. The closing events typically average a duration in the range of 0.5–1.0 ms, irrespective of the membrane voltage. A slight increase in the frequency of these transitions is observed at higher potentials, leading to a decrease in the time spent at the base-line level (more on this below). For the patch shown in Fig. 2, for example, the average time spent at the base-line level in between two consecutive closing events went from 52 ms at −30 mV to 36 ms at −80 mV. This type of activity has been seen reproducibly in 27 individual patches. OmpT is characterized by a much more active gating pattern (Fig.3). At small potentials, the predominant current level is also that corresponding to the current flowing through all the channels, but the average duration at the base line is much shorter than for OmpU (for example, ∼16 ms at −30 mV for the illustrated patch, which has a comparable number of channels to the OmpU patch above). Notably, the average duration of the closing events ranges from 2 to 30 ms, depending on the voltage used. These values are much larger than the 0.5–1.0-ms average closing duration found for OmpU. As seen in Fig. 3, OmpT displays frequent prolonged closures, which are never seen with OmpU. The combination of more frequent and more prolonged closures makes OmpT a more active and less frequently open channel than OmpU. This gating pattern has been consistently observed in 31 patches. Occasionally (in <107 of the traces), the channel temporarily switches to an even more active gating pattern characterized by an intense flickering activity (not shown). A close inspection of the gating patterns also reveals differences between the two porins. Representative traces are shown on an expanded time scale in Fig. 4 to highlight the details of the closing events. The most frequently observed events in OmpU patches are closures of small amplitudes, corresponding to a conductance of 51 pS. On occasion, such events are interrupted by closures of larger amplitude that are usually five or six times the small event amplitude. Examples of such transitions are shown in Fig.4A, where the dashed lines mark the small event current level and its multiples. It is unclear whether the 51-pS conductance represents the monomeric conductance or that of a substate. For OmpT, the most frequent transition, as clearly seen in the rapid and prolonged closures of the traces in Fig. 3, has a conductance of 354 pS. Events of conductances that are 1/3 or 2/3 of this value are also often seen (although not consistently in all patches, or even at all voltages in the same patch). Such events are displayed in Fig. 4B. Because the 354-pS conductance is consistently found at all voltages and in all patches, it may represent the conductance of the trimer. The dashed lines in Fig. 4(B–D) have been drawn at levels that represent the monomeric conductance of ∼120 pS and its multiples. Occasionally, a conductance level of 50–80 pS appears mixed in with the other levels. This presumed substate is marked by asterisks in the traces of Fig. 4 (C and D), where it is seen to be of smaller size than the multiples of the monomer conductance marked by the dashed lines. The selectivity of the OmpU and OmpT channels was investigated by measuring current amplitudes at various voltages in symmetric and asymmetric ionic conditions. The slope of the obtained current-voltage plot yields the conductance, whereas the x axis intercept represents the potential at which there is not net current (reversal potential,Erev). In symmetric conditions (same ionic composition of the buffer in the pipette and the bath, here 150 mm KCl), Erev is 0 mV, as expected in the absence of any driving force for ion movement. In asymmetric conditions (150 mm KCl in the pipette buffer; 50 mm KCl in the bath buffer), the current is null at a potential that precisely counterbalances the driving force originating from the concentration gradient. In this condition,Erev depends on the relative permeabilities of the channel for anions and cations. Such permeability ratio can be calculated from Erev by using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (30Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 341-347Google Scholar). As observed for OmpF and OmpC, the frequency and duration of closing events being so low, it is not possible to obtain amplitude histograms for OmpU. Thus, we measured the amplitude of individual events for three separate patches. The data points plotted in Fig.5A are the averages of current amplitudes obtained for the most frequent transition (the small conductance seen in Fig. 4A). The slope conductances obtained from the linear regressions were identical in symmetric (closed symbols) and asymmetric (open symbols) conditions (51 pS). The reversal potential was calculated to be −23.7 mV, indicating a preference for cations over anions, with a relative permeability ratio PK/PClof 13.8. In the case of OmpT, amplitude histograms are easily obtained because the closures are frequent and long-lived. The peaks of the amplitudes were fitted with Gaussian curves, and the current values obtained from such fits were averaged across four individual experiments and plotted in Fig. 5B. The linear regressions produced slope conductances of 354 and 248 pS in symmetric (closed symbols) and asymmetric (open symbols) conditions, respectively. The nonparallel shift of the current-voltage plots indicates an effect of ionic conditions on the conductance, a hint that the ionic occupancy of single channels has not yet reached saturation in 50 mm KCl. The calculated reversal potential was"

Both transporters represent proteins with 12 predicted transmembrane domains of different vesicle types like large dense core vesicles, small synaptic vesicles (SSVs), and synaptic-like microvesicles (2Erickson J.-D.

In contrast to the transporters of the plasma membrane, which mainly use the Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane to drive transport, activity of vesicular transporters relies on the proton electrochemical gradient (ΔμH+) generated by a vacuolar H+-ATPase (6Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The variability of quantal size has been established for monoaminergic cells like PC12 cells (7Pothos E.N. Davila V. Sulzer D. J.

These studies suggest that secretory vesicles vary in their transmitter content and that this variability may result from changes in vesicular volume rather than from changes in transmitter concentration. Recently, we have identified functional subsets of heterotrimeric G proteins on secretory vesicle membranes (10Ahnert-Hilger G. Schäfer T. Spicher K. Grund C. Schultz G. Wiedenmann B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 26-38PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pahner I. Höltje M. Winter S. Nürnberg B. Ottersen O.P. Ahnert-Hilger G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and have shown that the activity of both VMAT1 and VMAT2 is regulated by the α-subunit of Go2 (11Pahner I. Höltje M. Winter S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2131-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By this mechanism neurons and other secretory cells might vary their vesicular transmitter content and therefore alter the amount of transmitter released during exocytosis. The major goal of the present study was to elucidate the upstream signals for the G protein activation leading to the observed inhibition of VMAT activity. In general, heterotrimeric G proteins are activated by heptahelical receptors of the plasma membrane. Exceptions to this rule are the growth cone associated protein GAP 43 (14) as well as the amyloid precursor protein (15Brouillet E. Trembleau A. Galanaud D. Volovitch M. Bouillot C. Valenza C. Prochiantz A. Allinquant B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that also activate G protein signaling. Another question concerned G proteins probably involved in regulating transporter activity in cells that store monoamines but do not express Go2. To address these issues we examined mouse blood platelets. Platelets are the major storage sites of serotonin apart from the central nervous system. They take up serotonin by the serotonin plasma membrane transporter (SERT) and, as has been shown for human platelets, package it by VMAT2 activity (16Cesura A.M. Bertocci B. Da Prada M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 186: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Zucker M. Weizman A. Rehavi M. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 2311-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) into large dense bodies together with other substances like ADP (for review see Ref.18Wurzinger L.J. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1990; 120: 1-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated by various substances at sites of endothelial injury, these cell fragments become spherical, acquire surface stickiness, aggregate, and release mediators like serotonin that act at endothelial cells and smooth muscles. This activation cascade repairs damaged blood vessels, maintains hemostasis, and may even lead to diseases like thrombosis. We took advantage of mice deficient of peripheral tryptophan hydroxylase activity (Tph1−/−), the key enzyme in serotonin synthesis. Platelets from Tph1−/− mice contain only very small amounts of serotonin compared with wild type ones (19Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Science. 2002; 299 (76): 5603Google Scholar). We used these platelets as an accessible model system for monoamine transmitter-depleted vesicles that allowed us to study the impact of the transmitter content on G protein-mediated VMAT regulation. Using mice deficient for the α-subunit of Gq, we could identify this G protein subunit as a regulator of VMAT2 activity in platelets. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Gαo2 (clone 101.1) and synaptobrevin II (clone 69.1) (20Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R.

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingham, CA). 5-Hydroxy-[3H]tryptamine trifluoroacetate (serotonin; specific activity, 3260 Bq/mmol) and [3H]noradrenaline (specific activity, 444 Bq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The 5HT2A receptor antagonist spiperone, the α2A receptor antagonist BRL 44408, the D3 receptor antagonist GR 103691, as well as the TXA2 agonist U46619 were obtained from Tocris.

Wild type and peripheral tryptophan hydroxylase knockout (Tph1−/−) mice were bred as given (19Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Science. 2002; 299 (76): 5603Google Scholar). Wild type and Gαq−/− mice were kindly supplied by S. Offermanns (Institut für Pharmakologie, Heidelberg, Germany) and bred as previously described (26Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Genotyped mice of either sex were anesthetized by intraperitoneally injecting a mixture of 50 μl of Ketavet (Curamed Pharma, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 50 μl of Rompun (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) per 10 g of body weight. Blood was taken from the inferior caval vein in the presence of heparine (30 IU/ml). The blood was mixed with 0.5 volume of Tyrode-Hepes (TH) buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) and centrifuged for 7 min at 210 × g. The platelet-rich plasma supernatant was taken and centrifuged for 5 min at 1090 ×g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in TH buffer, and the platelets were counted in a Neubauer chamber. Platelets from wild type and Tph1−/− or Gαq−/− mice were adjusted to an equal number of platelets/ml prior to the experiments. Sedimented platelets (see above) were washed two times with TH buffer. For vesicular uptake, platelets were suspended in potassium glutamate buffer (KG buffer) containing 150 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm 1,4-piperazine diethanesulfonic acid, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH supplemented with SLO. Incubation was performed for 5 min on ice. Unbound toxin was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 1090 ×g). The pellets were resuspended in KG buffer with 2 mm ATP added. The platelets were then divided into individual reaction cups, and uptake was started by adding 100 μl of KG-ATP buffer supplemented with 1 mm ascorbic acid and 80 nm [3H]serotonin. Additives such as the nonhydrolyzable GTP-analogon GMppNp or tetrabenazine were applied during this step. Incubation was performed for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold KG buffer followed by rapid centrifugation. The pellets were then lysed in 0.4% Triton-X-100 to determine radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting and protein content using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA kit; Pierce). Serotonin uptake by intact platelets was performed in TH buffer supplemented with 80 nm [3H]serotonin and 1 mm ascorbic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubation was stopped by diluting with ice-cold TH buffer, and the samples were processed as in the case of permeabilized platelets. For reconstitution experiments intact blood platelets were preloaded with 15 μm serotonin dissolved in TH buffer for 30 min at room temperature before they were subjected to the permeabilization and vesicular uptake procedure or analyzed by HPLC. In general, the samples were analyzed in triplicate. The monoamine content of wild type Tph1−/− or Gαq−/− platelets was quantitated by HPLC using either a fluorescence detection system or an electrochemical detection system yielding similar results. The platelets were resuspended in 0.1 n perchloric acid dissolved in PBS and further processed with a fluorescence detection system (27Walther D.J. Bader M. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 68: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or electrochemical detection system (19Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Science. 2002; 299 (76): 5603Google Scholar) as described previously. The amounts of serotonin calculated from the standard curve were given in nanograms and normalized to protein content or given per platelet (see above). Crude synaptic vesicles (lysis pellet 2 fraction) were prepared from mice whole brain homogenates according to a protocol described (28Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Serotonin uptake was performed as described recently (13Höltje M. von Jagow B. Pahner I. Lautenschlager M. Hörtnagl H. Nürnberg B. Jahn R. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2131-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimented platelets (see above) were suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde dissolved in PBS, and fixed for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation the platelets were spun down again at 2000 ×g for 5 min, resuspended, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 50 mm glycine and 0.1% sodium borhydride as quenching solution. After another PBS washing/centrifugation step, the platelets were cryoprotected in glycerol/PBS for the following freeze substitution and embedded in Lowicryl HM 20 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) as described (29Takumi Y. Ramirez Leon V. Laake P. Rinvik E. Ottersen O.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut on a Leica Ultratome and mounted onto Formvar-covered (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany; 0.8% in chloroform) nickel grids. The sections were subjected to postembedding immunogold procedure as described (30Wenzel H.J. Buckmaster P.S. Anderson N.L. Wenzel M.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Hippocampus. 1997; 7: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were etched with 1% H2O2 diluted in H2O for 30 min followed by immunocytochemistry. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the sections were incubated with the respective primary antiserum diluted in the blocking solution for 3 h at room temperature. After a further blocking step with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (pH 7.6), the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Fab fragments coupled to 5- or 10-nm gold particles (British BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) diluted 1:20 in blocking solution for 1.5 h at room temperature. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The micrographs were taken on a Zeiss EM 900 or a Philipps CM 10. Sedimented platelets or synaptic vesicles from wild type or deletion mutants were dissolved in Laemmli buffer, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose the respective proteins were detected by the indicated antibodies using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). As a first approach we compared vesicular monoamine uptake into platelets from wild type and Tph1−/− mutants permeabilized by SLO. In wild type platelets a serotonin uptake of about 50 pmol/mg protein could be detected, which was less compared with the 65 pmol/mg protein found for Tph1−/− platelets (Fig.1 A). In both preparations serotonin uptake was completely abolished when reserpine or tetrabenazine was added, indicating that the observed uptake was mediated by VMAT2 (4Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A significant inhibition of uptake was observed, when GMppNp (100 μm), an activator of trimeric G proteins, was added to wild type platelets. In contrast, the addition of GMppNp displayed no effect on uptake into permeabilized Tph1−/− platelets. A summary of the data obtained from five individual experiments revealed that the vesicular serotonin uptake into mutant platelets was 40% higher compared with the wild type preparations (Fig. 1 A, inset). When comparing the GMppNp-induced inhibition of vesicular [3H]serotonin uptake in wild type and mutant platelets (combined data from five individual experiments, given as % of control), the uptake in the former was inhibited by 40%, whereas no effect was seen in mutant platelets (Fig. 1 A, inset). In Tph1−/− mice the activity of the peripheral tryptophan hydroxylase is abolished, whereas the respective enzyme of central neurons is maintained, resulting in normal serotonin levels in brain. So the GMppNp-mediated down-regulation of serotonin uptake into a crude vesicular preparation from wild type and mutant brains was analyzed for comparison. The tetrabenazine-sensitive uptake was unchanged in Tph1−/− compared with wild type mice, and more importantly, the addition of GMppNp inhibited the uptake to about 25% in either group (Fig. 1 B). To analyze how transport is affected by G protein activation, a Michaelis-Menten kinetic was performed using wild type platelets. The presence of GMppNp decreased V max from 18.37 pmol/mg/min in control to 13.9 pmol/mg protein/min (values in a second experiment were 26.11 and 20.05 pmol/mg protein/min, respectively) and increased K m from 0.47 μm (control) to 0.57 μm (second experiment, 0.74 to 0.91 μm) (Fig. 2). The obtained kinetic values for VMAT2 activity in mouse platelets are comparable with kinetic data published for human VMAT2 (4Erickson J.D. Schäfer M.K. Bonner T.I. Eiden L.E. Weihe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, GMppNp affected both V max andK m of VMAT2 in platelets. Deletion of peripheral tryptophan hydroxylase, which reduces serotonin content in the periphery, abolished the G protein-mediated down-regulation of VMAT2 only in secretory vesicles of platelets but not in SSV. Having seen that the GMppNp-mediated down-regulation of serotonin uptake is functional in Tph1−/− brain SSV but completely abolished in the respective platelets, we preloaded Tph1−/− platelets with serotonin to shift the vesicular serotonin content to a level that closely resembled the one found in platelets from wild type animals. When treating Tph1−/− platelets with 15 μm serotonin prior to the permeabilization and uptake procedure, GMppNp strongly inhibited uptake by about 50%, whereas uptake in similarly treated controls was unaffected (Fig.3 A). Preincubation with increasing serotonin concentrations between 0 and 150 μmshowed a dose-dependent reconstitution of the GMppNp-induced down-regulation of vesicular [3H]serotonin uptake with a maximal effect at 15 μm serotonin that caused an inhibition by 40% (Fig. 3 B). At higher serotonin concentrations the inhibition as well as the overall uptake decreased, which might be attributed to enhanced platelet clotting. To determine whether the reconstitution of the GMppNp-mediated down-regulation of VMAT2 in Tph1−/− platelets is also mediated by other monoamines, such as noradrenaline, a second experimental approach was performed. Generally, platelets take up serotonin because of the activity of the plasma membrane transporter SERT, which less accepts other monoamines. To directly preload secretory vesicles with noradrenaline, pemeabilization with α-toxin instead of SLO was used. α-Toxin generates only small pores and therefore yields longer living permeabilized preparations. α-Toxin-permeabilized Tph1−/− platelets were preloaded with 15 μm noradrenaline or serotonin used for comparison or just received buffer. Following preloading, the usual uptake procedure using [3H]serotonin dissolved in uptake buffer and supplemented with or without GMppNp was performed. Whereas GMppNp inhibition was less than 15% in control platelets, it increased to 42–48% because of the preloading with either noradrenaline or serotonin, respectively (Fig. 3 C). The data so far suggest that preloading with serotonin and noradrenaline can reconstitute GMppNp-mediated inhibition in Tph1−/− platelets. To prove that Tph1−/− platelets do not contain other monoamines, a HPLC analysis was performed (Fig.4 A). In wild type platelets the serotonin content was calculated to be 5.31 ng/μg protein, whereas in Tph1−/− platelets it was only 0.32 ng/μg protein, representing ∼6% of the amount detected in wild type platelets (19Walther D.J. Peter J.-U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Science. 2002; 299 (76): 5603Google Scholar). Additionally, the content of noradrenaline, adrenalin, and dopamine was examined. Both noradrenaline and adrenalin could only be detected in minute amounts, and dopamine was below detection level. To demonstrate that preincubation with serotonin does considerably alter the vesicular filling in platelets, we compared the amount of serotonin before and after a 30-min preincubation with 15 μm serotonin. In this set of experiments, the platelet serotonin content before preincubation was 2.15 and 0.18 ng/μg protein in wild type and Tph1−/− platelets, respectively (Fig.4 B). After preincubation with serotonin, the serotonin content was increased by about 20% (2.66 ng/μg) in wild type platelets. In Tph1−/− platelets the increase was much more pronounced, reaching 8-fold the amount of untreated platelets (1.51 ng/μg). The resulting serotonin content approximates serotonin levels found in wild type platelets (Fig. 4 B). The ultrastructure of the platelets was examined by electron microscopy to see whether the deficiency in serotonin synthesis in Tph1−/− mice causes morphological changes of the vesicular storage organelles. However, the comparison with platelets of wild type mice revealed no differences in the ultrastructural morphology (Fig.5 A). All platelets contained some few vesicular elements with an average diameter of ∼120 nm and a sharp membraneous envelope, which identified them as dense bodies, although most of them had lost their dense core because of the histological preparation for electron microscopy. The dense bodies could be easily discriminated from profiles of the open canalicular system of the platelet plasma membrane that is characterized by a fuzzy glycocalyx coat on its luminal appearing membrane. In addition to the dense bodies, two other types of opaque vesicular elements could be observed in platelets of both, Tph1−/− and wild type mice. These comprise large α-granules with an approximate diameter of 100–250 nm. Some of them contained vesicular structures inside and may therefore represent an immature stage of α-granules, also called multivesicular bodies (31Youssefian T. Massé J.-M. Rendu F. Guichard J. Cramer E.M. Blood. 1997; 89: 4047-4057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, small dense granules with a diameter of 30 nm were observed throughout in the platelet cytoplasm. To see whether a change in the occurrence of some proteins required for proper function of vesicular serotonin storage might account for the observed differences, we compared by immunoreplica analysis the amount of VMAT2 and G proteins in SSV and platelet preparations from both types of mice. An antiserum against VMAT2 detected major protein bands at 55 kDa as well as a few minor bands in the platelets and brain of either group, corresponding to the apparent molecular weight and possible protein modifications of VMAT2 (32Krantz D.E. Peter D. Liu Y. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Miller G.W. Erickson J.D. Perez J.T. Penland S.N. Mash D.C. Rye D.B. Levey A.I. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An antiserum against Gαo2 exhibited a strong immunosignal in brain, but virtually no signal could be detected in platelets of either type. Antisera against Gαq/11 and Gβ2 showed strong signals in platelets and brain of either group, whereas Gβ5 was only detected in brain preparations. Protein bands in the wild type appeared to be a little stronger than in knockout animals, but no significant differences were seen in the general pattern (Fig. 5 B). The application of immunogold electron microscopy revealed that platelets from Tph1−/− and wild type mice also do not differ with respect to the subcellular distribution of the vesicular proteins synaptobrevin, VMAT2, as well as the G protein Gαqsubunit. Immunogold signals for all three proteins were found to be associated with membranes of the three vesicular organelles described above (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, the immunoreactivities for VMAT2 and synaptobrevin were more pronounced on α-granules and small dense vesicles compared with dense bodies. On the other hand dense bodies have been described to be the only serotonin storage sites in human platelets (18Wurzinger L.J. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1990; 120: 1-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Morgenstern E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 183-190PubMed Google Scholar). Probably, mouse platelets for which no ultrastructural data were found in the literature differ from human platelets in this respect. In contrast to the situation in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the absence of Gαo2 in platelets (Ref. 35Offermanns S. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and this work) excludes its involvement in the inhibition of VMAT2 activity. In platelets Gαq is one of the most important G proteins (35Offermanns S. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to its localization on the plasma membrane, it also sediments with the dense granule fraction in human platelets (36Giesberts A.N. van Ginneken M. Gorter G. Lapetina E.G. Akkerman J.W. van Willigen G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and localized together with VMAT2 on secretory vesicles (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, Gαq might be well suited as a regulator of vesicular monoamine transport in platelets. Consequently, we performed uptake experiments on mice lacking the gene for the α-subunit of Gq. Gαq−/− mice have increased bleeding times, because of a defective platelet activation mediated by Gαq signaling (26Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). They also suffer from several deficits like motor discoordination, probably because of a reduced developmental regression of surplus cerebellar climbing fibers innervating Purkinje cells (37Offermanns S.

Anthrax affects mainly herbivorous animals such as sheep, cattle, and wild herbivores, although all mammals are susceptible. The bacterium is transmitted predominately via spores rather than vegetative cells. Infection is usually acquired through the uptake of spores from soil or infected animal products by inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous abrasions. Fully virulent strains of B. anthracis possess two major virulence factors, the anthrax toxins and a γ-polyglutamic acid capsule. The anthrax toxin proteins, edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen (PA)1 are encoded, respectively, by genes cya, lef, andpag, located non-contiguously on plasmid pXO1 (185 kbp) (1Pezard C. Berche P. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PA binds to either edema factor or lethal factor to produce the binary edema or lethal toxins, respectively (5Belton F.C. Strange R.E. Br. J. of Exp. Pathol. 1954; 35: 144-152PubMed Google Scholar, 6Leppla S.H. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Anthrax Toxin Complex; Source Book of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 277-301Google Scholar). Mice challenge experiments with isogenic strains of B. anthracis expressing either lethal toxin or edema toxin indicate that, although these toxins act synergistically, lethal toxin is the key virulence factor (1Pezard C. Berche P. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other main virulence factor, the γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) capsule, is encoded on plasmid pXO2 (95 kbp) (1Pezard C. Berche P. Mock M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsule is only weakly immunogenic and is therefore not suitable for vaccine purposes (2Makino S. Uchida I. Terakado N. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 3Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). γ-PGA is synthesized by enzymes encoded by thecapA, capB, and capC genes (4Avakyan A.A. Katz L.N. Levina K.N. Pavlova I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 1082-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-PGA capsule forms the outermost element of the B. anthracis cell where it inhibits phagocytosis (2Makino S. Uchida I. Terakado N. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) by providing a monotonous linear polymer. The current UK and USA human anthrax vaccines, although differing slightly, are based on PA (83 kDa.). The UK anthrax vaccine consists of an alum-precipitated culture filtrate from an aerobic static culture ofB. anthracis strain Sterne 34F2, whereas the USA vaccine consists of an alhydrogel-adsorbed cell-free culture filtrate ofB. anthracis V770-NP1-R, grown anaerobically in a fermenter. Both strains, although avirulent, must nevertheless be handled as class III pathogens. In an attempt to reduce the costs associated with handling strains of B. anthracis (5Belton F.C. Strange R.E. Br. J. of Exp. Pathol. 1954; 35: 144-152PubMed Google Scholar, 6Leppla S.H. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Anthrax Toxin Complex; Source Book of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 277-301Google Scholar), various alternative production systems have been explored. However, with the notable exceptions of Bacillus subtilis andEscherichia coli, these have met with little success (7Barnard J.P. Friedlander A.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 562-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Turnbull P.C.B. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 13: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cloning pagA into B. subtilis strain IS53 (9Ivins B.E. Welkos S.L. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 537-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in the secretion of recombinant PA (rPA) to a concentration of about 40 μg/ml, ∼3-fold higher than that obtained with B. anthracis Sterne (∼15 μg/ml). Strain B. subtilis WB600, a multiply extracellular protease deficient-strain (10Wu X.-C. Wilson L. Tran L. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 11Baillie L.W. Johnson M. Manchee R.J. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 19: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), has been used to reduce degradation of rPA by co-produced proteases. In an attempt to increase rPA production from B. subtilis, we have examined the role of PrsA on rPA secretion. PrsA is an essential lipoprotein component of the B. subtilisprotein secretion pathway, where it functions on the transside of the cytoplasmic membrane as a post-translocational folding factor (12Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PrsA has been shown to be rate-limiting for the high level secretion of α-amylase. Increasing the cellular concentration of PrsA results in a corresponding increase in the amount of α-amylase secreted into the culture medium (13Vitikainen M. Pummi T. Airaksinen U. Wahlstrom E. Wu H.Y. Sarvas M. Kontinen V.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we show that secretion of rPA, like that of α-amylase, is PrsA-dependent. Although the B. subtilis YacD, a PrsA paralogue, is not able to complement PrsA activity, we show here that three B. anthracis PrsA orthologues are able to do so with respect to both viability and protein secretion in B. subtilis. TableI lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used. Strains were grown and maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (per liter: 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl), excepting for the determination of rPA production from strains MFJ683, MFJ943, and MFJ945, which were grown in complete anthracis medium (per liter: 35 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 6 g of Na2PO4.7H2O, 1 g of KH2PO4, 5.5 g of NaCl, 40 mg of l-tryptophan, 40 mg of l-methionine, 5 mg of thiamine, 25 mg of uracil). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml; erythromycin, 1 μg/ml; kanamycin, 10 μg/ml. Unless stated otherwise, isopropyl-β-d thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added at 1 mm and xylose at 1% (w/v) to induce gene expression from the Pspac and Pxyl promoters, respectively.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain/PlasmidRelevant genotype/CharacteristicsReference/SourceB. subtilis 168trpC2(30Anagnastopoulos C.

Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1990: 75-174Google Scholar). pRCW101 was constructed by amplifying a fragment (∼300 bp) at the 5′-end of prsA, including ribosome binding site, from chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotide primers (Bsu-prsA-fwd 5′-CGCAAGCTTATTTGGAATGATTAGGAG-3′ and Bsu-prsA-rev 5′-CGCGGATCCAGGGCAGTATATTGATCG-3′) with restriction endonuclease sites (BamHI and HindIII) incorporated at their 5′ termini. The fragment was cloned into pMUTIN4 (15Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and, following recovery in E. coli, pRCW101 was integrated into theB. subtilis chromosome via a single crossover recombination at prsA. The resulting strain, RCW201, had a truncated non-functional version of prsA under the control of its native promoter and an intact copy of prsA under the control of the Pspac promoter. Plasmids encoding B. subtilis (Bsu) and B. anthracis (Ban) prsA genes, pRCW207 (Bsu-prsA), pRCW208 (Ban-prsAA), pRCW209 (Ban-prsAB), and pRCW210 (Ban-prsAC) were constructed by amplifying the genes and associated ribosome binding sites from chromosomal DNA using oligonucleotide primers with restriction endonuclease sites (BamHI andHindIII) incorporated at their 5′ termini (Bsu-prsA fwd, 5′-CGCAAGCTTATTTGGAATGATTAGGAG-3′;Bsu-prsA rev2, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCCGCAGTTCTCAGCA-3′;Ban-prsAA fwd3, 5′-GCCGAAGCTTGTAGGAGTGTTTATCGAA-3′; Ban-prsAArev4, 5′-CGCGGATCCATACAAAAAAAGCTCGG-3′; Ban-prsABfwd3, 5′-GCCGAAGCTTTAACATATTCGGATGAGG-3′;Ban-prsAB rev4, 5′-CGCGGATCCAAGCACAACCTTATCTG-3′;Ban-prsAC fwd5,5′-GCCGAAGCTTGTGAGGTATTTTGAATTG-3′; Ban-prsACrev6, 5′-CGCGGATCCCCCTTTTCTAATTACAG-3′). The amplified fragments were cloned into pJPR1 using the multiple cloning site located immediately downstream of the Pxyl promoter. Adjacent to the clonedprsA gene is a chloramphenicol resistance gene, and this region of the plasmid is flanked by the 5′- and 3′-ends of B. subtilis amyE. Strains in which plasmids pRCW207, pRCW208, RCW209, and pRCW210 had integrated into the chromosome of RCW201 viaa double crossover recombination at amyE were isolated after selection of plates containing chloramphenicol. For Western blotting, proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell UK Ltd, London) using a mini-trans-blot system (BioRad). For dot-blotting, samples of culture supernatant were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a vacuum manifold (Invitrogen). Proteins were detected with in-house-specific rabbit anti- PA antibodies and swine anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DakoCytomation Ltd, Ely, Cambridgeshire, UK) and visualized with the colorimetric developing agent 4-chloronapthol. The images generated by Western or dot-blotting were analyzed with QuantityOne (Bio-Rad). Background values were removed prior to determining the intensities of individual protein bands. The relative band intensities were compared within and between lanes on a single gel. α-Amylase activity in culture supernatants was determined using the Phadebas amylase test (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). The protein sequences were aligned using the ClustalW tool (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). Calculation of the relative identity of the sequences was carried out using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm, which is available within the EMBOSS suite of software at the Human Genome Project Resource Centre (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). Mutants of prsAencoding a defective PrsA protein exhibit a defect in the secretion of AmyQ, an α-amylase derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens(12Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The prsA3 mutation appears to affect PrsA folding, resulting in post-translocational proteolysis of PrsA and reduced PrsA activity (16Hyyrylainen H.L. Vitikainen M. Thwaite J. Wu H.Y. Sarvas M. Harwood C.R. Kontinen V.P. Stephenson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26696-26703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PrsA influences the production of rPA, the pagA-encoding plasmid pYS5 (17Singh Y. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19103-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced intoB. subtilis strain MFJ945 in which the wild-typeprsA gene was replaced with prsA3. The isogenic parental strain with a normal copy of prsA was MFJ943. MFJ945 (prsA3) and MFJ943 (prsA) were grown in complete anthracis medium and the cultures sampled during growth and stationary phases. Analysis of the culture supernatants by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) indicated that exponential and early stationary phase samples of MFJ943 contained a protein with the same relative mobility as rPA (lanes 2–3). This protein was absent from overnight cultures of this strain (lane 4). In contrast, no rPA was detected in the supernatants of MFJ945 (prsA3) at any growth stage (lanes 5–7). To confirm that PrsA influences the yield of rPA, strains were constructed so that the level of PrsA could be controlled. The pMUTIN4 integration vector (15Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) was used to construct B. subtilis strain RCW201 in which expression of prsAwas under the control of the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter. Because prsA is essential for viability (12Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we confirmed that RCW201 had an absolute requirement for IPTG. At IPTG concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mm, the growth rate and yield were similar to that of the wild-type strain. However, at lower concentrations, growth was characterized by a lag of several hours and the growth exclusively of IPTG-independent suppressor mutants. In contrast, the growth of a strain in which the prsA homologueyacD was placed under Pspac control was not IPTG-dependent (data not shown). RCW201PA (i.e. RCW201 with pPA101) was used to analyze the relationship between prsA expression and the yield of secreted rPA. RCW201PA was grown in LB broth in the presence of various concentrations of IPTG (0.5–10 mm). rPA production was determined by quantitative Western blotting analysis of culture supernatants. The data (Fig. 2) show a direct relationship between the level of prsA expression (i.e. IPTG concentration) and the yield of mature rPA. The unannotatedB. anthracis genome sequence (The Institute for Genomic Research: www.tigr.org) was searched for homologues of B. subtilis prsA. The genome sequence was translated in all six reading frames and protein-protein alignments were carried out using the blastp algorithm (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Three B. anthracis proteins, named PrsAA, PrsAB, and PrsAC, showed homology to B. subtilis PrsA. Alignment of the B. subtilis andB. anthracis PrsA homologues indicated a high degree of sequence conservation throughout their entire lengths (Fig.3). The relative identities of B. anthracis PrsA homologues with B. subtilisPrsA ranged from 38–44%, and the Ppi PPIase I and II domains were well conserved. In contrast, the relative identity between B. subtilis PrsA and YacD was 24%; no YacD homologue was identified in B. anthracis. Of the three B. anthracis PrsA homologues, PrsAA shows the highest similarity (44%) with B. subtilis PrsA. Analysis of the region of the chromosome either side of prsAArevealed the presence of three genes, yhaI, hpr, andyhaH, that co-localize with prsA of B. subtilis (Fig. 4). No genes co-localizing with B. subtilis prsA were found in the chromosome regions either side of the B. anthracis prsABand prsAC genes. This suggests that B. anthracis prsAA is the primary homologue of B. subtilis prsA and that B. anthracis prsAB andprsAC were acquired after these species separated from a common ancestor. The B. subtilis PrsA homologue YacD is not able to complement PrsA activity with respect to either viability or secretion (data not shown). We therefore determined whether theB. anthracis PrsA homologues could function inB. subtilis by establishing a complementation system in which B. subtilis and B. anthracis prsA genes could be expressed independently. The basis of this complementation system is strain RCW201, in which expression of the native prsA is under the control of the IPTG-inducible Pspac promoter. Introduction of xylose-inducible copies of the B. anthracis homologues Ban-prsAA,Ban-prsAB, or Ban-prsAC into the chromosome of RCW201 at the amyE locus (encoding a non-essential α-amylase) generated strains RCW303, RCW304, and RCW305, respectively. The resulting strains expressed either the nativeB. subtilis prsA gene (+IPTG/−xylose) or the B. anthracis homologue (−IPTG/+xylose) or both (+IPTG/+xylose). As a control, strain RCW302 was constructed in which a second copy of theB. subtilis prsA gene was similarly located at theamyE locus under xylose-inducible control. The ability of individual B. anthracis prsA orthologues to complement the essential activity of B. subtilis prsAwas examined on agar plates, using the strains described above, in the presence of IPTG and/or xylose. The results (Fig.5) indicated that all three B. anthracis prsA homologues are able to complement B. subtilis prsA with respect to viability. Moreover, the simultaneous expression of both genes was not detrimental to growth, indicating that the B. subtilis and B. anthracis PrsA proteins do not interfere negatively with each other. Colonies appearing on media lacking both IPTG and xylose were found to be IPTG-independent and were most probably suppressor mutants (19Pragai Z. Harwood C.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6819-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Strain RCW303, carrying Ban-prsAA, exhibited smooth colony morphology in the presence of xylose, conditions favoringBan-PrsAA production. This compared with a rough morphology when the host PrsA was produced or co-produced with PrsAA either in the presence of IPTG alone (Fig. 6) or with IPTG and xylose (not shown). In contrast, wild-type B.subtilis and the strains carrying Ban-prsAB,Ban-prsAC, or a second copy of Bsu-prsA exhibited a normal rough morphology in the presence of xylose (Fig. 6) and/or IPTG (not shown). These observations indicate that Ban-PrsAA has a different substrate specificity to that of the other PrsA proteins. B. subtilisPrsA levels influence the yield of AmyQ (12Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and rPA (Fig. 2). Consequently, strain RCW302 with a xylose-inducible copy of Bsu-prsA and strains RCW303, RCW304, and RCW305 with xylose-inducible copies of Ban-prsAA, Ban-prsAB, andBan-prsAC, respectively, were used to determine their influence on the secretion of AmyQ and rPA. These strains were transformed with either pKTH10, encoding AmyQ, or pPA101, encoding rPA. The B. subtilis prsA complementation strains transformed with pKTH10, viz. RCW302Amy, RCW303Amy, RCW304Amy, and RCW305Amy, were grown in LB broth containing 1% xylose. The growth of the strains expressing Pxyl-controlled B. subtilis orB. anthracis prsA genes was similar to that of RCW101 expressing B. subtilis prsA from its native promoter (Fig.7). In each case, AmyQ synthesis was induced during transition from exponential to stationary phase and the highest yield of AmyQ was observed in stationary phase. The stability of AmyQ in culture medium was confirmed by the maintenance of high α-amylase activities in 24-h culture supernatants. RCW101, in whichB. subtilis prsA was expressed from its native promoter, displayed a yield of AmyQ severalfold higher than the strains in which the prsA genes were under xylose regulation. Of the latter strains, RCW302Amy (with Bsu-prsA) and RCW304Amy (withBan-prsAB) exhibited a 2- to 3-fold higher yield of AmyQ than strains RCW303 (with Ban-prsAA) and RCW305 (withBan-prsAC). Equivalent experiments were carried out with strains producing rPA, RCW302PA (with Bsu-prsA), RCW303PA (withBan-prsAA), RCW304PA (with Ban-prsAB), RCW305PA (with Ban-prsAC). Again, the growth of strains expressing Pxyl-controlled B. subtilis and B. anthracis prsA genes was similar to that of RCW102 in which theB. subtilis prsA was expressed from its native promoter (Fig. 8). In all strains, rPA production peaked during transition to the stationary phase but then declined with different kinetics, presumably because of the presence of proteases in the culture medium (20Miller J. McBride B.W. Manchee R.J. Moore P. Baillie L.W. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 26: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As was seen for AmyQ, the highest rPA yield was observed when B. subtilis prsA was expressed from its native promoter, in RCW102, whereas the maximal rPA yields of strains expressing B. subtilis or B. anthracis prsA genes from the Pxyl promoter were between 2- to 3-fold lower. Strains expressing Ban-prsAA and Ban-prsABproduced slightly higher peak yields than those expressingBsu-prsA or Ban-prsAC. Lipoprotein PrsA, essential for the viability of B. subtilis, is an extracellular chaperone involved in the post-translocational folding of specific secretory proteins. To date, the only secretory protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to require PrsA for folding is AmyQ, and mutants with reduced amounts of PrsA show lower α-amylase activities (12Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, because PrsA is required for B. subtilis viability, it is likely that at least one protein essential for cell wall synthesis is PrsA-dependent. We investigated the role of PrsA in the secretion of B. anthracis PA, a key component of edema and lethal toxins. Initial studies, using the prsA3 mutation that produces ∼10% of the wild-type activity, indicated a role for PrsA in rPA production; unlike the wild-type control, no rPA was detected in the culture supernatant of the prsA3 mutant (Fig. 1). The importance of PrsA on rPA production was confirmed using a strain in which the level of prsA expression induced from the Pspac promoter was controlled by the addition of IPTG. A 5-fold increase in the concentration of IPTG in the medium (0.5–2.5 mm) resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in rPA production (Fig.2). Even at 10 mm IPTG, the amount of rPA was only about half that observed when Bsu-prsA was expressed from its native promoter (data not shown). Together these data indicate that the manipulation of PrsA synthesis could be a useful strategy for increasing the production of rPA. Because rPA production in B. subtilis was PrsA-dependent, we were interested to establish whether its native host, B. anthracis, encoded a PrsA homologue. Analysis of the raw DNA sequence data unexpectedly revealed the presence of three PrsA homologues in this bacterium, PrsAA, PrsAB, and PrsAC. Using a complementation system in which the synthesis of the native B. subtilis PrsA or a B. anthracishomologue could be controlled independently, we were able to show that all three orthologues were functional in B. subtilis with respect to cell viability and protein secretion. These observations raise the question as to why B. anthracisproduces three PrsA proteins and B. subtilis produces only one. An explanation might be found in the smooth colonies observed inB. subtilis expressing Ban-prsAA rather than the rough morphology typical of wild-type B. subtilis expressingBsu-prsA or one of the constructs expressingBan-prsAB or Ban-prsAC. The simplest explanation is that Ban-PrsAA is inefficient at folding a specific PrsA-dependent protein required for normal cellular morphogenesis. It also suggests that individual PrsA proteins are specific for, or can distinguish between, different secretory protein substrates. We attempted to test this hypothesis by analyzing the efficiency with which each PrsA protein was able to function in the secretion of two PrsA-dependent proteins, namely AmyQ and rPA (Figs. 7 and 8). When individual B. anthracis andB. subtilis prsA genes were put under the control of the xylose-inducible Pxyl promoter, AmyQ yields were similarly high in strains expressing Bsu-prsA andBan-prsAB, whereas yields from strains expressingBan-prsAA and Ban-prsAC were significantly lower (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the PrsA homologue that appeared to be the most effective in mediating high AmyQ yields, PrsAB, has the least amino acid similarity to B. subtilis PrsA. We were not able to ascertain whether the amounts of PrsA synthesized by each of these strains were the same, because the only antibodies that were available were to Bsu-PrsA. Although it is reasonable to assume that homologous genes expressed from the same promoter produce similar amounts of their protein, the variations in AmyQ production may reflect differential amounts of functional PrsA because of factors such as (a) variations in mRNA half-lives of the various prsA genes, (b) variations in the recognition efficiency for the variousprsA ribosome binding sites, and (c) differential stability of the various PrsA proteins in B. subtilis.Alternatively, the various PrsA lipoproteins may exhibit differential substrate specificities with respect to AmyQ. In a similar set of experiments, rPA yields were examined under conditions in which the various prsA genes were induced with xylose (Fig. 8). rPA levels were generally higher withBan-prsAA and Ban-prsAC and lower withBsu-prsA and Ban-prsAB, although the differences in yields were not as marked as with AmyQ. Interestingly, the kinetics of rPA degradation in strains expressing the various prsA genes followed different patterns, most likely because of their differential effects not only on the folding of rPA but also on that of the host extracellular proteases that are co-produced in stationary phase. The data (Fig. 8) suggest that the PrsA protein encoded by Ban-prsAA increases the persistence of secreted rPA in the medium to a greater extent that either Bsu-prsA or the other B. anthracis proteins. The decrease in rPA from the maximal concentrations at transition phase is in contrast with the stability and persistence of AmyQ (Fig. 7). The data for AmyQ, rPA, and cell morphology provide clear evidence that the B. anthracis PrsA homologues show different but overlapping substrate specificities. A similar observation has been reported for other components of bacterial protein secretion pathways. A recent analysis of completed bacterial genome sequences (21Lenz L.L. Portnoy D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1043-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has identified nine bacterial species that possess two homologues of SecA:B. anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes,Listeria innocua, Mycobacterium leprae,Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, all nine are Gram-positive bacteria that colonize or cause disease in human hosts. That study suggested that L. monocytogenes SecA2 might be involved in phase variation, and secA2 mutants showed a rough, rather than the usual smooth, colony morphology and a greatly increased LD50 compared with wild-type. At least four of these bacterial species, B. anthracis, 2R. C. Williams, A. Wipat, and C. R. Harwood, unpublished results. S. aureus, S. gordonii, and S. pneumoniae(22Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1081-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), also encode a second homologue of SecY, namely SecY2, indicating that they have a specialized transporter, SecY2-SecA2, for the export of a subset of secretory proteins. In the case of S. gordonii, this secondary transporter is required for the transport of a large serine-rich surface protein (GspB) that contributes to platelet binding. Similarly, B. subtilis encodes five signal peptidases, SipS, SipT, SipU, SipV, and SipW (23Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Although all are able to process secretory preproteins, only SipS and SipT are essential for viability; viability is maintained in the presence of either SipS or SipT but not when both are deleted (24Bron S. Bolhuis A. Tjalsma H. Holsappel S. Venema G. van Dijl J.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Tjalsma H. Noback M. Bron S. Venema G. Yamane K. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25983-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The remaining signal peptidases have a minor role in protein secretion. The endoplasmic reticulum (type SipW, for example) appears to be required for the processing of two spore-associated preproteins, namely pre-TasA and pre-YqxM (26Stover A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1664-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stover A.G. Driks A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again these data indicate that, where they occur, paralogous components of secretory pathways are required for the processing of a subset of protein substrates. In relation to the B. anthracis PrsA homologues, two questions arise. First, when and, in the case of spore-associated proteins, where are these proteins synthesized? Second, are individual PrsA proteins associated with specific translocators such as SecY-SecA, SecY2-SecA2, or, possibly, even the twin-arginine transporter (28Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H.

https://openalex.org/W1970094694,"Ssu72 is an essential and highly conserved protein involved in mRNA transcription and 3′-end processing. The biochemical function of Ssu72 was so far unknown. We report here evidence that Ssu72 is a phosphatase that resembles protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). First, recombinant Ssu72 cleaves the phosphotyrosine analogue p-nitrophenylphosphate, and this catalytic activity is impaired by PTPase-inhibiting agents. Second, the Ssu72 sequence contains the CX 5R signature motif of PTPases; mutation of the catalytic cysteine in this motif abolishes Ssu72 activity in vitro and has been shown to confer lethalityin vivo. Third, secondary structure prediction and site-directed mutagenesis predict that Ssu72 adopts the fold of PTPases of the low molecular weight family. Distinguishing features, such as a short “aspartate loop” at the active site, suggest however that Ssu72 is the founding member of a new phosphatase subfamily. The novel Ssu72 activity may regulate coupling events during mRNA biogenesis. Ssu72 is an essential and highly conserved protein involved in mRNA transcription and 3′-end processing.

The novel Ssu72 activity may regulate coupling events during mRNA biogenesis. RNA polymerase II C-terminal repeat domain cleavage and polyadenylation factor protein tyrosine phosphatase column volume dithiothreitol p-nitrophenylphosphate transcription factor Over the last few years a wealth of biochemical and genetic data have revealed extended coupling between nuclear events of gene expression (1Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 2Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). In particular, transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 is coupled to mRNA processing, including 5′ capping and splicing and 3′-end formation of the transcript. This coupling is achieved by the binding of mRNA processing factors to the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD), a mobile extension of the catalytic core of pol II (3Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The CTD becomes phosphorylated during transcription initiation and remains phosphorylated during RNA chain elongation. Several CTD kinases have been described (4Prelich G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but only one CTD phosphatase, called Fcp1, is known (5Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 6Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition to pol II, several other proteins of the transcription machinery are phosphorylated (7Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and RNA processing complexes contain phosphoproteins as well. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events are thus crucial for the regulation of transcription-coupled mRNA processing. Ssu72 was originally identified in a yeast genetic screen. A mutation in the ssu72 gene enhances a defect in the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) that confers a shift in the transcription start site (8Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ssu72 binds directly to TFIIB (9Wu W.H. Pinto I. Chen B.S. Hampsey M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 643-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it also interacts with pol II, both genetically and physically (10Pappas Jr., D.L. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast Ssu72 is a subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF), which together with cleavage factor I and poly(A) polymerase is sufficient for mRNA 3′-end formation (11Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar). Because RNA 3′-end formation and transcription termination are interlinked, and because Ssu72 functions also during transcription initiation, Ssu72 may be involved in a possible coupling between transcription termination and initiation (1Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Recent data show that Ssu72 is also involved in transcription elongation (11Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Ssu72 mutation can increase pol II pausing and can counteract the toxicity of 6-azauracil, an inhibitor of pol II elongation (11Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast Ssu72 is essential for viability (8Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and shares 44% identical amino acid residues with its human homologue. The high degree of conservation suggests that Ssu72 has a similar function in all eukaryotic cells. Thus Ssu72 is an essential and highly conserved protein involved in eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis. However, the biochemical function of Ssu72 remained unknown. Here we provide evidence that Ssu72 is a phosphatase that resembles protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). PTPases can be divided in four families, including receptor-like, intracellular, dual specificity, and low molecular weight (lowMr ) PTPases (13Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Fauman E.B. Sapper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Ssu72 shows similarities to the low Mr PTPase family but that it also has distinguishing features. Possible functions of this novel enzymatic activity during mRNA biogenesis are discussed. Gene ssu72encoding for the 194-amino acid residue human isoform 1 was amplified by PCR from human muscle cDNA using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGCATGCCATGG CAATGCCGTCGTCCCCGCTGCGGG-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTCCTGCGGCCGCGTAGAAGCAGACGGTGTGC-3′ (mutated positions in bold, restriction sites underlined). Thereby, anNcoI restriction site and codons for two additional amino acids, methionine and alanine, were added to the 5′-end of the gene, and at the 3′-end of the gene, the stop codon was removed and aNotI site was added. PCR products were digested and ligated into pET28b (Novagen), resulting in a construct that encodes for the Ssu72 polypeptide chain plus a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. After transformation of ligation products into Escherichia coliXL1 blue cells, plasmid DNA was isolated, and DNA from positive clones was sequenced. The resulting DNA sequence of gene ssu72agrees with the published sequence (10Pappas Jr., D.L. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but deviates from the data base entry for PNAS-120 (NCBI accession number AAK07538) at two amino acid positions. Apparent mutations encode for residues Lys-182 and Ser-183 instead of Arg-182 and Val-183, respectively. Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with the two step PCR overlap extension method. The mutated gene ssu72 C12S was amplified from the cloned ssu72 plasmid DNA in two steps. In the first step, two independent PCR reactions were carried out. The first reaction was carried out with a T7 promoter forward primer and the primer 5′-GCTCCGGTTCTGGTTGCTCGAGCT CACCACCGCCACCCG-3′. In the second reaction we used the reverse complement counterpart to the latter primer and a T7 terminator reverse primer. In the second step, the entire mutated gene was amplified with both T7 primers from the PCR products of the first step. The resulting PCR product was digested with NcoI and NotI and ligated into pET28b (Novagen). For amplification of mutated genes ssu72 R18K, D140A, and D143A, the primers 5′-GTTGTGCGCCTCCATGCTCTT GTTCTGGTTGCTCGAGCAC-3′, 5′-CCTGGATGGCCACATTGACCACGTGC-3′, and 5′-GCCTCCTCGTGGTT CGCCTGGATGTCCAC-3′ were instead used in the first step, respectively, together with their reverse complement counterparts. Plasmid DNA harboring the human gene ssu72 was transformed into E. coliBL21 DE3 CodonPlus RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and kanamycin, both at concentrations of 50 μg/ml. Once the cell culture reached an A 600 of 0.5, temperature was reduced to 20 °C, and cells were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown over night. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. All protein variants were purified as follows. Cell walls were broken with a French press followed by DNase I (Roche Applied Science) incubation on ice for 20 min. The slurry was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 20 column volumes (CV) of buffer A followed by 5 CV of buffer B (buffer A but with 300 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted with buffer B containing in addition 250 mmimidazole. Eluted proteins were diluted with 8 volumes of buffer C (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT) and bound to a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 2 CV of buffer C, and the protein was eluted in a gradient of 25 CV from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer C. Peak fractions were applied to a Superose 12 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Protein purity was judged by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant Ssu72 migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa compared with a theoretical molecular mass of 24.0 kDa. In size exclusion chromatography, Ssu72 migrated like a globular protein of around 50 kDa molecular mass, suggesting that Ssu72 forms a stable homodimer. Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Under near physiological buffer conditions, Ssu72 was highly soluble and could be concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Pure protein samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cleavage ofp-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) was used to characterize the enzymatic activity of Ssu72. Formation of thep-nitrophenylate product was followed in real time by measuring absorbance at 405 nm (ε405 = 18 mm−1cm−1) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The pH optimum for pNPP cleavage was determined in steps of 0.5 pH units by measuring product absorbance after cleavage of 5 mm pNPP by 0.9 μm Ssu72 after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. For assays between pH 4.5 and 7.5, 40 mm sodium citrate-HCl buffer was used. Between pH 7.5 and 9.0, 40 mm Tris-Cl buffer was used. For determination of the temperature dependence of pNPP cleavage in the range of 25 to 50 °C, product formation was monitored in steps of 5° after a 20-min incubation of 5 mm pNPP and 0.9 μm Ssu72 in 40 mm sodium citrate-HCl buffer, pH 6.5. For reactions that included divalent metal ions, the buffer was replaced by 50 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, to circumvent the chelating effect of citrate, and samples were incubated for 20 min. For all inhibitor studies, product formation after a 20-min incubation was measured for a substrate concentration of 5 mm. The inhibitory anions [BeF3]− and [AlF4]− were generated in situ by the addition of 1 mm NaF and 100 μmBeCl2 or AlCl3, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 9 volumes of 1 mNa2CO3. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were determined by measuring initial reaction rates at various pNPP concentrations in 50 mm citrate-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.9 μmSsu72. Data were fitted to Lineweaver-Burk equations with the program Origin. The inhibitory constant for phosphate was determined by measuring K m values at various inhibitor concentrations followed by graphical evaluation. By visual inspection of the Ssu72 amino acid sequence, we identified the signature motif11VCX 5RS19, which is typical for PTPases. This motif comprises a cysteine and an arginine residue that form part of the active site in all PTPases and are involved in catalysis (15Ramponi G. Stefani M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In PTPases, the cysteine residue is generally responsible for the nucleophilic attack of the substrate phosphorus atom, leading to the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate, whereas the arginine residue is involved in stabilization of the transition state (16Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Except for the signature motif, there is no apparent sequence homology between Ssu72 and PTPases. To test Ssu72 for a potential phosphatase activity, we cloned human Ssu72, over-expressed the protein in E. coli, and purified it to apparent homogeneity (see “Experimental Procedures”). We then subjected the purified recombinant protein to a colorimetric assay based on cleavage of the phosphotyrosine analogue pNPP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Highly purified recombinant Ssu72 could indeed cleave pNPP. Ssu72 activity was strongly dependent on the pH of the buffer and was highest at pH 6.5. At pH 6.0, the protein showed 15% of its maximum activity, and below pH 5.5, protein precipitation essentially abolished activity. From pH 6.5 to 9.0, activity progressively decreased to about 10% of the maximum. The temperature optimum for Ssu72 activity was reached at 40 °C, but the protein showed 86% of its maximum activity at 37 °C. To minimize experimental errors and to avoid long incubation times that could lead to enzyme inactivation, further experiments were performed at pH 6.5 and 37 °C under near physiological conditions. Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Lineweaver-Burk analysis revealed a K m value for pNPP of 3.6 mm (Fig. 1), comparable with values reported for the dual specificity phosphatase VHR (17Denu J.M. Zhou G.

Open table in a new tab We next tested whether known phosphatase-inhibiting agents had an effect on Ssu72 activity (Fig. 2 A). The anion [BeF3]−, a potent inhibitor of phosphatases that form phosphoaspartate intermediates (19Yan D. Cho H.S. Hastings C.A. Igo M.M. Lee S.Y. Pelton J.G. Stewart V. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Cho H. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), did not show an effect on Ssu72 activity. Similar results were obtained with the anion [AlF4]−. In contrast, vanadate ions strongly inhibited Ssu72 activity. The addition of 1 mm orthovanadate reduced product formation below 5%. Phosphate ions also inhibited Ssu72 activity but not as strongly as vanadate. Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed that phosphate acts as a competitive inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). The K i value for phosphate, 4.3 mm, is close to theK m value for pNPP. This shows that phosphate efficiently competes with pNPP for binding to the active site, suggesting that Ssu72 affinity for pNPP is governed by the binding of the phosphoryl group. The influence of divalent metal ions on Ssu72 activity was also examined (Fig. 2 A). The addition of 1 mmMg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ had essentially no effect, but at 10 mm concentrations, product formation was reduced to 60, 45, and 80%, respectively. In contrast, 1 mm Co2+, Ni2+, or Cu2+were sufficient to abolish activity. Consistently, Ssu72 was inactive after elution from a Ni-NTA-agarose column, but activity was rescued after removal of bound Ni2+ ions with a MonoQ column. In keeping with the negative effect of metal ions, EDTA enhanced Ssu72 activity slightly, most likely because of chelation of metal ion traces. Consequently, 10 mm EDTA was included in further experiments. These results showed that Ssu72 activity does not depend on metal ions, but is rather inhibited by them. The oxidizing agent H2O2 also impaired Ssu72 activity (Fig.2 C). Even at very low concentrations, H2O2 abolished catalysis after a 12-min incubation. Activity could however be recovered by adding the reducing agent DTT, demonstrating that Ssu72 oxidation is reversible (Fig2 C). Inhibition of Ssu72 by metal ions and by oxidation suggested a catalytic role of the cysteine residue in the signature motif. Metal ions would mask the cysteine side chain, with the “soft” ions Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ being more effective because of their strong interaction with the “soft” cysteine sulfur atom or because of an oxidizing effect in the case of Cu2+. Consistently, H2O2 would inactivate the cysteine side chain by oxidizing it to sulfenic acid (21Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). To test directly whether residues in the signature motif are required for Ssu72 activity, we mutated cysteine 12 and arginine 18 to serine and lysine, respectively, purified the resulting Ssu72 variants, C12S and R18K, and subjected them to pNPP cleavage assays. The variant C12S did not cleave pNPP even after incubation for 24 h, showing that cysteine 12 is essential for Ssu72 activity. The variant R18K retained only very low activity, and the catalytic reaction stopped after 10 min, so that kinetic parameters could not be determined. This points to a crucial catalytic role of arginine 18, which does not depend solely on the positive charge of the side chain. The signature motif is found at different locations within the polypeptide sequence of various PTPase families. In receptor-like and intracellular PTPases, the signature motif is found in the second half of the catalytic domain, in dual specificity PTPases it is located near the middle of the sequence, and in low Mr PTPases it is located in the N-terminal region (22Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because the signature motif of Ssu72 is also found near the N terminus, and because an asparagine residue within the motif is conserved between Ssu72 and low Mr PTPases (23Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but not in other PTPase families, Ssu72 may be related to low Mr PTPases. A relationship between Ssu72 and lowMr PTPases is strongly supported by secondary structure prediction (program PHD (24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar)), which revealed that Ssu72 is a mixed α/β protein that shows essentially the same succession of secondary structure elements as the lowMr PTPases (Fig.3; Refs. 23Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Su X.-D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, and 26Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Lin D. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21714-21720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences within the predicted secondary structure elements revealed weak homology between Ssu72 and enzymes of the lowMr family (Fig. 3), suggesting that the fold of the proteins is the same. The signature motif is predicted to form the loop region between the N-terminal β-strand and the subsequent α-helix, consistent with structures of low Mr PTPases (22Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition to the cysteine and arginine residues in the signature motif, the active site of PTPases comprises a crucial aspartate residue (15Ramponi G. Stefani M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,22Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In sequences of the low Mr PTPase family, this aspartate is found about 110 residues C-terminal of the signature motif (Fig. 3). In the three-dimensional structure of PTPases, the aspartate is part of a flexible loop, here referred to as the aspartate loop, near the entrance to the active site (23Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on the assumption that the fold of Ssu72 resembles that of lowMr PTPases, we predicted a region in Ssu72 that corresponds to the aspartate loop (Fig. 3). Indeed this region comprises the two aspartates 140 and 143. Whereas aspartate 143 is invariant, aspartate 140 is highly conserved and is a glutamate inArabidopsis thaliana Ssu72. To test whether one of the two aspartate residues corresponds to the active site aspartate in PTPases, we individually mutated the two residues to alanine, purified the resulting Ssu72 variants D140A and D143A, and quantified their activities with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The variant D140A showed a K m value of 7.9 mm, twice that of wild type Ssu72, and aV max value 10-fold lower than that of wild type (Table I). The variant D143A showed a 7-fold higherK m value, but its V max value was 3-fold lower than that of wild type Ssu72 (Table I). In contrast to the differences in K m values, Ssu72 wild type and variant D143A had comparable specific activities, but the variant D140A showed a 10-fold lower specific activity than wild type (Table I). Overall, both aspartate mutants of Ssu72 show a decreased catalytic activity, which is reflected in the lowkcat /K m values (Table I). The kinetic parameters suggest that aspartate 140 is important for transition state stabilization, whereas aspartate 143 is more important for substrate binding. These results establish the region of Ssu72 comprising aspartates 140 and 143 as the counterpart of the catalytically important aspartate loop of PTPases. We report here three lines of evidence suggesting that Ssu72 is a phosphatase that resembles PTPases. First, Ssu72 can cleave the phosphotyrosine analogue pNPP and its catalytic activity is impaired by known PTPase-inhibiting agents. Second, Ssu72 contains the signature motif found in all PTPases, and conserved residues in the signature motif are required for activity. Third, secondary structure prediction and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the overall structure of Ssu72 resembles that of low Mr PTPases, including an aspartate loop that forms part of the active site. Published data demonstrate an essential role of the signature motif in Ssu72 for cell viability. Truncation of an N-terminal protein part that harbors the catalytic cysteine residue is lethal to yeast (8Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, a single point mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue to serine suffices to confer lethality (8Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The gene encoding for Ssu72 was originally discovered as itsssu72-1 allele, which enhances a genetic defect in TFIIB in yeast (27Sun Z.-W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ssu72-1 allele gives rise to a 10-amino acid duplication in the N-terminal region of Ssu72 (8Sun Z.W. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The duplication corresponds to residues 4–15 in human Ssu72 and comprises the essential cysteine residue. The reaction catalyzed by PTPases generally involves two steps and three crucial active site residues. The CX 5R signature motif forms the phosphate-binding loop in the active site of all PTPases. The cysteine in the CX 5R motif acts as a nucleophile and accepts the PO3 moiety from the phosphotyrosine, generating a phosphocysteine intermediate. In a second step, the PO3 moiety is transferred to a water molecule, releasing phosphate and regenerating the enzyme. The arginine in the CX 5R motif is required for stabilization of the pentacovalent transition state. In addition a flexible aspartate loop contributes an aspartate residue to the active site that serves as a general acid/base in both steps of the reaction (13Barford D. Jia Z. Tonks N.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Su X.-D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Lin D. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21714-21720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis and inhibitor studies suggest that the reaction mechanism and active site architecture of Ssu72 is similar to that of known PTPases. Similar to PTPases (15Ramponi G. Stefani M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), mutation of the cysteine residues in the CX 5R motif abolishes Ssu72 activity, and mutation of the arginine residue dramatically reduces activity. Similar to low Mr PTPases, Ssu72 is inhibited by vanadate, which can mimic a pentacovalent transition state. In contrast, Ssu72 activity is not impaired by the [BeF3]− anion, which inhibits phosphatases that form an aspartylphosphate intermediate (19Yan D. Cho H.S. Hastings C.A. Igo M.M. Lee S.Y. Pelton J.G. Stewart V. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14789-14794Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Cho H. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The effects of metal ions on Ssu72 activity agree with similar studies of the PTPase VHR (28Kim J.-H. Cho H. Ryu S.-E. Choi M.-U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), except that Co2+ does not impair VHR activity, whereas it abolishes Ssu72 activity. Despite these structural and mechanistic similarities, some substantial differences exist between Ssu72 and low Mr PTPases. Ssu72 differs from low Mr PTPases by the presence of a C-terminal extension, predicted to form a helix-loop-strand motif, and by an insertion of more than 10 residues after the second predicted α-helix (Fig. 3). Further, a counterpart of the aspartate loop in PTPases was identified in Ssu72, but it is about 10 residues shorter than in low Mr PTPases and comprises two catalytically important acidic residues instead of one. The shorter aspartate loop in Ssu72 may be less flexible than that of canonical PTPases, where residues in this loop can move up to 12 Å upon substrate binding (29Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The structural differences in the aspartate loops are reflected in differences in their catalytic roles. Whereas the Ssu72 aspartate loop mutations D140A and D143A result mainly in a modest decrease in V max and an increase in K m, respectively, mutation of aspartate 129 in bovine low Mr PTPase did not change theK m value but led to a more than 2000-fold decrease in V max (30Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the aspartate loop may also account for a weaker substrate affinity and a lower specific activity of recombinant Ssu72 when compared with some lowMr PTPases (Table I). A candidate Ssu72 substrate is the phosphorylated pol II CTD, which coordinates mRNA transcription and processing. The CTD consists of YSPTSPS heptapeptide repeats, which can be phosphorylated at the tyrosine 1 in mammalian cells (31Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In yeast, tyrosine 1 phosphorylation has not been reported, but it may occur, as substitution of tyrosine 1 by phenylalanine is lethal (32West L.M. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-12333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that Ssu72 is a CTD tyrosine phosphatase, Ssu72 mutation impairs pol II transcription but does not affect pol I and pol III (11Dichtl B. Blank D. Ohnacker M. Friedlein A. Roeder D. Langen H. Keller W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1139-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), both of which lack a CTD. Recombinant Ssu72, however, does not cleave synthetic CTD phosphotyrosine peptides or isolated phosphotyrosine (not shown). Thus Ssu72 could in principle function as a phosphotyrosine-binding protein, perhaps as an anchor that jams CPF to phosphorylated pol II, complementing known CTD-interacting subunits of CPF (33Barilla D. Lee B.A. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 445-450PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ssu72 phosphatase activity may depend on the complete target protein or may be stimulated by an activating factor, similar to the stimulation of the CTD phosphatase Fcp1 by TFIIF (34Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ssu72 activity may also depend on phosphorylation or on association with a small molecule, as shown for some low Mr PTPases (15Ramponi G. Stefani M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteins other than pol II could be the target of Ssu72 activity, but few tyrosine-phosphorylated nuclear proteins are known, perhaps because of the difficulty in detecting this transient modification. Finally, Ssu72 activity could also target nucleic acids. We have discovered an essential phosphatase/phosphoprotein-binding activity residing in the Ssu72 protein that is intimately associated with the mRNA transcription/processing apparatus. It is likely that this novel Ssu72 activity regulates aspects of the coupling between nuclear gene expression machines."

This inhibitory pathway is operative in detergent-resistant membrane fractions where cAMP-elevating agents activate Csk, resulting in a concomitant decrease in Src activity.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). In mammals, eight different SFKs have been described (2Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Each member has a distinct unique domain, but all SFKs have in common that they contain acylation site(s) for membrane localization and single SH3, SH2, and protein-tyrosine kinase domains (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In addition, SFKs contain two critical tyrosine residues (corresponding to Tyr527 and Tyr416 in Src) important for overall regulation of SFK activity. When phosphorylated by the ubiquitously expressed C-terminal Src kinase, Csk, the C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr527) interacts with the SH2 domain, resulting in repression of the catalytic activity (4Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H.

The other regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr416) is located in the activation loop, and autophosphorylation of this site is required for full catalytic activity. Thus, induction of Src kinase activity involves sequential displacement of the SH2 domain from phosphorylated Tyr527 and/or dephosphorylation of Tyr527 (by PTPases such as RPTPα) (10Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and subsequent autophosphorylation of Tyr416. The importance of Csk-mediated regulation of Tyr527 is illustrated by the fact that disruption of thecsk gene is embryonically lethal, and studies of cell lines established from these animals revealed that although Src expression levels were reduced, relative Src kinase activity was increased 5–15-fold (11Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This was associated with very low levels of Tyr527 phosphorylation in Src, whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr416 was highly increased (11Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Due to single or double acylations, SFKs are associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and typically partition into detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), which is suggested as an overall term including both lipid rafts and caveolae (13Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar). Data indicate that lipid rafts and caveolae function as platforms for the signal-transducing machinery (14Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) and serve for example to position kinases and their substrates in close proximity for signal transduction events to occur rapidly upon the appropriate signal. The functional significance of lipid rafts as signaling units has best been characterized downstream of the T cell receptor, where the integrity of lipid rafts has been shown essential for proper signaling (15Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Several signal transduction pathways induce SFK activity, including immunoreceptors, cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), integrins, and receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. the EGF and the PDGF receptors (EGFRs and PDGFRs, respectively)) (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Both EGFRs and PDGFRs are activated by dimerization followed by trans-autophosphorylation, giving rise to docking sites for a variety of signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, Grb2/Sos, SHC, and Cbl. Prior to ligand binding, 40–607 of the EGFRs associate with DRMs, but rapidly after ligand binding, the receptors migrate out of DRMs and into clathrin-coated pits, where receptor-mediated endocytosis will occur (16Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cbl plays a dual role in the sorting and degradation process of the receptors. First, Cbl binds to and ubiquitinylates the phosphorylated receptors and thus sorts them for degradation by the proteasome. Second, Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl induces conformational changes in Cbl. This facilitates binding of the CIN85-endophilin complex and subsequent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the activated receptors (18Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 19Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). DRM-associated SFKs are negatively regulated through C-terminal phosphorylation catalyzed by a DRM-associated pool of Csk (20Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K.

Csk is recruited to membrane microdomains via binding of its SH2 domain to phosphorylated Tyr317 in the phosphoprotein Cbp/PAG, which is ubiquitously expressed and partitions exclusively into the DRM fraction (20Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 21Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E.

Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A similar SH2-phosphotyrosine-mediated interaction has recently been demonstrated between Csk and Tyr14 in caveolin, which is an important constituent of caveolae (24Cao H. Courchesne W.E. Mastick C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8771-8774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to spatial regulation, different mechanisms for modulation of Csk kinase activity have been described. First, Csk kinase activity is induced 2–4-fold by binding of the Csk SH2 domain to Cbp/PAG (25Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Second, Gऔγ can also increase Csk kinase activity 2-fold, probably via interaction with the catalytic domain (26Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Last, Csk kinase activity can be regulated via covalent modification as well; in T cells, we recently demonstrated a 2–4-fold induction of Csk phosphotransferase activity after protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser364 in Csk, with a concomitant increase in C-terminal inhibitory phosphorylation of lipid raft-associated Lck (23Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PKA, Csk, and SFKs are present in all cell types. Therefore, we hypothesized that PKA-mediated Csk activation could regulate C-terminal phosphorylation and activity of other SFKs in addition to Lck. Here, we demonstrate that an adenylyl cyclase (AC)-PKA-Csk inhibitory pathway down-regulates the kinase activity of Src in both human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of a general principle for PKA-mediated inhibition of SFKs through activation of Csk. We further suggest that the PKA-Csk-mediated Src down-regulation plays an important role in modulating signaling downstream of Src. EGF, prostaglandin E2, and methyl-औ-cyclodextrin were purchased from Sigma;n-octyl-औ-d-glucoside was from U.S. Biochemical Corp.; and H89 and forskolin were from Calbiochem. Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Csk, anti-LAT, anti-Grb2, anti-HA, and antibodies toward PKA subunits RIα and C were as before (22Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol.

The phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies toward Tyr416 and Tyr527 in Src were from BIOSOURCEInternational (catalog no. 44-660 and 44-662, respectively), whereas monoclonal anti-Src antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (clone GD11). Anti-caveolin (catalog no. C37120-150/610407) was from Transduction Laboratories, and both anti-Cbl and anti-EGFR were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (catalog no. sc-170 and sc-120, respectively), and anti-FAK was from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog no. 05-537). PKA-substrate phosphospecific antibody (abbreviated anti-RXX(PS/PT), where pS and pT represent phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, respectively) was purchased fromCell Signaling Technology and is reactive toward phosphorylated threonine with arginine in position −3 or toward phosphoserine with arginine in position −2 or −3. The antibody that recognizes Src only when it is not phosphorylated on Tyr416(nonphospho-416) was also purchased from Cell Signaling Technology(catalog no. 2102). Anti-Cbp/PAG was kindly provided by Dr. Václav Horejsı́ (Institute of Molecular Genetics AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic). The human leukemia T cell line Jurkat TAg, a derivative of the Jurkat cell line stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen, was kept in logarithmic growth in RPMI medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells, purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), catalog no. CRL-1573) and mouse NIH-3T3 and NIH-3T3-A14 cells (mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing insulin receptor, kindly provided by Boudewijn Burgering, University Medical Center of Utrecht, The Netherlands) were kept in logarithmic growth in minimal essential medium supplemented with glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, 107 fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) and split by trypsination at less than 807 confluence. When indicated, cells were serum-starved for 12–16 h before cell stimulation. For transfections, Jurkat TAg cells (2 × 107) in 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM were mixed with 10 ॖg of each DNA construct in electroporation cuvettes with a 0.4-cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad) and subjected to an electric field of 250 V/cm with 960-microfarad capacitance. The cells were expanded in complete medium and harvested 20 h post-transfection. Transfection of HEK293, NIH-3T3, and NIH-3T3-A14 cells were performed with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instruction (1:2.5 DNA/LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM). After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, the transfection solution was removed, and regular medium was added. Cells were harvested by trypsination 20–24 h later. Isolation of detergent-resistant membranes was performed as described in detail elsewhere (27Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of an ice-cold standard lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 0.77 Triton X-100 with 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) by 10 pestle strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, loaded at the bottom of a 40 to 57 sucrose gradient (in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 20 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected from the top. In the presence of ATP (1 mm) and MgCl2 (15 mm), DRM fractions were stimulated with or without forskolin (100 ॖm, 10 min if not otherwise stated) or prostaglandin E2 (100 ॖm, 2 min if not otherwise stated) at 30 °C; thereafter, either cAMP measurements or immunoprecipitations were conducted. Mixed DRM fractions subjected to immunoprecipitations were always solubilized with 50 mmn-octyl-औ-d-glucoside. Cells were stimulated with forskolin (100 ॖm, 10 min if not otherwise stated) or prostaglandin E2 (100 ॖm, 2 min if not otherwise stated) in the absence and presence of EGF (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C and then disrupted in ice-cold standard lysis buffer containingn-octyl-औ-d-glucoside (50 mm) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. After incubation at 4 °C for a minimum of 4 h, protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Src was immunoprecipitated by using monoclonal Src antibodies (clone GD11; Upstate Biotechnology) and washed three times in standard lysis buffer, and then precipitates were divided into three or four. Immunoblot analysis was either conducted on precipitates directly using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies toward Tyr527 in Src or nonphospho-416 in Src or monoclonal Src antibodies or washed three times in a buffer containing Hepes (50 mm, pH 7.4) and MgCl2 (5 mm) and then assayed for autophosphorylation in the presence of 1 mm ATP at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and immunoblot analysis was performed by using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies toward Tyr416 in Src. When Src phosphotransferase activity was measured toward poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma) as a substrate, the protocol was as for a Csk kinase assay. Csk was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies and washed three times in standard lysis buffer. After three additional washes in Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) with 50 MgCl2, the Csk phosphotransferase activity was measured as incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the synthetic polyamino acid poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma). A standard protocol was followed (28Vang T. Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Levy F.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with reaction volumes of 50 ॖl containing 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP (0.15 Ci/mmol), 200 ॖg/ml poly(Glu,Tyr), and immunoprecipitated Csk. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 12 min. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated Csk in each kinase reaction were verified by immunoblotting. A standard cAMP assay (cAMP kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; catalog no. SP004) was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were quantified by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. The different Csk constructs employed have been described elsewhere (22Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding wild type Src or Src-Y527F were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog nos. 21-114 and 21-115). The Src-S17A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene) of Src wild type, and the resulting construct was sequenced (GATC Biotech). We have previously shown that cAMP/PKA, through phosphorylation dependent activation of Csk, specifically interfere with and inhibit Lck-mediated signaling in T cells (23Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that a general pathway from GPCRs via cAMP and PKA to Csk negatively regulates different SFKs, we studied HEK293 cells. These cells are of epithelial origin (proximal tubules in kidney) and express the SFK Src. Treatment of HEK293 cells with the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin and subsequent kinase assay with immunoprecipitated Src revealed strongly reduced ability to autophosphorylate on Tyr416(densitometric scanning analysis: 4.8 ± 1.5-fold decrease, average ± S.E. n = 3), whereas there was a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of Tyr527 (1.6 ± 0.1-fold increase, average ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitated Src not subjected to the autophosphorylation assay was analyzed for Tyr(P)416(1.5 ± 0.2-fold decrease with forskolin, average ± S.E.,n = 3) or Tyr(P)527 (1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase with forskolin, average ± S.E., n = 3) levels (data not shown). The phosphotransferase activity of Src toward the synthetic polyamino acid poly(Glu,Tyr) was also lowered upon forskolin treatment of HEK cells (Fig. 1B). This points toward a role for cAMP in down-regulation of the kinase activity of Src. Furthermore, the physiological cAMP-elevating agent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) had an inhibitory effect on Src similar to that of forskolin (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment of cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 blocked this effect, implicating PKA in cAMP-mediated regulation of Src (Fig. 1C). Similar results were also obtained in NIH-3T3-A14 cells (fibroblasts) (Fig.1D) and in HEK293 cells treated with forskolin in the presence or absence of another PKA inhibitor, KT5720 (100 nm, 15 min, data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that cAMP is acting through PKA via Csk to inhibit Src in these cell types. Since all SFKs have lipid modifications involved in membrane targeting, we wanted to investigate the inhibitory effect of cAMP on Src in the DRM fractions of HEK293 cells. Upon sucrose gradient fractionation of HEK293 cells, less than 0.57 of total cellular protein was found in the DRM fractions (fractions 2–5, Fig.2A) compared with the soluble fractions (fractions 9–12). Nevertheless, upon the addition of Mg-ATP to the different fractions to reconstitute AC activity, forskolin-induced cAMP production peaked in the DRM fractions (Fig.2B). Similarly, PGE2 also induced cAMP production in DRM fractions (data not shown), indicating the presence of both PGE2 receptors and AC in membrane microdomains. Furthermore, small amounts of PKA C and RIα subunits as well as Csk were found in DRM fractions of HEK293 cells, whereas substantial amounts of Src partitioned into these fractions (Fig. 2C). Since the PKA-Csk-Lck pathway in T cells has been found localized to lipid rafts, we wanted to see if a similar pattern of regulation existed for Src in DRMs of HEK293 cells. Interestingly, forskolin treatment of HEK293 DRMs reconstituted with Mg-ATP was sufficient to down-regulate the activity of Src associated with these fractions, as indicated by increased Tyr527 phosphorylation (Fig.2D), reduced Tyr416 autophosphorylation (Fig.2D), and lowered phosphotransferase activity toward poly(Glu,Tyr) (Fig. 2E). Similar results were also obtained with lipid rafts from Jurkat TAg T-cells transfected with wild type Src (Fig. 2D) and with DRMs from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Fig.2E). Disruption of plasma membrane organization by cholesterol depletion with methyl-औ-cyclodextrin lowered the amounts of Src, Csk, and PKA C subunit present in DRMs (Fig. 2F) but not in soluble fractions (data not shown). As a result, disruption of membrane microdomain integrity by methyl-औ-cyclodextrin completely abolished forskolin-induced Tyr527 phosphorylation of Src (Fig. 2G). Altogether, these data show that all of the components necessary for mediating the inhibitory effect of cAMP on Src are present in DRMs and need to be properly organized to be fully operative. Csk phosphorylates Tyr527 in Src, and the observation that cAMP induces phosphorylation of this site indicates a role for Csk. Therefore, we next studied the effect of increased cAMP on Csk activity in DRMs from HEK293 cells. Stimulation of Mg-ATP-reconstituted DRM fractions with forskolin or PGE2led to a 2–2.5-fold increase in Csk kinase activity (Fig.3A). This is consistent with previous findings in T cells (23Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In order to identify a role for Csk in cAMP-induced Src inhibition, we overexpressed kinase-deficient Csk-SH3-SH2, an interfering mutant that can displace endogenous Csk from its anchor protein Cbp/PAG in lipid rafts (22Torgersen K.M. Vang T. Abrahamsen H. Yaqub S. Horejsi V. Schraven B. Rolstad B. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29313-29318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). When expressed in HEK293 cells, this mutant was properly recruited into DRMs (Fig.3B). Interestingly, expression of this mutant caused spontaneous hyperphosphorylation of Tyr416 in DRM-associated Src (Fig. 3C) and abolished the inhibitory effect of cAMP on Src kinase activity (Fig. 3D). In conclusion, these results show that cAMP/PKA-mediated activation of Csk down-regulates Src kinase activity in DRMs of HEK293 cells. Previous studies have indicated that Src can be phosphorylated on Ser17 by PKA, but no physiological role for this phosphorylation was demonstrated (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). However, it was recently reported that direct phosphorylation of Ser17 in Src by PKA up-regulates Src kinase activity (30Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To assess direct regulation of Src versus indirect PKA-mediated regulation via Csk in DRMs, we overexpressed either wild type Src or mutant Src-S17A in HEK293 cells. The contribution of endogenous Src in these experiments was negligible due to very low expression levels compared with those of the transfected constructs (Fig.4A, upper panel). Both wild type Src and Src-S17A partitioned into DRM fractions, and compared with control transfected cells (empty vector), the levels of these proteins in DRMs exceeded endogenous Src protein levels severalfold (Fig. 4A, lower panels). Although forskolin treatment reduced Tyr416 phosphorylation of both DRM-associated wild type Src and Src-S17A, no changes in DRM association were observed (Fig.4B). Furthermore, wild type Src and Src-S17A immunoprecipitated from DRM fractions stimulated with forskolin revealed comparable reductions in Tyr416 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser17 does not appear to regulate Src activity (Fig. 4C). This is also consistent with previous findings (31Yaciuk P. Choi J.K. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Treatment with forskolin did not change the phosphorylation status of Ser17 of immunoprecipitated wild type Src, as indicated after immunoblotting with a phosphospecific PKA-substrate antibody (Fig. 4C). However, PKA was clearly activated by forskolin in these experiments, since whole cell lysates analyzed with the phospho-specific PKA-substrate antibody showed increased phosphorylation compared with unstimulated cells (data not shown). Additionally, no significant differences were seen in phosphorylation status of Tyr416 in wild type Src compared with Src-S17A in Jurkat TAg cells stimulated with forskolin (Fig.4D). This indicates that in T cells, although normally not expressing Src, direct phosphorylation of Ser17 of Src is not likely to be involved in regulation of Src kinase activity. Constitutive phosphorylation of Ser17 in Src to ∼607 stoichiometry in vivo has been reported (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Since our results showed basal Ser17 phosphorylation that was not altered by forskolin-induced PKA activation (Fig. 4C), we speculated that PKA-mediated Ser17 phosphorylation was not physiologically relevant in this cellular setting. To fully study the impact of the PKA-mediated Ser17 phosphorylation, we incubated immunoprecipitated wild type Src or Src-S17A with increasing amounts of highly active recombinant PKA C subunit in the presence of Mg-ATP. Neither in wild type Src nor in Src-S17A did PKA change Ser17 phosphorylation, and autophosphorylation assays revealed that Tyr416 phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig.4E). PKA was clearly active, since it autophosphorylated in the same assay and was able to phosphorylate and activate recombinant Csk in a separate assay (data not shown). Thus, in the absence of the inhibitory Csk, PKA neither increased phosphorylation of Ser17 in Src nor affected the activity of Src or Src-S17A. In conclusion, DRM-associated Src is not directly phosphorylated by PKA in response to elevated cAMP in the cells examined, and the inhibitory effect of cAMP on Src in DRMs is therefore not mediated directly by PKA but rather via an indirect pathway involving Csk. Since cAMP indirectly inhibits Src kinase activity, we next wanted to assess the impact of this inhibitory pathway in a setting where Src normally would be activated. The EGFR, which partitions into DRMs (Fig. 5A) (17Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), activates Src upon stimulation with EGF. We therefore wanted to investigate whether the AC-PKA-Csk pathway could intersect EGF-induced Src activation. Upon stimulation of HEK293 cells with EGF, Tyr416 phosphorylation of both DRM-associated Src and total cellular Src was increased. (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively). Similar results were also obtained with whole cell lysates from NIH-3T3-A14 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, EGF- induced activation of Src was significantly inhibited when cells were pretreated with forskolin (Fig. 5C). This could not be explained by lowered tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, since its phosphorylation status was unaffected by forskolin pretreatment in this system (Fig. 5D). However, overexpression of dominant negative Csk-SH3-SH2 fully restored EGF-induced Src activation even in the presence of forskolin (Fig. 5E). Thus, in a physiological setting cAMP can interfere with receptor tyrosine kinase-induced Src activation in a Csk-dependent manner. Since cAMP inhibits EGF-induced Src activation, we next investigated whether this could be reflected in reduced activation of proteins downstream of Src. Cbl is phosphorylated by Src upon EGFR activation (32Kassenbrock C.K. Hunter S. Garl P. Johnson G.L. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (our own observations in HEK293 and NIH-3T3-A14 cells; data not shown) and thereby contributes to receptor internalization (18Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Both in HEK293 cells and in A14 cells, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was clearly inhibited when cells were pretreated with forskolin (Fig. 6, A andB). Another Src substrate, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), was also inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation of NIH-3T3 transfected with wild-type Src, whereas forskolin pretreatment inhibited this phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the inhibitory effects of forskolin on EGF-induced FAK phosphorylation were abolished in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with Src-Y527F, which cannot be regulated by Csk (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of cAMP is dependent on Tyr527 in Src. Last, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 mediated through Src was also inhibited by cAMP (not shown). Altogether, this indicates that the cAMP/PKA pathway, through activation of Csk, intersects growth factor-induced signaling mediated by Src in DRMs. Cyclic AMP exerts inhibitory effects in many cell types and is known to interfere with mitogenic signaling from growth factors (33Burgering B.M. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Most of the studies published so far describing the inhibitory effect of cAMP have focused on the inhibition of growth factor-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling by cAMP, which is likely to be mediated by direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKA (34Dumaz N.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently described a proximal inhibitory pathway in T cell lipid rafts whereby cAMP, through PKA type I, activates Csk by phosphorylation of Ser364 in Csk, leading to inhibition of Lck and of T cell activation through the T cell receptor complex (23Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a new inhibitory pathway for regulation of growth factor-induced signaling, in which GPCRs that signal through cAMP-PKA activate Csk, which in turn directly inhibits Src activity. Several distinct mechanisms of Src activation exist. The activity of Src is tightly coupled to the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal negatively regulatory Tyr527 (11Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 36Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D.

Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and a plausible model for activation of Src includes initial dephosphorylation of Tyr527. Furthermore, Src contains several other phosphorylation sites that have modulatory effects on Src kinase activity. For instance, increased Src activity at the onset of mitosis correlates with increased phosphorylation of serine (Ser72) and threonine (Thr34 and Thr46) residues in the unique domain of Src, probably catalyzed by Cdc2-cyclin complexes (38Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 39Shenoy S. Choi J.K. Bagrodia S. Copeland T.D. Maller J.L. Shalloway D.

However, since neutralizing mutations of these residues do not abolish this activation of Src, one might speculate that these phosphorylations modulate the effects of other regulatory mechanisms acting on Src. Furthermore, Ser17phosphorylation by PKA is reported to occur in vitro(reviewed in Ref. 3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) and to directly activate Src in NIH-3T3 cells (30Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, this site does not appear to have physiological impact, since (i) Ser17 appears to be constitutively phosphorylated in HEK293 cells (this report); (ii) we do not observe activation of Src in response to cAMP in HEK293 cells, not even when Csk is displaced and the inhibitory effect of PKA on Src via Csk is abolished (this report); (iii) we are not able to show PKA activation of Src in NIH-3T3 cells (this report) as reported in Ref. 30Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar. In addition, the Src SH3 and SH2 domains contain other phosphorylation sites that can modulate activity, either by changing domain interactions or Src structure. Finally, phosphorylation-independent activation of Src can occur via Gαs or Gαi binding to the catalytic domain of Src, thereby inducing conformational changes that favor autophosphorylation of Tyr416 and subsequent Src activation (42Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, several distinct mechanisms for Src regulation exist, although it remains largely unknown what is the contribution of the different regulatory mechanisms in a given physiological setting. Notwithstanding the above-discussed modulating mechanisms, C-terminal phosphorylation seems to be a crucial master switch in regulation of Src, and factors regulating Csk activity and localization would consequently be of physiological importance (43Cary L.A. Cooper J.A. Nature. 2000; 404 (947): 945Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the majority of Src in HEK293 cells partitions into the DRM fraction, and given the established role of lipid rafts and caveolae in signal transduction, this probably reflects a physiologically relevant pool of Src involved in signal transduction. Thus, mechanisms regulating the activity of DRM-associated Csk and the total amount of Csk in DRMs are expected to affect Src signaling through caveolae/lipid rafts. Indeed, csk knockout cells reveal a phenotype with increased basal Tyr416 phosphorylation of Src and hardly detectable Tyr527 phosphorylation (11Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we show that total amount of Csk associated with DRMs is important for Src regulation, since profound effects on basal Src kinase activity are observed by overexpression of dominant negative Csk, which competes endogenous Csk from its DRM association provided by Cbp/PAG. We also show that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of endogenous DRM-associated Csk modulates Src kinase activity. This provides a model for a novel mechanism of cAMP-mediated inhibition of Src signaling by modulation of Csk activity. Importantly, this inhibitory pathway is able to interfere with growth factor-induced Src signaling, demonstrating its physiological relevance. Growth factor receptors such as the EGFR partition into DRMs, and our observations suggest that EGF stimulation results in activation of DRM-associated Src. Furthermore, physiological activation of Src upon EGF stimulation was clearly inhibited by pretreatment with cAMP- elevating agents. Previously, this has been explained by cAMP/PKA-mediated inhibition of EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, resulting in reduced activation of Src (44Barbier A.J. Poppleton H.M. Yigzaw Y. Mullenix J.B. Wiepz G.J. Bertics P.J. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in the cell line studied here, no changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR were observed, indicating that cAMP did not affect EGFR activation. In contrast, overexpression of dominant negative Csk abolished the inhibitory effect of cAMP on EGF-induced Src activation, which supports a role for Csk in this respect. Finally, the inhibitory effect of increased cAMP on EGF-induced phosphorylation of Cbl and FAK was profound. Regulation of EGF-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 was also observed (not shown). Altogether, this indicates that PKA through activation of Csk not only regulates basal activity of DRM-associated Src but potentially also intersects Src-mediated signaling in a physiological setting (model presented in Fig. 7). This also seems to be a general principle, since the same effects were seen in different cell types such as HEK293 and NIH-3T3 cells. The fact that cAMP/PKA can inhibit EGF-induced Cbl phosphorylation may have some important implications for EGFR turnover. Upon stimulation, DRM-associated EGFRs move out of DRMs and are internalized via clathrin-coated pits. Cbl directly binds to the phosphorylated EGFRs and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src (32Kassenbrock C.K. Hunter S. Garl P. Johnson G.L. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24967-24975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, a Cbl-CIN85-endophilin complex was reported to play an important role in EGFR internalization, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl is necessary for its interaction with CIN85 (18Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the novel inhibitory cAMP pathway we describe in this report would affect EGFR turnover. Further studies will be necessary to address this issue. In summary, we report the presence of a novel inhibitory pathway in DRMs, whereby cAMP/PKA through activation of Csk intersects Src-mediated signaling. Since PKA, Csk, and SFKs are expressed in all cell types, this pathway may represent a general principle for regulation of SFKs. We are grateful for the technical assistance of Guri Opsahl."

The mechanism by which IRF-7 is activated and cooperates with other transcription factors is not fully elucidated. Activation of IRF-7 results from a conformational change triggered by the virus-dependent phosphorylation of its C terminus. This conformational change leads to dimerization, nuclear accumulation, DNA-binding, and transcriptional transactivation. Here we show that activation of IRF-7, like that of IRF-3, is dependent on modifications of two distinct sets of Ser/Thr residues. Moreover, we show that different virus-inducible cis-acting elements display requirements for specific IRFs. In particular, the virus-responsive element of the ISG15 gene promoter can be activated by either IRF-3 or IRF-7 alone, whereas the P31 element of the interferon-β gene is robustly activated only when IRF-3, IRF-7, and the p300/CBP coactivators are all present. Furthermore, we find that IRF-7 interacts with four distinct regions of p300/CBP. These interactions not only stimulate the intrinsic transcriptional activity of IRF-7, but they are also indispensable for its ability to strongly synergize with other transcription factors, including c-Jun and IRF-3.

These include interferons (IFNs),1 tumor necrosis factors, and several chemokines and interleukins that signal the occurrence of the infection and orchestrate the innate immune response directed against the invading virus (1Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The production and action of these cytokines depends in large part on specific modulations of gene expression. Expression of type I IFN genes is controlled at least in part by IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), such as IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7. These IRFs differ in their pattern of expression: IRF-3 is a constitutively and ubiquitously expressed protein, whereas IRF-5 and IRF-7 are expressed at different levels in various tissues, and their synthesis can be further stimulated following exposure to IFNs. In cells where the constitutive levels of IRF-7 are low, this IFN-dependent up-regulation of IRF-7 is crucial for expression of its target genes (e.g. most IFN-α genes) (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar situation may exist for IRF-5 (6Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The activation of these IRFs involves the phosphorylation of a stretch of serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues at their C-terminal ends. This phosphorylation results in a conformational change that allows nuclear accumulation, DNA-binding, and transcriptional activation of target genes (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E.

Normally, IRF-3 and IRF-7 associate with each other, and upon virus infection they further interact with the coactivators p300 and CBP (CREB-binding protein) to form a stable complex termed VAF (virus-activated factor). VAF alone is sufficient to activate the transcription of IFN- and virus-inducible genes through their ISRE (IFN-stimulated response element), where it binds with high affinity. However, it is necessary but not sufficient to activate theIFN-β gene promoter, where it binds with much less affinity. In this case, two other virus-inducible activator proteins ATF-2/c-Jun and NF-κB are required, and together with VAF they assemble into a unique complex at the IFN-β gene promoter (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The activity of IRF-7 is modulated by virus-dependent post-translational modifications, but the exact mechanism by which it activates transcription is not fully elucidated. In particular, it would be of interest to identify the amino acids involved in IRF-7 activation, and to determine whether IRF-7 can activate transcription independently from other transcription factors or from coactivators. In this study, we examined IRF-7-dependent transcription in mammalian cells and in insect cells (S2 cells, derived fromDrosophila melanogaster embryos). Insect cells have a number of advantages that alleviate limitations associated with the use of mammalian cells: 1) they do not have any apparent IRF ortholog (IRF family members have overlapping binding specificity and can associate with each other); 2) the role of mammalian coactivators can be assessed (Drosophila CBP ortholog is functionally different enough that it cannot coactivate transcription with IRF-3 (16Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)); 3) the IFN-dependent feedback loop that leads to IRF-1 and IRF-7 up-regulation cannot operate in insect cells (no IFN or IRF orthologs); 4) there is no stimulation of virus-activated signal transduction pathways by DNA transfection alone. Here, we show that, unlike IRF-3, IRF-7 exhibits intrinsic transcriptional activity (16Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, binding of the mammalian p300/CBP coactivators further stimulates the ability of IRF-7 to activate transcription. Whereas IRF-3 and IRF-7 can independently activate transcription from the ISRE, efficient activation of the P31 sequence from the IFN-β gene promoter requires both IRF-3 and IRF-7, as well as the p300/CBP coactivators. Multiple interactions, between IRF-3 and IRF-7, and between each transcription factor and p300/CBP, account for the synergistic activation of the P31 cis-acting element and the unusual stability of the VAF complex. In addition, IRF-7 also synergized with c-Jun, and this synergy was facilitated by recruitment of the p300/CBP coactivators. Effector constructs for transient transfections of mammalian and insect cells were cloned into pcDβA and pPac vectors, respectively, using standard methods (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In these constructs, the coding sequence of human IRF-7B is preceded by a histidine tag (H6IRF-7) or a sequence encoding three flag tags, MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDHDE (F3IRF-7). Alternatively, the coding sequence of IRF-7 was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–147). Mutants of IRF-7 were generated by PCR and were all verified by sequencing. Reporter constructs have been described (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

HEC-1B (HTB-113, ATCC) cells were derived from a human endometrial carcinoma and are resistant to IFN; SAN cells were derived from a human glioblastoma and are lacking type I IFN genes; 293T cells are a SV40 large T antigen expressing highly transfectable derivative of 293 cells, which were derived from human embryonic kidney cells transformed with human adenovirus type 5.

Mammalian cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 1 ml of a precipitate containing 10 μg of reporter, 5 μg of effector plasmid (except for Gal4, 1 μg), 5 μg of pCMV-lacZ and pSP72 to a total of 25 μg (5–9 μg) for 18 h, trypsinized, aliquoted for further treatments, and harvested 3 days after transfection. S2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (3 million cells in 3 ml), transfected the next day with 0.3 ml of a precipitate containing 250 ng of hsp82lacZ, 500 ng of reporter plasmid, and effector plasmid mixtures as indicated in the figure legends (with pPac added to a total of 5.75 μg), and harvested 2 days after transfection. CAT activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured in extracts of transfected cells (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

In vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates were performed exactly according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the TnT kit (Promega), linearized pcDβA effector plasmids, and T7 RNA polymerase. Whole cell extract preparation, binding, and PAGE conditions for EMSA were as described (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

Immunoblotting, after SDS-PAGE was performed as described (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

The chemiluminescence detection system was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GST-CBP-N, -M, -C, -p300-N, -M, and C were described previously (20Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y.

GST and GST fusions were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 and purified as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences), and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol.35S-Labeled in vitro translated proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by two washes with binding buffer and two washes with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. Extracts from HEC-1B cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate were prepared and treated with deoxycholate and Nonidet P-40 exactly as described (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). After 50-fold dilution with binding buffer and preclearing on glutathione-Sepharose beads, the 32P-labeled proteins were incubated with immobilized GST fusions for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with binding buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated with SL-12 (anti-IRF-3) or affinity-purified anti-IRF-7 (HU36) as described (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Pulled down and immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In mammalian cells, IRF-7 is constitutively associated with IRF-3, which is present ubiquitously, and it is thus unclear whether IRF-7 can activate transcription on its own. The ability of IRF-7 to activate transcription independently from other transcription factors or from coactivators was tested in S2 cells. Because S2 cells lack the IFN system, IRF-7 cannot be activated through the virus-dependent pathway. However, IRF-7 can be made constitutively active in mammalian cells either by deletion of an internal inhibitory domain or by glutamic acid (Glu) substitutions of several critical Ser residues in the C terminus (5Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These residues have been proposed to be the targets of virus-dependent phosphorylation, and they fall into two sets based on sequence comparison (Fig. 1 A). We used constructs expressing human IRF-7B wild-type (WT), IRF-7E2, IRF-7E6, and IRF-7E8 (mutants of one or both sets of target residues), and IRF-7Δi (lacking an internal inhibitory domain) with N-terminal FLAG tags. These plasmids were cotransfected with a reporter driven by three copies of the ISRE of the ISG15 gene (i.e. a high affinity binding site for IRFs), in the presence or absence of mammalian p300/CBP (Fig. 1 B). Expression of IRF-7B WT, IRF-7E6, or IRF-7E8 alone resulted in minimal activity of the ISREx3CAT reporter, whether the p300/CBP coactivators were coexpressed or not. By contrast, expression of IRF-7Δi significantly stimulated ISREx3CAT activity in the absence of transfected p300/CBP (Fig. 1 B). Coexpression of p300/CBP further stimulated IRF-7Δi activity by about 40%. This stimulation was even more significant when the concentration of IRF-7Δi was low (see below). The unexpected lack of activity of IRF-7E6 in insect cells might reflect poor DNA binding in the absence of IRF-3 with which it is normally associated. We tested this possibility using Gal4-IRF-7 fusions and a reporter, G5E1bCAT, driven by five copies of a Gal4-binding site. Gal4-IRF-7WT, E2, E6, and E8 had very low level activity in S2 cells, which was minimally stimulated by p300/CBP coexpression (Fig. 1 C, middle panel). The activity of E6 was slightly stronger than that of Gal4-IRF-7 WT, which could be accounted for by the difference in their expression levels (Fig. 1 C, right panel). By contrast, Gal4-IRF-7Δi was a very strong activator, which was further stimulated by p300/CBP coexpression (3–4-fold). The fact that Gal4-IRF-7Δi was much more potent than IRF-7Δi in S2 cells (compare Fig. 1, B with C, left panel, and note the different scales), suggests that IRF-7Δi bound DNA relatively weakly. Thus, IRF-7Δi activated transcription in insect cells, demonstrating that IRF-7 can activate transcription independently from other IRFs. However, IRF-7E6 failed to do so, despite the ability of a very similar construct, IRF-7(D475–487), to function as a constitutive activator in 293T cells. IRF-7(D475–487) is a mutant form of hIRF-7A, where the Ser residues modified in IRF-7E6 have been mutated to aspartic acid (Asp) instead of Glu (21Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); IRF-7A differs from IRF-7B used in this study by an extra 29 aa after position 226. To understand the basis for this unexpected difference, we examined the activity of a variety of IRF-7B mutants in human cells. We first tested our IRF-7E6 mutant in 293T cells and confirmed that, as described for IRF-7(D475–487) (21Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), it was constitutively active and virus infection did not appreciably stimulate its activity (data not shown). However, the use of 293T cells for such experiments might be problematic (limitations 1–4, see Introduction). Therefore, we examined the phenotypes of a panel of hIRF-7B mutants by doing cotransfections in SAN cells. These cells lack type IIFN genes, avoiding the complication of a feedback loop, and transfection per se does not activate virus-dependent pathways as effectively as in 293T cells (limitations 3 and 4). We used the P31x2CAT reporter, which is only weakly inducible by virus alone but strongly stimulated by WT IRF-7, thus allowing the phenotypes of mutations to be clearly assessed (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The sequence and phenotype of each IRF-7B point mutants are shown in Fig. 2 A. If a residue is normally phosphorylated in response to viral infection, mutations to Ala are expected to decrease virus-dependent activity. By contrast, mutations to Glu could lead to constitutive activity or to a decrease in virus-dependent activity depending on how effectively Glu functions as a phosphoserine mimetic. Consistent with previous observations, expression of full-length IRF-7B strongly stimulated the activity of P31x2CAT, in both uninfected and infected cells (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Mutation of either set of Ser residues to Ala (IRF-7A2, -A6, and -A8) drastically reduced the ability of IRF-7 to stimulate P31x2CAT activity in virus-infected cells, suggesting that both sets of residues are involved in virus activation. Mutation of the first set to Glu (IRF-7E2) also strongly suppressed IRF-7 activity in virus-infected cells. By contrast, mutation of part or all of the second set of residues to Glu (IRF-7Em3 and E6) had no effect on virus-activated levels, but substantially increased IRF-7 constitutive activity. Combining the IRF-7E6 mutation with either Ala or Glu substitution in the first set (IRF-7A2E6 and -E8), however, led to a strong decrease in the ability of IRF-7 to stimulate P31x2CAT activity both in uninfected and virus-infected cells, suggesting that Glu residues do not serve as good phosphomimetics in the first set. In addition, we also assayed each of these mutants as fusion proteins with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain by doing cotransfections with G5E1bCAT. This approach minimized the possibility of endogenous IRF proteins being associated with the ectopically expressed IRF mutants (limitation 1). Most mutants displayed no transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 A, right panel), suggesting that the activity detected with the P31x2CAT reporter was the result of their association with endogenous IRF-3 or IRF-7 molecules. Gal4-IRF-7B WT activity was still inducible but the basal activity was significantly higher than for the native protein. Intriguingly, Gal4-IRF-7E6 showed very strong basal activity and virus infection enhanced it to levels even higher than those achieved with Gal4-IRF-7Δi (see Fig.3 C). The fact that the activity of IRF-7E6 or Gal4-IRF-7E6 could be further stimulated upon virus infection in SAN cells unless the first set of residues were mutated to Ala or Glu strongly suggests that residues within both sets were phosphorylated in response to viral infections. Furthermore, the constitutive activity displayed by IRF-7E6 or Gal4-IRF-7E6 in SAN or 293T cells is best accounted for by phosphorylation of the first set of residues upon transfection because this constitutive activity was absent when these residues were mutated or when IRF-7E6 or Gal4-IRF-7E6 were expressed in insect cells. We also took advantage of the activity of IRF-7Δi in insect cells to test the effect of Ser residue substitutions in the context of this construct. Interestingly, all the substitutions tested were more active than IRF-7ΔiWT in S2 cells (Fig. 3 A). When the IRF-7Δi mutants were tested in mammalian cells, we observed the same pattern of activity as in insect cells (Fig. 3 B for HEC-1B cells, we obtained very similar data for SAN cells, not shown). Thus, whereas our data indicate that Glu substitutions in IRF-7 cannot sufficiently mimic the virus-activated form of IRF-7 in insect cells, these mutations can still increase the transcriptional activity of IRF-7 in the context of the internal deletion mutant, underscoring the importance of both sets of residues in IRF-7 activation. The phenotypes of IRF-7B deletion mutants are shown in Fig.3 C. The shortest truncation (aa 449) led to a complete lost of virus responsiveness, and further deletions removed inhibitory sequences and uncovered a weak constitutive activation domain (aa 388, 308, and 266). By contrast, expression of an internal deletion mutant, IRF-7Δi, where aa 267–438 were removed, led to a strong activation of P31x2CAT in uninfected cells that was further increased upon virus infection (about 2-fold). It should be noted that the level of activation by IRF-7Δi is comparable with that achieved with virus-activated IRF-7B in this assay, whereas similar internal deletion constructs described by other investigators are much more active than WT IRF-7 (21Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8803-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As observed in insect cells, Gal4-IRF-7Δi had very strong transcriptional activity, about 20 times stronger than that of IRF-7Δi, consistent with relatively weak IRF-7Δi DNA binding. The functional interaction between IRF-7 and p300/CBP as seen in the transfection experiments suggest that these proteins may also interact physically. We first examined the interaction between IRF-7 and the coactivators using metabolically32P-labeled protein and three non-overlapping fragments of CBP fused to GST (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.4 B, IRF-7 associates specifically with the C-terminal 550 aa of murine CBP in a virus-dependent manner, although the interaction is much weaker than what was observed with IRF-3 in a similar experiment (16Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, endogenous virus-activated IRF-7 can interact with the C-terminal domain of CBP. We next used in vitro translated IRF proteins in pull-down experiments to further map this interaction (a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 4 C, and binding values referred to in the text below correspond to the average of at least three independent experiments). Both IRF-7BWT and IRF-7Δi proteins bound preferentially to the N-terminal region of CBP (∼18 and ∼57% of input, respectively) as compared with the C-terminal region (∼0.3 and ∼1% of input, respectively), whereas IRF-3 displayed a reversed preference (16Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As was the case for IRF-3, however, binding to the N and C regions of CBP was further mapped to the N2 and C2 domains, and interestingly binding to C2 was substantially stronger than binding to C (∼0.9 and ∼6% for IRF-7WT and IRF-7Δi, respectively). For p300, IRF-7WT and IRF-7Δi also bound to the N (∼12 and ∼30% of input, respectively) and C (∼3 and ∼12% of input, respectively) regions, but binding to the C region was further mapped to two independent domains, C1 and C2. For both p300 and CBP, weak (∼2% of input) but reproducible binding to IRF-7 proteins was also detected with the middle part of each coactivator, M. Importantly, binding of IRF-7Δi to either the N or C region, but not the M region of p300/CBP was consistently stronger than that of IRF-7BWT (about 3 times). Thus, internal deletion of aa 267–438 in IRF-7B favors a conformation that cannot only bind DNA and activate transcription on its own, but also interact more strongly with p300 and CBP. Moreover, IRF-7 proteins made more distinct contacts with the coactivators (3 for CBP and 4 for p300) than IRF-3 proteins (2 distinct contacts, (16Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the fact that the IRF-coactivator interactions were detected using protein produced in vitro (in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, Fig.4 C) and GST fusions produced in bacteria suggests that these interactions were direct and in particular did not involve IRF-3. It is noteworthy that the pull-downs using recombinant proteins were more sensitive than those using native proteins. The more stringent pull-down immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 4 Bfailed to detect the interaction with CBP-N, presumably because this interaction is affected by the presence of detergent. Latent IRF-7 does not bind DNA but virus activation or truncation of the C-terminal domain results in DNA binding activity (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We conducted EMSA experiments using the ISRE of the ISG15 gene as a probe, WT or mutant IRF-7B proteins expressed in vitro, and GST-CBP fusion proteins. We detected very little ISRE binding for IRF-7B or IRF-7Δi in the presence of GST alone (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and 7), and the same held true for IRF-7E6, E8, ΔiE2, ΔiE3, and ΔiE5 (data not shown). By contrast, truncation to aa 388 led to detectable ISRE binding (Fig. 5 A, lane 10), despite a significantly lower expression level in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 5 A, right panel). No supershift was detected in the presence of GST-CBP-C2, despite the ability of this fusion protein to interact with IRF-7 (Figs.4 C and 5 B). In the presence of GST-CBP-N, a slow migrating complex was detected with IRF-7B, IRF-7Δi, and IRF-7B1–388. The CBP-N-supershifted"

Thrombin induced iNOS protein in the Raw264.7 cells, which was inhibited by a thrombin inhibitor, LB30057. Thrombin increased NF-κB DNA binding, whose band was supershifted with anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies. Thrombin elicited the phosphorylation and degradation of I-κBα prior to the nuclear translocation of p65. The NF-κB-mediated iNOS induction was stimulated by the overexpression of activated mutants of Gα12/13(Gα12/13QL). Protein kinase C depletion inhibited I-κBα degradation, NF-κB activation, and iNOS induction by thrombin or the iNOS induction by Gα12/13QL. JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK were all activated by thrombin. JNK inhibition by the stable transfection with a dominant negative mutant of JNK1 (JNK1(−)) completely suppressed the NF-κB-mediated iNOS induction by thrombin. Conversely, the inhibition of p38 kinase enhanced the expression of iNOS. In addition, JNK and p38 kinase oppositely controlled the NF-κB-mediated iNOS induction by Gα12/13QL. Hence, iNOS induction by thrombin was regulated by the opposed functions of JNK and p38 kinase downstream of Gα12/13. In the JNK1(−) cells, thrombin did not increase either the NF-κB binding activity or I-κBα degradation despite I-κBα phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that thrombin induces iNOS in macrophages via Gα12 and Gα13, which leads to NF-κB activation involving the protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of I-κBα and the JNK-dependent degradation of phosphorylated I-κBα.

Septic shock involves hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute organ dysfunction accompanying the inflammatory and procoagulant responses. Hypotension and the signs of inadequate organ perfusion are the major manifestations of sepsis. The changes in the vascular reactivity do not depend on infectious pathogens but on disturbances in the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascade (1Venet C. Zeni F. Viallon A. Ross A. Pain P. Gery P.

The cascade of inflammatory and clotting reactions induces the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and microparticles cause the acute generation of thrombin (6Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the level of the thrombin and antithrombin complexes is higher in patients with sepsis than in healthy control subjects (7Mavrommatis A.C. Theodoridis T. Economou M.

In sepsis, the level of antithrombin III (ATIII),1 an endogenous coagulation inhibitor, is reduced as a result of complex formation with multiple activated clotting factors (8Philippe J. Offner F.

Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 3: 11-15Google Scholar). It is highly likely that the activation of prothrombin to thrombin by the coagulation pathway increases the level of unbound free thrombin in these patients. Vascular hyporeactivity is attributable to excess nitric oxide (NO) production, a key gaseous molecule inducing the collapse of the cardiovascular system, by an inducible form of NOS (11Szabo C.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as the tumor necrosis factor-α induce NO production (14Salvucci O. Kolb J.P. Dugas B. Dugas N. Chouaib S.

Activated protein C, as a natural anticoagulant, regulates the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation and attenuating the inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Protein C prevents LPS-induced hypotension by inhibiting excess NO production (16Isobe H. Okajima K. Uchiba M. Mizutani A. Harada N. Nagasaki A. Okabe K.

Macrophages, which are effector cells in eliminating microorganisms and other noxious elements, participate in many complex immunological and inflammatory processes. They produce the cytokines that recruit other inflammatory cells, which are responsible for the diverse effects of inflammation. Septic shock syndrome results from an excessive triggering of endogenous inflammatory mediators, which are released primarily by activated macrophages (19Evans T.J. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In view of the imbalance between thrombin and antithrombin in septic patients as a result of the exhaustion of antithrombin and excess NO as culminating factors in vascular hyporeactivity, this study investigated the effect of thrombin on the production of NO in macrophages. In addition, the signaling pathways responsible for the induction of iNOS by thrombin were examined. This study reports for the first time that thrombin induces iNOS through I-κBα phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB activation via the protein kinase C (PKC) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways in macrophages. Thrombin exerts mitogenic proliferation through the receptors coupled with the Gα12and Gα13 proteins belonging to the Gα12subfamily (20Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol.

In view of the uncertainty of the PKC linkage to the Gα12subfamily, we assessed whether PKC was associated with the Gα12 family in the activation of NF-κB by thrombin.

The Raw264.7 cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 ॖg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 57 CO2. Raw264.7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106/10-cm2 dish and preincubated for 24 h at 37 °C. For all experiments, cells were grown to 80–907 confluency and were subjected to no more than 20 cell passages. To compare NO production, Raw264.7 cells were incubated with 1 ॖg/ml of LPS (Escherichia coli 026:B6; Difco). NO production was monitored by measuring the nitrite level in the culture medium. This was performed by mixing with Griess reagent (17 sulfanilamide, 0.17N-1-naphthylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 2.57 phosphoric acid). Absorbance was measured at 540 nm after incubation for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed according to the procedures published previously (27Kim S.G. Nam S.Y. Kim C.W. Kim J.H.

Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to remove debris. The proteins were fractionated using a 7.57 separating gel to assess the level of iNOS, whereas I-κBα and its phosphorylated form were determined using a 127 separating gel. Briefly, the fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Cytosolic iNOS was immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-iNOS antibody, whereas polyclonal anti-I-κBα and anti-phosphorylated I-κBα antibodies were used to assess I-κBα and its phosphorylated form, respectively. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to remove debris. Activated JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK in cell lysates were immunochemically assessed using the specific antibodies, which recognized the active phosphorylated forms. The levels of unphosphorylated JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK1/2 were measured using the respective antibody directed against each MAP kinase. The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody. Nitrocellulose paper was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride or developed using ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Culture dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS. The dishes were then scraped and transferred to microtubes. Cells were allowed to swell by adding 100 ॖl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Tubes were vortexed to disrupt cell membranes. The samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing crude nuclei were resuspended in 50 ॖl of the extraction buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then incubated for 30 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 10 min to obtain the supernatant containing nuclear extracts. The nuclear extracts were stored at −70 °C until use. A double-stranded DNA probe for the consensus sequence of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) was used for gel shift analysis after end-labeling of the probe with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction mixture contained 2 ॖl of 5× binding buffer containing 207 glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 8 ॖg of nuclear extracts, and sterile water in a total volume of 10 ॖl. Incubations were initiated by addition of 1-ॖl probe (106cpm) and continued for 20 min at room temperature. In some experiments, an aliquot of nuclear extracts (8 ॖg each) was incubated with 2 ॖg of highly specific anti-p65 and/or p50 antibody (NF-κB) at room temperature for 1 h, according to the method described previously (28Cho M.K. Suh S.H. Kim S.G. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 6: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto 47 polyacrylamide gels at 100 V. The gels were removed, fixed, and dried, followed by autoradiography. Cells were grown on Lab-TEK chamber slides® (Nalge Nunc International Corp.) and incubated in serum-deprived medium for 24 h. Standard immunocytochemical method was used as described previously (29Nancy V. Wolthuis R.M. de Tand M.F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Bos J.L. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8737-8745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were fixed in 1007 methanol for 30 min and washed three times with PBS. After blocking in 57 bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, cells were incubated for 1 h with polyclonal rabbit anti-p65 antibody (1:100) in PBS containing 0.57 bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) after serial washings with PBS. Counter-staining with propidium iodide verified the location and integrity of nuclei. Stained cells were washed and examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS NT, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well dish and transfected the following day. Briefly, cells were incubated with Gα12/13W or Gα12/13QL plasmid (1 ॖg each of the plasmid DNA) and 3 ॖl of LipofectAMINE® reagent (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of antibiotic-free MEM for 3 h. Culture medium was changed with serum-free MEM with antibiotics, and cells were further incubated for 12 h to assess iNOS expression and for 1–3 h to monitor NF-κB activity. The transfection efficiency was ∼507, as determined by transfection with the lacZ reporter gene. For phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) experiments, cells were treated with 1 ॖm PMA for 18 h and transfected with Gα12/13QL plasmid. Cells were transfected using Transfectam® according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). Raw264.7 cells were replated 24 h before transfection at a density of 2 × 106 cells in a 10-cm2 plastic dish. Transfectam® (20 ॖl) was mixed with 10 ॖg of a JNK1 dominant negative mutant (JNK1(−)) plasmid in 2.5 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM). Cells were transfected by addition of MEM containing each plasmid and Transfectam® and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 57 CO2 for 6 h. After addition of 6.25 ml of MEM with 107 fetal bovine serum, cells were incubated for an additional 48 h, and geneticin was added to select the resistant colonies. In the present study, a mixture of stably transfected JNK1(−) clones were used. JNK1(−) cells had no inducible JNK activity, as monitored by phosphorylation of glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (stimulation by 10 ॖg/ml bovine collagen(I) for 1 h). The expression of JNK1, but not JNK2, was decreased 437 by JNK1(−) transfection. One-way analysis of variance procedures were used to assess significant differences among treatment groups. For each significant effect of treatment, the Newman-Keuls test was used for comparisons of multiple group means. The criterion for statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 or p< 0.01. The effect of thrombin on NO production in macrophages was first assessed. Thrombin (10 units/ml, 12 h) increased the NO production by 4–5-fold. NO production was maintained for at least 48 h (Fig.1A). Western blot analysis confirmed iNOS induction by thrombin at the time points examined (Fig.1A). LPS (1 ॖg/ml), which was used as a positive control, induced iNOS with a concomitant increase in NO production (Fig.1A). The extent of iNOS induction by thrombin was comparable with that by LPS. iNOS induction by thrombin was potentiated by the presence of serum (data not shown). In order to characterize the effects of thrombin on the iNOS expression per se, the subsequent experiments were conducted with cells starved of serum for 24 h. The effect of varying thrombin concentrations on the iNOS expression was next examined. Although 1 unit/ml thrombin (i.e.equivalent to the plasma concentration observed in healthy control animals (30Bokarewa M.I. Tarkowski A. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 30: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)) affected iNOS expression minimally, 10 units/ml thrombin or greater notably induced the protein (Fig. 1B). This was in agreement with the Western blot results. Therefore, thrombin exhibited a threshold effect. The level of thrombin was increased severalfold by sepsis with a reciprocal decrease in the ATIII levels (7Mavrommatis A.C. Theodoridis T. Economou M. Kotanidou A. El Ali M. Christopoulou-Kokkinou V. Zakynthinos S.G. Intensive Care Med. 2001; 27: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Nielsen J.D. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 3: 11-15Google Scholar). Hence, the concentration used in this study was considered appropriate for assessing the role of thrombin in sepsis. LB30057 is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a Ki of 0.38 nm (31Chi L. Mertz T.E. Rogers K.L. Janiczek N. Peng Y.W. Saganek L. Bousley R.F. Juneau P.L. Uprichard A.C. Gallagher K.P. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 2001; 11: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Treatment of the Raw264.7 cells with 1 ॖm or greater LB30057 completely blocked the induction of iNOS by thrombin (18 h), which demonstrated that thrombin induces iNOSper se presumably through the thrombin receptor (Fig.1C). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed that the iNOS induction by thrombin accompanied an increase in the mRNA level (data not shown). iNOS expression is controlled primarily by the transcription factor, NF-κB (32Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether or not the iNOS induction by thrombin was mediated by NF-κB activation, the nuclear extracts prepared from the cells treated with thrombin for 0.5–12 h were probed with the radiolabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (Fig.2A). NF-κB was activated by thrombin with a band intensity of a slow migrating p65/p50 complex being increased from 30 min to 12 h. The p50/p50 homodimer complex migrated slightly faster in the cells treated with thrombin. Supershift analysis was carried out using anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies to confirm whether or not the retarded band consisted of the p65 and p50 proteins. A 20-fold excess of the NF-κB probe abolished the band retardation (Fig. 2B). Either anti-p65 or the anti-p50 antibodies supershifted the retarded band. The addition of both anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies also caused a supershift with the reduction in the band intensity of the p65/p50 complex (Fig.2B). These results suggest that the p65 and p50 proteins were the components actively binding to the NF-κB-binding site. The specificity of the thrombin effect on NF-κB activation was verified by LB30057 (10 ॖm) (Fig. 2C). Because p65 was the major component of the NF-κB activated by thrombin, this study determined the translocation of p65 into the nucleus. The Raw264.7 cells were treated with thrombin for 30 min to 3 h, fixed, and permeabilized. Immunocytochemistry showed that the p65 protein was located mainly in the cytoplasm of the control cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the p65 protein moved into the nucleus after the thrombin treatment. The nuclear integrity was confirmed by propidium iodide staining of the identical cells (Fig. 3A). The proteolytic degradation of the I-κBα subunit preceded the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. These studies were extended to determine whether or not NF-κB activation by thrombin resulted from the degradation of I-κBα (Fig. 3B). I-κBα phosphorylation preceded I-κBα degradation. Thrombin (10 unit/ml) increased I-κBα phosphorylation at 15 min (Fig. 3B). The I-κBα level was subsequently decreased between 30 min and 1 h. Therefore, thrombin activates NF-κB through I-κBα degradation following its phosphorylation. Previously, it was reported (20Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17901-17907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that thrombin binding to its receptor stimulates the guanine nucleotide exchange of Gα12 subfamily proteins. This study was interested in whether or not the Gα12/13 subunits were responsible for NF-κB-mediated iNOS induction. Gα12QL or Gα13QL expression also notably increased NO production in the cells (Fig. 4A). In order to confirm that thrombin induced iNOS in the Raw264.7 cells through the Gα12/13 pathway, the cells were transfected with the either Gα12W, Gα13W, Gα12QL, or Gα13QL (Gα12 or Gα13 activated mutant) plasmid and then treated with thrombin. Thrombin induced iNOS in the cells transfected with the Gα12/13W plasmid, which was comparable with that by either Gα12QL or Gα13QL. iNOS was not inducible in the cells transfected with the Gα15QL (Gα15 activated mutant) plasmid, which was used as a negative control. This study next determined whether or not the activated mutants of Gα12/13 stimulated p65/p50 complex binding to the NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide. Either Gα12QL or Gα13QL increased the band intensity of the p65/p50 DNA complex (Fig. 4B). Thrombin induced cell differentiation via the PKC-dependent pathway (34Bogatkevich G.S. Tourkina E. Silver R.M. Ludwicka-Bradley A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45184-45192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The potential role of PKC in the NF-κB-mediated iNOS induction by thrombin was assessed in the PKC-depleted cells. The cells were treated with PMA for 18 h for PKC depletion, which was followed by exposure to thrombin (10 units/ml) for 24 h. Pretreatment of the cells with PMA completely inhibited both the iNOS induction and the increase in NO production by thrombin (Fig. 5A). PKC depletion also inhibited NF-κB activation, I-κBα phosphorylation, and I-κBα degradation by thrombin (Fig. 5, B and C). These results show that PKC plays a role in the I-κBα phosphorylation by thrombin. In the case of the pathways of the Gα12 protein-coupled receptors, the PKC-dependent phosphorylation is linked to Gα12/13 activation (35Offermanns S. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26044-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As an approach to determine whether or not PKC controlled iNOS induction downstream of Gα12/13, iNOS expression was monitored in the Gα12/13QL-transfected cells, which had been depleted of PKC. PKC depletion completely inhibited the iNOS induction by Gα12/13QL (Fig. 5D). The MAP kinases were involved in iNOS expression (36Kristof A.S. Marks-Konczalik J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8445-8452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we determined whether the MAP kinases including JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK1/2 controlled iNOS induction by thrombin. Thrombin activated all three MAP kinases in the Raw264.7 cells (Fig.6A). JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was distinct at 30 min to 1 h, which gradually returned toward the control levels (i.e. 3–6 h). p38 kinase was only weakly phosphorylated by thrombin. Cells stably transfected with the dominant negative mutants or chemical inhibitors were used to assess the role of each MAP kinase in the induction of iNOS. JNK inhibition by the stable transfection with a dominant negative mutant of JNK1 (JNK1(−)) completely suppressed iNOS induction by thrombin (Fig. 6B). In contrast, p38 kinase inhibition by SB203580 (10 ॖm) enhanced the enzyme expression (Fig.6C). PD98059 (50 ॖm) failed to affect the iNOS expression level. Hence, the induction of iNOS by thrombin was regulated by the distinct and opposed functions of JNK and p38 kinase. The activation of the G proteins stimulates the MAP kinases in a variety of cells (26Komatsuzaki K. Terashita K. Kinane T.B. Nishimoto I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This study determined whether or not the MAP kinase pathways were connected with Gα12/13 by using either JNK1(−) cells or chemical inhibitors. F"

Recently, two distinctive NFAT-binding sites (proximal and distal) are identified on the PPARγ2 gene (7Yang T.T. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3892-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The NFAT- and C/EBP-binding sites are located in the immediate upstream regulatory region of the PPARγ2 promoter. Whether NFAT cooperates with C/EBP to regulate the PPARγ2 gene expression remains uncertain.The significance of the PPARγ2 NFAT regulatory elements is further implicated by recent DNase I-hypersensitive site studies (31Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHS1 and DHS2) are found in the PPARγ2 gene. DNase I-hypersensitive sites represent regions that are “accessible” for transcription factor binding in the nucleosome-packed chromatin (32Veenstra G.J. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung J. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of transcription factors to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites may facilitate chromatin rearrangement and/or transcriptional activation of promoters that are actively engaged in gene expression. Thus, identification of proteins that bind to DNase I-hypersensitive sites is important to understand transcriptional regulation. The PPARγ2 distal NFAT element is located between the DHS1 and the DHS2 DNase I-hypersensitive site. The PPARγ2-proximal NFAT element is located within DHS1. The proximity of these NFAT elements to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites suggests that understanding the molecular basis of NFAT-mediated transcription will shed new light on the regulation of PPARγ2 gene.The purpose of this study is to examine the molecular basis of NFAT-mediated gene expression. We report that NFAT cooperates with C/EBP to regulate PPARγ2 gene expression. The transcription cooperation is mediated, in part, by the formation of a composite NFAT·C/EBP complex on the PPARγ2-proximal NFAT element. Promoter analysis reveals that a similar NFAT·C/EBP composite element regulates transcription of insulin-like growth factor 2, angiotensin-converting enzyme homolog, and transcription factor POU4F3 genes. Thus, the NFAT·C/EBP complex represents a novel composite regulatory element to direct NFAT-mediated gene expression. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)1 was first identified as an important regulator for cytokine gene expression (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Subsequent isolation of cDNAs reveals a broad distribution of NFAT in multiple tissues. For example, NFAT regulates expression of type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and is implicated in learning and memory (3Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). NFAT regulates expression of b-type natriuretic peptide during cardiac hypertrophy (4Molkentin J.D.

NFAT also modulates skeletal muscle fiber type by directing selective gene expression in slow oxidative myofibers (e.g. myoglobin gene and slow fiber-specific troponin I gene) (5Chin E.R. Olson E.N.

NFAT also regulates expression of fatty acid-binding protein and transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) during adipogenesis (6Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W.

However, the molecular basis that governs the expression of these NFAT target genes remains to be determined. NFAT interacts with transcription factor AP-1 (Fos and Jun proteins) to form a cooperative composite enhancer (NFAT·AP-1) and to regulate expression of many cytokine genes (11Macian F. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The cooperative induction is mediated, in part, by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. For example, the well characterized antigen receptor-responsive element (ARRE) from the interleukin (IL)-2 gene contains binding sites for NFAT and AP-1 (12Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell.

Thus, intimate associations between NFAT, AP-1, and DNA are necessary for the transcription cooperation of the IL-2 gene. Transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) plays an important role in adipogenesis (20MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

For example, members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family induce expression of PPARγ2 during adipocyte differentiation (24Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell.

Recently, two distinctive NFAT-binding sites (proximal and distal) are identified on the PPARγ2 gene (7Yang T.T. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3892-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The NFAT- and C/EBP-binding sites are located in the immediate upstream regulatory region of the PPARγ2 promoter. Whether NFAT cooperates with C/EBP to regulate the PPARγ2 gene expression remains uncertain. The significance of the PPARγ2 NFAT regulatory elements is further implicated by recent DNase I-hypersensitive site studies (31Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Two DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHS1 and DHS2) are found in the PPARγ2 gene. DNase I-hypersensitive sites represent regions that are “accessible” for transcription factor binding in the nucleosome-packed chromatin (32Veenstra G.J. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 665-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Felsenfeld G. Boyes J. Chung J. Clark D. Studitsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of transcription factors to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites may facilitate chromatin rearrangement and/or transcriptional activation of promoters that are actively engaged in gene expression. Thus, identification of proteins that bind to DNase I-hypersensitive sites is important to understand transcriptional regulation. The PPARγ2 distal NFAT element is located between the DHS1 and the DHS2 DNase I-hypersensitive site. The PPARγ2-proximal NFAT element is located within DHS1. The proximity of these NFAT elements to the DNase I-hypersensitive sites suggests that understanding the molecular basis of NFAT-mediated transcription will shed new light on the regulation of PPARγ2 gene. The purpose of this study is to examine the molecular basis of NFAT-mediated gene expression. We report that NFAT cooperates with C/EBP to regulate PPARγ2 gene expression. The transcription cooperation is mediated, in part, by the formation of a composite NFAT·C/EBP complex on the PPARγ2-proximal NFAT element. Promoter analysis reveals that a similar NFAT·C/EBP composite element regulates transcription of insulin-like growth factor 2, angiotensin-converting enzyme homolog, and transcription factor POU4F3 genes. Thus, the NFAT·C/EBP complex represents a novel composite regulatory element to direct NFAT-mediated gene expression. We thank Drs. M. P. Clark, T. Hoey, P. F. Johnson, T. Soderling, and B. M.

Trophoblasts have been proposed to play a critical role in modulating virus spread to the fetus. This paper addresses the mechanism of HIV-1 biology in trophoblastic cells. The trophoblastic cell lines BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3 were infected with reporter HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins from the vesicular stomatitis virus or various strains of HIV-1. We demonstrate that despite a high internalization process of HIV-1 and no block in viral production, HIV-1 established a limited infection of trophoblasts with the production of very few progeny viruses. The factor responsible for this restriction to virus replication in such a cellular microenvironment is that the intracellular p24 is concentrated predominantly in endosomal vesicles following HIV-1 entry. HIV-1 transcription and virus production of infectious particles were both augmented upon treatment of trophoblasts with tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1. However, the amount of progeny virions released by trophoblasts infected with native HIV-1 virions was so low even in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines that a co-culture step with indicator cells was necessary to detect virus production. Collectively these data illustrate for the first time that the natural low permissiveness of trophoblasts to productive HIV-1 infection is because of a restriction in the mode of entry, and such a limitation can be overcome with physiologic doses of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, which are both expressed by the placenta, in conjunction with cell-cell contact.

Mathematical modeling has allowed the estimation that 30% of infections occur in utero less than 2 months before birth and 65% at birth (7Rouzioux C. Costagliola D. Burgard M. Blanche S. Mayaux M.J. Griscelli C. Valleron A.J. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1995; 142: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Transmission of HIV-1 during early gestation also occurs since HIV-1 has been detected in 8-week aborted fetuses and in second trimester fetal tissues (8Lewis S.H. Reynolds-Kohler C. Fox H.E.

Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In order for the virus to reach the fetal circulation and infect the fetus in utero, HIV-1 must cross the placental barrier which is made of a double layer of polarized epithelial type cells, the cytotrophoblasts and syncitiotrophoblasts. These cells separate the maternal and fetal blood circulations and control fluxes between the two circulations. Several published reports have addressed the question as to how HIV-1 reaches the fetus. It has been shown that the placenta may allow transcytosis of the virus from the maternal to the fetal circulation (12Lagaye S. Derrien M. Menu E. Coito C. Tresoldi E. Mauclere P. Scarlatti G. Chaouat G. Barre-Sinoussi F. Bomsel M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Alternatively and/or concomitantly, the virus may infect the placenta to reach the fetal circulation and ultimately the fetus. Indeed, HIV-1 has been detected on both the maternal and fetal portions of the placenta, i.e. in decidual macrophages, leukocytes, trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, in villous endothelial cells, and CD3-expressing placental cells (8Lewis S.H.

Dis. 1999; 179: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, some authors have shown that HIV-1 undergoes productive replication in the placenta. The analysis of the evolutionary relationships of the sequences of HIV-1 clearly linked maternal sequences with associated sequences in the trophoblasts and put them on distinctive branches (3Zachar V. Zacharova V. Fink T. Thomas R.A. King B.R. Ebbesen P. Jones T.B. Goustin A.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, human choriocarcinoma cell lines (i.e. BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3) as well as isolated primary trophoblastic cells (including cytotrophoblasts from term placenta and cytotrophoblasts from term placenta induced to differentiate in syncytiotrophoblastsin vitro) and Hofbauer cells were shown to be weakly permissive to HIV-1 infection in vitro and to sustain a low level of virus replication. However, other scientists have failed to detect the presence of HIV-1 in the placenta of infected mothers and/or replication of the virus in these cells (19Tscherning-Casper C. Papadogiannakis N. Anvret M. Stolpe L. Lindgren S. Bohlin A.B. Albert J. Fenyo E.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9673-9678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it remains controversial whether HIV-1 can sustain a productive cycle in trophoblastic cells, but if indeed possible, it is clear that it is magnitudes lower than in CD4-positive T lymphocytes. The reasons behind this limited infection are ill defined but are thought to be due to factors related to the phenotype of HIV-1 in conjunction with particular cellular environments. This may include limitations in virus entry, intracellular restriction, inappropriate cellular environment, or a combination of the three (reviewed in Ref. 20Vidricaire G. Tremblay M.J. Med. Sci. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The question of viral entry is crucial because the expression of the cellular receptor CD4 of HIV-1 is very low, whereas the expression of co-receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, of HIV-1 may decline from the first to third trimester of gestation. This may account for a limited viral entry (9Mano H. Chermann J.C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1991; 7: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Al-Harthi L. Guilbert L.J. Hoxie J.A.

Immunol. 2000; 119: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the process of viral entry per se in trophoblastic cells has not been investigated thus far. A key feature of pregnancy is the production of a vast array of cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and TNF-α), hormones, growth factors (e.g. epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, progesterone, and estrogen), and prostaglandins (e.g. prostaglandin E2) in a developmentally regulated fashion by the conceptus and/or the uterus. These agents play pivotal roles during gestation and are mandatory for a successful pregnancy (reviewed in Refs. 25Robertson S.A. Seamark R.F. Guilbert L.J. Wegmann T.G. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 239-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Saito S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2000; 47: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Norwitz E.R. Schust D.J. Fisher S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some of these agents are also known to be up-regulated in vivo in HIV-1-infected patients and to modulate viral expressionin vitro (reviewed in Refs. 20Vidricaire G. Tremblay M.J. Med. Sci. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar and 28Poli G. Fauci A.S. Human Cytokines: Their Role in Disease and Therapy. Blackwell Sciences Ltd., USA1995: 421-449Google Scholar). We previously tested the ability of factors known to be present in the vicinity of the trophoblast during gestation and for which trophoblastic cells express the appropriate receptors to drive HIV-1 transcriptional activity in trophoblasts. Among all the soluble agents tested (i.e.epidermal growth factor, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 IL-12, leukemia inhibitory factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, nerve growth factor, prostaglandin E2, transforming growth factor-β, and TNF-α), only two cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1, were found to strongly activate virus transcription (29Vidricaire, G., Tremblay, M. J., 10th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, 2003, 370, Foundation for Retrovirology and Human Health, Alexandria, VA, Boston, MA, February 2003.Google Scholar). Thus, specific cytokines and/or modulatory factors present in the placental microenvironment while controlling cellular activities may also play a regulatory role in protecting the host or, inversely, in driving HIV-1 expression. More specifically, because HIV-1 may be present in too low a concentration and/or may be latent, some of these factors could be, in part, the triggering element necessary for the expression of HIV-1 in infected trophoblastic cells. This would translate into productive viral expression and spreading of the virus to the fetus. The central objective of the present work was to provide further insight on the susceptibility of human trophoblasts to a productive infection with HIV-1. To this end, we conducted experiments with both fully infectious HIV-1 particles and recombinant HIV-1-based reporter viruses pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of the broad-host-range vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) and certain strains of HIV-1. The pseudotyping strategy with VSV-G allows bypassing the natural mode of HIV-1 entry and not only broadens the natural virus tropism but also significantly enhances virus infectivity (30Canki M. Thai J.N. Chao W. Ghorpade A. Potash M.J. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7925-7933Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Contrary to previous assumptions, we demonstrate for the first time that the reason for the limited HIV-1 infection of trophoblastic cells is not linked with ineffective virus internalization because we found massive HIV-1 entry in trophoblastic cells. Rather, the subcellular distribution of viral p24 was predominantly located in the vesicular fraction, an event accounting for the weak virus production in such cells. On the other hand, we showed that trophoblastic cells possess no block in viral transcription or viral production. We showed that TNF-α and IL-1 triggered an important increase in viral gene expression. However, production of progeny virions upon treatment with these pro-inflammatory cytokines was only seen following co-cultivation with susceptible indicator cells. These data represent further evidence that the natural low permissiveness of trophoblasts to productive HIV-1 infection is associated with limitations in the early events of the virus life cycle. Our results suggest that the presence of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 in the vicinity of trophoblastic cells in association with lymphocytic cells would create favorable conditions leading to vertical transmission of this retrovirus. Considering that expression of these cytokines is highly regulated according to the stage of placental development, it can be proposed that windows of opportunity are transiently created for the induction of viral expression by extracellular factors in trophoblasts. Collectively, the data presented may explain in part the mechanism of transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus during gestation. The malignantly transformed human cell lines of trophoblast lineage BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (expressing the simian virus 40 large T antigen) was kindly provided by W. C. Greene (J. Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco). The JAR, JEG-3, and 293T cells lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), and the BeWo cell line was maintained in F-12 Nutrient Mixture (Invitrogen). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3 cells were routinely subcultured at a seeding density of 3 × 106 cells and 293T cells at 1 × 106 cells in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. PM1 cells were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The reporter LuSIV cell line, kindly provided by J. E. Clements (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD), was derived from the CEMx174 parental cell line (B-cell/T-cell hybrid) and carries the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the SIVmac239 LTR. These cells were maintained at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in selection medium made of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 15 mm NaOH, 25 mm HEPES, and supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were isolated by centrifugation through a Ficoll-Paque density gradient. PBMCs were resuspended at a density of 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 with 20% FBS, 15 mm NaOH, 25 mm HEPES and supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), 3 μg/ml of PHA-P (Sigma), and 50 units/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (kind gift of M. Gately, Hoffmann-La Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (31Lahm H.W. Stein S. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 326: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pNL4-3 is a full-length infectious molecular clone of HIV-1 and the NL4-3-Luc E−R+ vector was constructed by inserting a frameshift mutation near the env gene and the firefly luciferase reporter gene into the nef gene (32Azocar J.

Both molecular constructs were obtained through the AIDS Repository Reagent Program. The pHCMV-G molecular construct codes for the broad-host-range vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G) under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (34Yee J.K.

The pcDNA-1/Amp-based expression vector coding for the HIV-1 Ada-M (M-tropic) full-length envelope protein was generously provided by N. R. Landau (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). pHXB2-env is a mammalian expression vector coding for the HIV-1 HXB2 (T-tropic) envelope glycoprotein and was obtained from the AIDS Repository Reagent Program. pLTR-Luc and pmκBLTR-Luc have been kindly provided by Dr. K. Calame (Columbia University, New York). These molecular constructs contain the luciferase reporter gene under the control of wild-type (GGGACTTTCC) or NF-κB-mutated (CTC ACTTTCC) HIV-1HXB2 LTR (453 to +80) (35Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular construct pNF-κB-Luc contains five (5Lepage P. Van de Perre P. Carael M. Nsengumuremyi F. Nkurunziza J.

The reporter gene vectors pBlue3′LTR-Luc-A to G carry the HIV-1 LTR regions from subtypes A to G driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene (obtained through the AIDS Repository Reagent Program) (36Jeeninga R.E. Hoogenkamp M. Armand-Ugon M. de Baar M. Verhoef K. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3740-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Viruses were produced by calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells, as described previously (37Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fortin J.F. Cantin R. Lamontagne G. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3588-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were plated 16 h before transfection to reach a 50–80% confluence the day of transfection. By using the Clontech Transfection Kit (BD Biosciences), cells were co-transfected with NL4-3-Luc E−R+ along with a vector coding for VSV-G, Ada-M-env, or HXB2-env to produce the luciferase expressing single cycle pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. Fully infectious viral entities were produced by transiently transfecting 293T cells with the infectious molecular clone pNL4-3 or by co-transfection with pNL4-3 and pHCMV-G. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 24 h in complete DMEM culture medium. Pseudotypes and fully infectious viruses were collected at this point by filtering the culture media through a 0.22-μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Virus stocks were aliquoted and frozen at −85 °C for future use. All virus preparations underwent only one freeze-thaw cycle before initiation of infection studies. Virus stocks were normalized for virion content by using a p24 antibody capture assay developed in our laboratory (39Bounou S. Leclerc J.E. Tremblay M.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 of JAR and PM1 cells were incubated with Ada-M or VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 particles (200 ng of p24) in 6-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C for a period of 5 min to 4 h. Cells were next extensively washed with ice-cold PBS and trypsinized for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS. For cell entry assays, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The level of p24 was determined by an in-house enzymatic assay as described previously (39Bounou S. Leclerc J.E. Tremblay M.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For cell fractionation assays, to disrupt cellular membranes, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 1 min and broken by Dounce homogenization (three strokes, 7-ml B pestles). Nuclei, cell debris, and undamaged cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1,800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C). Supernatants containing cytosol and vesicles (including endosomes) were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in a Heraeus centrifuge. Supernatant that represents the cytosolic fraction was adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100 while the pellet which is the vesicular fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The level of p24 present in each fraction was assessed using the p24 assay (39Bounou S. Leclerc J.E. Tremblay M.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In 25- or 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks, 2–6 × 106 BeWo, JAR, or JEG-3 cells were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 7 h with luciferase-encoding HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with VSV-G (6–145 ng of p24), Ada-M, or HXB2 envelope glycoproteins (250–400 ng of p24). Cells were then washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and subcultured at 25 × 103 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates or at 50 × 103cells per well in 48-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates in 200 μl of complete DMEM culture medium. After an overnight incubation, 100 μl of medium was removed from each well and replaced with 100 μl of culture medium supplemented with the following agents: tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and interleukin (IL)-1α or IL-1β (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). After an 8- to 72-h incubation period, luciferase activity was monitored in cell lysates as described previously (40Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For co-culture experiments, 1 × 106 JAR cells were incubated in 25-cm2 tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 7 h with fully competent NL4-3 particles (400 ng of p24). Cells were then washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and subcultured at 1 × 105 cells per well in 12-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates in 1.3 ml of complete DMEM culture medium. After an overnight incubation, 650 μl of culture medium was removed from each well and replaced with 650 μl of fresh complete DMEM culture medium supplemented with TNF-α at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After a 24-h stimulation period, the infected JAR cells were co-cultured for 24 h with 4 × 105 indicator cells (i.e. LuSIV or PBMCs). Indicator cells that remained in suspension were removed from the attached JAR cells, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,200 rpm, and resuspended in the appropriate culture medium. The rescued LuSIV and PBMCs were seeded in 48-well plates at 3 × 105 cells per well. On each subsequent day, 100 μl of LuSIV or 150 μl of cell-free culture media from the PBMCs were transferred to 96-well plates and lysed. The lysed cells and culture media were frozen. Finally, luciferase activity and p24 level were assessed in lysed LuSIV and in PBMCs culture media, respectively. JAR cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using the Clontech Transfection Kit. Briefly, 0.5–1.5 × 106 JAR cells were plated 16 h before transfection in 25-cm2 tissue culture dishes. For each transfection, 5 μg of plasmid DNA was used. For the HIV-1 clades A to G transfection experiment, JAR cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of an actin promoter-driven β-galactosidase vector (pActin-β-galactosidase) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 8 h in complete DMEM culture medium. The transfected cells were then washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and subcultured at 25 × 103 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates or at 50 × 103 cells per well in 48-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates in 200 μl of complete DMEM culture medium. After an overnight incubation, 100 μl of medium was removed from each well and replaced with 100 μl of fresh complete DMEM culture medium supplemented with TNF-α at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. After an 8-h stimulation period, 100 μl of cell-free culture media was removed, and 25 μl of a 5× luciferase assay lysis buffer was added. Luciferase activity was measured as described above. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the Galacto LightTM chemiluminescent reporter assay for β-galactosidase (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Given the reported low susceptibility of trophoblastic cells to productive HIV-1 infection (22David F.J. Autran B. Tran H.C. Menu E. Raphael M. Debre P. Hsi B.L. Wegman T.G. Barre-Sinoussi F.

This goal was reached by inoculating BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3 with luciferase expressing single-cycle HIV-1 particles pseudotyped either with the envelope protein of HXB2 (T-tropic HIV-1 strain), Ada-M (macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain), or the envelope G protein of VSV (i.e. VSV-G).

Most representatives become reduced with the aid of thioredoxin, whereas some members use AhpF, tryparedoxin, or cyclophilin A. Recent research on a new peroxiredoxin isoform (type C) from Populus trichocarpa has shown that these particular types may also use glutaredoxin instead of thioredoxin. This finding is supported by the occurrence of chimeric proteins composed of a peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin region. A gene encoding such a fusion protein is enclosed in the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome. We expressed the H. influenzaeprotein, denoted here as PGdx, in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant enzyme. In vitro assays demonstrate that PGdx, in the presence of dithiothreitol or glutathione, is able to protect supercoiled DNA against the metal ion-catalyzed oxidation-system. Enzymatic assays did, indeed, characterize PGdx as a peroxidase, requiring the glutathione redox cycle for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (kcat/Km 5.01 × 106 s−1m−1) as well as the small organic hydroperoxide tert-butylhydroperoxide (kcat/Km 5.67 × 104 s−1m−1). Enzymatic activity as function of the glutathione concentration deviated from normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving a sigmoidal pattern with an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.9. Besides the formation of a disulfide-linked PGdx dimer, it was also shown by mass spectrometric analysis that cysteine 49, which is equivalent to the active site cysteine of the peroxiredoxins, undergoes glutathionylation during purification under nonreducing conditions. Based on these results, we propose a model for the catalytic mechanism.

Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). The unrestrained accumulation of these species gives rise to oxidative stress and can lead to cell damage, mutations, or even death. One issue of the reactive oxygen species detoxification concerns the decomposition of hydroperoxides. Most pro- and eukaryotic cells rely on the action of heme-containing enzymes called catalases, which disproportionate H2O2 to water and O2. Some eukaryotic cells may also use glutathione peroxidases to remove H2O2 as well as organic and lipid hydroperoxides. In addition, research over the past decades has led to the characterization of a new family of peroxidases, collectively called “peroxiredoxins” (Prxs)1 (3Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Netto L.E. Seo M.S. Stadtman E.R. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). They decompose organic hydroperoxides and H2O2 by means of thiol-containing electron donors such as thioredoxin (Trx), AhpF, cyclophilin A, tryparedoxin, or, as recently reported, also the redox protein glutaredoxin (Grx) (4Chae H.Z.

The bacterium resides in the upper respiratory tract of humans, where it generally grows aerobically, although facultative anaerobic growth is also possible (9Hollander R. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1976; 42: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Besides oxidative stress from its aerobic respiratory metabolism or as a result of the high O2 tension at the nasopharynx, H. influenzae may also be exposed to high levels of oxidants produced by the host's immune system, which uses the destructive power of reactive oxygen species to eliminate bacterial infections (10Craig J.E. Cliffe A. Garnett K. High N.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 55-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, experimental data indicate that H. influenzae has to deal with H2O2 secreted by peroxidogenicStreptococci (11Pericone C.D. Overweg K. Hermans P.W. Weiser J.N. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3990-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Whereas the existence of an H2O2-inducible catalase (HktE) has been described in H. influenzae Rd, the enzyme seems to be redundant (12Bishai W.R. Howard N.S. Winkelstein J.A. Smith H.O. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bishai W.R. Smith H.O. Barcak G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As yet, no other antioxidant enzyme has been identified that acts against hydroperoxides, making the ways in which the bacterium deals with hydroperoxide stress an interesting topic for future research. Previously, we described a glutathione amide-dependent peroxidase from the phototrophic purple sulfur bacteriumChromatium gracile, capable of reducing both H2O2 and tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) at comparable high rates (14Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Jacquemotte F. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Bartsch R.G. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20890-20897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By means of a BLAST search using its deduced amino acid sequence, we were able to identify several homologs in different bacterial species, including one encoded by an open reading frame (HI0572) enclosed in the H. influenzae Rd genome. The comparisons revealed the fusion of an N-terminal Prx region to a C-terminal Grx region, a unique feature typical for this novel family of homologs. This structure suggests that a thioltransferase reaction by the Grx moiety may be involved in the reduction of the Prx moiety (8Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D.

Grxs are small, ubiquitous thioltransferases that are specifically designed to use GSH for their reduction (17Prinz W.A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

They catalyze the reduction of protein disulfide groups and GSH-containing mixed disulfide groups either via a dithiol or monothiol mechanism (18Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In this paper, we expand our knowledge of the chimeric enzyme fromH. influenzae Rd (aptly named PGdx, as inPeroxiredoxin/Glutaredoxin) by demonstrating its abilities to protect supercoiled DNA from oxidative damage and to catalyze the in vitro reduction of H2O2 and t-BOOH using GSH as electron donor. Furthermore, we noticed the formation of a homodimer and a glutathionylated monomer during purification under nonreducing conditions. Surprisingly, kinetic studies of PGdx revealed sigmoidal kinetics with respect to GSH, normally attributed to the phenomenon of cooperativity. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA purification from gel or solution was carried out using either the Qiaquick DNA Extraction or PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Ligations were performed using Ready-To-Go T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid DNA was prepared by the alkaline lysis method on either a small scale (19Birnboim H. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar) or a 30-ml scale using the Qiagen plasmid purification kit. Chromatographic protein purification steps were performed on anÄKTA-design fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) with chromatographic equipment from the same manufacturer or with materials from Bio-Rad. Spectrophotometric measurements were taken using a Uvikon 943 double beam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Watford, UK). Reduced GSH, H2O2, t-BOOH, DTT, ascorbate, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. GSH reductase (GR; type IV from bakers' yeast) was from Fluka (Glossop, UK). Escherichia coli Trx and Trx reductase (TR) were from Sigma. H. influenzae Rd (KW20) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA; catalog no. 51907). E. coli MC1061 and E. coli B834(DE3) were used as host for cloning and expression of PGdx, respectively. AllE. coli strains were cultured at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium on an orbital shaker rotating at 200 rpm. H. influenzae Rd was grown at 37 °C under a 37 CO2atmosphere (candle extinction jar method) on an orbital shaker rotating at 100 rpm. H. influenzae Rd medium consisted of brain heart infusion liquid (Difco) supplemented with औ-NAD and hemin (Fluka, Glossop, UK). Solid media for all strains were prepared by adding agar to the liquid media to a final concentration of 1.87. When appropriate, 100 ॖg of carbenicillin/ml was added to the E. coli culture medium. The gene HI0572 (GenBankTM accession number AAC22230) was amplified by PCR from H. influenzae Rd genomic DNA (prepared as described elsewhere) (20Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using Gold Star DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and the following primers: forward primer (5′-TC CATATG TCT AGT ATG GAA GG-3′) containing anNdeI (underlined) site and the initiation codon (boldface) and reverse primer (5′-CGC GGA TCCTTA TGC AAA GTA T-3′) containing a BamHI site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface). The PCR product obtained was purified and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) prior to digestion withNdeI/BamHI. The digested fragment was cloned into an NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-11a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). An E. coli B834(DE3) expression strain was transformed with the expression construct, cultured overnight in 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin, and then transferred to fresh medium up to a ratio of 1:100. Cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8, after which isopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After induction for 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing the Complete Protease Inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science), and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and then disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Clear supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (10 × 200 mm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Proteins were eluted with a continuous gradient of 0–1m NaCl, at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The sample was applied to a CHT-2 ceramic hydroxyapatite column from Bio-Rad equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The column was washed with equilibration buffer before eluting the protein with increasing concentrations of phosphate, pH 6.8. Protein fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA) concentrator. For the ultimate purification step, we used a MonoQ column. Purified PGdx was stored at −80 °C until further use. Aliquots of the peak fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (157) performed as described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured in 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 6.5)/6 m guanidine hydrochloride on basis of the molar extinction coefficient computed from the amino acid composition using software at ExPASy (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org; ε 280 = 23,470m−1 cm−1). Mass determinations were performed on a hybrid quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK), equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. For precise measurements, the samples were first desalted by ultrafiltration on a Millipore 0.5-ml concentrator (Bedford, MA) with a molecular mass cut-off of 5 kDa. The sample was then dissolved and diluted in 507 acetonitrile, 0.17 formic acid to a final concentration of ∼2 pmol/ॖl. Tryptic digestion of PGdx was carried out by first dissolving 1 ॖl of the purified PGdx (10 ॖg/ॖl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8) and then adding trypsin up to an enzyme/PGdx ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After 4 h of incubation (37 °C), 1 ॖl of the digested protein was diluted in 20 ॖl of 507 acetonitrile, 0.17 formic acid and analyzed by quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry. The ability of PGdx to protect supercoiled DNA from oxidative degradation was assayed with either a DTT or GSH metal ion-catalyzed oxidation system (DTT or GSH/Fe3+/O2; thiol MCO system) or an ascorbate metal ion-catalyzed oxidation system (ascorbate/Fe3+/O2; nonthiol MCO system). Assays were done in a 20-ॖl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 3 ॖm freshly prepared FeCl3, 10 ॖm PGdx (except for the control, where PGdx was replaced with 10 mm EDTA), and 10 mm DTT, GSH, or ascorbate. The reactions were incubated for 40 min before adding ∼1 ॖg of plasmid BlueScript DNA. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, samples were analyzed on a 17 agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. GSH/GR/NADPH-dependent peroxidase activity of PGdx was determined using a continuous assay. Assays were performed at 25 °C in a 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 0.15 mm NADPH, 0.1 mmEDTA, and the following products each in turn added as a last component, with the others already having been added: 50 nmPGdx, 10 mm GSH, 100 ॖm hydroperoxide, and 3 units of GR. Trx/TR/NADPH-dependent peroxidase activity was assayed by adding 100 ॖm hydroperoxide to a reaction mixture containing 50 nm PGdx, 8.5 ॖm Trx, and 2 ॖm TR in 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, with 0.15 mm NADPH and 0.1 mm EDTA. Final reaction volumes were 500 ॖl each. The decrease in NADPH absorbance was continuously monitored at 340 nm. Velocity versus substrate curves for GSH, H2O2, and t-BOOH were determined using a coupled assay consisting of 0.15 mm NADPH, 3 units of GR, and 50 nm PGdx in 0.1 mmsodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, with 0.1 mmEDTA. Concentrations of GSH were varied while keeping those oft-BOOH or H2O2 constant, andvice versa. Hydroperoxides were added last. Peroxidase activity was monitored at 340 nm against a blank containing no enzyme and expressed as ॖm NADPH oxidized per min using the molar extinction coefficient of 6,200 m−1cm−1 for NADPH. All measurements were done in triplicate, and the mean and S.E. were calculated. Data were analyzed by fitting them to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v =Vmax[S]/Km + [S]), the Hill equation (v =Vmax[S]n/K′ + [S]n), or the Eadie-Scatchard equation (v/[S]n = −(1/K′)v + (Vmax/K′)) using the nonlinear least squares method. A BLAST search with the deduced amino acid sequence of the C. gracile Prx/Grx protein (14Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Jacquemotte F. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Bartsch R.G. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol.

This open reading frame, annotated as “hypothetical protein” and/or “membrane protein,” based on its hydrophobic character, encodes a 241-amino acid polypeptide chain with a theoretical mass of 26,742.5-Da and, in particular, three cysteine residues located at positions 49, 180, and 183. Alignments show the N-terminal region of Haemophilus PGdx (amino acids 1–160) to share 30–407 identity and 50–607 similarity with members of the Prx family, particularly with members of type C. The term “type C Prx” is a recently adopted nomenclature by Rouhieret al. (8Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Faÿ E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It includes those Prxs that are characterized by their short length (averaging 160 amino acids), limited sequence similarity with type A (2-Cys) and B (1-Cys) Prxs (except for the conserved sequence surrounding the strictly conserved N-terminal cysteines), and an extra cysteine residue located some 24 amino acids further down the N-terminal cysteine. Whereas this extra cysteine is lacking in PGdx, a situation also shared by the Oryza andActinobacillus homolog, identities of the N-terminal region are still higher with type C than with type A or B Prxs. Those Prxs that show the highest identity with the Prx region of PGdx are depicted in Fig. 1. Another distinguishable fact is the apparent ability of type C Prxs to use Grx instead of Trx as electron donor (8Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Sautiere P.E. Brun A. Laurent P. Tagu D. Gerard J. de Faÿ E. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This especially merits mention, since the C-terminal region of PGdx shares strong homology (527 identity, 697 similarity) with Grx3 from E. coli. This Grx-homologous domain contains cysteine residues 180 and 183, arranged in a characteristic CPFC disulfide motif, and is coupled to the Prx region via a Gln-rich stretch starting with a Pro. Depicted in Fig. 1 are the sequences of E. coli Grx3 and Populus trichocarpa Grx. The latter reduces the poplar type C Prx, which is also included in Fig. 1. BLAST searches of the H. influenzae PGdx against the Microbial Genomes data base revealed numerous as yet uncharacterized homologs, the majority of them in microorganisms implicated in human disease (Fig. 1). Similarity extends over the entire sequence, especially in the Prx region, and ranges from 60 to 957 identity and from 75 to 1007 similarity. Recombinant PGdx, of which the expression level in theE. coli cytosol was considerably high, was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” About 30 mg of pure PGdx was obtained from 1-liter cell culture. Apart from a protein band at monomeric migration distance, nonreducing SDS-PAGE also clearly visualized a second band migrating as a homodimer (Fig.2). This band disappeared with the addition of औ-mercaptoethanol, DTT, or GSH to the sample buffer but did not with ascorbate, suggesting the possibility of two monomers being linked by a disulfide bridge. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry measurements confirmed the existence of a completely oxidized dimer at 53,216.2 Da that disappeared when 10 mm GSH was added to the sample solutions (Table I, Fig.3).Table IMass spectrometric analysis of purified PGdxEnzymeExperimental massCalculated massCommentDaDaNonreduced PGdx26,915.05 ± 1.4226,914.6NM + GSH (307.3 Da) −2-Da (disulfide bridge between GSH and Cys49)1-aDetermined from a tryptic digest analyzed using mass spectrometry. −2-Da (disulfide bridge between Cys180 and Cys183)53,216.17 ± 5.0153,216.6(NM) × 2 −6-Da (3 disulfide bridges)Reduced PGdx26,610.67 ± 0.8926,611.3NM26,915.83 ± 1.1326,914.6NM + GSH (307.3 Da) −2-Da (disulfide bridge between GSH and Cys49)1-aDetermined from a tryptic digest analyzed using mass spectrometry. −2-Da (disulfide bridge between Cys180 and Cys183)Predicted masses are those for PGdx lacking the N-terminal Met (NM; 26,742.5 − 131.2 Da), as confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing (data not shown).1-a Determined from a tryptic digest analyzed using mass spectrometry.

When the nonreduced monomeric form was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we observed a peak with a mass of 26,915.1 Da, which is 305 Da higher than expected (Table I, Fig. 3). This prompted us to investigate the possibility whether the enzyme was modified by glutathionylation during the overexpression and subsequent isolation from E. coli. The addition of GSH, indeed, did reduce the mass to that of the fully reduced monomer (Table I, Fig. 3), a phenomenon that was not observed when ascorbate was added (not shown). In order to determine the location of the GSH moiety in the peptide chain, we performed a tryptic digest and analyzed the digest mixture of the reduced and nonreduced condition by mass spectrometry (spectra not shown). The mass spectrum of the reduced PGdx digest mixture contained a peak at 23,16.2 Da, corresponding to the monoisotopic mass of the unmodified peptide Thr35–Arg56. Under nonreducing conditions, this peak was absent and replaced by a peak at 2,621.2 Da, which agrees with the monoisotopic mass of the modified peptide Thr35–Arg56. To confirm this observation and the location of the modification, the peptide was subjected to collision-induced fragmentation mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 4, the MS/MS spectrum was found to be consistent with the sequence of the peptide. Fig. 4 also shows an increment in mass of 305 Da after Cys49 (note the shift of the y“ ions), which points to the GSH molecule being linked to the Cys49 residue. Supercoiled DNA is prone to nicking when exposed to oxidative radicals such as those generated by the MCO system. Therefore, PGdx was tested for its ability to protect supercoiled DNA from degradation induced by the MCO system in the presence of DTT, GSH, or ascorbate (Fig. 5). The absence of PGdx resulted in open coiled or nicked DNA, whereas the addition of 10 mm EDTA completely inhibited degradation. PGdx, in combination with DTT or GSH, was successful in protecting the DNA. When DTT or GSH was replaced by ascorbate as electron donor, the enzyme was unable to protect the DNA at a concentration that was sufficient to provide full protection against degradation when a thiol was present. We set up a reconstitution assay by which we demonstrated that PGdx can use the GSH/GR/NADPH system and that the reduction of hydroperoxides depends on the presence of each component. The high activity observed after the addition of GR (Fig.6A) is due to the accumulation of its substrate, GSSG. In contrast, no discernible peroxidase activity was observed when GSH and GR were replaced by Trx and TR. For both H2O2 (not shown) and t-BOOH (Fig. 6,E and F), the background activity coincided with the decrease in absorbance when PGdx was present. Measurements for H2O2 ort-BOOH reduction at saturating GSH concentrations gave normal Michaelis-Menten patterns with Km andkcat/Km values of 2.29 ॖm and 5.01 × 106 s−1m−1 for H2O2 reduction (not shown) and 208.80 ॖm and 5.67 × 104 s−1m−1 fort-BOOH reduction (Fig.7A). TheVmax was in the range of 25.74 ॖmol/min/mg PGdx for H2O2 reduction and 26.57 ॖmol/min/mg PGdx for t-BOOH reduction. For a kinetic analysis with GSH, we chose t-BOOH as substrate, since its spontaneous reaction at physiological pH with GSH is less pronounced compared with H2O2. In order to avoid extensive background activity with GSH, we also used a pH of 7.1 instead of pH 7.8, the established pH optimum for PGdx (not shown). Measurements revealed a sigmoidal substrate-velocity curve (Fig.7B). By fitting our data into the Hill equation, we obtained an apparent Hill coefficient (napp) of 2.9, indicating a phenomenon of strong cooperativity.Km(app) andkcat/Km(app) were 3.11 mm and 3.01 × 103 s−1m−1, respectively.Vmax(app) was 20.98 ॖmol/min/mg PGdx. Theinsets in Fig. 7 represent the data as an Eadie-Scatchard plot. When n equals 1, the v/[S]versus v is linear, as is the case fort-BOOH, but when n is greater than 1, the plot is curved, as shown for GSH (23Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975: 347-464Google Scholar). We have recently shown that a subgenomic fragment from H. influenzae Rd, bearing the open reading frame HI0572, is capable of complementing t-BOOH and H2O2sensitivity of an Ahp- and catalase-negative E. coli strain, respectively, and of delivering GSH-dependent alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activity to a naturally GSH peroxidase-negativeE. coli (24Vergauwen B. Pauwels F. Vaneechoutte M. Van Beeumen J.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was envisioned that these properties could be attributed to the unusual primary structure of the gene product, consisting of a peroxidase region at the N terminus, showing homology with type C Prx, and a C-terminal region, showing homology with Grx. Studies described here demonstrate clearly that this chimeric protein of H. influenzae Rd, denoted as PGdx, effectively catalyzes the GSH/GR/NADPH-dependent reduction of both H2O2 and t-BOOH at high rates. The Trx/TR/NADPH system was unable to support peroxidase activity. PGdx protects supercoiled DNA against the thiol MCO-system, suggesting that the protein can function as an effective antioxidant enzyme in vivo. Assays with t-BOOH and H2O2 as substrates indicated activities with specificity constants of 104 and 106s−1m−1, respectively. Interestingly, this latter value is comparable with that of the major peroxidase system of E. coli, AhpR (25Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Whereas the AhpR system reduces both organic hydroperoxides and H2O2 with similar kinetic efficiencies, it was proposed that organic hydroperoxides are pseudosubstrates and that the only role of AhpR in nature is the decomposition of H2O2 (25Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Consequently, bearing in mind that PGdx could fulfill a similar role as AhpR, the 2-order of magnitude lower value of kcat/Km fort-BOOH reduction compared with that of H2O2, at least, supports this assumption.

https://openalex.org/W1980564728,"Deposition of fibrillar aggregates of the औ-amyloid peptide (Aऔ) is a key pathologic feature during the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. The initial neuronal responses to Aऔ in cortical circuits and the regulation of Aऔ-induced signaling remain unclear. In this study, we found that exposure of cortical slices to Aऔ1–42 or Aऔ25–35 induced a marked increase in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), two enzymes critically involved in a variety of cellular functions. Activation of M1 muscarinic receptors, but not nicotinic receptors, significantly inhibited the Aऔ activation of PKC and CaMKII. Increasing inhibitory transmission mimicked the M1 effect on Aऔ, whereas blocking GABAA receptors eliminated the M1 action. Moreover, electrophysiological evidence shows that application of Aऔ to cortical slices induced action potential firing and enhanced excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas muscarinic agonists potently increased inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that Aऔ activates PKC and CaMKII through enhancing excitatory activity in glutamatergic synaptic networks. Activation of M1 receptors inhibits Aऔ signaling by enhancing the counteracting GABAergic inhibitory transmission. Thus the muscarinic reversal of the Aऔ-induced biochemical and physiological changes provides a potential mechanism for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with cholinergic enhancers."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA is mainly achieved by the acetyl-CoA synthetase reaction, whereas oxidative decarboxylation by the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex appears to be of minor importance (reviewed in Ref. 1Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Even under glycolytic growth conditions, S. cerevisiae converts pyruvate into acetate, catalyzed by the subsequent action of pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA synthetase (2Flikweert M.T. Van Der Zanden L. Janssen W.M. Steensma H.Y. Van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1996; 12: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the presence of a fermentable carbon source, acetyl-CoA may be mainly used as a precursor of fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis. On the other hand, an additional pool of acetyl-CoA is required for the glyoxylate cycle (citrate synthase and malate synthase reactions) when cells grow with a non-fermentable substrate such as ethanol or acetate. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase, catalyzing the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA, was first identified in the pig heart (3Gergely J. Hele P. Ramakrishnan C.V. J. Biol.

During the purification of yeast Nα-acetyltransferase, an endogenous “inhibitor” of acetyltransferase was purified and shown to be acetyl-CoA hydrolase (11Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Biol.

Acetyl-CoA hydrolase also inhibits purified rat brain pyruvate carboxylase (13Mahan D.E. Mushahwar I.K. Koeppe R.E. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and [acyl-carrier-protein]acetyltransferase (14Lowe P.N. Rhodes S. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the expression of acetyl-CoA hydrolase (ACH1) from S. cerevisiae is glucose-repressible (15Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7413-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to cAMP-dependent repression (16Boy-Marcotte E. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Ach1p1in vivo is still speculative. Previously, we have shown that the ability of ach1 mutants to grow on acetate is impaired (17Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).ACH1 is highly homologous to the aarC gene ofAcetobacter aceti (18Fukaya M. Takemura H. Tayama K. Okumura H. Kawamura Y. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1993; 76: 270-275Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the Neurospora crassagene acu8 (19Marathe S. Connerton I.F. Fincham J.R.S. Mol. Cell.

An acu-8 mutant strain, characterized as acetate non-utilizing, shows strong growth inhibition by acetate but will use it as a carbon source at low concentrations (20Connerton I.F. McCullough W. Fincham J.R.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1797-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The acu-8 mutant was also shown to be deficient in acetyl-CoA hydrolase and to accumulate acetyl-CoA when supplied with acetate. As in Saccharomyces, the Neurosporaenzyme is acetate-inducible. The arrC-defective mutant also showed an inability to assimilate acetic acid (18Fukaya M. Takemura H. Tayama K. Okumura H. Kawamura Y. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1993; 76: 270-275Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in all three organisms, disruption of these genes yields strains that grow normally on ethanol (17Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Fukaya M. Takemura H. Tayama K. Okumura H. Kawamura Y. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Ferment.

Possibly, the acetyl-CoA balance during growth on acetate is disturbed in such mutants. Whether or not acetyl-CoA hydrolase is involved in regulating the endogenous pool(s) of acetyl-CoA remains to be established. In this study, we took an initial step to characterize the biochemical property of Ach1p in vivo and determine its subcellular localization. We demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of Ach1p is dependent upon its putative nucleotide (CoA) binding sites and show that Ach1p is a mitochondrial enzyme. In addition, we provide initial evidence that Ach1p is involved in development of pseudohyphae but not in mitochondrial biogenesis. Yeast culture media were prepared as described by Sherman et al.(21Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YPD contained 17 Bacto-yeast extract, 27 Bacto-peptone, and 27 glucose. SD contained 0.77 Difco yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and 27 glucose. Nutrients essential for auxotrophic strains were supplied at specified concentrations. For comparison of Ach1p expression in different carbon sources, synthetic media containing 57 glucose, 27 galactose, 27 glycerol, and 27 potassium acetate were used. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (22Ito H., Y. Fukuda K. Murata K. Murata Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed by standard protocols as described by Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Yeast strains YPH250 (MATa ade2, his3, leu2, lys2,trp1, ura3–52), YPH252 (MATα ade2,his3, leu2, lys2, trp1,ura3–52), and INVSc1 (MATα his3-1,leu2, trp1–289, ura3–52) were used in this study. For creating the yeast expression vector encoding Ach1p, the sequence encoding yeast ACH1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the SstI-XbaI site of the yeast expression vector pVT101U, a 2-ॖ-based expression plasmid containing the ADH1 promoter (24Vernet T. Dignard D. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). ACH1 constructs containing truncations of the N-terminal region (Ach1pdN, deletion of 1–64 amino acid residues), the first mutation of the putative CoA binding site (Ach1pSS, substitution of amino acids Gly-277 and Gly-279 by Ser-277 and Ser-279), and the second mutation of the putative CoA binding site (Ach1pES, substitution of amino acids Gly-393 and Gly-395 by Glu-393 and Ser-395) were made. All mutations were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. The sequences of the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. The open reading frame ofACH1 was obtained by PCR, by the use of primers that incorporated unique NcoI and BamHI sites at the initiating methionine and 6 bp downstream of the stop codon, respectively. For the His-tagged Ach1p, a DNA fragment containing theACH1 coding region was generated by amplifying of yeast genomic DNA with sequence-specific primers. The PCR product was purified and ligated to the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), yielding pET15bACH1. The His-tagged fusion protein was synthesized in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as described (25Huang C.-F.

Denatured, purified recombinant Ach1p isolated from an SDS-PAGE gel was used as antigen for raising polyclonal antibodies in rabbits essentially as described (25Huang C.-F. Buu L.-M., Yu, W.-L.

Crude yeast lysates were prepared, and acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity was determined by radioactive assay, as described previously (15Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7413-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA in 1 min. Yeast total proteins were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (26Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F., Yu, W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as secondary antibodies. H33258 was diluted in mounting solution for nucleic acid staining. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Microphot SA microscope. The monoclonal anti-yeast mitochondria porin antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. The monoclonal anti-yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3p antibody (also called anti-TCM1 antibody) was a gift of Dr. J. Warner (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), and the polyclonal anti-Kar2p antibody was a gift from Dr. M. Rose (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). Polyclonal anti-porin antibody was diluted 1:20,000 for Western blot analysis and 1:5000 for immunofluorescence staining. The polyclonal antibodies against yeast Arf1p were generated by the use of recombinant proteins from our laboratory (26Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F., Yu, W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J.

Yeasts grown in selective minimal medium or YPD medium were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 mm NaN3, before Lyticase digestion of cell walls in a solution of 1.2 m sorbitol and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. Spheroplasts were suspended in buffer containing 0.1 m sorbitol, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors and disrupted on ice with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged (450 × g) to remove debris and unbroken cells. Cleared lysate (0.8 ml) was loaded on top of a manually generated six-step sucrose gradient (0.7 ml each of 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 107 sucrose in lysis buffer), which was then centrifuged at 170,000 ×g for 3 h in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 4 °C. Proteins in samples (100 ॖl) of fractions, collected manually from the top, were precipitated with 107 trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Diluted antibodies against mitochondrial porin (1:500) (Molecular Probes), Kar2 (1:1000), Emp47 (1:5000), and Arf1p (1:5000) (26Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F., Yu, W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C.

The medium formula, cell treatments, and fractionated centrifugation were performed as described (27Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W.T. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F.

Wild-type yeast cells were cultured in 50 ml of synthetic medium containing 27 glucose at 30 °C with shaking overnight. Then the overnight culture was harvested and transferred into 100 ml of oleic acid-containing medium (0.37 yeast extract, 0.37 peptone, 0.17 oleic acid, 0.27 Tween 40, and 0.57 potassium phosphate) to induce the formation of peroxisomes. After 24 h, the yeast cells were harvested and washed once with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3). Then cells were suspended in 3 ml of spheroplast solution (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.3), 150 ॖl of औ-mercaptoethanol was added, and the cells were kept at room temperature for 15 min with gentle rocking. After spinning down and resuspending in 3 ml of fresh spheroplast solution containing 30 ॖl of औ-mercaptoethanol, 1,000 units of lyticase were added. The cells were mixed gently and incubated at 30 °C for generation of spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were spun down, washed once in ice-cold spheroplast solution, and finally suspended in lysis buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 5 mmMES, pH 6.0, 1 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The spheroplasts were lysed by passage through a 26-gauge needle 20 times and incubated on ice for 30 min. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The crude organelle pellet, consisting mainly of mitochondria and peroxisomes, was gently resuspended in lysis buffer and centrifuged at low speed (600 × g) to remove larger aggregates. The organelle suspension was loaded on a 14–367 Nycodenz gradient to further fractionate mitochondria and peroxisomes. The gradient was centrifuged at 32,500 rpm, 4 °C, for 3.5 h. After centrifugation, the sample was divided into 14 fractions from 14 to 367 Nycodenz gradients; then proteins were precipitated by 107 trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. Yeast was grown in YPGal to early stationary phase. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (31Huang C.-F. Chen C.-C. Tung L. Buu L.-M. Lee F.-J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria were resuspended in lysis buffer to give an approximate final concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml. To isolate the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a suspension of mitochondria (10–20 mg of protein/ml in 0.6m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) was diluted with 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, to a final sorbitol concentration of 0.1 m. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 20 min. The “shocked” mitochondria were sedimented at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor for 20 min. The supernatant contains the contents of the intermembrane space; then proteins were precipitated by 107 trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. To isolate mitochondrial membrane and matrix, shocked mitochondria were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, to a protein concentration of about 2 mg/ml with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and left on ice to allow further swelling of the mitochondrial matrix space. After 5 min, “shrinking buffer” (one-third of the suspension volume) containing 1.8 msucrose, 8 mm ATP, 8 mm MgC12, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH, was added. The suspension was mixed carefully by three strokes in the Dounce homogenizer and left on ice. After 5 min, the suspension was exposed to ultrasonic irradiation for 3 × 5 s on ice. Total mitochondrial membranes were sedimented for 60 min at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant represents the matrix fraction; then proteins were precipitated by 107 trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. To characterize theACH1 gene product, we prepared a rabbit antiserum against anE. coli synthesized recombinant full-length His-tagged Ach1p fusion protein. Among total cellular proteins, antibodies prepared against Ach1p reacted only with a protein of ∼64 kDa, the expected size for Ach1p (Fig. 1). This protein was not detected in an ach1 mutant (Fig. 1) or by the preimmune serum (not shown). Immunoblotting with this antiserum detected nanogram amounts of Ach1p (data not shown) as well as various mutant forms of Ach1p (Fig. 1A). As in previous RNA blot analysis (15Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7413-7418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ach1p was subjected to glucose-dependent repression (Fig.1B). A data base search showed significant homologies among Ach1p and other CoA-transferases, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe ACH1 (SpACH1; 647 identity), N. crassa Acu8 (NcAcu8; 577 identity), E. coli ACH1-like (EcCat1, GenBankTM accession U28377; 387 identity),A. aceti AarC (AarC; 397 identity), Clostridium kluyveri CAT1 (CkCat1, succinyl-CoA:coenzyme A transferase; 377 identity), and C. kluyveri CAT2 (CkCat2, butyryl-CoA-acetate Coenzyme A; 207 identity). The amino acid sequence of the CoA (ADP) binding site (GXGXX(G/A)) was reported from an analysis of the known three-dimensional structures of ADP binding औ-α-औ-folds (32Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows that the conserved CoA (ADP) binding site (GXGXX(G/A)) from heterodimeric CoA transferases are present in the amino acid sequences of Ach1p and homologous CoA-transferases (33Parales R.E. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4657-4666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sohling B Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these putative nucleotide (CoA) binding sites are required for Ach1p activity, we generated two mutants, Ach1pSS and Ach1pES, by site-directed mutagenesis (as described under “Materials and Methods”). Wild-type Ach1p, Ach1pSS, and Ach1pES were expressed in the ach1mutant, and their expression was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-Ach1p antibody (Fig. 1A). Enzyme assays of protein extracts from these strains confirmed that Ach1pSS and Ach1pES expressed in the ach1 mutant contained little (<57) detectable acetyl-CoA hydrolyzing activity, whereas the untransformed wild type had normal enzyme activity (Fig. 1A). In addition, in comparison with wild-type yeast, overexpressing Ach1p in theach1 mutant had ∼3.8-fold of activity. Because of the low solubility of E. coli producing Ach1p recombinant proteins, we failed to isolate recombinant Ach1p and its mutant constructs to assess their enzymatic activity. Previously, we have shown that the ability of ach1 mutants to grow on acetate is impaired (17Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We next tested whether overexpressed Ach1p and its mutant constructs have biological function in ach1 mutant yeast. Specific growth rates of tested strains (wild-type strain, ach1strain, ach1 strains overexpressing Ach1p, Ach1pES, and Ach1pSS) were obtained by the growth of cells in the synthetic medium containing acetate, and A600values were determined at specific time intervals. Overexpressing Ach1p in ach1 mutant can grow on acetate medium; however, the ability of the ach1 mutant and strains overexpressing Ach1pES and Ach1pSS to grow on acetate is impaired (data not shown). These data suggest that Ach1pES and Ach1pSS lose their biological activity in vivo. To study the subcellular distribution of Ach1p, the total yeast spheroplast-homogenized lysate was fractionated by 30–607 discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig.3A, distribution of most of Ach1p was similar to that of the mitochondrial protein porin, although little Ach1p was found in cytoplasmic fractions. To determine further whether Ach1p may also be present in peroxisomes, a homogenate of oleate-grown cells was first subjected to differential centrifugation to obtain an organellar pellet. This material was further fractionated by density gradient centrifugation on Nycodenz. Fig. 3Bshows good resolution between mitochondria (porin marker) and peroxisomes (thiolase marker), and the distribution of Ach1p was similar to that of the mitochondrial protein porin. By immunofluorescence microscopy, endogenous Ach1p, similar to porin, appeared to be localized to mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Yeast mitochondria can form branched networks distributed evenly around the circumference of the cell in the peripheral cytoplasm. Abnormal mitochondrial morphology was not seen in ach1 mutant yeast. To further localize the Ach1p within the purified mitochondria, we analyzed the intermembrane space, matrix, and membrane fractions (Fig.4). Ach1p cofractionated with Mge1p but not with cytochrome oxidase subunit IV and porin, indicating that it is localized to the mitochondrial matrix.Figure 4Ach1p is localized to mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondria of yeast were subfractionated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein samples of submitochondrial fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with specific antisera to detect the following proteins: membrane markers (Porin and cytochrome oxidase IV), matrix marker (Mge1p), and Ach1p protein. Mem, mitochondrial membrane proteins; IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space;Matx, mitochondrial matrix; MW, molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Most proteins targeted to the mitochondrial matrix contain a cleavable N-terminal presequence with basic and hydroxylated amino acids interspersed throughout their length (35Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 36Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Although the N terminus of Ach1p contains no typical matrix-targeting sequence, we suspected that deletion of the N-terminal domain from Ach1p might interfere with its mitochondrial localization. After expression in the ach1mutant, Ach1pdN, lacking 64 amino acids at the N terminus, was recovered in the least dense fractions of the lysate (data not shown). In cells, most of the Ach1pdN mutant was in the cytoplasmic region with a punctate distribution (Fig. 5), and the mitochondrial morphology was similar to that in wild-type cells (Fig.5). In addition, fusion between the N terminus (64 amino acids) of Ach1p and GFP protein failed to be imported into mitochondria (data not shown). We further tested whether overexpression of Ach1p or its mutant constructs (Ach1pES and Ach1pSS) in yeast might cause dominant-negative effects on mitochondrial morphology. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Ach1pES and Ach1pSS, like overexpressed Ach1p, were present in some tubular or spherical structures that also stained with anti-porin antibody (Fig. 5). Thus, N terminus, but not putative Co-A binding sites of Ach1p, was required for Ach1p mitochondrial localization. Because most of Ach1p is localized in the mitochondria, we next examined whether Ach1p can affect mitochondrial function. Yeast, when cultured in glycerol medium, requires mature active mitochondria for oxidative metabolism and growth. Yeast grown in glucose initially does not need active, mature mitochondria, and the mitochondria are not well developed before being switched from anaerobic glucose fermentation to aerobic ethanol oxidation. The wild-type strain, ach1strain, and ach1 strains overexpressing Ach1p and its deleted or mutated constructs (Ach1pES, Ach1pSS, and Ach1pdN) were cultured overnight in synthetic medium containing glucose. Cells were harvested, suspended in double distilled H2O, subjected to serial dilution, and dropped onto glucose, acetate, glycerol, succinate, and ethanol media plates. Fig.6 shows that all strains grew on the glucose, glycerol, succinate, and ethanol media plates; however, theach1 mutant and the Ach1pES, Ach1pSS, and Ach1pdN expression strains did not grow in acetate medium plates. Moreover, the Ach1p-overexpressing cells grew as well as the wild-type yeast on acetate plates. These results suggested that Ach1p is not involved in cellular events in mitochondrial biogenesis, which is required for cells to grow in non-fermentable carbon sources. Diploid cells of the yeast S. cerevisiae undergo pseudohyphal differentiation in response to nutrient limitation (37Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). We have characterized the connection between acetyl-CoA changes and pseudohyphal growth. Wild-type, ach1/ach1 mutant, and ach1/ach1-overexpressing Ach1p yeast cells were grown in low ammonium sulfate (SLAD; 50 ॖm) medium to characterize their pseudohyphal differentiation. Importantly, we found that cells lacking the Ach1p were completely defective in pseudohyphal differentiation, whereas ach1/ach1-overexpressing Ach1p restores pseudohyphal growth (Fig.7). However, expression of Ach1p deleted or mutated constructs (Ach1pES, Ach1pSS, and Ach1pdN) failed to restore pseudohyphal growth (data not shown). In this study, we show that putative conserved nucleotide (CoA) binding sites and N terminus of Ach1p require its enzyme activity. Our data also show that Ach1p is localized to the mitochondria, and the N terminus of Ach1p is required for its localization. Finally, we show that Ach1p is not involved in mitochondrial biogenesis but may be involved in pseudohyphal differentiation. The amino acid sequences of Ach1p and homologous CoA-transferases contain two conserved CoA (ADP) binding sites (GXGXX(G/A)) from heterodimeric CoA transferases (Fig. 2) (9Soling H.-D. Rescher C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Parales R.E. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4657-4666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined whether these putative nucleotide (CoA) binding sites are required for Ach1p activity. Enzyme assays confirmed that Ach1pSS and Ach1pES expressed in the ach1 mutant contained little detectable acetyl-CoA hydrolyzing activity. We also showed that utilization of acetate as carbon source by theach1 mutant is impaired, and overexpression of Ach1pES, or Ach1pSS, cannot restore this activity. Our data indicate that one or more putative nucleotide (CoA) binding sites are required for Ach1p enzymatic activity. The subcellular localization of a protein is an important characteristic with functional implications. Our data show that most of Ach1p is localized to the mitochondria, although a little Ach1p was also found in small punctate form distributed in the cytoplasm. The majority of mitochondrial matrix-targeting signals are cleaved upon import into the mitochondria (36Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The matrix-located MTF1 protein in yeast, which is a transcription-stimulating factor (38Sanyal A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11970-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is an exceptional case. This protein lacks a recognizable matrix-targeting sequence, and its import is reported to be independent of outer membrane receptors. How specificity of targeting is achieved in this case and whether there is an entirely separate pathway for importing this protein remain to be clarified. We demonstrate that N-terminal but not putative CoA binding sites of Ach1p are required for localization to mitochondria. Thus, translocation of Ach1p from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix may, like that of MTF1, require that the N-terminal sequence lacks a recognizable matrix-targeting signal. A recent report described that Ach1p has two different protein spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (39Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1720-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3144) Google Scholar). These two Ach1ps have the same relative molecular weight but differ in their pI, suggesting that Ach1p might be modified post-translationally. However, we attempted, but failed, to confirm that there are two different protein spots of Ach1p by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 2L.-M. Buu, Y.-C. Chen, and F.-J. S. Lee, unpublished data. Carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) is known to be present in mitochondria and peroxisomes of oleate-grown S. cerevisiae, and both proteins are encoded by the same gene, YCAT (27Elgersma Y. van Roermund C.W.T. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3472-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We also speculated whether Ach1p in oleate-grown cells might have a different subcellular localization. Our data showed that the majority of Ach1p is present in mitochondria but not in peroxisomes. Thus, we concluded that Ach1p is a mitochondrial enzyme and may execute its physiologic function in the matrix space. Contemporary knowledge of the structure and function of acetyl-CoA hydrolases (i.e. cytosolic (8Prass R.L. Isohashi F. Utter M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5215-5223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Suematsu N. Okamoto K. Shibata K. Nakanishi Y. Isohashi F. Kraus T. Uttamsingh V. Anders M.W. Wolf S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2700-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial (5Robinson Jr., J.B. Mahan D.E. Koeppe R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) is incomplete. Ach1p resembles the rat mitochondrial acetyl-CoA hydrolase, is not affected by ADP or ATP, and is inhibited by औNADH (9Soling H.-D. Rescher C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Km of the Ach1p is similar to the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA hydrolase from hamster brown fat (6Bernson V.S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,12Lee F.-J.S. Lin L.-W. Smith J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, the pH optima for Ach1p and rat brain mitochondrial acetyl-CoA hydrolase are identical (pH ∼8) (5Robinson Jr., J.B. Mahan D.E. Koeppe R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that Ach1p is localized to mitochondria, consistent with the previous finding that the biochemical properties of Ach1p is similar to those of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA hydrolases. Diploid cells of the yeast S. cerevisiae undergo pseudohyphal differentiation in response to nutrient limitation (37Gimeno C.J. Ljungdahl P.O. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1077-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Studies on the way in which nitrogen and carbon starvation induce invasive and filamentous growth suggest multiple regulatory points in each pathway and cross-talk between the pathways (41Palecek S.P. Parikh A.S. Kron S.J. Microbiology (Oxf.). 2002; 148: 893-907Google Scholar). Changing any single component may rearrange metabolic fluxes in a manner that is difficult to predict. New approaches to metabolic system modeling and design are likely to contribute to identifying the particular components that signal invasion and filamentation and offer predictions for how to regulate the intracellular activities of those components. Our study showed that Ach1p was required for pseudohyphal formation, suggesting a physiologic connection between acetyl-CoA changes and pseudohyphal growth. In recent studies, sequence alignment of genes with similar regulation patterns revealed a putative regulatory promoter element (CCWTTSRNCCG) for the glyoxylate cycle (42van den Berg M.A. de Jong-Gubbels P. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This specific element was present in seven genes, including CIT2 (citrate synthase in peroxisomal matrix), ICL1 (isocitrate lyase), MLS1 (malate synthase in peroxisomal matrix), MDH2 (malate dehydrogenase in peroxisomal matrix), CAT2 (carnitine acetyltransferase in peroxisomal matrix and mitochondria), ACR1(succinate-fumarate transporter in mitochondrial inner membrane), andACH1, which were derepressed on ethanol or acetate. Consistent with this observation, three glyoxylate cycle genes,ICL1, MLS1, and MDH2, showed the same regulation pattern as ACH1 (42van den Berg M.A. de Jong-Gubbels P. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition,acu-8 mycelium exhibited no significant flux through the glyoxylate cycle 10 h after transfer to acetate. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that Ach1p may be involved in the glyoxylate cycle. Recently, Lorenz and Fink (43Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 2001; 412: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) showed that live S. cerevisiae cells isolated from the phagolysosome are induced for genes of the glyoxylate cycle. These findings in fungi, in conjunction with reports that isocitrate lyase is both up-regulated and required for the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, demonstrate the wide ranging significance of the glyoxylate cycle in microbial pathogenesis. It will be interesting to learn whether Ach1p, similar to genes involved in the glyoxylate cycle, can be induced in phagolysosomes. The role of acetyl-CoA hydrolases catalyzing the scission of the high energy thioester bond acetyl-CoA with no apparent metabolic advantage represents a biochemical conundrum. Because acetyl-CoA hydrolase is highly expressed in yeast when media contain acetate, we suspect that, under conditions when acetate is used as the main carbon source, a large amount of acetyl-CoA is generated but not effectively incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid or glyoxylate cycle. Such an excess of acetyl-CoA could lead to autoacetylation of proteins, as well as to the generation of toxic ketone bodies or other noxious metabolites. It is possible, albeit not yet established, that the intracellular level of acetyl-CoA could be regulated at a “safe” level by hydrolysis of excessive acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA hydrolase. Another interpretation is that the ACH1 enzyme, in vivo, is regulated by its associated factor, which can alter the Ach1p enzyme to be an acetyltransferase. It has been shown that the distinction between acyltransferases and thioesterases is quite narrow (44Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, acetyltransferases, in the absence of the acetyl acceptor, can transfer the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to water and act as hydrolasesin vitro. Interestingly, a recent proteomic analysis showed that exposure of S. cerevisiae to sorbic acid in YEPD medium, pH 4.5, resulted in the up-regulation of 10 proteins, including Ach1p (45Nobel D.D. Lawrie L. Brul S. Klis F. Davis M. Alloush H. Coote P. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1413-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that the induction of Ach1p may confer resistance to the inhibitory effects of sorbic acid. Furthermore, Ach1p was indicated to have high homologies (427 identity and 627 similarity) to C. kluyveri CAT1 (CkCat1, succinyl-CoA:coenzyme A transferase) and was suggested to be a succinyl-CoA:CoA transferase. However, the specific enzymatic activity of C. kluyveri CAT1 in recombinant E. coli clones was very low (9Soling H.-D. Rescher C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We attempted, but failed, to prove that Ach1p has such enzymatic activity.2 In conclusion, this study has confirmed that putative conserved nucleotide (CoA) binding sites of Ach1p are required for its enzyme activity in vivo. We also demonstrated that Ach1p is a mitochondrial enzyme, although its potential function in the glyoxylate cycle needs to be investigated further. We also showed that Ach1p is not involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, and our data suggest that the metabolism of acetyl-CoA by Ach1p is involved indirectly in pseudohyphal differentiation. Although yeast can use acetate or ethanol as carbon source by converting them to acetyl-CoA in the metabolic pathway, it will be interesting to know how ach1 mutants could impair acetate but not ethanol utilization. The exact physiologic role of this mitochondrial Ach1p needs to be investigated further. We thank Drs. T. Langer and M. Rose for providing us with antibodies. We thank Chih-Hsin Chen for preparing the anti-Ach1p antibody."

To better understand how RA-mediated TGase expression is regulated, we considered whether co-stimulation of NIH3T3 cells with RA and epidermal growth factor (EGF), a known activator of PI3K, would facilitate the induction or increase the levels of TGase expression. Instead of enhancing these parameters, EGF inhibited RA-induced TGase expression. Activation of the Ras-ERK pathway by EGF was sufficient to elicit this effect, since continuous Ras signaling mimicked the actions of EGF and inhibited RA-induced TGase expression, whereas blocking ERK activity in these same cells restored the ability of RA to up-regulate TGase expression. However, TGase activity is not antagonistic to EGF signaling. The mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of EGF were not compromised by TGase overexpression, and in fact, exogenous TGase expression promoted basal cell growth and resistance to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Moreover, analysis of TGase expression and GTP binding activity in a number of cell lines revealed high basal TGase GTP binding activity in tumor cell lines U87 and MDAMB231, indicating that constitutively active TGase may be a characteristic of certain cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that TGase may serve as a survival factor and RA-induced TGase expression requires the activation of PI3K but is antagonized by the Ras-ERK pathway.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that the extent of TGase enzymatic activity may be crucial for determining the exact cellular effects induced by the TGase. In addition to transamidation activity, TGase also undergoes a GTP binding/GTP hydrolysis cycle, a feature that distinguishes it from the other transglutaminases (2Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GTP-bound TGase participates in signaling pathways that link cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors. The most studied example of this involved the up-regulation of phospholipase C activity by the α1-adrenergic receptor (13Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 14Feng J.F. Rhee S.G. Im M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), where it was shown that the α1-adrenergic receptor stimulated the GTP binding activity of TGase. The GTP-bound TGase species, in turn, was shown to stimulate phosphoinositide lipid hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The ability of TGase to transduce signals adds another dimension to its functionality and may help explain how the same protein can be linked to several, sometimes opposing, cellular responses. This point is exemplified by the recent finding that a transamidation-defective form of TGase protected cells from heat shock-induced apoptosis (8Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), indicating that the GTP binding/GTPase activity of TGase likely mediated the survival advantage. Despite advances in the characterization of TGase functions and their impact on cellular processes, the events that lead to a completely activated TGase species (a molecule having transamidation activity and capable of binding GTP) in vivo are not completely understood. One aspect of TGase regulation involves altering the expression levels of the protein. In several cell types, the TGase protein is expressed at low levels (4Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Pike L.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6587-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), chemotherapeutic agents (17Mehta K. Int. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid (RA) is the most consistent inducer of TGase expression and activation, and a mechanism by which RA up-regulates TGase expression has been elucidated. RA binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and stimulates their association with specific DNA motifs located in the promoter region of the TGase gene, resulting in transcription (2Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 439-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Other than modifying gene transcription, RARs also activate signaling molecules. The signaling potentials of STAT3, PI3K, and ERK have been shown to increase following RA treatment (20Paillaud E.

Biochem.

For some time our laboratory has been interested in understanding the regulation and function of TGase in cells. Contrary to findings linking TGase to apoptosis (8Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell.

Griffin M. Malorni W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we have shown that RA-induced TGase expression provided a protective effect fromN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR)-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 and NIH3T3 cells (7Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, RA stimulation resulted in the activation of the anti-apoptotic molecule PI3K, which was necessary for the induction of TGase expression and GTP binding activity (23Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given that the regulation of TGase expression is linked to PI3K activation and that growth factors frequently activate PI3K, we considered whether co-treatment of NIH3T3 cells with growth factors and RA would potentiate the induction of TGase expression, as well as the level of transamidation or GTP binding activity, compared with RA treatment alone. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was chosen as the co-stimulus because it is not only an effective activator of PI3K but it also up-regulates TGase activity in hepatocytes (24Katoh S. Nakagawa N. Yano Y. Satoh K. Kohno H. Ohkubo Y. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, we found that rather than enhancing the induction rate or the expression levels of TGase, EGF suppressed the ability of RA to stimulate TGase expression. Activation of the Ras-ERK pathway was sufficient to impart this inhibitory effect of EGF, since cells with continuous Ras signaling also limited RA-induced TGase expression, and blocking ERK activation in these cells restored the ability of RA to up-regulate TGase expression. These findings prompted us to question how EGF-regulated processes would be affected by exogenous TGase expression. Cells expressing TGase displayed a growth and survival advantage over control cells, and EGF-mediated proliferation and resistance to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis was not compromised by the overexpression of TGase. These findings demonstrate that EGF inhibits RA-induced TGase expression in NIH3T3 cells by activating the Ras-ERK pathway, whereas limiting TGase expression does not appear to be critical for EGF to elicit its effects. When coupled with our earlier findings linking the activation of PI3K to the induction of TGase expression, we begin to appreciate the complex interplay of signaling pathways that regulate TGase in cells. Moreover, these results are consistent with the idea that EGF-coupled signaling does not counteract the up-regulation of TGase as a means of reversing a TGase-mediated growth inhibitory or apoptotic activity as TGase exhibits mitogenic and survival activities rather than serving as a suppressor of cell growth. Thus, the effects of EGF receptor signaling on TGase expression are more likely the outcome of EGF-directed effects on the broad profile of RA-stimulated gene expression, in order to repress the anti-mitogenic effects of other RA-induced gene products. LY294002 and PD98095 were obtained fromCalbiochem, and EGF was from Invitrogen. RA, HPR, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and monodansyl cadaverine were purchased from Sigma. The TGase antibody was obtained from Neomarkers; the actin antibody was from Sigma, and the phospho-ERK and ERK antibodies were from New England Biolabs. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all additional material was obtained from Fisher unless stated otherwise. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, and MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin. The cell lines were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the various treatments described, the cells were grown to near confluence in medium containing 10% serum, and then medium containing 1% serum with 5 μm RA (unless indicated otherwise), or 100 ng/ml EGF, ± 10 μm LY294002 or ± 10 μm PD98095, were added for the times indicated under “Results.” Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with cell lysis buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphoric acid, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.35). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Total cell lysates from each sample were combined with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.02% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The filters were incubated with the various primary antibodies diluted in TBST overnight at 4 °C and then washed 3 times with TBST. To detect the primary antibodies, anti-mouse or -rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:5000 in TBST, was incubated with the filters for 1 h, followed by 3 washes with TBST. The protein bands were visualized on x-ray film after exposing the filters to chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Photoaffinity labeling of TGase was performed by incubating whole cell lysates with 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 500 μm AMP-PNP for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were placed in an ice bath and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 15 min, mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled. SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters and exposure on x-ray film. Cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and grown in complete medium for 2 days. The cells were then incubated in medium containing 1.5% serum ± 5 μm RA (unless indicated otherwise) and ± 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 days. The cultures were then incubated with serum-free medium for an additional day and were fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei and/or blebbing. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well and grown in medium containing 1.5% serum ± 5 μm RA and ± 100 ng/ml EGF. Every 2 days the medium was changed. At 0, 2, 4, and 6 days of treatment, the cells were collected and counted. Exposure of cells to RA limits cell growth or induces a cell death response in several cell types suggesting that retinoids may be efficacious in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. More recent work has shown that exposure of GL-15 glioma cells to 1 μm RA promoted cell proliferation (20Paillaud E. Costa S. Fages C. Plassat J.L. Rochette-Egly C. Monville C. Tardy M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and findings from our laboratory demonstrated that RA affords protective effects to HL-60 and NIH3T3 cells from the apoptotic agentN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (HPR) (7Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We decided to test whether RA treatment could also protect NIH3T3 cells from serum deprivation-mediated cell death. Mouse fibroblast cells were chosen for this study because it was determined previously that exposure of NIH3T3 cells to RA caused the up-regulation of TGase expression, as well as stimulated the GTP binding and transamidation activities of TGase, and that the RA-induced TGase activity limited the effectiveness of HPR at inducing apoptosis (7Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A. Boehm J.E. Combs C. Zgola M.M. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33582-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, Fig.1 A shows that NIH3T3 cells treated with 5 μm RA for 2 days resulted in an increase in TGase protein levels (Fig. 1 A, α TGase) and yielded a corresponding stimulation of GTP binding activity (Fig.1 A, [α-32P]GTP binding) as indicated by the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP. The extent of TGase expression and GTP binding activity stimulated at significantly higher levels of RA (50 μm) was comparable with that obtained with 5 μm RA, indicating that the latter level was sufficient to yield a maximum TGase response. We then examined whether RA protected these cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. The fibroblasts were stimulated with or without RA for 2 days and then were stressed by serum starvation, and the resulting apoptotic rates were compared. Cells that were not treated with RA were susceptible to apoptosis, as nearly 70% of the cells displayed nuclear condensation or blebbing, a characteristic unique to cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 1 B, vector). To confirm that these cells were apoptotic, a second assay that detects the activation of caspases was also performed. Total cell lysates from cells that were or were not deprived of serum were subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes the cleaved (activated) form of caspase 3. Consistent with cells undergoing programmed cell death, cleaved caspase 3 was readily detected in the serum-deprived cells but not in the actively growing cells (data not shown). Treatment with 5 μm RA resulted in a dramatic reduction in the rate of cell death compared with control cells (Fig. 1 B, vector), demonstrating that RA can provide a protective effect from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis as well as HPR-mediated apoptosis (7Antonyak M.A. Singh U.S. Lee D.A.

The increase in TGase expression caused by 5 μm RA (Fig.1 B, inset, vector) can account for the pro-survival effect of RA, because simply overexpressing TGase in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 B, inset, WT TGase) is sufficient to inhibit apoptosis resulting from serum deprivation, and does so as effectively as treating cells with 5 μm RA (Fig. 1 B, WT TGase). TGase has long been considered an apoptotic or cell differentiation factor (5Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3034-3040PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J.

We questioned whether the anti-apoptotic effect of TGase was unique to NIH3T3 cells or whether TGase might provide a protective effect to other cell lineages. To address this possibility, an analysis of TGase expression and GTP binding activity in various cell lines was performed. We reasoned that if TGase activation were detrimental to cell proliferation then it would not be detected in any actively growing cells. However, if TGase was linked to a survival response, then its activity could be enhanced in some cell types. The data presented in Fig. 2 shows that treatment with RA increased TGase expression and GTP binding activity in all of the cell lines assayed, indicating that various cell types express functional RARs and can induce TGase expression and activation similar to NIH3T3 cells. The monkey kidney cell line COS7, the breast tumor cell line MDAMB231, and the brain tumor cell line U87 all displayed substantial levels of TGase expression even prior to RA treatment. Cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells displayed detectable TGase expression in the absence of RA treatment; however, incorporation of [α-32P]GTP into TGase only occurred after treatment with RA (25Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TGase expressed in MDAMB231 and U87 cells was able to incorporate [α-32P]GTP in the absence of RA stimulation (Fig. 2). Thus different cell lines display varying degrees of basal TGase expression and GTP binding activity, arguing against a general role for chronic TGase GTP binding activity in limiting cell proliferation and/or promoting apoptosis. RA treatment has been shown to result in the up-regulation of a growing number of intracellular signaling proteins including ERK (22Bost F. Caron L. Marchetti I. Dani C. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that PI3K activity was essential for RA-induced TGase expression. Each of these signaling molecules is frequently used by growth factors, such as EGF, to regulate a variety of cellular processes (26Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that TGase expression and GTP binding activity may be positively regulated by growth factor stimulation in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, treatment of NIH3T3 cells for 3 days with EGF does not lead to an increase in TGase expression nor does EGF stimulate the GTP binding activity of TGase. Because RA-mediated TGase expression requires PI3K, together with the fact that EGF directly activates PI3K, we questioned whether the co-stimulation of cells with RA and EGF might synergize to elicit a more rapid induction of TGase expression or increase the overall level of TGase protein compared with RA stimulation alone. However, instead of increasing either of these parameters, EGF significantly diminished, but did not completely block, the ability of RA to augment the expression and GTP binding activity of the TGase (Fig. 3 A). The EGF-mediated inhibition of retinoid-induced TGase expression was not dependent on the concentration of RA used to stimulate these cells, as exposure with up to 75 μm RA was not able to overcome the inhibitory effects of 30 min of EGF pretreatment (Fig.3 B). It is worth noting, however, that if TGase expression was initially up-regulated by RA, followed by stimulation of the cells with EGF for 3 additional days, the growth factor was ineffective at decreasing TGase expression or GTP binding activity (Fig.3 C), despite being capable of fully activating ERK (Fig.3 D). Taken together, these findings indicate that although RA and EGF activate common signaling proteins, there must be some degree of signaling specificity since only RA stimulates TGase expression. More importantly, EGF-mediated signaling inhibits retinoid-induced TGase expression in NIH3T3 cells only when the cells are pretreated with EGF or when EGF and RA are added together, whereas EGF appears to be ineffective at down-regulating TGase expression and GTP activity when added subsequent to RA treatment. EGF is a well established mitogenic and anti-apoptotic factor (26Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), whereas RA has classically been considered to be a cell differentiation factor (27Fontana J.A. Rishi A.K. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because of the opposing functions attributed to EGF and RA, it became important to determine how these factors, alone and in combination, affect the apoptotic and cell growth rates of NIH3T3 cells. As expected, EGF caused a 50% reduction in the rate of cell death induced by serum starvation (Fig.4 A) and stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in cell number following 6 days of growth factor treatment (Fig. 4 B). Exposure to 5 μm RA protected the cells from serum deprivation-mediated apoptosis to an extent similar to that observed with EGF (Fig. 4 A). Combining both EGF and RA did not significantly reduce the apoptotic rate any further than treating with either factor alone. This was to be expected since the protective effects of RA from stress-induced apoptosis appear to occur via the up-regulation of TGase activity (Fig. 1 B), and EGF suppresses most of the RA-induced TGase expression and thereby eliminates the anti-apoptotic effect of RA. As a result, the extent of resistance from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis caused by co-stimulation with RA and EGF is similar to that obtained when treating with EGF alone. Interestingly, exposure of cells to 5 μm RA, which strongly inhibits the proliferation of the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (Fig. 4 C) and differentiates the leukemia cell line HL-60 (28Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar), did not block the basal or EGF-mediated growth of NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, both the untreated and EGF-stimulated cells appeared to grow slightly better in the presence of RA. These findings suggest that 5 μm RA, which is capable of eliciting an anti-apoptotic effect in mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B), also does not inhibit the growth of these cells, regardless of whether or not RA is able to up-r"

These interactions can be complex; there are sometimes a number of diverse proteins that can interact with a particular target molecule (1Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Elucidation of key intermolecular contacts between protein partners can aid in the development of small molecule inhibitors and/or promoters of these important interactions, which in turn control function. A particularly interesting area in biology today is the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of the assembly/disassembly of signaling networks in response to a specific cellular signal (3Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Indeed, the spatio-temporal compartmentalization of signaling molecules affords biological control by poising interacting partners in close proximity to substrate(s) and/or regulatory elements (4Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-429PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 holoenzyme through interactions with Akinaseanchoring proteins (AKAPs) has emerged as an important modulator of PKA activity in diverse tissues (5Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The PKA holoenzyme consists of a regulatory subunit (R2) dimer and two catalytic (C) subunits (6Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of target proteins is carried out by the C subunit, whereas the N-terminal 45 residues of the R subunit mediates both dimerization and subcellular localization via AKAP recognition (7Hausken Z.E.

Hence, the N-terminal functional domain is termed aD/D motif because it dimerizes anddocks to anchoring partners. Solution structural studies revealed that the type IIα D/D of PKA packs into an antiparallel, dimeric X-type four-helix bundle, with a surface-exposed hydrophobic groove that is the site of anchoring interactions (9Newlon M.G.

Sequence alignment of the identified AKAPs, to date, reveals no specific recognition sequence for the D/D. However, a conserved structure consistent with an amphipathic helix was predicted, and has been demonstrated in recent solution structural studies of a peptide derivative of the prototypic AKAP human thyroid anchoring protein Ht31 (residues 493–515 and designated Ht31pep) (7Hausken Z.E.

In an effort to gain a better understanding of the physicochemical basis for PKA-AKAP interactions, we initiated hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange and backbone relaxation studies of the D/D free and in complex with Ht31pep. In contrast to recent work described by Powell et al. (15Powell K.D. Ghaemmaghami S. Wang M.Z. Ma L. Oas T.G. Fitzgerald M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 10256-10257Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using H/D exchange to measure ligand-binding affinities, we observe only modest changes in the H/D protection factors upon complex formation, despite the nanomolar binding affinity of Ht31 for the D/D (11Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we also find that backbone flexibility in the binding interface of the D/Dincreases in the Ht31pep complex. We propose that the increase in backbone mobility and display of modest changes in H/D exchange protection factors upon high affinity ligand binding may be a general effect observed for proteins that use solvent accessible hydrophobic surfaces to recognize diverse binding partners. The D/D·Ht31peppeptide complex was prepared as described previously (16Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Ht31pep peptide was obtained from PeptidoGenic Research and Co. (Livermore, CA). The stoichiometry of binding for classical AKAPs is one AKAP per R subunit dimer (11Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apo-D/D was prepared as a 0.25 mm (0.5 mm monomer) sample in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 4.0. Relaxation experiments were collected on either a 0.25 mm (0.50 mm monomer apo) or a 0.50 mm (1.0 mm monomer complex) sample. Samples for hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies were collected on 0.25–1.0 mm protein solutions. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments were initiated by introducing the protein samples into deuterated buffer via a QuikChange gel chromatography step (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A series of two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra (17Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) were collected on a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer at 0, 16, 30, 60, 100, 300, 1080, 1560, and 2880 min after the introduction of the sample into D2O buffer. Calibration of the individual spectra to correct for protein concentration differences between samples was achieved by normalizing the data to the intensity of the non-exchanging aliphatic resonance of Val20 Hγ 2* in a one-dimensional 1H spectrum taken directly after the completion of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments. The time-dependent change in the cross-peak intensity (volume) of each amide proton resonance was found to be exponential. Fitting of each of the observed decay curves to an exponential decay function allowed the extraction of the residue specific experimental exchange rate,kobs, according to, I=e−kobs×tEquation 1 where I is the observed cross-peak intensity (volume) at time t. Fitting of data, whether normalized or non-normalized, volume or intensity, from 600 or 500 MHz spectrometer gave identical rates (data not shown). Residue-specific protection factors,P, for individual amide protons were calculated from the following relationship, P=kint/kobsEquation 2 where P is the protection factor,kint the intrinsic rate corrected for local sequence variations (18Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), and kobs the observed rate for the solvent exchange of the amide proton. A general form of the hydrogen-deuterium exchange mechanism can be described as (19Hvidt A.A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), CHkop⇔kclOH→D2OkintOD⇔CDEquation 3 where H and D denote protonated and deuterated backbone amides, C the “closed” form and O the “open” form, and kcl andkop are their corresponding rate constants. The intrinsic rate constant for the chemical exchange reaction,kint, for a specific amide proton depends upon the local primary sequence, pH, and temperature under which exchange takes place (18Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 20Molday R.S. Englander S.W. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Given this model, the rate constant for the exchange, kex, is given by the following relationship.kex=(kop×kint)/(kcl+kint)Equation 4 When the chemical exchange step is much faster than the rate constant for reprotection, we approach the EX1 limit,kex = kop. When the closing step, kcl, is faster than the exchange rate, kint, then kexreduces to kex = Kop× kint, where Kopis the equilibrium constant for the opening reaction. This is known as the EX2 limit. Under these conditions and assuming a well defined native-state ensemble, an apparent free energy of exchange, ΔGexapp, can be estimated from the calculated protection factors according to the following relationship,ΔGexapp=−RT ln[P]Equation 5 where R is the gas constant, T the temperature in Kelvin, and P is the residue-specific protection factor (P =kex/kint) (20Molday R.S. Englander S.W. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Relaxation experiments were collected at 25 °C on Bruker DMX500 and DRX600 spectrometers using a triple-resonance gradient probe. The 15N T1,15N T2, and NOE measurements were acquired with established methods that use pulsed-field gradients for coherence transfer pathway selection combined with sensitivity enhancement (21Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar, 22Kay L.E.

Phys. 1971; 55: 3604-3611Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The 15N T1 and 15N T2 relaxation experiments were collected as a time series of two dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra, with variable delay times (40, 100*, 200, 300, 400*, 500, 600, 800, 100, and 1280 ms for T1 and 10, 18, 26, 38, 50*, 62, 78, 98, and 122 ms for T2), where asterisks indicate duplicate points to estimate the error in the measured intensities. Data were processed using the program FELIX 97.0 (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and the intensities for the amide 1H-15N cross-peaks were assessed with relax_scripts (62Akke M. relax_scripts. Lund University, Lund, Sweden1994Google Scholar). TheR1 and R2 relaxation rates values were determined by fitting the time series to a single exponential decay function. The errors in the rates are reported as the 95% confidence limits in the kinetic fits.1H-15N steady-state NOE values were determined from the ratio of the intensities of the respective cross-peaks with and without proton saturation. Errors were assessed both from replicate experiments and from measurements of the root mean square values of the noise in the spectra (21Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Relaxation of an amide 15N nucleus is dominated by dipolar coupling with the attached proton, and anisotropy of the 15N chemical shift tensor. Dynamics of the NH bond axis are characterized by the spectral density function,J(ω), which is related to the three relaxation parametersR1, R2, and NOE (24Abragam A. Principles of Nuclear Magnetism. Clarendon Press, Oxford1961Google Scholar). The model-free formalism (25Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4570Crossref Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 26Clore G.M. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7387-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) allows the assessment of the amplitudes and time scales of the intramolecular motions by modeling the spectral density function, J(ω), in terms of the order parameterS2 (characterizing the amplitude of internal motions of each NH bond), τe (the effective correlation time for internal motions), and τm (the isotropic rotational correlation time of the protein). For an axially symmetric rotational diffusion tensor (27Schurr J.M. Babcock H.P. Fujimoto B.S. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 105: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Tjandra N. Feller S.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 12562-12566Crossref Scopus (669) Google Scholar), the spectral densityJ(ω) can be expressed as a function of the angle between the N-H bond vector and the unique axis of the principal frame of the diffusion tensor. We have followed standard protocols (with fitting data acquired at 500 and 600 MHz simultaneously) for selection of a dynamical model describing internal motions for each residue (26Clore G.M. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7387-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Once the model selection was completed, the parameters characterizing overall molecular tumbling and the internal motional parameters were optimized simultaneously. All optimizations involved minimization of the χ2 function (29Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer 3rd, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The model free calculations were performed using the program modelfree (version 4.1), (alsor2r1_diffusion and pdbinertia) kindly provided by Dr. Arthur G. Palmer. Protomer-specific assignments were used for the D/D in the Ht31pep complex except for residues 33, 35, and 36, where it was not possible to obtain unambiguous protomer-specific assignments (10Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Carr D.W. Westphal R. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the latter cases, Model Free analysis was performed by assigning all possible protomer-specific assignments to resonances (residues 33, 35, and 36). No significant differences were observed in the resulting parameters for residues 33, 35, and 36. Of a total of 44 residues in the RIIα D/D protomer, five (Thr10, Gln23, Phe31, Thr37, and Glu41) in the apo and three (Phe31, Thr37, and Glu41) residues in the Ht31 complex were excluded from analysis because of weak signal intensity and/or resonance overlap. Because the non-palindromic peptide Ht31pep binds to RIIα in a one peptide to one dimer stoichiometry, it induces asymmetry into the complex resulting in protomer-specific chemical shift changes in the D/D dimer upon peptide binding (10Newlon M.G.

Residues on both the exterior and buried faces of helices I/I′ and II/II′ experience reduction in hydrogen exchange kinetics upon peptide binding (Table Iand Fig. 1b). The largest changes in amide exchange rate upon AKAP binding occur in helix I/I′ (Leu12/12′ through Arg22/22′), which make up the hydrophobic cleft that is the site of direct AKAP interaction. Mutagenesis studies indicated that residues Ile3/3′ and Ile5/5′ contribute important determinants for Ht31pep binding (11Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but interestingly these residues are freely exchanging in both the apo and the D/d·Ht31pep complex. Helices II/II′ (Ala32/32′-Leu39/39′) make up the bottom surface of the molecule and are removed from the AKAP binding surface. Nonetheless, increases in amide-proton exchange protection factors are also observed in this region upon complex formation (Fig.1b).Table IHydrogen/deuterium exchange parameters Open table in a new tab Figure 1a, differences in order parameters observed between the free and the complexed forms of RIIα-(1–44).

Relaxation rate parametersR1, R2, and NOE were obtained from the analysis of proton detected 15N and1H correlation spectra of the free and the D/d·Ht31pep complex. Data were collected at two magnetic fields, 500 and 600 MHz. 52 of 56 amide proton resonance cross-peaks were of sufficient quality for the reliable quantitation of the cross-peak intensities in the individual spectra. The relaxation parameters are given in Table II. We observe a decrease in the NOE value upon complex formation for most of the residues located in the hydrophobic binding groove, and a concomitant increase in the NOE value for the biologically important residues Ile3 and Ile5 (13Vijayaraghavan S. Liberty G.A. Mohan J. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Carr D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 14Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), among others. These compensatory increases/decreases upon complex formation leads to a system where the domain average NOE values are the same for the free and Ht31pep complex, as determined at 500 and 600 MHz (Table II and Fig. 2). Comparison of the R1 relaxation rates for the apo and Ht31pep complex shows a field dependence to the observeddomain average rates. The average value for thefree is larger than that observed for the complex, when measured at 500 MHz, but is within error as assessed at 600 MHz. The average R2, relaxation rates for thefree and the complex (at 500 and 600 MHz) are within experimental error, but individual residue rates show variable changes upon complex formation, suggesting the presence of low frequency motions, including possible conformation exchange.Table IIAverage values of the 15N relaxation parameters for the free and complexed RIIαMagnetic field〈NOE〉〈R1〉〈R2〉MHzs−1Free5000.53 ± 0.061.83 ± 0.048.82 ± 0.38Complex5000.54 ± 0.061.69 ± 0.079.25 ± 0.32Free6000.59 ± 0.051.46 ± 0.059.89 ± 0.49Complex6000.67 ± 0.071.42 ± 0.079.54 ± 0.35 Open table in a new tab We have performed a Model Free analysis (25Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4570Crossref Scopus (3399) Google Scholar) of the data in an effort to interpret relaxation parameters in terms of dynamical variables. Chemical shift splitting is observed in the D/d·Ht31pep complex and protomer-specific assignments were used where available (see “Experimental Procedures”) (16Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observed residue-specific relaxation parameters (Fig. 2) show an overall (protomer A versusprotomer B) similar behavior, thus we included a total of 52 residues in our analysis of the complex. The experimental data (500 and 600 MHz) were examined assuming either an isotropic or an anisotropic axially symmetric molecular tumbling model. The diffusion tensors of overall reorientation were calculated from the R2/R1 ratios (those within one standard deviation of the average (30Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar)) using the program r2r1_diffusion (provided by Dr. Arthur G. Palmer) and the atomic coordinates of the free or Ht31pep·D/D complex, respectively (16Newlon M.G. Roy M. Hausken Z.E. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23637-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The calculated ratio of diffusion tensor components were 2Dzz/(Dxx + Dyy) = D‖‖/D⊥ = 0.97 ± 0.02 (free) and D‖‖/D⊥ = 1.16 ± 0.02 (Ht31pep complex). Thus, the isotropic model adequately describes the overall reorientation and was used for further analysis. The overall rotational times, τm, calculated fromR2/R1 were used as the initial input values and the final optimization yielded the isotropic correlation times, τm, of 7.94 ± 0.04 and 8.25 ± 0.04 ns for the free and D/D·Ht31pep complex, respectively. A simultaneous fit of the data acquired at 500 and 600 MHz allowed the description of a dynamic model for 36 spins (70% of the total). Residues that could not be fit by a simultaneous protocol are located in the extended and/or disordered regions of the protein.

In addition, the D/D possesses a hydrophobic groove along the solvent exposed part of the interface of helices I, I′ (14Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G.

The hydrophobic side chains of this groove cluster against each other and are well defined in the solution structure, despite being solvent exposed. This is an unusual, but significant characteristic of the D/D, which promotes participation in protein-protein interactions with a diverse family of anchoring proteins (32Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mapping studies on a growing family of anchoring proteins have helped define a primary sequence of 20 amino acids that exhibit a high probability of amphipathic helix formation that is the likely site for D/D binding (33Alto M.N. Soderling S.H. Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Fayos R. Jennings P.A. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Ht31pep has emerged as the prototypic AKAP and structural studies confirmed the role of hydrophobic groups from the amphipathic helix of Ht31 for high-affinity D/D anchoring interactions (11Carr D.W.

Here we report that the trypanosomatid signal recognition particle (SRP), unlike all other known SRPs in nature, contains, in addition to the 7SL RNA homologue, a short RNA molecule, termed sRNA-85. Using conventional chromatography, we discovered a small RNA molecule of 85 nucleotides co-migrating with theLeptomonas collosoma 7SL RNA. This RNA molecule was isolated, sequenced, and used to clone the corresponding gene. sRNA-85 was identified as a tRNA-like molecule that deviates from the canonical tRNA structure. The co-existence of these RNAs in a single complex was confirmed by affinity selection using an antisense oligonucleotide to sRNA-85. The two RNA molecules exist in a particle of ∼14 S that binds transiently to ribosomes. Mutations were introduced in sRNA-85 that disrupted its putative potential to interact with 7SL RNA by base pairing; such mutants were unable to bind to 7SL RNA and to ribosomes and were aberrantly distributed within the cell. We postulate that sRNA-85 may functionally replace the truncated Alu domain of 7SL RNA. The discovery of sRNA-85 raises the intriguing possibility that sRNA-85 functional homologues may exist in other lower eukaryotes and eubacteria that lack the Alu domain.

Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Wild K. Cusack S. Weichenrieder O. Strub K. Sinning I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SRP binds to the signal sequence of a pre-secretory protein as it emerges from the ribosome and delays further translation, a process known as the elongation arrest. After interaction of the SRP with the membrane-bound SRP receptor (SRα), this pause in translation is relieved and the protein is co-translationally translocated into the ER through the translocon (1Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar,2Wild K. Cusack S. Weichenrieder O. Strub K. Sinning I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This translational pause is thought to prevent misfolding or aggregation of the non-targeted proteins. SRP homologues have been identified in organisms of all three kingdoms, but they differ considerably. The archeal 7SL RNA resembles the higher eukaryotic RNA, whereas the SRP RNA in most eubacteria is shorter and carries only domain IV, which is the binding site of the signal peptide-binding protein (3Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the ancestral SRP molecule was reduced in size during the evolution of bacteria (3Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mammalian SRP is composed of six proteins and a single RNA molecule, the 7SL RNA (4Walter P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro studies using canine microsomes, it has been demonstrated that SRP54 binds the signal peptide as it emerges from the ribosome. SRP54 also binds to the 7SL RNA, and it is a GTPase. SRP19 is thought to facilitate the association of SRP54 with the RNA (5Siegel V. Walter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 314-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SRP9/14 binds to domain I, also known as the Alu domain, and functions in elongation arrest. SRP68/72 mediates the interaction of SRP with SRP receptor (6Siegel V. Walter P. Cell. 1988; 52: 39-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In yeast, the SRP is also composed of six proteins, Srp72p, Srp68p, Sec65p (SRP19 homologue), Srp54, Srp21, and Srp14p. No homologue of yeast SRP9 exists. Four proteins (14, 21, 68, and 72) are required for the stable expression of SRP, suggesting that, together with SRP RNA, they build a stable core particle to which Sec65p and Srp54p can bind (7Brown J.D. Hann B.C. Medzihradszky K.F. Niwa M. Burlingame A.L. Walter P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4390-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Little is known about the biogenesis of SRP. SRP RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and, in the case of mammalian SRP RNA, it undergoes limited processing at the 3′-end; three uridylates are removed and a single adenylate is added (8Sinha K. Perumal K. Chen Y. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30826-30831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Endogenous SRP RNA was detected in the nucleolus (9Jacobson M.R. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7981-7986Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Further studies in yeast showed that the nuclear export of SRP RNA is a carrier-mediated process that depends on the presence of the Alu domain. Assembly of the nuclear export-competent SRP takes place in the nucleolus and requires four core SRP proteins that are actively imported into the nucleus by the ribosomal import pathway. Transport into the cytoplasm involves the nuclear export factor Xpo1p (10Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Grosshans H. Deinert K. Hurt E. Simos G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 745-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One of the most important functions of SRP is elongation arrest. This function is confined to the Alu domain, because SRP sub-particles lacking the Alu domain have lost the elongation arrest capacity (12Siegel V. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown how SRP elicits the pause of translation. It was proposed that, because of the structural similarity of the Alu domain to tRNA, it may compete with incoming tRNA to the A site of the ribosome (13Lütcke H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 531-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Experimental data demonstrated that SRP actually interacts with ribosome after the transpeptidylation reaction and before translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P site (14Ogg S.C. Walter P. Cell. 1995; 81: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The role of the elongation arrest in protein translocationin vivo remains to be clarified. Recent studies withSaccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that SRPs carrying a truncated Srp14p did not maintain elongation arrest bothin vitro and in vivo, suggesting the coupling of protein translation and translocation (15Mason N. Ciufo L.F. Brown J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4164-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, most of the bacterial SRP RNAs lack the Alu domain (3Althoff S. Selinger D. Wise J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the structure of the Alu domain of mammalian SRP have indicated that the Alu domain consists of two helical stacks connected by a central U-turn, a structural motif that is termed the τ-junction due to its shape. This structure resembles other RNAs such as the hammerhead ribozyme and the part of 23 S RNA that binds to L11 (16Weichenrieder O. Wild K. Strub K. Cusack S. Nature. 2000; 408: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In yeast, both Yarrowia lipolytica andSchizosaccharomyces pombe, the Alu domain is severely reduced and only contains the U-turn loop. The size and shape of the Alu domain are very variable; the only part that is conserved is the U-turn, being the part recognized by SRP9/14. The protein component of the Alu domain also varies across the three kingdoms, because S. cerevisiae possesses a homodimer of SRP14 (17Strub K. Fornallaz M. Bui N. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1333-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas inBacillus subtilis the dimeric histone-like HBsu protein binds to the τ-junction (18Nakamura K. Yahagi S. Yamazaki T. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13569-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids constitute a diverse family of parasitic protozoans that possess exotic RNA processing mechanisms such astrans-splicing (19Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and RNA editing (20Estevez A.M. Simpson L. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These processes may reflect the evolutionary position of trypanosomatids being descendants of one of the deepest branches of the eukaryotic lineage (21Sogin M.L. Elwood H.J. Gunderson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Very little is known about protein translocation in trypanosomatids. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of a 7SL RNA homologue in trypanosomatids. Structurally, the trypanosome 7SL RNA homologue resembles the mammalian 7SL RNA except for its Alu-like domain, which is truncated, lacking one of the loops and the potential to form the tRNA-like pseudoknot (22Michaeli S. Podell D. Agabian N. Ullu E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Ben-Shlomo H. Levitan A. Béjà O. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4977-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma 7SL RNA exists in the cell in two stable conformations that change during the translocation cycle. This conformational change is associated with a novel RNA editing of C to U in position 133 located in domain III (24Ben-Shlomo H. Shay E.N. Levitan A. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25642-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that a small RNA (sRNA-76) was co-purified with Trypanosoma brucei7SL RNP. Importantly, sRNA-76 was identified as a tRNA-like molecule (25Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This finding led us to hypothesize that trypanosome SRP may differ from all other known SRPs and is composed of two small RNAs (25Béjà O. Ullu E. Michaeli S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, progress was made in elucidating the trypanosome SRP complex. More specifically, homologues to SRP54, -72, -19, and -68 were identified in the T. brucei genome project, but no homologues to the Alu domain proteins SRP9 and -14 were found. 2S. Uliel, unpublished data. 2S. Uliel, unpublished data. RNA interference was used to silence the SRP54 in T. brucei. SRP54 depletion inhibited growth and cytokinesis, suggesting that the SRP pathway is essential. The translocation of signal peptide-containing proteins was investigated. Surprisingly, these tested proteins were translocated into the ER and properly processed. However, several of them were mislocalized and accumulated in mega vesicles, most likely due to a secondary effect on protein sorting. The translocation of these proteins to the ER upon SRP54 depletion suggests that an alternative pathway for protein translocation must exist in trypanosomes (26Liu L. Liang X.H. Uliel S. Unger R. Ullu E. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47348-47357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that, as inEscherichia coli, the substrates of the trypanosome SRP pathway consist mainly of polytopic membrane proteins and not the signal peptide-containing proteins like in higher eukaryotes (27Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar,28Seluanov A. Bibi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2053-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this study we have provided direct evidence that the trypanosomatidL. collosoma SRP is composed of two separate RNA molecules: 7SL RNA and sRNA-85, a novel tRNA-like molecule. sRNA-85 interacts with 7SL RNA by base pairing, and together these RNAs comprise a small RNP of ∼14 S that interacts with ribosomes. Disruption of the potential base pairing between sRNA-85 and 7SL RNA completely abolished sRNA-85 interaction with 7SL RNA; the RNA was found at the top of the gradient with the bulk of the cellular tRNAs. In situ hybridization suggests that both 7SL RNA and sRNA-85 are mainly confined to the cytoplasm but also exist in the nucleolus. Being a tRNA-like molecule, sRNA-85 may assist in the arrest function of the SRP. The trypanosomatid SRP may represent the first attempt to separate the arrest function of the SRP from the signal recognition and translocation promotion entities of the particle. This novel tRNA-like molecule, like the Alu domain, may also function in the transport of the SRP particle from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. Functional homologues of sRNA-85 may be present in other lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes that either carry a truncated Alu domain or lack this domain entirely. The following oligonucleotides were used: 16640, 5′-GTCCTACCAGCCTAGA-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 11–25 of sRNA-85; 18288, 5′-TGCGGGCGTCCTACC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 18–32 of sRNA-85, used for primer extension; 20404, 5′-GTTTTTTTTTTGGTGCTCGATCCAGGACT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 64–83 of sRNA-85, used for splint labeling; 25109, 5′-GTTTTTTTTTTGCTCGATCCAGGACT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 64–80 of sRNA-85, used for splint labeling; 19197, 5′-CACGGTTAAGAGCCGTG-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 25–41 of tRNALys; 20584, 5′-GTTTTTTTTTTTTTGCTTCACAGGATCGCCT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 264–279 of the 7SL RNA; 6451, 5′-CTGGACTCGAACCAGGGTTA-3′, complementary to positions 44–63 of tRNAGln; 10155, 5′-CATCCGTGACAGGATTCGAAC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 53–73 of tRNAArg; 18662, 5′-CGCAGGTGATGACAGGCT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 240–257 of 7SL RNA; 16865, 5′-ATCAGATGCCGGTAGTC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 72–86 of snoRNA-2; 18489, 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTCTGTCAAACTTCACA-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 252–270 downstream of sRNA-85, including a BamHI site, used for PCR to amplify the entire sRNA-85 locus from the λ phages carrying the gene and to generate the mutants IV, V, and VI; 35167, 5′-CGGGATCCATGCGATGCGGAGACAAGCC-3′, sense, from positions −135 to −154 upstream of the coding region, including aBamHI site, used for PCR to generate the mutants IV, V, and VI; 18530, 5′-CGGGATCCCGCCCTCCTGACAACCCACG-3′, sense, from positions −179 to −200, used for PCR to amplify the entire sRNA-85 locus from the λ phages carrying the gene; 35168, 5′-TCAAATAGAATGTGTTCGTCCTACCAGCTAGA-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 11–42 of sRNA-85, carrying three base substitutions (underlined) in the positions, which are proposed to interact with 7SL RNA (mutant IV); 35170, 5′-ATGCGGGCGTCCTCCCGTCTAGACTAATCAAGCT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions from −1 to 33, carrying three base substitutions for mutant V; 35169, 5′-AGTTTCAAATAGAATGTGTTCGTGCTCCCGTCTAGACTAATCTTGCTTCACCG-3′, antisense, complementary to positions from −7 to 36, carrying seven base substitutions for mutant VI; 36318, 5′-TGTTCGTCCTAC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 23–34, used for primer extension of mutant IV; 36317, 5′-CCCGTCTAGACT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 13–24, used for primer extension of mutant V; 38908, 5′-TGTTCGTGCTCCCGTCTAGA-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 10–29, used for primer extension of mutant VI; 36319, 5′-TGTTCGTGCTCCCGT-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 10–24, used for Northern analysis of mutant VI; 16271, 5′-ATCCAGGACTCCGAACC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 57–72 of sRNA-85 used for PCR to generate the probes for in situhybridization and Northern analysis; 18488, 5′-CGGGATCCCGTTCTGTCAAACTTCACA-3, sense, covering positions from −58 to −38 upstream of sRNA-85, carrying a BamHI site, used for PCR to generate the probes for in situhybridization; 15137, 5′-CCGGATCCGGTGCGATGAAATGAGACGG-3′, antisense, carrying a BamHI site, complementary to positions 23–42 downstream of the 7SL RNA gene, used for PCR to generate the probes for in situ hybridization; 8721, 5′-CGGGATCCAGCCGGAGCCTTGCTC-3′, sense, covering positions 1–16 of the 7SL RNA with a BamHI site, used for PCR to generate the probes for in situ hybridization; 12407, 5′-AGCTATATCTCTCGAA-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 83–98 of U6 snRNA, used for Northern analysis; 5303, 5′-GCAGAGCACCACGTCAACGC-3′, antisense, complementary to positions 82–101 of 7SL RNA, used for Northern analysis; and SM-04, 5′-GGCTTAGAGGCGTTCAGCCGAGAACCACCGTGCGA-3′, antisense, complementary to the 3′-end of rRNA1, used for Northern analysis. L. collosoma growth and extract preparation were as previously described (29Xu Y.X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted using nitrogen cavitation, and RNPs were extracted at 0.4 m KCl. DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography was as previously described (30Michaeli S. Roberts T.G. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10582-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flowthrough fraction from the DEAE-Sephacel was concentrated on a 0.5-ml DEAE-Sephacel column by binding at 50 mm KCl and eluting the particles at 0.4 m KCl. The KCl eluate was layered on continuous 10–30% (w/v) sucrose gradients. Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for either 3 or 22 h at 35,000 rpm using a Beckman SW41 rotor. RNA was extracted from the sucrose peak fraction carrying sRNA-85, and samples (0.1 μg) were 3′-end-labeled with [5′-32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol) (31England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The labeled RNA was fractionated on an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel. The eluted small RNA was subjected to sequencing using base-specific nucleases as previously described (29Xu Y.X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The alkaline partial hydrolysis ladder was produced by boiling the RNA in 50 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA for 2 min. The labeled RNA (250,000 cpm) was also used to screen a genomic library (32Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two 700-bp fragments derived from digesting the λDNA with RsaI and Sau3A were subcloned into pBluescript and were sequenced from both strands using T3 and T7 primers. The extracts or column fractions for affinity selection were in buffer A containing 400 mm KCl. Oligonucleotide 85-R-1, 5′-GATCCAGGACTCGAACCXXXXA-3′, complementary to positions 58–74 of sRNA-85, is composed of 2′-O-methyl nucleotides except X, which is biotinylated 2′-deoxythymidine. Affinity selection was performed essentially as previously described (33Palfi Z. Gunzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) except that hybridization with the RNPs was performed in 200–250 mm KCl. 10–20 μg of RNA was mixed with 30–100 pmol of oligonucleotides and heated for 2 min at 85 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The annealing reaction was quenched on ice for 30 min, 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 5 units of T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase version 2.0,Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the reaction was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (34Hausner T.P. Giglio L.M. Weiner A.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2146-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. RNA was prepared from L. collosoma cells under acidic conditions (35Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 108) were pelleted at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.3m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 10 mm EDTA. The RNA was subjected to two extractions with equal volumes of phenol equilibrated with the same buffer. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA was mixed with sample buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 8 m urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol) and fractionated on a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). To discharge the tRNA, we treated the RNA sample with a mild alkaline by incubating the RNA in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.6) at 37 °C for 20 min. sRNA-85 mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis using primers carrying the mutations and oligonucleotides situated upstream and downstream of the gene. The different oligonucleotides used for the PCR amplification were previously listed. The mutated sRNA-85 genes were subcloned into theBamHI site of the pX-neo expression vector. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Stable cell lines carrying the mutated genes were established as described previously (32Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). L. collosoma cells were harvested at 5 × 107 cells/ml and washed with PBS. Cells (5 × 109) were concentrated and incubated on ice. AMT (Sigma) was added to the cells at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (36Watkins K.P. Dungan J.M. Agabian N. Cell. 1994; 76: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells treated with AMT-psoralen were kept on ice and irradiated using a UV lamp at 365 nm with an intensity of 10 milliwatts/cm2 for 30 min. RNA was prepared from the cells using TRIzol reagent and subjected to the splint-labeling technique. Hybridization probes specific to 7SL RNA and sRNA-85 were synthesized by PCR amplification. For the synthesis of the 7SL RNA probes, two oligonucleotides, 15137 and 8721, were used, and for the production of the sRNA-85, oligonucleotides 16721 and 18488 were used. PCR was performed under standard conditions using the expand high fidelity enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), but the dNTPs mixture contained 200 μm of each of the nucleotides except dTTP (130 μm) and digoxigenin-11 (DIG)-dUTP (70 μm). For labeling the mutant-specific oligonucleotides, the oligonucleotides were tailed with DIG-dUTP using the enzyme terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. The conditions for fixation and hybridization were similar to those published previously (37Chaves I. Zomerdijk J. Dirks-Mulder A. Dirks R.W. Rapp A.K. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12328-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells in mid-logarithmic phase were washed with PBS (0.15 msodium chloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and resuspended in PBS before fixation. The cells were then diluted 1:2 in fixation solution (1× fixation solution: 4% formaldehyde and 5% acetic acid in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min while rotating. The fixed cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 ×g, and the fixation medium was replaced by 70% ethanol, followed by two additional washes in 70% ethanol to remove all traces of formaldehyde. Microscopic slides were prepared by dropping 20 μl of fixed-cell suspension on glass slides. Slides were allowed to air-dry and were then baked at 80 °C for 10 min to improve the adherence. Before hybridization, the cells were subjected to partial hydrolysis and proteolysis by using 0.1% pepsin in 0.01 mHCl for 5 min at 37 °C. After treatment, the cells were washed with 2× SSC, dehydrated with ethanol, and then air-dried. The DIG-labeled PCR product was in 60% deionized formamide, 2× SSC, 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, and 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 24 h. When DIG-labeled oligonucleotides were used, hybridization was performed at 25 °C. After hybridization, the slides were rinsed three times for 20 min each in 50% formamide/2× SSC at 37 °C. Finally, slides were washed two times for 5 min at room temperature. For detection of the DIG-labeled probes, slides were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C with 1:200 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-DIG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To stain the nucleus and kinetoplast, we incubated the cells with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for 15 min. The cells were imaged by an Olympus Vanox AHBT3 microscope equipped with a fluorescence lamp and ×100 objective, and image analysis was performed using an Olympus DP50 camera. To study the composition of the trypanosomatid SRP complex, we devised a scheme to purify the particles. Whole-cell extracts were prepared in high salt concentration to assure the dissociation of the SRP from the ribosomes. Enrichment for small RNPs, including the SRP, was achieved by removing the ribosomes, and the resulting post-ribosomal supernatant (PRS) contained U2 snRNA, 5S RNA, 7SL RNA, and tRNAs (Fig. 1A,lane 1). A purification step on a DEAE-Sephacel was able to separate the SRP population into two types: (1) particles that did not bind to the column and were found in the flowthrough and wash fractions (lanes 2 and 3) and (2) particles that were bound to the column and were eluted at 0.4 m KCl (lanes 4–6). The samples from the column fractionation were subjected to Northern analysis with the 7SL RNA probe (lower part of Fig.1A). Quantitation of the Northern analysis indicates that only 19.5% of the SRP was bound to the column. The L. collosoma 7SL RNA exists in the cell in two stable conformations. We have previously demonstrated that 7SL I is preferentially bound to ribosomes, whereas 7SL II is found mainly in free RNPs (24Ben-Shlomo H. Shay E.N. Levitan A. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25642-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A great variation was observed with respect to the binding of different small particles to the DEAE-Sephacel column, except for the SRP particles, which in all our preparations were unable to bind to the column. The inability of the SRP complex to bind to the column matrix may stem from the fact that most of the RNA is inaccessible for interacting with the column, because it is either involved in intramolecular base pairing or bound to proteins. In several preparations, it was possible to enrich flowthrough fractions that were completely depleted of almost all small RNPs except for the SRP and other small RNAs in the size range of 60–90 nt. Such a fraction was further used to purify the SRP complex. In the last purification step, concentrated flowthrough column fractions were separated by using two sequential sucrose gradients, consequently yielding a fairly homogeneous population of ∼12 S particles enriched for the two 7SL RNA forms and for an RNA of about 85 nt (Fig. 1B). The small RNA was termed sRNA-85. To identify the sRNA-85 molecule, we labeled RNA from the sucrose-gradient peak fractions at the 3′-end with pCp and T4 RNA ligase and subjected it to enzymatic sequencing (Fig. 1C). Several gaps were observed in the partial alkaline ladder (marked withstars in Fig. 1C), indicating the presence of ribose-methylated nt in sRNA-85. Unfortunately, with the partial RNA sequencing data, we were unable to identify it, and to obtain the complete sequence of sRNA-85, the coding gene had to be cloned from anL. collosoma genomic library. Two subclones of 700-bp derived from λDNA carrying sRNA-85 with Sau3A andRsaI were used for the sequencing. The complete sequence of sRNA-85 is presented in Fig.2A. Sequence alignment showed a 90% identity between the gene sequence in Fig. 2A and the RNA sequence presented in Fig. 1C. RNase H cleavage with oligonucleotides complementary to either the 3′- or the 5′-end of the RNA indicated that sRNA-85 is a single transcript (data not shown). A GenBankTM search using the entire sequence presented in Fig. 2A indicated the presence of tRNALys"

https://openalex.org/W1993073403,"The mechanism for the conversion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) from the active to the latent conformation is not well understood. Recently, a monoclonal antibody, 33B8, was described that rapidly converts PAI-1 to the latent conformation (Verhamme, I., Kvassman, J. O., Day, D., Debrock, S., Vleugels, N., Declerck, P. J., and Shore, J. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17511–17517). In an attempt to understand this interaction, and more broadly to understand the mechanism of the natural transition of PAI-1 to the latent conformation, we have used random mutagenesis to identify the 33B8 epitope in PAI-1. This site involves at least 8 amino acids scattered over more than two-thirds of the linear sequence that form a compact epitope on the PAI-1 three-dimensional structure. Surface plasmon resonance studies indicate a high affinity interaction between latent PAI-1 and 33B8 that is ∼100-fold higher than comparable binding to active PAI-1. Structural modeling results together with surface plasmon resonance analysis of parental and site-directed PAI-1 mutants with disrupted 33B8 binding suggest the existence of a specific PAI-1 intermediate structure that is stabilized by 33B8 binding. These analyses strongly suggest that this intermediate form of PAI-1 has a partial insertion of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A, and together, these data have significant implications for the general serpin mechanism of proteinase inhibition. The mechanism for the conversion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) from the active to the latent conformation is not well understood. Recently, a monoclonal antibody, 33B8, was described that rapidly converts PAI-1 to the latent conformation (Verhamme, I., Kvassman, J. O., Day, D., Debrock, S., Vleugels, N., Declerck, P.

J. Invest. Med. 1998; 46: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, PAI-1 is found at low levels in the plasma (5–10 ng/ml), but it is elevated significantly in a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis (2Schneiderman J. Sawdey M.S. Keeton M.R. Bordin G.M. Bernstein E.F. Dilley R.B. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PAI-1 stabilizes both arterial and venous thrombi, contributing, respectively, to coronary arterial occlusion in post-myocardial infarction (5Hamsten A. de Faire U. Walldius G. Dahlen G. Szamosi A. Landou C. Blombäck M. Wiman B. Lancet. 1987; 2: 3-9Abstract PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) and venous thrombosis following post-operative recovery from orthopedic surgery (6Siemens H.J. Brueckner S. Hagelberg S. Wagner T. Schmucker P. J. Clin. Anesth. 1999; 11: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plasma PAI-1 is also elevated in postmenopausal women, and has been proposed to contribute to the relative increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in this population (7Koh K.K. Mincemoyer R. Bui M.N. Csako G. Pucino F. Guetta V. Waclawiw M. Cannon III, R.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The role of PAI-1 in atherosclerosis is less well defined, but PAI-1 is found in high concentrations in vascular plaque (8Taatjes D.J. Wadsworth M. Absher P.M. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1997; 21: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and is involved in the in vitro regulation of tissue proteolysis and smooth muscle cell migration (9Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).Whereas PAI-1 elevation is associated with disease progression, PAI-1 inhibition is associated with improvement in a number of pathophysiologic processes. PAI-1 null mice are viable and have normal coagulation and normal bleeding time (10Carmeliet P. Stassen J.M. Schoonjans L. Ream B. van den Oord J.J. De Mol M. Mulligan R.C. Collen D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, when subjected to vascular injury, PAI-1 null mice develop unstable thrombi that lyse spontaneously, indicating that revascularization of occluded arteries is improved significantly in the absence of PAI-1 (11Farrehi P.M. Ozaki C.K. Carmeliet P. Fay W.P. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). With respect to pathological fibrosis, PAI-1 null mice are protected from the development of vascular plaque (12Eitzman D.T. Westrick R.J. Xu Z. Tyson J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2000; 96: 4212-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pulmonary fibrosis (13Hattori N. Degen J.L. Sisson T.H. Liu H. Moore B.B. Pandrangi R.G. Simon R.H. Drew A.F. J. Clin.

Invest. 1996; 97: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These studies, together with the aforementioned clinical observations, suggest that PAI-1 inhibition may restore endogenous stimulation of fibrinolysis by plasminogen activation, re-establishing a critical defense mechanism for the prevention of intravascular thrombosis and tissue fibrosis.Structurally, PAI-1 is a metastable protein exhibiting conformational plasticity, and exists in active, latent, and cleaved forms (15Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The conversion of PAI-1 from the active to the latent conformation appears to be unique among serpins in that it occurs spontaneously at a relatively rapid rate. And while this transition has been known for more than 15 years (16Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the latent structure has been known for 10 years (17Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), the mechanism of the conversion from the active to the latent conformation is not well understood.To gain a better understanding of the structural basis for the latent transition we have analyzed the interaction of a murine monoclonal antibody, 33B8, with PAI-1 (18Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This antibody was raised against the tPA·PAI-1 complex, and has previously been shown to rapidly inactivate PAI-1 by accelerating the conversion of PAI-1 to the latent conformation (19Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reported rate of inactivation by this antibody is ∼4000-fold faster than the spontaneous conversion of PAI-1 to the latent structure. Based on these studies it was suggested that exposure of the antibody epitope depended on an unfavorable equilibrium in PAI-1 that might involve an intermediate PAI-1 structure with partial insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. Therefore, to see if this epitope requires partial RCL insertion into β-sheet A we have used a random PAI-1 mutant library (20Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to identify this binding epitope, by screening the library for functional PAI-1 mutants that no longer react with 33B8.DISCUSSIONTogether, our data demonstrate that the identified 8 residues must comprise at least a significant part of the 33B8 binding epitope on the surface of PAI-1. From our modeling of this epitope on the active and latent conformations (Fig. 5) it is readily apparent that in latent PAI-1 the putative epitope is much more linear and consolidated than it is in active PAI-1. The surface plasmon resonance experiments also show that the latent form of PAI-1 binds 33B8 with much higher apparent affinity than does active PAI-1, and that the difference in apparent affinity is because of a large reduction in the rate of active PAI-1 association with the antibody and not to differences in the rates of dissociation. This observation is consistent with earlier suggestions that active PAI-1 may be in equilibrium between a structure with the RCL fully exposed and an intermediate form with partial RCL insertion into β-sheet A (19Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If this equilibrium exists then there are two possible ways in which the PAI-1 mutants identified in this study could show reduced binding to 33B8. The first, which has already been discussed, is by directly disrupting the epitope, and the second is by stabilizing PAI-1 in a structure with low affinity for 33B8. In the latter case we would expect that these mutants would also show a reduced rate of conversion to the latent form because the putative intermediate should be on the pathway from active PAI-1 to the latent structure. To test this possibility we determined the rate at which each of the point mutants converted to the latent conformation. These data indicated that there was no correlation between the rate of PAI-1 conversion to the latent form and the 33B8 binding defect. Specifically, the three point mutations that show major reductions in their rates of association with 33B8 but only small changes in their dissociation rates (N87D, T232S, and N329I) were either as stable, or less stable than wild-type PAI-1 (data not shown). These results support the conclusion that the identified mutations map the 33B8 binding epitope, and that the loss of binding by the mutants is not because of effects of the mutations outside the epitope that shift the putative equilibrium of active PAI-1 away from a form with high affinity for 33B8.Nonetheless our data do provide significant support for active PAI-1 being in equilibrium with an intermediate form. This comes from modeling of the 33B8 epitope on the structures of two different serpins with partial RCL insertion. The first is native antithrombin III (24Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R.

Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and the second is a mutant of α1-antichymotrypsin in the δ conformation (26Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These structures are shown in Fig.8 along with the active and latent forms of PAI-1. The 8 residues identified in our studies are purple in each PAI-1 structure, as are residues at the homologous positions in antithrombin III and α1-antichymotrypsin. Examination of the four structures demonstrates that in active PAI-1 the putative epitope is less compact than in the other structures, and that one of the residues (Ser331) is essentially entirely blocked by residues of the RCL in active PAI-1 (red arrow, Fig. 8, A and E). In contrast, both latent PAI-1 (Fig. 8, D and H) and the mutant form of α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 8, C andG) show a compact coherent epitope with all the residues visible on the surface of the molecule. In the case of antithrombin III the epitope structure is intermediate between active PAI-1 (Fig. 8,A and E) and the δ conformation (Fig. 8,C and G) with only the equivalent of the Asn329 position being partially obscured by the RCL (blue arrow, Fig. 8, B and F). These structures demonstrate that serpins can exist in conformations with partial RCL insertion and that the extent of this insertion can vary. Furthermore, our modeling studies suggest that because the 33B8 epitope contains residues that are located on both sides of the RCL insertion site in the fully RCL expelled form of active PAI-1 (Asn329-β-strand 5A, Gln174-β-strand 3A, and Asp89-β-strand 2A), then the RCL must be partially inserted in a structure similar to those shown in Fig. 8, panels B, F, C, and G, before the antibody binds, otherwise the most likely effect of antibody binding would be to block RCL insertion, not to promote it.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This hypothesis is consistent with current models of the serpin mechanism, which suggest that active serpins have flexible RCLs, and that this flexibility is essential for inhibitor function (21Lawrence D.A.

These peptides incorporate into the serpin, as strand 4 of β-sheet A and convert the inhibitor to a form analogous to the latent structure but with the RCL exposed where it becomes a non-inhibitory substrate for its target proteinase (34Schulze A.J.

This mechanism, which was predicted in 1990 (38Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was largely confirmed when the crystal structure of a serpin-proteinase complex was recently solved (42Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This structure demonstrates that in the stable inhibited complex the serpin RCL is fully inserted into β-sheet A, and that large regions of the proteinase are distorted including the active site. This distortion prevents the efficient deacylation of the complex and kinetically traps the proteinase. Thus, full insertion of the RCL is essential for stable inhibition. However, the initial steps of RCL insertion are not well defined. For example, it has been suggested that antithrombin III can undergo an allosteric switch between two conformations of its RCL, one that is partially inserted and one that is fully expelled from β-sheet A (43van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this transition regulates the activity of antithrombin toward different proteinases (44Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 45Belzar K.J. Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Gettins P.G. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8551-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies, together with the results described here, suggest that a dynamic equilibrium between partial RCL insertion and an uninserted form may be a common feature of serpins, and that this equilibrium may play an important role in regulating serpin inhibitory activity.Finally, our results demonstrate a novel approach for identifying the binding epitope of a PAI-1 inactivator and for distinguishing its mechanism of action. It is likely that this approach will be useful for examining other PAI-1 ligands, and ultimately, this experimental design may be applicable to the characterization of binding epitopes in other metastable proteins, among which serpins are a predominant family that presents many challenges, yet offer unique opportunities for drug discovery. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)1 is a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene family and is the principal inhibitor of the plasminogen activators tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in vivo (1Vaughan D.E. J. Invest. Med. 1998; 46: 370-376PubMed Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, PAI-1 is found at low levels in the plasma (5–10 ng/ml), but it is elevated significantly in a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis (2Schneiderman J. Sawdey M.S. Keeton M.R. Bordin G.M. Bernstein E.F. Dilley R.B. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), deep vein thrombosis (3Juhan-Vague I. Valadier J. Alessi M.C. Aillaud M.F. Ansaldi J. Philip-Joet C. Holvoet P. Serradimigni A. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (4Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PAI-1 stabilizes both arterial and venous thrombi, contributing, respectively, to coronary arterial occlusion in post-myocardial infarction (5Hamsten A. de Faire U. Walldius G. Dahlen G. Szamosi A. Landou C. Blombäck M. Wiman B. Lancet. 1987; 2: 3-9Abstract PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar) and venous thrombosis following post-operative recovery from orthopedic surgery (6Siemens H.J. Brueckner S. Hagelberg S. Wagner T. Schmucker P. J. Clin. Anesth. 1999; 11: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Plasma PAI-1 is also elevated in postmenopausal women, and has been proposed to contribute to the relative increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in this population (7Koh K.K. Mincemoyer R. Bui M.N. Csako G. Pucino F. Guetta V. Waclawiw M. Cannon III, R.O. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The role of PAI-1 in atherosclerosis is less well defined, but PAI-1 is found in high concentrations in vascular plaque (8Taatjes D.J. Wadsworth M. Absher P.M. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1997; 21: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and is involved in the in vitro regulation of tissue proteolysis and smooth muscle cell migration (9Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Whereas PAI-1 elevation is associated with disease progression, PAI-1 inhibition is associated with improvement in a number of pathophysiologic processes. PAI-1 null mice are viable and have normal coagulation and normal bleeding time (10Carmeliet P. Stassen J.M. Schoonjans L. Ream B. van den Oord J.J. De Mol M. Mulligan R.C. Collen D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, when subjected to vascular injury, PAI-1 null mice develop unstable thrombi that lyse spontaneously, indicating that revascularization of occluded arteries is improved significantly in the absence of PAI-1 (11Farrehi P.M. Ozaki C.K. Carmeliet P. Fay W.P. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). With respect to pathological fibrosis, PAI-1 null mice are protected from the development of vascular plaque (12Eitzman D.T. Westrick R.J. Xu Z. Tyson J. Ginsburg D. Blood. 2000; 96: 4212-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pulmonary fibrosis (13Hattori N. Degen J.L. Sisson T.H. Liu H. Moore B.B. Pandrangi R.G. Simon R.H. Drew A.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Eitzman D.T. McCoy R.D. Zheng X. Fay W.P. Shen T. Ginsburg D. Simon R.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These studies, together with the aforementioned clinical observations, suggest that PAI-1 inhibition may restore endogenous stimulation of fibrinolysis by plasminogen activation, re-establishing a critical defense mechanism for the prevention of intravascular thrombosis and tissue fibrosis. Structurally, PAI-1 is a metastable protein exhibiting conformational plasticity, and exists in active, latent, and cleaved forms (15Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The conversion of PAI-1 from the active to the latent conformation appears to be unique among serpins in that it occurs spontaneously at a relatively rapid rate. And while this transition has been known for more than 15 years (16Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the latent structure has been known for 10 years (17Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), the mechanism of the conversion from the active to the latent conformation is not well understood. To gain a better understanding of the structural basis for the latent transition we have analyzed the interaction of a murine monoclonal antibody, 33B8, with PAI-1 (18Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This antibody was raised against the tPA·PAI-1 complex, and has previously been shown to rapidly inactivate PAI-1 by accelerating the conversion of PAI-1 to the latent conformation (19Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reported rate of inactivation by this antibody is ∼4000-fold faster than the spontaneous conversion of PAI-1 to the latent structure. Based on these studies it was suggested that exposure of the antibody epitope depended on an unfavorable equilibrium in PAI-1 that might involve an intermediate PAI-1 structure with partial insertion of the RCL into β-sheet A. Therefore, to see if this epitope requires partial RCL insertion into β-sheet A we have used a random PAI-1 mutant library (20Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to identify this binding epitope, by screening the library for functional PAI-1 mutants that no longer react with 33B8. DISCUSSIONTogether, our data demonstrate that the identified 8 residues must comprise at least a significant part of the 33B8 binding epitope on the surface of PAI-1. From our modeling of this epitope on the active and latent conformations (Fig. 5) it is readily apparent that in latent PAI-1 the putative epitope is much more linear and consolidated than it is in active PAI-1. The surface plasmon resonance experiments also show that the latent form of PAI-1 binds 33B8 with much higher apparent affinity than does active PAI-1, and that the difference in apparent affinity is because of a large reduction in the rate of active PAI-1 association with the antibody and not to differences in the rates of dissociation. This observation is consistent with earlier suggestions that active PAI-1 may be in equilibrium between a structure with the RCL fully exposed and an intermediate form with partial RCL insertion into β-sheet A (19Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If this equilibrium exists then there are two possible ways in which the PAI-1 mutants identified in this study could show reduced binding to 33B8. The first, which has already been discussed, is by directly disrupting the epitope, and the second is by stabilizing PAI-1 in a structure with low affinity for 33B8. In the latter case we would expect that these mutants would also show a reduced rate of conversion to the latent form because the putative intermediate should be on the pathway from active PAI-1 to the latent structure. To test this possibility we determined the rate at which each of the point mutants converted to the latent conformation. These data indicated that there was no correlation between the rate of PAI-1 conversion to the latent form and the 33B8 binding defect. Specifically, the three point mutations that show major reductions in their rates of association with 33B8 but only small changes in their dissociation rates (N87D, T232S, and N329I) were either as stable, or less stable than wild-type PAI-1 (data not shown). These results support the conclusion that the identified mutations map the 33B8 binding epitope, and that the loss of binding by the mutants is not because of effects of the mutations outside the epitope that shift the putative equilibrium of active PAI-1 away from a form with high affinity for 33B8.Nonetheless our data do provide significant support for active PAI-1 being in equilibrium with an intermediate form. This comes from modeling of the 33B8 epitope on the structures of two different serpins with partial RCL insertion. The first is native antithrombin III (24Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R.

Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and the second is a mutant of α1-antichymotrypsin in the δ conformation (26Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These structures are shown in Fig.8 along with the active and latent forms of PAI-1. The 8 residues identified in our studies are purple in each PAI-1 structure, as are residues at the homologous positions in antithrombin III and α1-antichymotrypsin. Examination of the four structures demonstrates that in active PAI-1 the putative epitope is less compact than in the other structures, and that one of the residues (Ser331) is essentially entirely blocked by residues of the RCL in active PAI-1 (red arrow, Fig. 8, A and E). In contrast, both latent PAI-1 (Fig. 8, D and H) and the mutant form of α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 8, C andG) show a compact coherent epitope with all the residues visible on the surface of the molecule. In the case of antithrombin III the epitope structure is intermediate between active PAI-1 (Fig. 8,A and E) and the δ conformation (Fig. 8,C and G) with only the equivalent of the Asn329 position being partially obscured by the RCL (blue arrow, Fig. 8, B and F). These structures demonstrate that serpins can exist in conformations with partial RCL insertion and that the extent of this insertion can vary. Furthermore, our modeling studies suggest that because the 33B8 epitope contains residues that are located on both sides of the RCL insertion site in the fully RCL expelled form of active PAI-1 (Asn329-β-strand 5A, Gln174-β-strand 3A, and Asp89-β-strand 2A), then the RCL must be partially inserted in a structure similar to those shown in Fig. 8, panels B, F, C, and G, before the antibody binds, otherwise the most likely effect of antibody binding would be to block RCL insertion, not to promote it.This hypothesis is consistent with current models of the serpin mechanism, which suggest that active serpins have flexible RCLs, and that this flexibility is essential for inhibitor function (21Lawrence D.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was largely confirmed when the crystal structure of a serpin-proteinase complex was recently solved (42Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). This structure demonstrates that in the stable inhibited complex the serpin RCL is fully inserted into β-sheet A, and that large regions of the proteinase are distorted including the active site. This distortion prevents the efficient deacylation of the complex and kinetically traps the proteinase. Thus, full insertion of the RCL is essential for stable inhibition. However, the initial steps of RCL insertion are not well defined. For example, it has been suggested that antithrombin III can undergo an allosteric switch between two conformations of its RCL, one that is partially inserted and one that is fully expelled from β-sheet A (43van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this transition regulates the activity of antithrombin toward different proteinases (44Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 45Belzar K.J. Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Gettins P.G. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8551-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These studies, together with the results described here, suggest that a dynamic equilibrium between partial RCL insertion and an uninserted form may be a common feature of serpins, and that this equilibrium may play an important role in regulating serpin inhibitory activity.Finally, our results demonstrate a novel approach for identifying the binding epitope of a PAI-1 inactivator and for distinguishing its mechanism of action. It is likely that this approach will be useful for examining other PAI-1 ligands, and ultimately, this experimental design may be applicable to the characterization of binding epitopes in other metastable proteins, among which serpins are a predominant family that presents many challenges, yet offer unique opportunities for drug discovery. Together, our data demonstrate that the identified 8 residues must comprise at least a significant part of the 33B8 binding epitope on the surface of PAI-1. From our modeling of this epitope on the active and latent conformations (Fig. 5) it is readily apparent that in latent PAI-1 the putative epitope is much more linear and consolidated than it is in active PAI-1. The surface plasmon resonance experiments also show that the latent form of PAI-1 binds 33B8 with much higher apparent affinity than does active PAI-1, and that the difference in apparent affinity is because of a large reduction in the rate of active PAI-1 association with the antibody and not to differences in the rates of dissociation. This observation is consistent with earlier suggestions that active PAI-1 may be in equilibrium between a structure with the RCL fully exposed and an intermediate form with partial RCL insertion into β-sheet A (19Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). If this equilibrium exists then there are two possible ways in which the PAI-1 mutants identified in this study could show reduced binding to 33B8. The first, which has already been discussed, is by directly disrupting the epitope, and the second is by stabilizing PAI-1 in a structure with low affinity for 33B8. In the latter case we would expect that these mutants would also show a reduced rate of conversion to the latent form because the putative intermediate should be on the pathway from active PAI-1 to the latent structure. To test this possibility we determined the rate at which each of the point mutants converted to the latent conformation. These data indicated that there was no correlation between the rate of PAI-1 conversion to the latent form and the 33B8 binding defect. Specifically, the three point mutations that show major reductions in their rates of association with 33B8 but only small changes in their dissociation rates (N87D, T232S, and N329I) were either as stable, or less stable than wild-type PAI-1 (data not shown). These results support the conclusion that the identified mutations map the 33B8 binding epitope, and that the loss of binding by the mutants is not because of effects of the mutations outside the epitope that shift the putative equilibrium of active PAI-1 away from a form with high affinity for 33B8. Nonetheless our data do provide significant support for active PAI-1 being in equilibrium with an intermediate form. This comes from modeling of the 33B8 epitope on the structures of two different serpins with partial RCL insertion. The first is native antithrombin III (24Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,25Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and the second is a mutant of α1-antichymotrypsin in the δ conformation (26Gooptu B. Hazes B. Chang W.S. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These structures are shown in Fig.8 along with the active and latent forms of PAI-1. The 8 residues identified in our studies are purple in each PAI-1 structure, as are residues at the homologous positions in antithrombin III and α1-antichymotrypsin. Examination of the four structures demonstrates that in active PAI-1 the putative epitope is less compact than in the other structures, and that one of the residues (Ser331) is essentially entirely blocked by residues of the RCL in active PAI-1 (red arrow, Fig. 8, A and E). In contrast, both latent PAI-1 (Fig. 8, D and H) and the mutant form of α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 8, C andG) show a compact coherent epitope with all the residues visible on the surface of the molecule. In the case of antithrombin III the epitope structure is intermediate between active PAI-1 (Fig. 8,A and E) and the δ conformation (Fig. 8,C and G) with only the equivalent of the Asn329 position being partially obscured by the RCL (blue arrow, Fig. 8, B and F). These structures demonstrate that serpins can exist in conformations with partial RCL insertion and that the extent of this insertion can vary. Furthermore, our modeling studies suggest that because the 33B8 epitope contains residues that are located on both sides of the RCL insertion site in the fully RCL expelled form of active PAI-1 (Asn329-β-strand 5A, Gln174-β-strand 3A, and Asp89-β-strand 2A), then the RCL must be partially inserted in a structure similar to those shown in Fig. 8, panels B, F, C, and G, before the antibody binds, otherwise the most likely effect of antibody binding would be to block RCL insertion, not to promote it. This hypothesis is consistent with current models of the serpin mechanism, which suggest that active serpins have flexible RCLs, and that this flexibility is essential for inhibitor function (21Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Carrell R.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5839-5844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Serpin activity can also be blocked by synthetic peptides that are homologous to the serpin RCL. These peptides incorporate into the serpin, as strand 4 of β-sheet A and convert the inhibitor to a form analogous to the latent structure but with the RCL exposed where it becomes a non-inhibitory substrate for its target proteinase (34Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Björk I. Ylinenjärvi K. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Presumably the first step in binding of the synthetic peptide would be to the open conformation that we propose. During the normal inhibition reaction, proteinase cleavage of the RCL to the point of an acylenzyme intermediate is coupled with a rapid conformational rearrangement of the serpin involving complete RCL insertion, which in turn causes a distortion of the catalytic center of the enzyme and consequent trapping of the proteinase (21Lawrence D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2101993420,"Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) is an abundant surface molecule that plays key roles in the infectious cycle ofLeishmania major. The dominant feature of LPG is a polymer of phosphoglycan (PG) (6Galβ1,4Manα1-PO4) repeating units. In L. major these are extensively substituted with Gal(β1,3) side chains, which are required for binding to midgut lectins and survival. We utilized evolutionary polymorphisms in LPG structure and cross-species transfections to recover genes encoding the LPG side chain β1,3-galactosyltransferases (βGalTs). A dispersed family of six SCG genes was recovered, whose predicted proteins exhibited characteristics of eukaryotic GalTs. At least four of these proteins showed significant LPG side chain βGalT activity; SCG3 exhibited initiating GalT activity whereas SCG2 showed both initiating and elongating GalT activity. However, the activity ofSCG2 was context-dependent, being largely silent in its normal genomic milieu, and different strains show considerable variation in the extent of LPG galactosylation. Thus theL. major genome encodes a family of SCGs with varying specificity and activity, and we propose that strain-specific LPG galactosylation patterns reflect differences in their expression.

Desjeux P. deRaadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Within vertebrates Leishmania resides within acidified phagosomes of macrophages as the amastigote stage. A key step of the infectious cycle is the ability of the parasite to be transmitted to fresh hosts by an insect vector, phlebotomine sand flies. Several studies have emphasized the importance of lipophosphoglycan (LPG),1 an abundant surface glycolipid of Leishmania promastigotes, in sand fly survival (reviewed in Refs. 2Ilg T. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2001; 190: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Following a sand fly bite,Leishmania and the blood meal are enclosed by a midgut peritrophic matrix for several days, whereas parasites differentiate to the replicating procyclic promastigote stage. During this period LPG and other phosphoglycans (PGs) contribute to survival in the hydrolytic milieu of the midgut (3Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). After a few days the matrix is degraded and the remnants of the blood meal are excreted; at this time, promastigotes bind to midgut epithelium through an LPG-dependent interaction to avoid being excreted as well (5Pimenta P.F. Turco S.J. McConville M.J. Lawyer P.G. Perkins P.V. Sacks D.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As digestion is completed and the fly prepares to feed again, parasites differentiate to the infectious metacyclic stage, which synthesize a structurally modified metacyclic form LPG that is unable to bind the midgut (5Pimenta P.F. Turco S.J. McConville M.J. Lawyer P.G. Perkins P.V. Sacks D.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6McConville M.J. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Sacks D.L.

The detached metacyclic parasites are adapted for transmission and establishment of the infection in a new vertebrate host (8Sacks D.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The basic “backbone” structure in all Leishmaniaconsists of a 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylinositol lipid anchor and heptasaccharide core, to which is joined a long PG polymer composed of 15–30 (Galβ1,4Manα1-PO4) repeating units, terminated by a capping oligosaccharide (Fig. 1). In different species and/or developmental stages a variety of modifications of the LPG backbone have been observed, including changes in the terminal capping oligosaccharide of LPG, the addition of side chain (sc) sugar modifications to the prototypic PG (Gal-Man-P) repeating unit, and increases in the number of PG repeats (reviewed in Refs.2Ilg T. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2001; 190: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev.

These modifications contribute in a species-specific manner to the binding and release of Leishmania promastigotes during development in the sand fly. In procyclic Leishmania donovani the PG repeats are unmodified, and midgut binding occurs through the Gal-containing capping oligosaccharide; in metacyclics, the number of PG repeats approximately doubles, resulting in a conformational change that precludes midgut binding (9Sacks D.L. Pimenta P.F. McConville M.J. Schneider P. Turco S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In L. major the PG repeats are modified by side chain β1,3 galactosyl residues (scβGal); in metacyclics, the number of PG repeats increases and the scβGal residues are further modified by addition of arabinose caps to block midgut binding (6McConville M.J. Turco S.J. Ferguson M.A. Sacks D.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3593-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 7Sacks D.L. Brodin T.N. Turco S.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These species-specific modifications also play important roles in the ability of the natural sand fly vector to transmit Leishmania species (2Ilg T. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2001; 190: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D. Kamhawi S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 453-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For example, neither L. donovani nor Leishmania majormutants lacking LPG PG scβGal residues can be maintained in the natural L. major host Phleobotomus papatasi (10Butcher B.A. Turco S.J.

A common theme in many protozoan parasites is their ability to alter their surface coats to ensure survival in both the insect vectors and mammalian hosts (12Roditi I. Liniger M. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In many respects, LPG functions as a stage- and species-specific adhesin in the sand fly. Adhesins have been extensively studied in bacteria (13Mulvey M.A. Hultgren S.J. Second Ed. Adhesion, Bacterial, Encyclopedia of Microbiology. 1. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar) and fungi (14Sundstrom P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Typically microbial adhesins are proteins that mediate attachment through interactions with specific carbohydrate, lipid, and/or protein moieties in host receptors. In Leishmania, this relationship is reversed because LPG is a glycolipid adhesin responsible for binding to a putative protein receptor in sand fly midguts (4Sacks D.L. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Dillon R.J. Lane R.P. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because of its importance to parasite development and vector transmission in the well characterized L. major–P. papatasi model, we focused on genes affecting the attachment of the side chain Gal residues to the LPG PG repeats (Fig. 1). Previously, we utilized LPG-deficient mutants in transfection-based functional rescue approaches to identify genes affecting synthesis of the LPG backbone (16Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 35-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Descoteaux A. Luo Y. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M.

Here, we used “cross-species” transfections to identify loci mediating LPG scβGal additions. The SCG(side chain galactose) genes identified represent the first “expression cloning” of a glycosylation gene family crucial for mediating midgut attachment of parasites, and suggest an approach for identifying genes involved in midgut attachment of other parasite species. Targeting genes that disrupt normal Leishmania-sand fly interactions may represent a novel approach for interrupting disease transmission and compromising virulence.

Parasitol. 1994; 66: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies were approved by the relevant institutional biosafety committees. An LmFV1 genomic DNA library constructed in the cosmid shuttle vector cLHYG (23Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was introduced by 30 separate electroporations into Ld; 13,100 independent transfectants were obtained. These were combined into three independent pools, and transfectants bearing Gal-modified LPG PG repeats were isolated by panning with WIC79.3 antibody as described (18Ryan K.A. Garraway L.A. Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8609-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Descoteaux A. Avila H.A. Zhang K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4458-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Three successive rounds of WIC79.3 antibody panning were performed, yielding a population that was strongly reactive. After plating to obtain single colonies, cosmid DNAs cSCG1 (laboratory strain B3547), cSCG2 (B3558), cSCG2a (B4876), and cSCG4 (B3559) were recovered by transformation ofEscherichia coli (18Ryan K.A. Garraway L.A. Descoteaux A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8609-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The 774-bp radiolabeled SCG universal probe (described below; Fig.2 B) was used to screen the LmFV1 genomic cosmid library (23Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Eighteen positive cosmids were identified, including cSCG3 (B3979), cSCG5 (B3985), and cSCG6 (B3971). Mapping and limited sequence analysis showed that in their respective cosmids, SCG1, SCG4,SCG5, and SCG6 are in the same transcriptional orientation as the HYG marker, whereas SCG2 andSCG3 are in the opposite orientation. Partial XhoI deletions of cosmids B3547/SCG1 and B3558/SCG2 (Fig.2 A) were generated by limiting digestion followed by circularization with T4 DNA ligase. A 7.6-kb HindIII fragment from B3558 was inserted into HindIII-digested pSNBR (25Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pSNBR-SCG2 (B3743). pSNBR-SCG2was digested with Bse36I, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, partially digested with SmaI to release a 2.8-kb 5′-flanking region fragment, then religated using T4 DNA ligase to create pSNBR-SCG2del1 (B3899). Digestion of pSNBR-SCG2del1 with XcmI followed by circularization with T4 DNA ligase generated pXK-SCG2(B3900), containing the 2.4-kb SCG2 coding region plus 48 bp of 5′ and 147 bp of 3′-flanking DNA. Relevant sequence of all constructs was verified using standard methods with an Applied Biosystems ABI-373 automated DNA sequencer. The XhoI deletion cAX21/SCG1 (B3556) (Fig. 2 A) was used as a target for mariner mosK transposon (Tn) mutagenesis as described (26Tosi L.R. Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A total of 80 transposon insertions were mapped and eight that fell within the 5.6-kb Leishmania insert were analyzed by transfection into Ld parasites (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). We also used pSNBR-SCG2 (B3743) as a target for mosK Tn mutagenesis, mapping a total of 72 Tn insertions. Eight Tn insertions that fell within the 7.6-kb Leishmania insert were analyzed by transfection into Ld parasites (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Complete double-stranded DNA sequences were obtained for the 2.4-kb SCG coding and flanking regions from B3547/SCG1 (GenBankTMAY230144), B3558/SCG2 (GenBankTMAY230145), B3979/SCG3 (GenBankTMAY230146), B3559/SCG4 (GenBankTMAY230147), B3985/SCG5 (GenBankTMAY230148), and B3971/SCG6 (GenBankTMAY230149). In some cases, primers were labeled with [33P]ATP (2000–4000 Ci/mmol) or [35S]dCTP (1250 Ci/mmol) and templates sequenced manually. Single strand sequence from both ends of theSCG1–6 cosmids was obtained using cLHYG-specific primers. TotalLeishmania RNAs were prepared using the Trizol method (Invitrogen). RNA (5 μg) was analyzed by Northern blotting as described (27Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RNA loading was normalized to ethidium bromide-stained rRNA. Genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed by Southern blotting as described (27Cunningham M.L. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For molecular karyotype analyses, Leishmaniachromosomes were prepared in agarose plugs and stored at 4 °C as described (28Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 925-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Pulse field gel electrophoresis was performed in a Bio-Rad model CHEF-DR II apparatus using an electrophoresis field program separating 0.4–1.8 megabase DNAs. Probes were generated by PCR amplification in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research) using 20 pmol of the indicated primers, 50 ng of template, 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of TAQ polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 μl of total volume following the manufacturer's directions. PCR-amplified DNAs were purified on a QIAquick PCR purification column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's directions and probes were labeled as described above. The 774-bp SCG “universal” coding region probe (corresponding to amino acids 1–258) was amplified as described above, using primers B890 (5′-CGCCATCGCAAACAGCATC) and B1240 (5′-gcggatccaccATGCGAGAGGAGAACAATGTGCCA; Leishmaniasequences in uppercase) and pXK-SCG2 template (B3900), 55 °C annealing temperature, and 2-min elongation time. The PCR product (1 μl) was used as template for an additional round of PCR amplification and purified before probe labeling. cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of LmFV1 RNA, random primers, and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume, following the manufacturer's directions. PCR reactions (50 μl), containing 1 μl of cDNA, 20 pmol of L. major miniexon (B936, 5′-AACGCTATATAAGTATCAGTTCTGTACTTTA) and common SCG (B871, 5′-GACGATGAGAGCAAGTAAGAC) primers, 0.25 mm dNTPs, and 1 unit of TAQ polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), were performed as described above using 62 °C annealing temperature and 2-min elongation time. Products were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide, 1× TBE (90 mmTris, 90 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) gel run overnight at 2.3 V/cm. DNA was visualized by staining with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes). LPG was extracted from logarithmically growing parasites (4–8 × 106cells/ml; 109 cells) in solvent E and purified by phenyl-coupled Sepharose chromatography (29Orlandi Jr., P.A. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10384-10391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PG repeat units were generated by hydrolysis of purified LPG under mild acid conditions, recovered, and separated by HPLC Dionex chromatography (30Mahoney A.B. Sacks D.L. Saraiva E. Modi G. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9813-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the PG repeats were dephosphorylated with E. colialkaline phosphatase (0.1 unit, 16 h, 37 °C), desalted by passage through a two-layered column of AG 50W-X12 over AG 1-X8, labeled at the reducing ends with 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfate and analyzed by GLYKO-FACE fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis according to manufacturer's specifications (Glyko Inc., Novato, CA). When [3H]Gal-labeled LPG PG repeats were included, gels were visualized by UV illumination and the radioactivity eluted from excised bands was measured by scintillation counting. The presence of Gal in LPG side chains was shown by digestion with E. coli β-galactosidase prior to fluorescent labeling (10Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20573-20579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Migration distances were compared with oligosaccharide standards. Strong acid hydrolysis (2 n trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5 h, 100 °C) of the repeat units followed by monosaccharide analysis indicated that >95% of the radiolabel remained as [3H]Gal (data not shown). Microsomes from logarithmically growing parasites (4–8 × 106 cells/ml; 2 × 109cells) were prepared by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation, and LPG scβGalT assays were performed (10Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20573-20579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfer of [3H]Gal from UDP-[3H]Gal to Ld LPG was verified by analysis of PG repeats by thin layer or Dionex HPLC chromatography (30Mahoney A.B. Sacks D.L. Saraiva E. Modi G. Turco S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9813-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The LPG PG repeating units from LmFV1 bear β1,3-linked Gal modifications, which confer reactivity to the antibody WIC79.3 (Fig.1 A) (24Kelleher M. Curtis J.M. Sacks D.L. Handman E. Bacic A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the unmodified L. donovani (Ld) LPG is unreactive with WIC79.3 (Fig. 1 B). In vitro, Ld LPG can serve as substrate for L. major PG scβGalT activity (10Butcher B.A. Turco S.J. Hilty B.A. Pimenta P.F. Panunzio M. Sacks D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20573-20579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Ng K.H.E.B.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We reasoned expression of LmFV1 scβGalTs in L. donovani would confer WIC79.3+ LPG reactivity, and designed a functional rescue strategy to exploit this (Fig. 1 C). An LmFV1 genomic library prepared in the Leishmania shuttle cosmid vector cLHYG (23Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was transfected into L. donovani, yielding a library of 13,100 Ld transfectants that provided >10-fold coverage of the ∼35 megabase L. major genome. WIC79.3+ Ld transfectants were recovered following 3 rounds of WIC79.3 antibody panning, and clonal lines were obtained by plating. From 24 lines we recovered four different cosmids, which upon retransfection into L. donovani conferred WIC79.3 reactivity. Restriction mapping showed that these contained 3 different loci that we termed SCG: SCG1 (cosmid B3547), SCG2 (cosmids B3558, B4876), and SCG4(cosmid B3559; Figs. 2 and 3, and data not shown). The active regions withinSCG1 and SCG2 cosmids were identified by WIC79.3 reactivity tests of Ld transfectants bearing deletion derivatives, or following mariner Tn insertion mutagenesis (26Tosi L.R. Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Analysis of 10 cosmid SCG1/B3547XhoI deletions identified a 5.6-kb SCG1 active region (gray box, Fig. 2 A, and data not shown). Analysis of eight transposon insertions within this region showed that four had lost WIC79.3 reactivity (Tns 45, 31, 63, and 13; Fig.2 B and data not shown). The WIC79.3-unreactive Tn insertion sites were clustered in a 1.4-kb region; sequence analysis out to the nearest flanking WIC79.3+ Tn insertion sites revealed a 2.4-kb open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 814-amino acid protein (Figs.2 B and 4 A). Notably, all WIC79.3-unreactive Tn insertions were mapped within the predicted SCG1 ORF. A similar approach was used to localize the active SCG2 gene to a 7.2-kb region in cosmid B3558 deletion B1X17 (gray box, Fig. 2 A). A 7.6-kb HindIII fragment encompassing this region was inserted into the Leishmania shuttle vector pSNBR (25Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (pSNBR-SCG2), sequenced, and subjected to Tn mutagenesis as described above. The sequence revealed a 2.4-kb ORF encoding a 814-amino acid protein, and 2.1 kb upstream of this a histone H4 pseudogene with a highly divergent 5′ end bearing numerous deletions and frameshifts. As seen for SCG1, the three WIC 79.3-unreactive Tn insertions obtained clustered in an 1.5-kb region within the SCG2 ORF (Fig. 2 B). ThisSCG2 ORF was closely related to the SCG1 ORF and other SCG genes as discussed below. Expression of theSCG2 ORF alone in an expression vector similar to the pX vectors (pXK-SCG2) yielded exclusively WIC79.3+ colonies when transfected into Ld parasites (TableI).Table IActivity of SCG genes in Ld transfection assayLine1-aDNAs transfected into Ld are: “c,” cosmids containing SCG1 (B3547), SCG2 (B3558),SCG3 (B3979), SCG4 (B3559), SCG5(B3985) or SCG6 (B3971); pXK-SCG2 (B3900) contains the SCG2 ORF in a Leishmania plasmid expression vector.WIC79.3 agglutination1-bRelative reactivity with WIC79.3 antibody in agglutination assays as an indication of LPG PG Gal side chains: “+” = 10–25%, “++” = 25–50%, “+++” = 100% agglutination.LPG side chain profile1-cPercentage of LPG PG repeats that contain the indicated number of Gal side chains as determined by Dionex HPLC chromatography (Fig. 6).

Open table in a new tab Southern blot analysis of LmFV1 chromosomes or digested DNAs withSCG1/SCG2 ORF probes indicated that there were additionalSCG loci not recovered in our screen, suggesting it had not reached saturation (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). These were recovered from the LmFV1 cLHYG genomic cosmid library by screening with a universal SCG coding region probe (Fig. 2 B): from a total of 18 cosmids we obtained new representatives ofSCG1, SCG2, and SCG4, as well as three new cosmid loci termed SCG3 (B3979), SCG5(B3985), and SCG6 (B3971; Fig. 3 A and data not shown). Southern blot analysis of LmFV1 chromosomes separated by pulsed-field electrophoresis revealed six chromosome bands hybridizing to the universal SCG probe (Fig. 3 B). To assign eachSCG locus to a given chromosome, locus-specific fragments were isolated from each cosmid and hybridized to chromosome blots. This assigned the SCG3, SCG1, SCG2,SCG6, SCG5, and SCG4 loci to chromosomes of ∼300, 550, 700, 850, 1600, and 2800 kb, respectively (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). These data and comparisons of the XhoI digestion patterns of total LmFV1 genomic DNA against the SCG cosmid panel (Fig. 3 A and data not shown) suggested that the entire family of LmFV1 SCGloci had been identified and recovered intact. WIC79.3 tests of multiple clonal lines for each Ld cosmidSCG transfectant showed that all SCG3/B3979 parasites were reactive, whereas all SCG5/B3985 andSCG6/B3971 transfectants were unreactive. The WIC79.3−unreactive phenotype of SCG5 and SCG6 Ld transfectants was not because of alterations in SCG cosmid DNAs following transfection into Leishmania (data not shown). As a control, the three cosmids identified by functional complementation (SCG1/B3547, SCG2/B3558, andSCG4/B3559) again generated WIC79.3+ Ld transfectants. The regions of theSCG3–6 cosmids that hybridized to the SCG1/2 ORF probes were mapped and sequenced (Fig. 4 and data not shown), revealing the presence of ORFs showing strong homology to those of SCG1/2. The predicted SCG1, -2, -3, and -6 ORFs were 814 amino acids (aa), whereas SCG4 had an N-terminal 32-amino acid extension arising from a single nt change; comparisons among these showed from 92 to 96% aa identity (Fig. 4, A andB). The SCG5 ORF encoded a protein of 816 residues, whose first 596 amino acids were highly homologous (94–97% aa identity) to the remaining SCG ORFs. Thereafter, the presence of numerous nucleotide substitutions/insertions beginning at SCG5 ORF nt 1789 caused higher divergence, resulting in 50% aa and 55% nt identity over the terminal 220 amino acids (Fig. 4, A and B, and data not shown). The 5′-flanking regions of the SCG genes were highly homologous, except for SCG1 that diverged from otherSCG genes 122 nt upstream of the predicted conserved start codon. Similarly"

We exchanged the alternative exon 3 regions between an embryonic isoform and the indirect flight muscle isoform. Each chimeric myosin was expressed in Drosophila indirect flight muscle, in the absence of other myosin isoforms, allowing for purified protein analysis and whole organism locomotory studies. The flight muscle isoform generates higher in vitro actin sliding velocity and solution ATPase rates than the embryonic isoform. Exchanging the embryonic exon 3 region into the flight muscle isoform decreased ATPase rates to embryonic levels but did not affect actin sliding velocity or flight muscle ultrastructure. Interestingly, this swap only slightly impaired flight ability. Exchanging the flight muscle-specific exon 3 region into the embryonic isoform increased actin sliding velocity 3-fold and improved indirect flight muscle ultrastructure integrity but failed to rescue the flightless phenotype of flies expressing embryonic myosin. These results suggest that the two structural versions of the exon 3 domain independently influence the kinetics of at least two steps of the actomyosin cross-bridge cycle.

Developmental stage and muscle-specific myosin isoforms have distinct rates of ATP hydrolysis and propel actin at velocities that strongly correlate with muscle contractile properties (1Tyska M.J. Washaw D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 51: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev.

Differences in myosin isoform function have been well characterized in many species (4Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20414-20418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which variation in specific structural regions of the myosin heavy chain (MHC)1 contributes to isoform-specific properties is not well understood, especially in striated muscle isoforms (5Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Studies aimed at defining structural regions of MHC that are responsible for setting isoform-specific properties have focused on two flexible surface loops that connect the proteolytic domains of the myosin head (25/50-kDa, loop 1; and 50/20-kDa, loop 2) (for review see Murphy and Spudich (6Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). Altering these loops in some myosin types influences in vitro ATPase rates and actin sliding velocities (7Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In mammalian smooth muscle and scallop and carp muscle isoforms, the pattern of Mhc RNA alternative splicing suggests that these loops contribute to differences in myosin functional properties; in some cases this has been supported byin vitro chimeric studies (9Kurzawa-Goertz S.E.

However, in other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, these two surface loops are invariant among all muscle myosin isoforms (13Bernstein S.I. Milligan R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, all structural variation between muscle MHC isoforms is confined to four discrete regions of the S-1 head (Fig.1), to the S-2 hinge region, and to the C-terminal tailpiece (13Bernstein S.I. Milligan R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The discrete domain variation inDrosophila myosin isoforms, which differs from the widespread variation observed in most vertebrate striated isoforms, highlights areas that must set isoform-specific functional properties. Structural variation in these regions is generated by alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts from the single Drosophila Mhc gene (14Bernstein S.I. Mogami K. Donady J.J. Emerson Jr., C.P.

This mechanism produces at least 15 myosin isoforms that are expressed in a wide variety of muscle types including slow embryonic and larval body wall muscle and the very fast indirect flight muscle (17Zhang S.

EMB myosin isolated from the transgenic line propels actin at one-tenth the velocity in the in vitromotility assay and has one-fourth the basal Mg-ATPase rate but does not differ in unitary step size compared with IFI (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus the functional differences between the two isoforms arise primarily from kinetic differences in the cross-bridge cycle and must be caused by variation in one or more of the alternative exon-encoded regions. One variable S-1 head region in Drosophila is encoded by alternative versions of exon 3. It is located near the N terminus of the protein, between the ATP hydrolysis site and the pivot point of the lever arm, and corresponds to residues 69–116 of chicken skeletal MHC (Fig. 1). The two alternative versions of exon 3 differ in 18 of 48 amino acids, 12 of which are non-conserved substitutions (13Bernstein S.I. Milligan R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Exon 3b is expressed primarily in adult muscles, including the indirect flight muscle, and a few external embryonic body wall muscles (17Zhang S. Bernstein S.I. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Hastings G.A. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exon 3a appears to be expressed only in embryonic muscles, including most intermediate and internal body wall muscles, visceral muscle, and embryonic cardioblasts (17Zhang S. Bernstein S.I. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This highly regulated expression pattern strongly suggests that alternative versions of exon 3 help setDrosophila myosin isoform-specific properties. In this study we used the unique genetic capabilities of theDrosophila myosin system to determine the role that exon 3 plays in setting isoform-specific functional properties of myosin. We constructed two chimeric transgenes with the exon 3 region exchanged between the IFI and EMB isoforms. We report on Pelement-mediated expression of the myosin transgenes, ATPase rates, and actin sliding velocities. Because the Drosophila system is currently the only system where single mutant myosin isoforms can be expressed in a functioning locomotory muscle, we also examined how the altered myosin properties influence Drosophila indirect flight muscle (IFM) myofibrillar ultrastructure and flight performance. Our results demonstrate that at least two steps of the myosin cross-bridge cycle are independently affected by different versions of the exon 3 region. To determine the functional role of the MHC region encoded by exon 3, we constructed twoP element-based transgenes. The first transgene, IFI-3a, allows expression of only the “embryonic” version of exon 3 (3a) in all MHC isoforms, including the IFI isoform. It was constructed by replacing the entire exon 3 coding region and flanking introns inpWMHC2, a wild type genomic Mhc clone (5Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with a fragment containing only exon 3a (from an embryonic cDNA,P[w+Mhcemb]lw3or Mhcemb (20Wells L. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4454-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Specifically, an N-terminal coding region ofpWMHC2 was created by subcloning a 5-kb XbaI fragment containing exons 1–6 and flanking introns into pBluescriptKS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 3.6-kb fragment fromMhcemb containing exons 1, 2, 3a, and 4 (without 3b and the introns between 2, 3a, and 4) was exchanged into the N-terminal subclone using XbaI and StuI. The modified subclone was ligated back into pWMHC2 at the XbaI sites. The pWMHC2 clone expresses wild type myosin at normal levels and restores flight ability of Mhc10, a myosin null specific to the jump muscle and IFM mutant flies (5Swank D.M. Wells L. Kronert W.A. Morrill G.E. Bernstein S.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We chose to express the modified genomic clone (IFI-3a) rather than a modified IFI cDNA because expression of a myosin isoform closely resembling IFI might have been lethal at the embryonic or larval stage. The second transgene forces expression of the “adult” version of exon 3 (3b) in the embryonic isoform (EMB). Exon 3a in theMhcemb cDNA clone (20Wells L. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4454-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was replaced by cDNA encoding exon 3b. Specifically, an XbaI and ApaI 4.7-kb fragment of Mhcemb containing exons 1–12 was subcloned into pBluescript KS. Exon 3a was removed from the subclone by digestion with PstI (restriction site in exon 2) andStuI (restriction site in exon 4). Digestion of an adult cDNA with the same restriction enzymes created a DNA fragment containing exon 3b. This fragment was ligated into the subclone, and the subclone insert was ligated back into digestedMhcemb. Both clones were ligated into a CaSPeR vector behind the Mhcpromoter, which drives high levels of myosin expression in all muscle types (21Hess N. Kronert W.A. Bernstein S.I. Kedes L. Stockdale F. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Muscle Development. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 621-631Google Scholar). All ligation sites were sequenced, and appropriate restriction digestions were carried out to ensure transgene fidelity. Drosophila were transformed by injecting the chimeric exon 3 plasmids at 0.6 mg ml−1, along with 0.05 mg ml−1 of a Δ2-3 helper plasmid that expresses transposase, into a yw strain (22Cripps R.M. Becker K.D. Mardahl M. Kronert W.A. Hodges D. Bernstein S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Cripps R.M. Bernstein S.I. Norton P.A. Steel L.F. Introducing DNA into Living Cells and Organisms. Eaton Publishing, Natick, MA2000Google Scholar). The balancer line w1118;CyO/Bl1; TM2/TM6B, was used to map transgenes to specific chromosomes. The transgenes were crossed into Mhc10 (lacks myosin in the indirect flight and jump muscles) to produce flies expressing only the transgenic myosin in their IFM and jump muscle. Additional lines were created by mobilizing the P element (containing the transgene) to another chromosome. Mobilization was achieved by crossing a transgenic line to a line constitutively expressing Pelement transposase from the Δ2-3 insertion on its third chromosome (24Grigliatti T.A. Roberts D.B. Drosophila, a Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 85-107Google Scholar). To confirm expression of the proper transgene with the expected alternative version of exon 3 in the transgenic organisms, we performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from IFMs of the transgenicDrosophila lines. Sets of IFMs from 25 flies were dissected in York modified glycerol and collected in a microcentrifuge tube as described in Swank et al. (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After sedimentation by centrifugation for 5 min in a benchtop microcentrifuge, the IFMs were resuspended and washed in 300 ॖl of York modified glycerol (without Triton X-100 and glycerol). Following a 5-min centrifugation, the IFM pellet was homogenized in 200 ॖl of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final RNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ॖl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O. An aliquot of total RNA (4.75 ॖl) was used for cDNA synthesis in a volume of 10 ॖl of reverse transcriptase buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units of RNasin, 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, and 3 ॖmol of an exon 7a reverse primer (5′-TCAACAGACAAATGTCTT-3′) or an exon 7d reverse primer (5′-AGAGGAAGCACATCTCTT-3′). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. PCR was performed with 1 ॖl of the cDNA and 0.4 ॖmol of the primers using Ready-to-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences). The primer pairs were 3a (5′-ATCCGAGAAGGTGGAAAA-3′) with 7d and 3b (5′-GAAAGATCTGCTCCAGCA-3′) with 7a. Touchdown PCR (25Roux K.H. Dieffenback C.W. Dueksler G.S. PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar) was performed as follows. After a 3-min incubation of the primers and single-stranded cDNA at 95 °C, 2 cycles consisting of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were performed. This was followed by a series of cycles, each repeated once, where the annealing temperature, initially 60 °C, was progressively decreased by 1 °C until an annealing temperature of 54 °C was reached. The last cycle,i.e. 45 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 54 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, was repeated 25 times. PCR products were analyzed on a 17 agarose gel. To determine the amount of myosin expressed by the transgenes in the Mhc10 background, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). At least 3 upper thoraxes were individually homogenized in separate 60-ॖl aliquots of sample buffer. Ten ॖl of homogenate from each sample was loaded into a single lane on a 7.57 gel. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were digitally photographed (Eagle Eye II, Stratagene), and relative protein amounts were determined using gel-scanning macros available with the public domain NIH Image software package. The myosin to actin ratio for each lane was determined and normalized to that of wild type (yw) flies. Myosin was isolated as described by Swank et al. (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 120 sets of dorsolongitudinal IFMs (DLMs) were dissected fromMhc10Drosophila expressing the myosin transgene of interest. After incubation in a glycerol and Triton X-100 solution, myosin was extracted and purified by a series of high salt suspensions and low salt precipitations. Myosin purity was confirmed on a 107 polyacrylamide gel. Myosin protein amounts were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.53 cm−1 for 1 mg ml−1. Actin was isolated from dissected DLMs as described by Razzaqet al. (1999). Purified F-actin was resuspended in assay buffer (AB), which contained 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (27Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Actin was quantified by absorbance at 290 nm minus absorbance at 310 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm−1 for 1 mg ml−1 (27Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For the motility assay, actin was labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For actin-activated ATPase assays, chicken actin was used instead ofDrosophila actin because Drosophila actin yields were too low to be practical. Chicken pectoralis actin was prepared as in Pardee and Spudich (28Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Aliquots of G-actin were frozen at −80 °C, and polymerized before use. Actin sliding and basal ATPase assays were performed on isolated myosin immediately following purification. Methods and analyses were identical to those used previously (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some experiments smooth muscle tropomyosin (smTM) (chicken gizzard, Sigma) was bound to Drosophila IFM actin by mixing at a 1:1 molar ratio. In this case, smTM (100 nm) was included in all solutions added to the flow cell after actin addition to prevent smTM dissociation from actin. Motility assays were conducted at 22–23 °C, and filament movement was recorded onto videotape. Actin-activated ATPase assays were performed in 0.15 ml of assay solution consisting of 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.0, 20 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP, and myosin to a final concentration of 70 nm. Calcium in this buffer does not affect basal or actin-activated Mg-ATPase rates. 2D. M. Swank, A. F. Knowles, and S. I. Bernstein, unpublished data. Actin concentration was varied from 0 to 2 ॖm. Myosin was preincubated with actin in the assay solution (minus ATP) for 10 min at 22–23 °C. The reaction was started with the addition of 15 ॖl of 10 mm[γ-32P]ATP and was terminated 30 min later with the addition of 50 ॖl of 1.8 n HClO4. This reaction period was determined to lie on the linear portion of the timeversus Pi production curve. Piproduction was monitored as described in Swank et al. (19Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For each myosin form, Vmax and actin-activatedKm values for actin were computed by fitting all data points from one myosin preparation with the Michaelis-Menten equation. Vmax and Km values from multiple preparations were averaged (n of at least 3) to give mean ± S.E. To determine the effect of the exon 3 transgenes on assembly and stability of myofibrils, we analyzed cross-sections and longitudinal thin sections of IFMs using transmission electron microscopy as described previously (29O'Donnell P.T. Bernstein S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2601-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Flight ability was assayed by observing whether a fly was capable of flying up (U), horizontally (H), down (D), or not at all (N) when released in a Plexiglas flight chamber. An attractant light was suspended above the chamber as wild type flies normally fly up toward a light source (30Drummond D.R. Hennessey E.S. Sparrow J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Flight index equals 6U/T + 4H/T + 2D/T + 0N/T, where T is the total number of flies tested. At least 100 flies were assayed for flight ability from each line of each transgene expressed in the Mhc10 null background. All flight assays were performed at 22 °C with 2-day-old flies. Student'st test and one-way analysis of variance were used for most statistical analysis with p values <0.05 considered statistically significant. We generated multiple transgenic Drosophila lines expressing chimeric myosins with alternative exon 3 regions exchanged between the EMB and IFI isoforms. We injected 522 yw embryos with the EMB-3b Pelement vector to produce over 10 independently transformed lines. We injected IFI-3a into 730 yw embryos to yield 3 independently transformed lines. The probability of a Pelement-mediated insertion event decreases exponentially as the size of the plasmid increases (23Cripps R.M. Bernstein S.I. Norton P.A. Steel L.F. Introducing DNA into Living Cells and Organisms. Eaton Publishing, Natick, MA2000Google Scholar). Thus the difference in transformation frequency between the IFI-3a plasmid (30.5 kb) andEMB-3b (17.5 kb) was expected. We also used the embryo injection protocol to produce three additional EMB lines (Mhcemb) that are identical to those described in Wells et al. (20Wells L. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I.

Open table in a new tab Protein amounts are mean ± S.E. of at least 3 lanes each loaded with the homogenized contents of one upper thorax. One of the three IFI-3a transgene insertions mapped to the third chromosome. This makes it useful for MHC studies, as the transgene can readily be crossed with stocks carrying Mhc mutations on the second chromosome. The other two lines were not useful in that one was homozygous lethal and the other mapped to the second chromosome. We generated an additional line by genetically moving (jumping) theP element construct from the second chromosome to the third. Lines with transgenes that mapped to either the first or third chromosomes were crossed into the Mhc10 background, (IFM and jump muscle specific myosin null) and were used for all subsequent analyses. We confirmed that the Mhc transgenes were transcribing the appropriate mRNA by using RT-PCR. cDNA created from RNA isolated from wild type IFM contains alternative exons 3b and 7d, whereas cDNA from the IFM of EMB flies contains exons 3a and 7a. cDNA created from RNA isolated from the IFM of IFI-3a flies was checked to verify the presence of embryonic exon 3a with adult exon 7d, a combination not found in yw (wild type) orMhc10 IFM (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and2). cDNA generated from RNA isolated from IFM of IFI-3a lines produced the expected band at 800 bp in PCRs using primers to exons 3a and 7d (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). The 3a primer verified that exon 3 was exchanged, and the 7d primer verified the IFI MHC background. A band was not produced in PCRs using primers to exons 3b and 7a (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5). The expected inclusion of the IFI-specific versions of exons 9, 11, and 15 was verified by RT-PCR and restriction enzyme digestion (data not shown). cDNA generated from RNA isolated from EMB-3b lines produced the expected 790-bp DNA band in PCRs using primers to exons 3b and 7a, (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–9). The 3b primer verified the exon 3 exchange, and the 7a primer confirmed the EMB background. No band was observed in PCRs using primers to exons 3a and 7d (Fig.2A, lanes 7–9). No bands were generated in PCRs using cDNA from IFM of yw (wild type) orMhc10 with this set of primers (Fig. 2B,lanes 1 and 2). Three of four EMB-3b lines carrying the transgene on the 3rd chromosome and the two-thirds chromosome IFI-3a lines expressed MHC at wild type levels (Table I). Thus for our in vivo studies we analyzed the three EMB-3b lines expressing myosin at wild type levels along with the two third-chromosome IFI-3a lines. Similar to our initial measurements (31Littlefield K.P. Swank D.M. Sanchez B.M. Knowles A.F. Warshaw D.M. Bernstein S.I. Am. J. Physiol.

Factor Xa attacks two sites in A1, Arg336, which precedes the highly acidic C-terminal region, and a recently identified site at Lys36. By using isolated A1 subunit as substrate for proteolysis, production of the terminal fragment, A137–336, was shown to proceed via two pathways identified by the intermediates A11–336and A137–372 and generated by initial cleavage at Arg336 and Lys36, respectively. Appearance of the terminal product by the former pathway was 7–8-fold slower than the product obtained by the latter pathway. The isolated A1 subunit was cleaved slowly, independent of the presence of phospholipid. The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer demonstrated an ∼3-fold increased cleavage rate constant, and inclusion of phospholipid further enhanced this value by ∼2-fold. Although association of A1 or A137−372 with A3-C1-C2 enhanced the rate of cleavage at Arg336, inclusion of A3-C1-C2 did not affect the cleavage at Lys36 in A11–336. A synthetic peptide 337–372 blocked the cleavage at Lys36 (IC50 = 230 ॖm) while showing little if any effect on cleavage at Arg336. Proteolysis at Lys36, and to a lesser extent Arg336, was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by heparin. These results suggest that inactivating cleavages catalyzed by factor Xa at Lys36 and Arg336 are regulated in part by the A3-C1-C2 subunit.

Factor VIII is synthesized as an ∼300-kDa precursor with domain structure A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 and is processed to a series of divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimers by cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1-A2-B domains and a light chain consisting of the A3-C1-C2 domains (2Vehar G.A.

Factor VIII is activated by thrombin or factor Xa by limited proteolysis at the A1-A2 domain junction (Arg372), A2-B junction (Arg740), and near the N terminus of the light chain (Arg1689) (5Eaton D.

Thus at physiological concentrations (∼1 nm), factor VIIIa is unstable, and loss of activity is attributed to the dissociation of the A2 subunit from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (7Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J.

The association of factor VIIIa with factor IXa increases thekcat for factor Xa formation by several orders of magnitude compared with factor IXa alone (11van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that modulation of factor IXa by A2 subunit enhances thekcat for factor Xa activation by ∼100-fold (12Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol.

The C-terminal acidic region of the A1 subunit (residues 337–372) appears to represent an A2-interactive site and participates in the orientation of A2 yielding maximal stimulation of factor IXa (14Koszelak Rosenblum M.E.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) attack this site cleaving at Arg336 in the A1 subunit, and this event correlates with inactivation of the cofactor. Although the mechanism for inactivation following cleavage at this site is not fully understood, component effects include altered interaction of the A2 subunit with the truncated A1 and an increase in theKm value for substrate factor X. Recently, a second cleavage site specific for factor Xa, Lys36, has been identified in the A1 subunit (16Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 287: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Attack at this site is also inactivating, and this effect results in part from altered conformation of A1 limiting productive interaction with the A2 subunit (16Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 287: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although factor Xa functions as an activator of factor VIII, subsequent factor Xa-catalyzed cleavage(s) within the A1 subunit of factor VIIIa may contribute to the dampening of factor Xase activity. This potential role may be significant given that the protease is the product of the reaction catalyzed by factor Xase. However, the interactions of factor Xa with substrate factor VIIIa (A1 subunit) are poorly understood. In this study, we report on the catalytic mechanism during proteolytic inactivation due to cleavage within the A1 subunit by factor Xa. By using isolated subunits of the cofactor and by employing functional reconstitution assays and SDS-PAGE analyses, we show the initial reaction of the A1 subunit with the protease yields two distinct intermediates indicative of separate pathways leading to the terminal A137–336 product. Furthermore, specific cleavages at Lys36 and Arg336 are differentially modulated following interaction of the protease with the A3-C1-C2 subunit, as well as the acidic C-terminal region of the A1 subunit. Purified recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA) and the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). The monoclonal antibody 58.12 recognizing the N-terminal end of A1 (20O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J.

Phospholipid vesicles containing 207 phosphatidylserine, 407 phosphatidylcholine, and 407 phosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma) were prepared usingN-octyl glucoside (22Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y.

The reagents human α-thrombin, factor IXa, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and the chromogenic Xa substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride; DiaPharm Group, Westchester, OH) were purchased from the indicated vendors. The synthetic peptide corresponding to factor VIII residues Met337–Arg372 (designated as peptide337–372) was prepared by the Biotechnology Analytical and Synthesis Facility at Cornell University and has been described previously (23Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide337–359 and peptide360–372 were derived from a tryptic digest of peptide337–372 and purified as described previously (23Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide351–365 was a gift from Dr. Paul Foster. Factor VIII (1.5 ॖm) was treated overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.017 Tween 20, and the light and heavy chains were isolated following chromatography on SP-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24Fay P.J.

The purified heavy chain was cleaved by thrombin, and the A2 and A1 subunits were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Hi-Trap heparin column and a Mono-Q column as reported previously (14Koszelak Rosenblum M.E.

The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was isolated from thrombin-treated factor VIIIa using a Mono-S column chromatography, and the residual A2 subunit was removed using an anti-A2 subunit monoclonal antibody coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (20). The A3-C1-C2 subunit was further purified following dissociation of the dimer by EDTA and chromatography on Mono-S (15Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A truncated A11–336 subunit was prepared as described earlier (14Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the isolated subunits showed >957 purity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar). The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was reconstituted from isolated A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits (2.4 ॖm each) overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mmCaCl2, and 0.017 Tween 20. Human factor Xa was added to the isolated A1 subunit or A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in a 1:10 ratio (mol/mol) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.017 Tween 20, and the reactions were run at 22 °C. Samples were taken at the indicated times, and the reactions were immediately terminated and prepared for SDS-PAGE by adding SDS and boiling for 3 min. The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (26Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To prepare A1/A3-C1-C2 dimers containing the cleaved A1 subunit, the cleavage reaction was quenched using TAP at an ∼5-fold molar excess relative to factor Xa. This mixture was adjusted to 500 nmand was reconstituted with 500 nm A3-C1-C2 subunit. Factor VIIIa was reconstituted from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer form(s) (5 nm) plus A2 subunit (20 nm), and reacted with 20 nm factor IXa and 10 ॖmphosphatidylserine-phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylethanolamine vesicle for 30 s in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.05 mNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.017 Tween 20. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 500 nm factor X. Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (final concentration; 50 mm) to stop the reaction. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (final concentration; 0.46 mm). Reactions were read at 405 nm using aVmax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All reactions were run at 22 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed with 87 gels using the procedure of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus at 150 V for 1 h. Bands were visualized following staining with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transblot apparatus at 50 V for 2 h in buffer containing 10 mmCAPS, pH 11, and 107 (v/v) methanol. Proteins were probed using the 58.12 and C5 monoclonal antibodies followed by goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody. The signal was detected using the ECF system (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were scanned at 570 nm using a Storm 860 instrument (Molecular Devices). Densitometric scans were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). The concentrations of remaining intact A1 and factor Xa-cleaved A1 products were calculated from band densities using the formula A1 = (density of A1 at the indicated time/density of initial A1) × initial A1 concentration, or A1 fragment = (density of A1 fragment at the indicated time/density of initial A1) × (mol mass A1/mol mass fragment) × initial A1 concentration, respectively. In order to evaluate the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa, we calculated the cleavage rate constants based on the densitometric values. Assuming the cleavage event and release of products are rapid, the concentration of free factor Xa should be constant. Therefore, the rate constant correlates with the concentration of substrate. The apparent rate constant (k) for A1 subunit cleavage by factor Xa was determined by employing Equation 1, [A]t=[A]0·e−ktEquation 1 where [A]t is the intact A1 subunit concentration at time point t. The apparent rate constant values (k11,k12, k21, andk22) in the following Scheme FS1 are based on parallel and series reactions for intact A1 subunit cleavage by factor Xa and were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression using multiple equations as described in Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5.[A]t=[A]0·e−(k11+k21+k3)tEquation 2 [B1]t=[A]0·k11·(e−(k11+k21+k3)t−e−(k12+k4)t)(k12+k4)−(k11+k21+k3)Equation 3 [B2]t=[A]0·k21·(e−(k11+k21+k3)t−e−(k22+k4)t)(k22+k4)−(k11+k21+k3)[C]t=(K1+K2)·(e−(k11+k21+k3)·t−e−k4·t)k4−(k11+k21+k3)Equation 4 −K1k11·(e−(k12+k4)·t−e−k4·t)−K2k22·(e−(k22+k4)·t−e−k4·t)K1=[A]0·k11·k12(k12+k4)−(k11+k21+k3),K2=[A]0·k21·k22(k22+k4)−(k11+k21+k3)Equation 5 where [A]t, [B1]t, [B2]t, and [C]t are the concentrations at time point (t) of intact A1 and A1 fragments consisting of residues 37–372 (A137–372), residues 1–336 (A11–336), and residues 37–336 (A137–336). We observed a reduction in total staining intensity for these fragments as the time course progressed, in parallel with the appearance of diffuse, low molecular mass staining material. For this reason it was necessary to incorporate expressions for rate values for these small degradation products (designated D1–D4). Because the initial loss of mass was greatest at the initial time points, we assume k3 >k4. Furthermore, rate values fork4 could not be differentiated for species designated B1, B2, and C. We recently demonstrated that factor Xa cleaves the A1 subunit (residues 1–372) of factor VIIIa at Lys36 (16Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 287: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in addition to Arg336 (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Identification of reaction products was determined following reaction of the isolated A1 subunit (2.4 ॖm) with factor Xa (0.24 ॖm). Fig.1A shows the stained gel following electrophoresis of intact A1 and the products of A1 subunit cleavage by factor Xa after reaction for 4 h at 22 °C. Three fragments were observed in addition to the intact subunit. These fragments were further characterized by Western blot analysis employing anti-A1 domain monoclonal antibodies specific for the N- or C-terminal sequences. Although the intact A1 (fragment 1) and fragment 3 were reactive with monoclonal antibody 58.12 (an antibody directed to residues 1–12 of the A1 sequence), fragments 2 and 4 were not identified (Fig. 1B, a). Use of the C5 antibody (specific for residues contained within the C-terminal acidic region of A1) showed reactivity with the intact A1 (fragment 1) and fragment 2 but did not react with either fragments 3 or 4 (Fig. 1B,b). These results, taken together with identified factor Xa cleavage sites for intact A1 (A11–372) at Lys36 and Arg336, identify fragment 2 as A1 residues 37–372 (A137–372), fragment 3 as A1 residues 1–336 (A11–336), and fragment 4 as A1 residues 37–336 (A137–336). Fig. 1C schematically illustrates the products of A1 digestion by factor Xa. Pretreatment of factor Xa with a molar excess of TAP failed to yield any proteolysis of A1 subunit, indicating that both cleavages were catalyzed by factor Xa (data not shown). Time course assays were used to correlate rates of cleavages in the A1 subunit and residual cofactor activity following the reconstitution of the factor Xa-treated A1 with other factor VIIIa subunits. Fig.2, A andB, shows the results of SDS-PAGE of the cleavage reactions. Densitometry scanning of the stained gel was employed to quantitate band density of the substrate A1 and each cleavage product. The A11–372 subunit gradually diminished following addition of factor Xa, and degradation was essentially complete by 8 h. Appearance of the A137–372 and A11–336 fragments correlated with loss of A11–372. However, rates of generation and degradation of these two forms were not identical. Generation of A137–372appeared somewhat faster compared with the A11–336 based upon the initial slope of the curve, and the former was obtained in greater yield based upon total band density. Subsequently, complete degradation of A137–372 occurred within 10 h of peak level, while the A11–336 persisted at ∼307 of peak level for 18 h, suggesting a markedly reduced rate of cleavage of the latter compared with the former. The A137–336, truncated at both termini, appeared after a lag of ∼2 h, and its generation increased over the remainder of the time course (24 h). This band showed no loss in density over an extended (24 h) reaction time suggesting the fragment represented a terminal digestion product. The simultaneous generation of A11–336 and A137–372 indicated the presence of two pathways for A1 cleavage of factor Xa to yield the terminal product, and these alternatives are schematically illustrated in Fig. 2C. Estimation of apparent rate constants for each cleavage reaction was derived from fitting the data shown in Fig. 2B to equations by a parallel series reaction as described under “Materials and Methods.” Based upon staining density, the total concentration of intact A1 plus the fragments A11–336, A137–372, and A137–336 (Fig. 2B,triangles) decreased during the reaction time course. This result suggested additional, minor cleavage pathways and was supported by the appearance of diffuse staining, low molecular mass fragments in the gels (data not shown). To account for these auxiliary fragments, the model incorporated conversion of the initial substrate, intermediates, and terminal fragment to degradation products designated D1–D4 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Because the greatest rate of loss occurred within the first 2 h, this result suggested the rate constant for D1 derived from degradation of intact A1 subunit was greater than those constants reflecting generation of D2–D4. We assume these latter rates (k4) are equivalent to fairly compare the rate constants (k11, k12,k21, and k22) for the primary cleavage pathways. The data are summarized in TableI. By using the isolated A1 subunit, there appeared to be a modest (2-fold) preference for factor Xa to cleave Lys36 compared with Arg336. However, the apparent cleavage rate at Lys36 in the intact A1 subunit (k11) was ∼8-fold greater than that observed for the A11–336 substrate (k22). This result suggested that the C-terminal region (residues 337–372) represented a critical region for factor Xa-dependent cleavage at this site. Conversely, the N-terminal region of A1 subunit (residues 1–36) showed little influence on cleavage at the Arg336 site (k12 ∼2-fold greater than k21).Table IRelative rate constants estimated for A1 subunit cleavage by factor Xa−A3-C1-C2+A3-C1-C2k(+A3-C1-C2)/k(−A3-C1-C2)min−1k114.22 ± 1.097.81 ± 0.571.85k124.11 ± 1.2025.3 ± 3.386.15k212.11 ± 0.8813.1 ± 0.526.21k220.55 ± 0.500.47 ± 0.100.85k32.09 ± 0.183.51 ± 1.011.68k40.24 ± 0.200.30 ± 0.101.25Parameter values were calculated from the fitted data shown in Figs. 2and 3 using the formula presented under “Materials and Methods.” All data are represented as rate constant values (k) × 1000. Open table in a new tab Parameter values were calculated from the fitted data shown in Figs. 2and 3 using the formula presented under “Materials and Methods.” All data are represented as rate constant values (k) × 1000. The analysis of A1 cleavage was complemented with assessment of the change of cofactor activity for factor VIIIa reconstituted from the cleaved A1. For this analysis, cleavage of A1 was quenched at the indicated time points by addition of TAP, and the A1 forms were reconstituted with an equimolar concentration of A3-C1-C2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resultant A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer forms were diluted and reacted with A2 (20 nm) to generate factor VIIIa heterotrimers, and cofactor activity was measured in a factor Xa generation assay. The amount of exogenous factor Xa resulting from the cleavage of A1 subunit was measured in a control assay, and the data were corrected prior to plotting. Loss of cofactor activity as a result of A1 cleavage was correlated with proteolysis of the A11–372 and the appearance of the A137–336via the intermediates A137–372 and A11–336(Fig. 2, A and B). However, this inactivation was incomplete, representing ∼407 of the activity for cofactor reconstituted with intact A1. This level of residual activity was consistent with the value obtained for factor VIIIa reconstituted with purified A137–336 (16Nogami K. Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 287: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The above results showed slow rates of cleavage of the isolated A1 subunit at either terminus. Earlier studies have demonstrated optimal reaction rates for factor Xa activity directed against factor VIII substrates require a phospholipid surface (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a factor Xa interactive site was recently mapped to the C2 domain of the cofactor (28Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which also contains residues required for the interaction of cofactor with anionic phospholipid surfaces (29Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, these factors likely contribute to catalytic efficiency of factor Xa-catalyzed cleavage of A1. In order to determine the roles for C2 and phospholipid, isolated A1 subunit was reconstituted with isolated A3-C1-C2, and the resultant A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was employed as substrate for factor Xa in reactions performed in the presence of phospholipid. Comparison of factor Xa cleavage of isolated A1 with that for A1 reconstituted in the dimer is shown in Fig.3. Time course experiments were run using 2.4 ॖm of either substrate and 0.24 ॖm factor Xa at 22 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data obtained from the stained gel (Fig. 3A) were subjected to densitometry scans (Fig. 3B) and are summarized in Table I. The cleavage of A1 in the dimer was rapid compared with the isolated subunit. Generation of significant levels of the A11–336 fragment from this substrate appeared within 2 min and reflected an ∼6-fold increase in constantk21(+A3C1C2) compared with constantk21(−A3C1C2). Subsequent conversion of this fragment to the terminal digestion product showed little if any influence of the A3-C1-C2 based upon near equivalence of the estimated rate constants (k22(+A3C1C2)/k22(−A3C1C2)∼1). In contrast to the rapid appearance of the A11–336fragment following cleavage of the dimer, generation of the A137–372 was not significantly enhanced by the presence of the A3-C1-C2 subunit (k11(+A3C1C2)/k11(−A3C1C2)∼1.8). However, subsequent conversion to the A137–336terminal fragment was markedly enhanced by this association (k12(+A3C1C2)/k12(−A3C1C2)∼6). These results indicate that the cleavage at Arg336rather than at Lys36 is markedly affected by inclusion of the A3-C1-C2 subunit and the surface, suggesting a selective role for interaction of protease via binding to the C2 domain in catalyzing cleavage at the C-terminal site. Moreover, the cleavage at Arg1721 at the A3-C1-C2 subunit by factor Xa appeared within 2 min and was almost complete by 120 min as described previously (5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A series of experiments was performed to quantitate the kinetics of A1 cleavage (initial event) and the contribution"
https://openalex.org/W2030153247,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 22-residue cytoplasmic region of ephrinB induces its binding to the SH2 domain of Grb4, thus initiating reverse signaling pathways controlling cytoskeleton assembly and remodeling. Recently, the region corresponding to this 22-residue motif was demonstrated to adopt a well packed β-hairpin structure with a high conformational stability in the unphosphorylated cytoplasmic subdomain. However, because the binding to Grb4 is phosphorylation-dependent and the hairpin contains three conserved tyrosine residues that may be phosphorylated, the key events remain unknown as to how tyrosine phosphorylation affects the structure of this well packed β-hairpin and which phosphorylation site is relevant to SH2 domain binding. By characterizing the structural and binding properties of six 22-residue SH2 domain-binding motifs with different phosphorylated sites, the present study reveals that, as shown by circular dichroism and NMR, the unphosphorylated 22-residue motif adopts a well formed β-hairpin structure in isolation from the ephrinB cytoplasmic subdomain. However, this β-hairpin is radically abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation, regardless of the relative location and number of Tyr residues. Unexpectedly, the peptides with either Tyr304 or Tyr316 phosphorylated show high affinity binding to SH2 domain, whereas the peptide with Tyr311 phosphorylated has no detectable binding. This implies that ephrinB with Tyr311 phosphorylated might have a currently unidentified binding partner distinct from the Grb4 protein, because Tyr311 is known to be phosphorylated in vivo. Based on the results above, it is thus proposed that the disruption of the tight side-chain packing by tyrosine phosphorylation in the well structured region of a signaling protein may represent a general activation mechanism by which a cryptic binding site is disclosed for new protein-protein interactions.

They are implicated to function at the interface between pattern development and morphogenesis, such as axon guidance, cell migration, segmentation, and angiogenesis (1Holder N. Klein R. Development. 1999; 126: 2033-2044Google Scholar, 2Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 3Adams R.H. Klein R. Trends Cardiovasc.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 400-408Google Scholar). The signaling network mediated by Eph receptors and their ligand ephrin is conserved among metazoans, and eight mammalian ephrins have been identified so far. These can be grouped into two structural and functional families, ephrinA and ephrinB. EphrinB and their Eph receptors are all plasma membrane-anchored proteins and are unique in their ability to transmit signals bidirectionally, thus mediating contact-dependent cell-cell interactions for guidance and assembly of cells (4Kullander K. Mather N.K. Diella F. Dottori M. Boyd A.W. Klein R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 73-84Google Scholar, 5Mellitzer G. Xu Q. Wilkinson D.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 400-408Google Scholar, 6Kullander K.

Recently, the Eph-ephrinB-mediated signaling network has been found to be involved in learning and memory formation (8Murai K.K. Pasquale E.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 159-162Google Scholar), and differential expressions of ephrinB were also correlated with tumorigenesis (9Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the ephrinB proteins plays a central role in mediating reverse signaling via protein-protein interactions with intracellular protein binding partners (10Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar, 11Lu Q. Sun E.E. Klein R.S. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 69-79Google Scholar). In particular, interaction between the 22-residue cytoplasmic region of ephrinB and the Grb4 SH2 domain initiates down-stream signaling pathways regulating cytoskeleton assembly and remodeling (7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar, 10Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the NMR structure of the ephrinB cytoplasmic subdomain, and showed that, in the absence of the tyrosine phosphorylation, this 22-residue motif adopted a well packed β-hairpin structure (Fig. 1) with a high conformational stability as indicated by 15N backbone dynamics data (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar). However, because the interaction between this 22-residue region and the Grb4 SH2 domain is phosphorylation-dependent (7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar, 10Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar), and the β-hairpin region contains three conserved Tyr residues Tyr304, Tyr311, and Tyr316 (Fig. 1), the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in this interaction still remains unknown. On the other hand, although selective and reversible phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in controlling biological activity of proteins in many biochemical processes, the mechanism still remains poorly understood especially in structural terms (13Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Wenheim, Germany1996Google Scholar). In this regard, the 22-residue ephrinB β-hairpin represents a unique model for addressing the structural consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation because: 1) it adopts a well packed β-hairpin structure with extensive long range side-chain packing, which would facilitate the assessment of structural changes upon tyrosine phosphorylation and 2) it contains three conserved tyrosine residues, thus offering the possibility of studying the consequence of multiple tyrosine phosphorylations. By characterizing structural and binding properties of a set of six 22-residue ephrinB peptides, the current study focuses on addressing the structural consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation and on identification of phosphorylation sites relevant to the SH2 domain binding by use of circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopy. The set of peptides includes one unphosphorylated, three single-, one double-, and one triple-phosphorylated forms. Detailed CD and NMR characterization of the six 22-residue peptides demonstrates that the isolated SH2-domain binding motif adopts a well packed β-hairpin structure in the unphosphorylated state as described before (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar), but this β-hairpin structure is dramatically abolished by tyrosine phosphorylations. Furthermore, NMR-based binding study indicates that the in vivo unphosphorylated site Tyr304 is actually relevant to the SH2 domain binding, whereas the in vivo phosphorylated site Tyr311 is irrelevant. These results provide the first detailed picture showing how cryptic binding sites buried in a well packed β-hairpin of a signaling protein is activated by disrupting the tight side-chain packing through tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations may bear important implications in deciphering the Eph-ephrinB-mediated reverse signaling mechanism and contribute to our general knowledge of how tyrosine phosphorylation modulates signal transduction by switching the conformation of a signaling protein. Cloning and Expression of the Grb4 SH2 Domain—A DNA fragment encoding human Grb4 SH2 domain (residues 283–380) was generated from Grb4 DNA by PCR with the forward primer, 5′-GGG GAA TTC AGA GAG TGG TAC TAC GGG-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GGG CTC GAG TCA CTG CAG GGC CCT GAC G-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites, and the DNA sequence was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The expression construct for the SH2 domain was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 to express GST fusion protein and was subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The cleavage of the fusion protein was performed by incubating the fusion proteins with bovine factor Xa for 2 days. The purified SH2 domain protein was obtained by rebinding the released GST protein to the glutathione-Sepharose. For heteronuclear NMR experiments the SH2 domain protein were prepared in 15N-labeled form using a similar expression protocol except for growing E. coli cells in minimal M9 media instead of the 2YT media, with an addition of (15NH4)2SO4 for 15N labeling. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Six 22-residue peptides with different sites and numbers of phosphorylations at Tyr304, Tyr311, and Tyr316 were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxy-carbonyl) chemistry. This set of peptides includes one unphosphorylated native peptide with a sequence of 301CPHYEKVSGDYGHPVYIVQEMP322 corresponding to the residues 301–322 of ephrinB2 (designated as ephrinB2301–322); three single-phosphorylated peptides, [pY304] ephrinB2301–322, [pY311]ephrinB2301–322, and [pY316]ephrinB2301–322, with phosphorylation at Tyr304, Tyr311, and Tyr316, respectively; one double-phosphorylated peptide [pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322; and one triple-phosphorylated peptide [pY304,pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322. For further mapping of the specificity and affinity determination of the ephrinB and SH2-domain interaction, three short phosphorylated peptides derived from the ephrinB2 sequence, pY304EKVSG, pY311GHPV, and pY316IVQEM, were also chemically synthesized using the same procedure. The peptides were purified by a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography C18 column, and their identities were verified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and NMR resonance assignments. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter, with samples containing 50 μm peptides in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. Far-UV CD spectra were collected at 20 °C using 1-mm path length cuvettes with a 0.1-nm spectral resolution. Fifteen independent scans were averaged for each peptide. NMR Experiments and Structure Model Generation—An NMR sample of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain with a concentration of ∼0.15 mm was prepared by exchanging the protein into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Samples of the synthetic 22-residue peptides with concentrations of ∼2.0 mm were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptides in 400 μl of either H2O or D2O aqueous buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH or pD 6.8). Deuterated dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 15 mm to prevent the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridge. The deuterium lock signal for the NMR spectrometers was provided by the addition of 50 μl of D2O. A mixture of protease inhibitors was also added to inhibit the activities of any residual proteases not removed by the purification procedure. NMR experiments, including two-dimensional NOESY (14Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Google Scholar), TOCSY (15Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and 1H-15N HSQC (16Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Google Scholar) were collected on a Bruker Avance-500 spectrometer. A mixing time of 250 ms was used for NOESY, and 65 ms was used for TOCSY experiments. Spectral processing and analysis were carried out using the XwinNMR (Bruker) and NMRview software programs. Sequence-specific assignments for the synthetic peptides were achieved through identification of spin systems in the TOCSY spectra combined with sequential NOE connectivities in the NOESY spectra (17Wagner G. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 347-366Google Scholar, 18Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Google Scholar). The structural model of ephrin-B2301–322 was generated from the corresponding region of the published NMR structure (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar) by using the Insight II software package. Structural Effects of Tyrosine Phosphorylations Characterized by Circular Dichroism—To gain insight into the globular secondary structure changes caused by tyrosine phosphorylation of the peptides, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of all six 22-residue peptides were collected at pH 6.8 and 20 °C. As seen in Fig. 2, the far-UV CD spectrum of the unphosphorylated ephrinB2301–322 has two main bands at 198.1 nm (positive) and at 212.5 nm (negative). The presence of a positive band at about 198 nm and a negative one in the range of 210–215 nm usually indicates a well formed antiparallel β-sheet or β-hairpin (19Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar). This observation provides solid evidence that the 22-residue SH2-domain binding motif still adopts a well formed β-hairpin structure on its own in isolation from the 33-residue functional subdomain (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar). Strikingly, all three single-phosphorylated ephrinB2301–322 gave CD spectra without positive bands and with the negative bands shifted to around 200 nm, which are typical of very flexible loops or even random coil conformations (19Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar). Similar CD spectra were also observed for the double- and triple-phosphorylated ephrinB2301–322. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, the well formed β-hairpin adopted by 22-residue ephrinB2301–322 was drastically abolished, regardless of the position and numbers of the phosphorylation sites. Structural Effects of Tyrosine Phosphorylations Characterized by NMR Spectroscopy—To further assess the detailed structural changes induced by tyrosine phosphorylations, all six peptides were extensively characterized by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The sequential assignments were successfully achieved for all six peptides by analyzing the combination of TOCSY and NOESY spectra in H2O according to well established methods (17Wagner G. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 347-366Google Scholar, 18Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Google Scholar), and the proton chemical shifts are presented in the supplementary materials (Supplemental Tables S1–S6). Fig. 3a presents the chemical shift differences between the isolated 22-residue unphosphorylated peptide ephrinB2301–322 and the corresponding region in ephrinB2301–333 (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar). No significant difference was observed for the amide protons. With regard to the CαH resonance shifts, only three residues Cys301, Tyr311, and Pro322 showed obvious changes, indicating that the secondary structure of the unphosphorylated ephrinB2301–322 is almost identical to that of the corresponding region in ephrinB2301–333, which is completely consistent with the CD study. Fig. 3b shows the differences of amide proton chemical shifts between ephrinB2301–322 and its five phosphorylated forms. Overall, differences were observed among the sequence with some changes larger than 0.1 ppm. More profound changes were observed for CαH chemical shifts (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, there were always three residues, Cys301, Pro302, and Tyr311 showing significant changes on a similar scale, regardless of the position of individual phosphorylated sites in the all five phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 3c). Previously, it was shown that, unlike serine and threonine phosphorylations, tyrosine phosphorylation had no direct effect on the backbone conformation of model peptides (20Tholey A. Lindemann A. Kinzel V. Reed J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 76-87Google Scholar). Therefore, the current observation implies that tyrosine phosphorylations of ephrinB2301–322, regardless of their locations in the hairpin (Fig. 1), all caused similar global structural disruption, which consequently gave rise to the similar patterns of CαH chemical shift changes. NOESY spectra in D2O were collected for all six peptides to further address detailed changes in side-chain packing upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Fig. 4 (a–f) show the same aromatic side-chain regions of NOESY spectra of the six peptides in D2O. As seen in Fig. 4a, the existence of a large number of NOEs indicates that ephrinB2301–322 is well packed even through it was isolated from the functional subdomain. A further comparison of NOE patterns from ephrinB2301–322 with those from the corresponding region in ephrinB2301–333 indicates that their characteristic NOEs are almost identical. Together with CD and chemical shift data shown in Figs. 2 and 3a, results of the NOE analysis here strongly indicate that the structure of the isolated ephrinB2301–322 is very similar to that of the corresponding region in ephrinB2301–333, namely it is a well packed β-hairpin structure stabilized by extensive packing interactions among Tyr, His, Pro and the other hydrophobic side chains (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar). In striking contrast, upon phosphorylation of Tyr304, extensive NOE disappearances occurred (Fig. 4b), indicating a severe disruption of the tight side-chain packing (21Song J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Vita C. Menez A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 129-134Google Scholar). More specifically, phosphorylation of Tyr304 resulted in a complete disappearance of NOEs related to the ϵ protons of Tyr304. Phosphorylation of Tyr304 also disrupted all NOE connectivities related to the δ protons of His303 as well as all NOEs between proton pairs from the two hairpin strands, such as those between the δ and ϵ protons of Tyr316 and γ protons of Lys306 or γ protons of Glu305 (Fig. 4, a and b). These clearly indicated that a global and severe disruption of the β-hairpin structure had occurred. Similarly, phosphorylation of Tyr311 caused not only local structural perturbation, as indicated by the disappearance of all NOEs related to the ϵH protons of Tyr311, but also abolished all the long range side-chain packing, particularly those between proton pairs from two hairpin strands, similar to those observed for [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 (Fig. 4, b and c). These observations are similar to those for [pY316]ephrinB2301–322, [pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322, and triple-phosphorylated [pY304,pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322 peptides (Fig. 4, d–f). It is particularly worthwhile to note that, for the [pY304,pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322 peptide, all NOEs related to ϵ protons of Tyr304, Tyr311, and Tyr316 have dramatically disappeared (Fig. 4f). The disappearance of NOEs related to the ϵ protons of the phosphorylated tyrosines suggests that the introduction of a phosphate group to the aromatic ring of the tyrosine residues may place a large steric barrier, or change the dynamics, or both. All of which could lead to a severe disruption of the side-chain packing centered around the ϵ protons of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues. This notion is strongly supported by the dramatic changes of CD spectra upon tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2) and NMR observation that, for all peptides, both δ and ϵ protons of the phosphorylated tyrosines can be unambiguously assigned in TOCSY spectra but NOEs related to ϵ protons have totally disappeared (Supplemental Table S1–S6). Strikingly, it appears that the disruption of the tight side-chain packing related to any of three tyrosine side chains is sufficient to abolish the entire β-hairpin structure. However, although tyrosine phosphorylation severely abolished all long range packing interactions, some sequential and medium range NOEs can still be identified clustering over the Ω-loop-like region (residues Ser308-Gly312) in all five phosphorylated peptides. This observation is very similar to residual structures in partially folded proteins, implying that this loop region might serve as an initiation site in protein folding (21Song J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Vita C. Menez A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 129-134Google Scholar, 22Barbar E. Hare M. Makokha M. Barany G. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9734-9742Google Scholar, 23Zhang O. Kay L.E. Shortle D. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 9-20Google Scholar, 24Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1996; 47: 369-395Google Scholar). Binding Properties of Six 22-Residue Peptides and Three Short Peptidomimetics—Their binding properties of all six 22-residue ephrinB peptides for the Grb4 SH2 domain were monitored by following 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain titrated with different peptides. The unphosphorylated native peptide ephrinB2301–322 causes no HSQC peak shifts even with a 5-fold excess of the peptide. In addition, the 33-residue subdomain ephrinB2301–333 was also tested and showed no detectable binding activity (data not shown), consistent with the results of previous biochemical studies (10Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar). In contrast, titration of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain with the peptide [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 showed that, if the molar ratio between the peptide and the SH2 domain was less than 1, two sets of the HSQC peaks were observed for many residues of the SH2 domain. One set is without any peak shift and another set with extensive peak shifts, which must have arisen from the SH2 domain complexed with the peptide [pY304]ephrinB2301–322. When the molar ratio reached ∼1:1, the HSQC peak set from the free SH2 domain all shifted to merge with the set from the complexed SH2 domain. Further addition of the peptide up to a 5-fold excess caused no further peak shift (Fig. 5a). This observation implies that the dissociation of the complex between the SH2 domain and [pY304] ephrinB2301–322 is within the regime of slow chemical exchanges. For slow chemical exchange, the Kd value is usually less than 10 μm (25Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Google Scholar). However, as pointed out previously (25Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Google Scholar), exceptions do exist and it would be important to establish the binding constants independently by other biophysical methods. Surprisingly, [pY311]ephrinB2301–322 causes no detectable change of the HSQC spectra even with a 5-fold excess of the peptide (data not shown), indicating that [pY311]ephrinB2301–322 does not bind to the Grb4 SH2 domain. For the peptide [pY316]ephrinB2301–322, at a molar ratio (peptide/SH2 domain) less than 1, two sets of the HSQC peaks were observed for many residues of the SH2 domain. One set is without any peak shift and another set with significant peak shifts resulting from the complexed SH2 domain. When the molar ratio was increased to ∼1:1, the HSQC peak set from the free SH2 domain shifted to merge with the set from the complexed SH2 domain, similar to that observed in [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 titration. Furthermore, the addition of the peptide up to a 5-fold excess caused no further peak shift (Fig. 5b). This observation indicates that the dissociation between the [pY316]ephrinB2301–322 peptide and the SH2 domain is also within the regime of slow chemical exchanges. Interestingly, the HSQC spectrum of the SH2 domain complexed with [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 is different from that of the SH2 domain complexed with [pY316]ephrinB2301–322. This observation may result from different conformational changes induced by the binding of the two peptides to the same site on the SH2 domain, or alternatively from the binding of the two peptides to two completely different sites. Given the fact that a large portion of the HSQC peaks of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain underwent significant shifts upon binding to either [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 or [pY316]ephrinB2301–322, discrimination of the above two possibilities can not be easily achieved by the HSQC mapping method, and would certainly require high resolution three-dimensional structures of the peptide-SH2 domain complexes to be determined by x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the HSQC spectrum of the SH2 domain complexed with the double-phosphorylated peptide [pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322 was almost identical to that of the SH2 domain complexed with the single-phosphorylated peptide [pY316]ephrinB2301–322 (Fig. 5c). This clearly suggests that additional phosphorylation of Tyr311 does not enhance binding. The HSQC spectrum of the SH2 domain complexed with triple-phosphorylated peptide [pY304,pY311, pY316]ephrinB2301–322 was almost identical to that of the SH2 domain complexed with the single-phosphorylated peptide [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 peptide (Fig. 5d), indicating that the SH2 domain may bind to the triple-phosphorylated peptide [pY304,pY311,pY316]ephrinB2301–322 in a similar manner as with the single-phosphorylated peptide [pY304]ephrinB2301–322. To map the determinant of the binding affinity and specificity between the phosphorylated ephrinB and the Grb4 SH2 domain, the binding interactions between the SH2 domain and three short phosphorylated peptides pY304EKVSG, pY311GHPV, and pY316IVQEM were studied by HSQC titrations. The pY304EKVSG peptide started to induce the shifts of a subset of HSQC peaks of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain at a molar ratio of 4:1 (peptide/SH2 domain), and the shifting proceeded until it was saturated at a molar ratio of ∼16:1 (spectra not shown). This observation suggests that the dissociation between the SH2 domain and pY304EKVSG is within fast chemical exchange regime with a much weaker binding affinity (25Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Google Scholar) as compared with the interaction with [pY304]ephrinB2301–322. Interestingly, the saturated HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain in the presence of a 16-fold excess of the pY304EKVSG peptide is similar to that of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain complexed with [pY304]ephrinB2301–322, indicating that both the short pY304EKVSG and [pY304]ephrinB2301–322 peptides bind to the SH2 domain in a similar manner. Again, the unambiguous interpretation of the HSQC titration results undoubtedly requires the availability of the high resolution structures of the complexes between the SH2 domain and the different phosphorylated peptides. For pY311GHPV and pY316IVQEM, no detectable HSQC peak shift was observed even with a 16-fold excess of the peptides (data not shown). These results imply that, for both the phosphorylation sites Tyr304 and Tyr316, additional residues not present in the shortened peptides pY304EKVSG and pY316IVQEM are required to achieve high affinity bindings with the SH2 domain. The transmembrane ephrinB ligands behave as “receptor-like” signaling molecules, controlling morphogenic processes such as axon guidance and angiogenesis. Previous functional studies have highlighted the critical role of the cytoplasmic domain in these processes (6Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Google Scholar, 7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar, 26Adams R.H. Diella F. Hennig S. Helmbacher F. Deutsch U. Klein R. Cell. 2001; 104: 57-69Google Scholar, 27Patel B.N. Van Vactor D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 221-229Google Scholar, 28Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 46-51Google Scholar). Identification of two intracellular binding partners of ephrinB, namely PDZ-RGB and Grb4 proteins, provided critical insights into the molecular interactions underlying the Eph-ephrinB-mediated reverse signaling network (7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar, 10Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Google Scholar, 11Lu Q. Sun E.E. Klein R.S. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 69-79Google Scholar). Very recently, it was proposed that by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the ephrinB cytoplasmic domain, the reverse signaling could be controlled and switched between two critical pathways: one PDZ-dependent pathway leading to G protein-coupled receptor signaling and another phosphorylation-dependent pathway that modulates cytoskeletal dynamics (29Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar). Despite the central role of tyrosine phosphorylation in Eph-ephrinB-mediated reverse signaling, it remained unknown how tyrosine phosphorylation affects the structure of the 22-residue SH2 domain binding motif with a well packed β-hairpin and which phosphorylation site is relevant to the SH2 domain binding. Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is perhaps the most universal regulatory mechanism in controlling the biological activity of proteins by post-translational modifications, which occurs for a variety of cellular process ranging from regulation of catabolism/metabolism to control of growth and gene expression (13Marks F.

It has been widely thought that phosphorylation controls protein activity mainly by inducing conformational changes, but the detailed mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the structural consequence and binding properties of tyrosine phosphorylations on the well packed ephrinB cytoplasmic β-hairpin might contribute to our general knowledge how tyrosine phosphorylation controls cellular signaling through conformational switches. In the first part of this study, the detailed CD and NMR characterization of a set of six 22-residue ephrinB peptides demonstrates that the unphosphorylated ephrinB2301–322 adopts a well packed β-hairpin structure as described previously (12Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Google Scholar), but this structure is radically disrupted upon tyrosine phosphorylation, regardless of the exact position of the phosphorylated site. Because many tyrosine side chains in proteins participate in the formation of the tertiary packing by interacting with other local and/or long range hydrophobic side chains, the introduction of a phosphate group with a large side-chain volume and strong negative charges will inevitably disrupt the hydrophobic tertiary packing. It is therefore very likely that destabilization of protein structures through disrupting the side-chain packing may represent a general mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation controls the functions of proteins. In the second part, the phosphorylation of the 22-residue motif is further correlated to the binding interaction with the Grb4 SH2 domain. The NMR study reveals that both the in vivo unphosphorylated site Tyr304 and the in vivo phosphorylated site Tyr316 can bind the Grb4 SH2 domain with high affinities. Unexpectedly, however, the peptide with Tyr311 phosphorylated showed no detectable binding ability to the SH2 domain. Whether the phosphorylated Tyr304 can serve as an in vivo docking site for the Grb4 SH2 domain needs to be further investigated. Nevertheless, the observation that the peptide with Tyr311 phosphorylation shows no binding activity to the Grb4 SH2 domain suggests that phosphorylated Tyr311 might have other currently unknown in vivo binding partners, because both Tyr311 or Tyr316 are conserved tyrosine residues within the 22-residue β-hairpin and was shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 339-346Google Scholar, 29Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Google Scholar, 30Kalo M.S. Yu H.H. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38940-38948Google Scholar). A recent report indicated that the protein Dishevelled (Xdsh) formed a complex with either the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated ephrinB cytoplasmic domain (35Tanaka M. Kamo T. Ota S. Sugimura H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 847-858Google Scholar), followed by a further recruitment of other proteins. To this end, it would be of great interest to explore whether the phosphorylation of Tyr311 contributes to the Xdsh-based protein-protein interactions. Based on current results, it appears that for the interaction between the ephrinB cytoplasmic region and the Grb4 SH2 domain, three conditions have to be satisfied simultaneously: 1) the well packed hairpin structure has to be disrupted by tyrosine phosphorylation to expose the docking region for the Grb4 SH2 domain; 2) the phosphate group is needed to provide the binding energy (36Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Google Scholar, 37Song J. Ni F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 177-188Google Scholar); and 3) the specific amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residues have to be present to achieve high affinity binding. The last point is particularly underscored by the results of NMR binding study on the interactions between the SH2 domain and three short peptides, which clearly indicates that the high affinity binding between the SH2 domain and phosphorylated ephrinB2301–322 requires regions larger than the short sequences C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosines. It is also striking to note that phosphorylation of Tyr311, which satisfies conditions 1 and 2, but not 3, result in no detectable binding to the Grb4 SH2 domain. The finding that the pY304EKVSG peptide is able to bind the Grb4 SH2 domain may provide a promising starting point for the design of inhibitors disrupting the protein-protein interaction between ephrinB and the Grb4 protein (27Patel B.N. Van Vactor D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 221-229Google Scholar). In summary, the present NMR study provides the first detailed picture showing how the well packed β-hairpin structure of ephrinB cytoplasmic domain can be dramatically disrupted by single, double, and triple phosphorylations at three conserved tyrosine residues. The NMR binding study further identifies two out of three tyrosine residues within the 22-residue hairpin of ephrinB as phosphorylation sites relevant for high affinity binding to the Grb4 SH2 domain. In particular, the observation that the 22-residue peptide with Tyr311 phosphorylated shows no binding to the Grb4 SH2 domain implies that ephrinB phosphorylated at Tyr311 might have currently unidentified in vivo binding partners other than Grb4. The current results can be extrapolated to suggest that the disruption of the tight side-chain packing by tyrosine phosphorylation in the well structured region of a signaling protein may represent a general activation mechanism by which the cryptic binding site is disclosed for further protein-protein interactions.

Via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we determine both the amount of fusion protein presented at the phage surface and the amount of complex formed, the ratio of which is proportional to the affinity. Hence this method enables us to calculate the relative affinities of a large number of mutants. As model systems, we investigated actin-binding motifs conserved in a number of proteins binding monomeric or filamentous actin. The hexapeptide motifs LKKTET, present in thymosin औ4, and LKKEKG, present in the villin headpiece, were mutated, and the variants were analyzed. Study of the positional tolerance allows postulating that the motifs, although similar in primary structures adopt different conformations when bound to actin. In addition, our data show that the second and the fourth amino acid of the thymosin औ4 motif and the first three residues of the villin headpiece motif are most important for actin binding. The latter result challenges the charged crown hypothesis for the villin headpiece filamentous actin interaction.

Efforts are going on to tackle the discovery of protein-protein interactions globally (1Von Mering C. Krause R. Snel B. Cornell M. Oliver S.G. Fields S. Bork P. Nature. 2002; 417: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar), but there is also need for novel methods for the analysis of these interactions, preferably easy, reliable, and high through-put techniques. Several means to probe amino acids that contribute to the binding of two proteins have been developed. X-ray crystallography and NMR may yield superior information about the interface of proteins at atomic resolution (2Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar,3Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, both methods are intrinsically difficult (even for noncomplexed proteins) and time-consuming and require expensive and sophisticated equipment, as well as large amounts of biological material. Cross-linking of interacting proteins followed by mass spectroscopy or conventional sequence determination of covalently coupled peptide fragments has limited application (4Vandekerckhove J. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 6Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Probing the accessible surface in protein complexes by deuterium exchange has also been employed (7Englander S.W. Sosnick T.R. Englander J.J. Mayne L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 618-623Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). But by far the two most popular methods are the use of peptide mimetics either in solution (8Meloen R.H. Puijk W.C. Slootstra J.W. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or on membranes (9Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 10Reineke U. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and especially site-directed mutagenesis (11Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 12DeLano W.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). However, in the latter powerful technique to study functions of proteins or interactions between proteins, one often faces the difficulty of choosing the position and type of amino acid exchange to be introduced. To circumvent this, one may perform a saturation mutagenesis at several positions thought to be important for the interaction. Obviously this creates a new problem, i.e. screening a large number of mutants in a systematic way. We propose to combine saturation mutagenesis, phage display and ELISA1 for the systematic screening and quantification of protein-protein interactions. Phage display is traditionally used for the selection of stronger binding ligands against target molecules (13Ehrlich G.K. Berthold W. Bailon P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 147: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); here we employ it differently. We generate defined libraries of mutants and subsequently analyze all of the different recombinant phages using ELISA. In this ELISA we determine both the amount of fusion protein on the phage and the amount of complex formed. The ratio of both gives information about the binding strength of the different mutants. We apply this method to the presentation of thymosin औ4, analyzing monomeric actin (G-actin) binding, and of the villin headpiece, probing both G-actin and filamentous actin (F-actin) binding. We selected these actin-binding modules because for thymosin औ4 the actin binding information is relatively well characterized, but its structure is poorly defined. By contrast the villin headpiece has a well resolved NMR structure, but information on those residues that interact with actin is still elusive. Thymosin औ4 interacts with actin via residues in an α-helix and a conserved hexapeptide motif (LKKTET) (14Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C.

NMR studies of thymosin औ4 reveal no unique structure for this motif; however, it is evident that the motif must become structured upon binding actin (17Czisch M. Schleicher M. Hörger S. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Zarbock J. Oschkinat H. Hannapel E. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Holak T.A.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A seemingly related sequence (LKKEKG) is present in a set of C-terminal headpiece domains (15Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Van Troys M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 323-348Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) implicated in F-actin binding (20Vardar D. Chishti A.H. Frank B.S. Luna E.J. Noegel A.A. Oh S.W. Schleicher M. McKnight C.J. Cell. Motil. Cytoskelet. 2002; 52: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NMR of the villin headpiece showed that the first five amino acids of the motif are in a α-helical conformation (21McKnight C.J. Matsudaira P.T. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Vardar D. Buckley D.A. Frank B.S. McKnight C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and some of these are part of a charged crown suggested to be important for actin binding (20Vardar D. Chishti A.H. Frank B.S. Luna E.J. Noegel A.A. Oh S.W. Schleicher M. McKnight C.J. Cell. Motil. Cytoskelet. 2002; 52: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although both modules appear to have analogous motifs in their primary structure, they display different specificities for G- and F-actin. This suggests that local structural changes in these actin-binding units govern the recognition of the different conformational states of actin. Here we show that a combination of mutagenesis, phage display, and ELISA may be a powerful new tool to systematically investigate protein-protein interactions by evaluating the relative binding strengths of mutants. Next to mutational tolerance at a position, structural information on the bound conformation can be inferred from mutants displaying increased affinity. In addition, our results show that some of the charged crown residues in the villin headpiece, hypothesized to be important for actin interaction, are dispensable for actin binding. Enzymes and reagents for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs or Invitrogen and were used following the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurogentec. The phagemid vector pCANTAB5E, the detection module, and the Escherichia coli strain TG1 were from Amersham Biosciences. The helper phage M13KO7 was from Promega. The Sequenase version 2.0 kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp., and [α-35S]dATP was from ICN. We used the phagemid pCANTAB5E harboring the wild type human thymosin औ4 or human villin headpiece cDNA, inserted between theSfiI and NotI restriction sites, as starting material to create the libraries. We constructed this library by independently mutating each of the six codons of both hexapeptide motifs into the 63 other possible ones, using overlap extension PCR mutagenesis (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) with synthetic oligonucleotides completely degenerated at the desired positions. The obtained PCR products wereSfiI- and NotI-ligated in pCANTAB5E. The resulting phagemid contains under control of the lac promotor, the gene III (gIII) signal coding sequence, the thymosin औ4 or the villin headpiece gene, the E-tag coding sequence, an amber codon (TAG), and the rest of the gIII coding region. The ligation was electroporated in TG1 cells. Phagemid DNA of individual transformants, was purified with WizardTM minipreps (Promega) and sequenced. These isolated transformants were also used to produce phages, displaying thymosin औ4 or villin headpiece variants, according to the protocol available from the company (Amersham Biosciences). We determined phage titers as described previously (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rescued phages were also used in the ELISAs described below. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated as calcium-G-actin by chromatography over Sephadex G-200 in G buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.017 NaN3). For biotinylation on Cys374, we applied actin to a NAP10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted it with G buffer without dithiothreitol. We immediately derivatized actin, on Cys374, with 5-fold molar excess Immunopure Iodoacetyl-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. The biotinylated actin was dialyzed four times against G buffer with dithiothreitol to remove excess of labeling reagent. We biotinylated actin (1 mg) on Gln41 using transglutaminase (1 unit; Sigma) as in Ref. 26Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar except that we used biotin cadaverin (Molecular Probes). In both cases we checked the incorporation of biotin by a Western blot using streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The set up of the method relies on monovalency of the phage display system and on the possibility to measure two absorbance values in an ELISA. The first criterion is fulfilled (see main text and Refs. 24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 27Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In wells, coated with E-tag antibody, one measures absorbance A0, which is proportional to the total amount of recombinant phages, ergo to the total amount of presented protein [Ytot]. In wells coated with target protein (here G- or F-actin), one measures absorbance A, which is proportional to the amount of protein-protein complex [XY]. In addition, if the total concentration of the presented protein [Ytot] is much lower than the total concentration of the target protein [Xtot] (see below), we can state that the concentration of free protein [X] equals [Xtot]. Thus, in the dissociation equation we can replace [Ytot] bykA0 and [XY] by kA (withk being the same proportionality factor). It is important to note that the Kd value of the E-tag antibody (10−7m see below) for the presented protein is significantly lower than the Kd value of the coated protein for the presented protein. We can then write:Kd = [Xtot](kA0− kA)/kA or (Kd/[Xtot])+ 1 =A0/A, i.e. theKd value is in a linear correlation with the ratioA0/A. Although our results, presented below, indicate that this correlation exists, the formula cannot be used to calculate Kd values because [Xtot] represents a solution concentration, and we here use a solid phase assay. Coating of functional biotinylated monomeric actin or filamentous actin was reproducible. In a previous paper (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we used a linear correlation between theKd and the ratio of phage titer (T) over the absorbance (A) measured in a similar way as here, with a formula of the following form: (Kd/[Xtot]) + 1 =T/ANk (where N is Avogadro's number and k is a proportionality factor). This formula is related to the one above because T/N is equal tokA0. Note that both formulae are also modified Scatchard equations. The above derivation relies on an excess of functional target protein, coated in the wells, over the amount of phage presented protein. The amount of biotinylated actin in the neutravidin-coated wells (see below) was 1.4 pmol/well. This is 106-fold higher than the amount of presented thymosin औ4 (in general attomol/well). We performed a similar assay coating monomeric actin (5 ॖg/100 ॖl) directly to the wells. Although 29 pmol of actin was coated, the read-out in the ELISA, using the same phage preparations, consistently resulted in lower signals (not shown), indicating most of the directly coated actin is not functional. Therefore, and because biotinylation on Cys374 of actin does not interfere with thymosin औ4 interaction, 2S. Rossenu, S. Leyman, and C. Ampe, unpublished results. we used the biotinylated form in all of the thymosin औ4-G-actin interaction assays. For the villin headpiece we used a previously documented procedure of F-actin coating (28Bourdet-Sicard R. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Tran Van Nhieu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We coated microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp) either with 400 ng/100 ॖl Immunopure neutravidin (Pierce) or 1 ॖg/100 ॖl of E-tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Excess binding sites were blocked with 200 ॖl of blocking buffer (27 solution of skimmed milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline). Neutravidin-coated wells were incubated with 1 ॖg/100 ॖl biotinylated actin for 1 h at room temperature. We washed the microtiter plate three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.057 Tween 20 (washing buffer) and added 1010 rescued phages in 200 ॖl of blocking buffer to the biotin-actin-neutravidin wells or a 1:100 dilution of the phages to the E-tag antibody-coated wells. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, we washed the plates four times with washing buffer and supplied the wells with 200 ॖl of 1:2500 diluted anti-M13 antibody, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. We washed the wells three times with washing buffer, incubated the enzyme with the substrate 2′,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6) sulfonic acid (Amersham Biosciences) and measured absorbance at 405 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Dynatech). For the villin headpiece mutant analysis, we coated 12 ॖm polymerized actin overnight at 4 °C (28Bourdet-Sicard R. Rüdiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Tran Van Nhieu G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The ELISA was carried out as above with similar phage dilutions as used for thymosin औ4. Based on the higher A0 values, the amount of presented villin headpiece was a factor 2–3-fold higher than that of thymosin औ4. The Kd values of chemically synthesized thymosin औ4 variants (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were determined as in Ref. 15Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar except that we used phosphate-buffered saline, the buffer also used in the ELISA. The genes coding for wild type or mutant villin headpiece were recloned from the pCANTAB5E phagemid in pET11d (Novagen), with a new stop codon inserted at the 3′-end of the villin head-piece coding sequence and expressed in E. coli MC1061 containing pSCM26 (29Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proteins, thus lacking the E-tag sequence, were purified following the protocol in Ref. 22Vardar D. Buckley D.A. Frank B.S. McKnight C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. TheKd values for the villin headpiece mutants were determined in a sedimentation assay. We incubated 12 ॖmF-actin with various molar ratios of the villin headpiece, or mutant, for 30 min at room temperature and sedimented the F-actin with an Airfuge (Beckman) for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and the F-actin pellet was washed with G buffer supplemented with 100 mm KCl and 1 mmMg2Cl. Aliquots of the supernatant and pellet were analyzed using a 107 Tricine gel. After staining the gels, we used densitometric scanning to determine the amount of bound and free villin headpiece. We used these values in a Scatchard plot to calculate theKd. The Kd for the WT-villin headpiece F-actin interaction is ∼10-fold higher than previously reported using slightly different buffer conditions at 4 °C (20Vardar D. Chishti A.H. Frank B.S. Luna E.J. Noegel A.A. Oh S.W. Schleicher M. McKnight C.J. Cell. Motil. Cytoskelet. 2002; 52: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Kd of the E-tag antibody for the E-tag sequence was determined using a Biacore X. The antibody was coated to a CM5 chip (Biacore, Sweden) using amine coupling with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride andN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions. Various concentrations of purified thymosin औ4, expressed from pCANTAB5E in HB2151 cells and thus containing the E-tag sequence, were passed over the sensorchip in HEPES-buffered saline (Biacore, Sweden). We derived theKd value (100 nm) from fitting the association and dissociation curves. Note that this is 100-fold lower than the Kd for the actin thymosin औ4 interaction in phosphate-buffered saline. Evaluating the contribution of amino acids participating in the interaction of two proteins is often difficult and time-consuming, especially when three-dimensional structures of the individual proteins or of the complex are unknown. In the post-genome era, in which researchers employ bioinformatics to predict new potential interactions, there is a need for relatively fast and easy ways to investigate the binding of two proteins to confirm these predictions. In a previous study, we already explored the possibility of using a combination of three existing methods: PCR, phage display, and ELISA to study protein-protein interactions (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present work we improved this method and applied it to the interaction of thymosin औ4 with G-actin and of villin headpiece with G- and F-actin using libraries of mutants. Using double cycle PCR saturation mutagenesis reactions (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) on the thymosin औ4 and the villin headpiece gene, inserted in the pCANTAB5E phagemid, we created libraries for each of the six positions of the hexapeptide motifs of both actin-binding modules. In the case of thymosin औ4, the motif is known to be important for the interaction with actin (14Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); for the villin headpiece this has been proposed (22Vardar D. Buckley D.A. Frank B.S. McKnight C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For each of the 12 libraries we obtained at least 2–5 × 106 transformants/ॖg DNA in E. coli, far in excess over the expected 64 variants for each position in the motif. From each of the six thymosin औ4 libraries, we isolated on average 70 clones and sequenced them to identify the created mutation. We recovered 103 of the 114 possible mutants at the amino acid level. From the results presented below for thymosin औ4, it became evident that classes of mutants exist. For this reason we isolated from the six villin headpiece libraries enough mutants to get a member of each class allowing rapid screening of the villin headpiece-F-actin interaction. The method is schematically depicted in Fig.1. Basically, we insert the gene of interest (or a limited library of mutants) in the gIIIp gene coding for the M13 minor coat protein pIII. We opted for the phagemid pCANTAB5E, which has been engineered for monovalent display of heterologous proteins (27Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), to avoid complications arising from avidity effects during measurements of relative affinity. In addition, this vector carries the coding information for the E-tag sequence, the epitope for the anti-E-tag antibody, between the gene of interest and the gIIIp gene. The presence of a M13 origin of replication in pCANTAB5E permits the packaging of the phagemid DNA when bacteria are infected with a helper phage (e.g. M13KO7) during the so-called rescue. Because we purify by cloning, we avoid laborious purification steps (note that this also avoids possible background absorbance values in the ELISA by religated phages containing no insert but expressing the E-tag). Because the system is statistically monovalent (maximally one of 2,000 recombinant phages will be divalent) (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the resulting recombinant phages only carry one copy of the heterologous protein and can be used in an ELISA for presentation of this protein to its coated partner. In this ELISA, the measured absorbance (A) is then proportional to the amount of protein complex formed. On the other hand, using the same phage preparations, the total amount of presented protein (A0) can be measured because only the recombinant phages carry the E-tag sequence. As derived under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Fig. 1), the formula predicts that there is a linear correlation between the equilibrium dissociation constant of the interaction and the ratio (A0/A) of the number of recombinant phages over the amount of complex formed, provided that the amount of coated target protein is in large excess over the amount of presented protein. As an alternative for A0, one can determine the phage titer (T) (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), assessing the sum of the recombinant and nonrecombinant phages. It is, however, important to note that only 17 of the total phage population carries a recombinant protein (31Saggio I. Gloaguen I. Laufer R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a previous paper (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we determined the T/Avalues of 18 mutants of Lys18 in the actin binding motif of thymosin औ4. Here, we measured the A andA0 values of the same mutants in an ELISA using biotinylated actin and coated anti-E-tag antibody, respectively. We plotted T/A (24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) versus A0/A values (this study) and observed a correlation of 0.86, indicating that both measurements yield essentially the same result independent of the manner in which the amount of recombinant protein is determined (data not shown). This is with the exception of those mutants where codon usage in E. coli influences the amount of expressed fusion protein. Indeed, for thymosin औ4 mutants in which Lys18 had been mutated to Arg, the T/A values were higher for mutants with a less frequently used codon, whereas theirA0/A values were all very similar (Table I). Similarly,A0/A values of K18Q mutants, where glutamine is encoded by TAG in the supE strain TG1 (this stop codon is only partially suppressed resulting in lower expression levels) or by the normal CAG codon, are comparable (83.7 and 82.6, respectively). Consequently, the method using titer over absorbance (T/A) can only be employed if one takes into account codon usage in E. coli. Thus, the purely ELISA-based method (measuring A and A0) is superior and exclusively used in the analysis presented below.Table ICodon usage influences T/A values but not A0/A valuescodonFrequencyT/AvalueA0/A value7AGG (Arg)0.51.16 × 101132.8CGG (Arg)0.51.11 × 101134.1CGA (Arg)11.25 × 101132.4CGT (Arg)742.62 × 10733.6AAG (Lys, WT)262.33 × 10732.6The frequency values are taken from Ref. 45Gribskov M.

Burgess R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar. We predict a correlation between the Kd and theA0/A ratio (see “Experimental Procedures”). To validate this, we determined theA0/A values of six phage displayed thymosin औ4 variants (WT, K18A, K18R, K18Y, K18E, and K19E) for which the Kd values of chemically synthesized counterparts were measured by a sequestration assay (15Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also measured theKd values of bacterially produced and purified villin headpiece wild type and mutants (K70R, K71D, E72S, and K73F) by a co-sedimentation assay and Scatchard analysis (data not shown). In both cases we plotted the Kd valuesversus the correspondingA0/A values of the same phage presented mutants. There is a linear correlation of 0.99 for the thymosin औ4-G-actin interaction and of 0.98 for the villin headpiece-F-actin interaction (Fig.2). These values suggest that despite the bias favoring dissociation inherent to washing steps in the ELISA, apparent affinities can be measured, illustrating the robustness of the method. We made recombinant phages of the 103 mutants of thymosin औ4, isolated from the six different libraries. All of the variants could be displayed on the phage surface, except for the Met, Arg, and Asp mutants at position 17, for reasons we currently cannot explain."
https://openalex.org/W2058070870,"Elongin A is a transcription elongation factor that increases the overall rate of mRNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II. To investigate the function of Elongin A in vivo, the two alleles of the Elongin A gene have been disrupted by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Elongin A-deficient ES cells are viable, but show a slow growth phenotype because they undergo a delayed mitosis. The cDNA microarray and RNase protection assay using the wild-type and Elongin A-deficient ES cells indicate that the expression of only a small subset of genes is affected in the mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Elongin A regulates transcription of a subset but not all of genes and reveal a linkage between Elongin A function and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2102430625,"Chemiluminescence emitted by Mn2+-activated ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) while catalyzing oxygenation was analyzed to clarify the source of the emission. Using dual detectors capturing radiation over a wide range of visible and infrared wavelengths, we tested for radiation from singlet O2 decay and found it to be essentially absent (less than 0.17 of the total luminescence intensity). Spectra were determined between 647 and 885 nm with a very sensitive, charge-coupled detector-based spectrograph to detect differences in the emission spectra between rubiscos from bacterial and higher plant sources. All Mn2+-activated rubiscos emitted a broad, smooth spectrum of chemiluminescence, unchanging as the reaction progressed. The spectra from higher plant rubiscos (spinach and both the wild type and an L335V mutant from tobacco), all exhibited maxima at about 800 nm. However, Mn2+-activated rubisco from the bacterium,Rhodospirillum rubrum, emitted at shorter wavelengths (760 nm peak), demonstrating host ligand-field influences arising from aminoacyl residue differences and/or conformational changes caused by the absence of small subunits. The findings provide strong evidence that the chemiluminescence arises from an excited state of the active-site Mn2+ that is produced during oxygenation. We propose that the Mn2+ becomes excited by a one-electron exchange mechanism of oxygenation that is not available to Mg2+-activated rubisco."
https://openalex.org/W2034152155,"The ubiquitous Op18 and the neural RB3 and SCG10 proteins are members of the oncoprotein18/stathmin family of microtubule regulators. These proteins bind two tubulin heterodimers via two imperfect helical repeats to form a complex of heterodimers aligned head-to-tail. Here we have analyzed GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis at the exchangeable GTP-binding site (E-site) of tubulin heterodimers in complex with Op18, RB3, or SCG10. These proteins stimulate a low and indistinguishable rate of GTP hydrolysis, and our results show that GTP exchange is blocked at both E-sites of the ternary complex, whereas GTP hydrolysis only occurs at one of the two E-sites. Results from mutational analysis of clusters of hydrophobic residues within the first helical repeat of Op18 suggest that GTP is hydrolyzed at the E-site that is interfaced between the head-to-tail arranged heterodimers, which is consistent with predicted GTPase productive interactions between the two tubulin heterodimers. Our mutational analysis has also indicated that Op18/stathmin family members actively restrain the otherwise potent GTPase productive interactions that are generated by longitudinal interactions within protofilaments.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of the neural family members is a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the N terminus, which includes two Cys residues that serve as palmitoylation sites and mediate association to intracellular membranes, primarily at the Golgi apparatus (for review, see Ref. 2Mori N. Morii H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous Op18 protein, which lacks this stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, has a widespread distribution in the cytosol. Op18/stathmin family members form ternary complexes with two tubulin heterodimers, and the overall shape of the complex has been revealed by transmission electron microscopy and a low resolution x-ray structure (3Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S.

The complex can be described as two tubulin heterodimers in a slightly curved head-to-tail alignment, with each one of the tandem helical repeats of Op18 binding along one heterodimer to generate a ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex, which is stabilized by longitudinal interactions between the two heterodimers (see Fig. 1). As predicted by these stabilizing heterodimer-heterodimer interactions within the complex, Op18 binds two heterodimers according to a two-site positive cooperative model, which strongly favors formation of a ternary complex rather than binary complex formation with a single tubulin heterodimer (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 4-Å resolution x-ray structure has allowed rejection of alternative models for the ternary complex (6Wallon G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Serrano L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but was of insufficient resolution to resolve the orientation of the extended Op18 helix. Cross-linking experiments, however, indicate that the N terminus of Op18 is orientated toward the exposed α-tubulin end of the head-to-tail-aligned heterodimers (8Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M.O. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Microtubules are polymers built up from α/औ-tubulin heterodimers, and a characteristic feature of individual microtubules is frequent and stochastic switching between polymerization and depolymerization cycles, a phenomenon termed dynamic instability (for review, see Ref.9Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). The औ-tubulin subunit of the heterodimer contains an exchangeable GTP-binding site (termed E-site), and microtubules utilize polymerization-induced GTP hydrolysis to generate dynamic instability. The mechanism of GTP hydrolysis involves longitudinal interactions of polymerizing α/औ heterodimers via a catalytic loop located on the α-tubulin that interacts with the E-site of the adjacent औ-tubulin subunit (10Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The tip of a polymerizing microtubule contains a stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin, the loss of which results in a catastrophe (i.e. transition from a growing to a shrinking polymer). Op18 was originally described as being a specific catastrophe-promoting protein (11Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), but this was subsequently challenged by a study claiming that Op18 acts solely by sequestering tubulin heterodimers (12Jourdain L. Curmi P. Sobel A. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10817-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This controversy was resolved by a study demonstrating that Op18 mediates both catastrophe promotion and sequestration of tubulin and that detection of these activities depends on buffer conditions (14Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It was also shown in the same study that the non-helical N-terminal region is essential for catastrophe-promoting activity, whereas the extended helical part of Op18 containing the two imperfect repeats is necessary and sufficient for tubulin-sequestering activity. Recent studies involving ectopic expression of truncated/mutated Op18 derivatives in human cell lines have indicated the significance of the functional dichotomy of Op18 that is observed in vitro (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,15Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1034-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How Op18 promotes catastrophes is still obscure, but given that the second helical repeat is dispensable, binding studies (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol.

Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) allow the conclusion that the mechanism does not involve the two-site positive cooperative binding activity of Op18 that is required for efficient formation of ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complexes (see Fig. 1). Moreover, such recent structural insights readily explain the requirement for the second helical repeat in generating an Op18·tubulin heterodimer complex of sufficient stability to exert tubulin-sequestering activity. The two-site positive cooperative binding activity of Op18 also has additional functional consequences that are distinct from tubulin sequestration, such as inhibition of GTP exchange and stimulation of autonomous low rate GTP hydrolysis within the ternary complex (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Truncation of the second helical repeat of Op18, which does not alter the catastrophe-promoting activity, terminates stimulation of GTP hydrolysis (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Hence, stimulation of tubulin GTP hydrolysis by Op18 depends strictly on the cooperative tubulin heterodimer binding activity that mediates the tubulin head-to-tail configuration of the complex. As outlined above, the cooperative Op18 binding of two tubulin heterodimers inhibits GTP exchange and stimulates autonomous low rate GTP hydrolysis within the ternary complex. In the present study, we have functionally dissected Op18 and the homologous RB3 and SCG10 proteins with the aim of understanding the significance of these GTP-regulatory events. Wild-type Op18 and an Op18 derivative with the non-helical N-terminal 45 amino acids deleted (termed Op18-R1 + 2 because it contains the tandem repeats 1 and 2 of the extended helix; see Fig. 1) have been described (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both of these Op18 derivatives contained an eight-amino acid C-terminal FLAG epitope. Soluble SCG10 (sSCG10), with the hydrophobic N-terminal 30-amino acid membrane targeting region removed, was prepared by a PCR strategy using a full-length cDNA clone of SCG10 (SCG10-8.6, (18Stein R.

The eight-amino acid C-terminal FLAG epitope was introduced by a 24-nucleotide insertion before the stop codon in the 3′ PCR primer. An N-terminally truncated SCG10 derivative (termed SCG10-R1 + 2), which corresponded to Op18-R1 + 2 (see Fig. 1), was prepared by a PCR strategy using sSCG10 DNA as a template. As part of the cloning strategy for truncated proteins, the first three amino acids of the N terminus of Op18 were added to the N terminus of Op18-R1 + 2 and SCG10-R1 + 2 derivatives. The soluble form of RB3 (sRB3) and the RB3-R1 + 2 derivative were constructed using an identical PCR strategy to that described above for SCG10. An RB3 cDNA, obtained from Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL, was used as a template (GenBankTM accession number AL534520). The Op18-family derivatives described above were expressed with a six-residue His tag at the N terminus and purified from Escherichia coli using pET-3d expression as described previously (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Construction of the Op18-pmut1, where the codons for Leu-47, Ile-50, and Leu-54 are exchanged for Ala codons, has been described previously (originally termed Op18-cc m1) (19Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Op18-pmut2, where the codons for Val-68, Leu-69, and Leu-72 are exchanged for Ala codons, and Op18-pmut3, where the codons for Val-82 and Leu-83 are exchanged for Ala codons, were constructed using a general strategy where mutations were introduced into subfragments of the coding region by overlapping PCR using wild-type Op18 as template. Coding regions of these Op18 derivatives were expressed and purified as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in pGEX 4T-1 (7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of PCR-generated fragments were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Purified recombinant proteins were routinely analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm the homogeneity and determine the protein concentration of each preparation. Analysis of tubulin GTPase activity was performed in PEM buffer (80 mmpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 1 mmEGTA, 4 mm Mg2+) containing 177 glycerol adjusted to the indicated pH with NaOH. The buffer also contained 5 mm adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP; to inhibit nonspecific ATPase activity) as described previously (7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, tubulin (TL238, Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was incubated with [α-32P]GTP, the resulting tubulin·[α-32P]GTP complexes were recovered by centrifugation through a desalting column (P-30 Micro Bio-Spin, Bio-Rad), and single-turnover GTP hydrolysis was followed at 37 °C. Control experiments showed that the Op18 preparations used neither bind nor hydrolyze [α-32P]GTP or cause dissociation of tubulin-bound [α-32P]GTP. Nucleotide hydrolysis was quantified by ascending chromatography as described (7Segerman B. Larsson N. Holmfeldt P. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35759-35766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which allows reproducible analysis of less than 0.27 hydrolysis of the [α-32P]GTP. [α-32P]GTP-tubulin (0.8 mol GTP/mol tubulin, ∼4 × 1015 dpm/mol) was incubated at 5 ॖm (in PEM buffer at the stated pH and glycerol concentration) on ice for 10 min in the presence or absence of the indicated Op18-family derivative. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 mm cold GTP at 37 °C, and exchange rates were followed over time by separation of unbound [α-32P]GTP through a desalting column (P-30 Micro Bio-Spin, Bio-Rad). These columns retained more than 99.997 of all non-tubulin bound [α-32P]GTP, whereas the flow-through contained tubulin and Op18 (>957 yield). Twenty microliters of the reaction mixture was sampled per time point. The GTP exchange rates were calculated by quantifying the radioactivity of the samples and the desalting columns. Plasmon resonance competition experiments were carried out on a BIAcore 3000 system with Op18 immobilized by amine coupling on a CM5 chip according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Analyses were performed with the indicated concentrations of tubulin in PEM, pH 6.8, premixed with graded concentrations of Op18 derivatives. The free tubulin concentrations were determined from the plateau levels by comparison with a standard tubulin curve, as described in the BIAcore handbook. Dissociation constants refer to the binding of two tubulin heterodimers. Complex formation between Op18 and tubulin heterodimers has previously been shown to result in low rate tubulin GTP hydrolysis (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine whether this property is conserved, we analyzed soluble derivatives of two neural members of the Op18/stathmin family, SCG10 and RB3, in which the membrane-targeting regions were deleted (see sSCG10 and sRB3 in Fig. 1). Single-turnover tubulin GTP hydrolysis was determined at 37 °C by incubation of Op18/stathmin family derivatives with tubulin at a concentration that was sufficiently low to avoid polymerization. As shown in Fig.2, all three Op18/stathmin family members tested stimulated tubulin GTP hydrolysis ∼3-fold as compared with the basal hydrolysis rate. Moreover, analysis of N-terminally truncated derivatives that only encompass repeats 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1) revealed unaltered tubulin GTPase stimulation (compare Fig. 2, A andB). It should be noted that truncation of the 45 residues at the non-helical N terminus resulted in a shift in dose-response in all cases, which indicates decreased tubulin heterodimer binding affinity. However, under the present assay conditions, each derivative was used at a concentration that was sufficient to reach the plateau level of tubulin GTPase stimulation (data not shown). Hence, the level of GTPase stimulation appears to be completely conserved among Op18/stathmin family members and requires only the region shown to be directly involved in the cooperative tubulin heterodimer binding activity, which generates the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex (see Fig.1). Op18 has also been shown previously to inhibit tubulin GTP exchange (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,17Amayed P. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A comparison of tubulin GTP exchange inhibitory properties of the three Op18/stathmin family members is shown in Fig. 2C, and the exchange rates calculated were as follows: control, 0.82 min−1; Op18, 0.061 min−1; sSCG10, 0.036 min−1; and sRB3, 0.0076 min−1. It is evident from these results that, under identical conditions to those used for tubulin GTPase assays, Op18 causes inhibition of the tubulin GTP exchange rate by a factor of ∼10. Interestingly, the effects of sSCG10 and sRB3 were even more potent, and the observed GTP exchange inhibition lies in the order sRB3 > sSCG10 > Op18. This is the same order as the order reported for stability of the ternary complexes between tubulin heterodimers and these Op18/stathmin family members (20Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which has been confirmed by us subsequently (data not shown). Hence, the stability of the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex appears to be an important determinant for tubulin GTP exchange inhibition. The 45-residue non-helical N terminus of Op18 contributes to tubulin GTP exchange inhibition at 37 °C (19Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cognate N-terminal regions of SCG10 and RB3 act similarly, as evidenced by decreased tubulin GTP exchange inhibition by the SCG10-R1 + 2 and RB3-R1 + 2 derivatives that only encompass the extended helical region (Fig.2D) (exchange rates were as follows: Op18-R1 + 2, 0.14 min−1; SCG10-R1 + 2, 0.083 min−1; and RB3-R1 + 2, 0,054 min−1). By comparing the data in Fig. 2,C and D, however, it is clear that the N-terminally truncated derivatives still retain substantial GTP exchange inhibitory activity, with RB3-R1 + 2 being as potent as full-length Op18. It is also clear from Fig. 2, C andD that the relative potency of each of the N-terminally truncated derivatives lies in the same order as the non-truncated derivatives, i.e. sRB3 > sSCG10 > Op18. To further address the structural requirements underlying tubulin GTP exchange rates, assays were performed on ice to increase the stability of complexes. We used the same glycerol-containing buffer as in the experiments described above, because glycerol greatly increases the tubulin heterodimer binding affinity of both full-length and truncated Op18 derivatives, thereby facilitating saturated binding (19Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To estimate the affinity of tubulin heterodimer binding under these conditions, plasmon resonance competition experiments were performed (Fig. 3A). The data show that truncation of the 45-residue non-helical N-terminal region results in a significant decrease in binding affinity toward tubulin heterodimers. From these data, the free tubulin concentrations at half-saturation (i.e. the apparent dissociation constant, ignoring two-site binding cooperativity) were calculated to be <0.2 ॖm for Op18 and 2.5 ॖm for Op18-R1 + 2. Analysis of the tubulin GTP exchange inhibitory properties of these two Op18 derivatives reveals similar levels of GTP exchange inhibitory activities if determined at 0 °C (Fig. 3B), and the calculated exchange rates were 0.012 min−1 for Op18 and 0.015 min−1 for Op18-R1 + 2 as compared with 0.16 min−1 for the control. These data also show that the potency of GTP exchange inhibition is dramatically increased at 0 °C compared with 37 °C (compare Figs. 2C and 3B). However, this can be attributed in part to the fact that the GTP exchange rate of pure tubulin is reduced at 0 °C in a glycerol-containing buffer, which has also been observed by others (21Seckler R. Wu G.M. Timasheff S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7655-7661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems clear from the data in Fig. 3 that the non-helical N-terminal region of Op18 is not a structural requirement for potent inhibition of GTP exchange. It follows that the enhancing effect of the N-terminal region on GTP exchange inhibition observed at 37 °C (Fig. 2) is an indirect effect mediated by the affinity-enhancing activity of this non-helical part of Op18/stathmin family members (Fig. 3A). It is also notable that the slopes of GTP exchange both at 37 °C (Fig. 2) and at 0 °C (Fig. 3) are mono-phasic, which suggests similar GTP exchange rates at both E-sites contained within the ternary complex. The solved x-ray structure shows that repeats 1 and 2 of Op18/stathmin family proteins are not in contact with the exposed E-site at one end of the complex, whereas the E-site that is interfaced between the two heterodimers can be predicted to be enclosed (Ref. 4Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S. Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Thus, it seems that the cooperative tubulin heterodimer-binding activity of Op18-like proteins inhibits GTP exchange at the exposed E-site by an allosteric effect. To address whether GTP is hydrolyzed at one or both of the E-sites of the two head-to-tail aligned tubulin heterodimers, we performed kinetic analysis of GTP/GDP conversion within the ternary complex. However, as indicated by data in Fig. 2, the rate of GTP hydrolysis in PEM buffer is too low relative to the half-life of the complex to obtain conclusive data by this approach. Therefore, nocodazole was employed to increase the rate of hydrolysis, because this drug has been reported to enhance both basal tubulin GTPase activity (22Mejillano M.R. Shivanna B.D. Himes R.H. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the GTPase activity stimulated by Op18 (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The addition of nocodazole results in a uniform ∼5-fold increase in the GTP hydrolysis rate of tubulin heterodimers in complex with Op18, SCG10, or RB3 (data not shown). Kinetic analysis of nocodazole enhanced [α-32P]GTP hydrolysis within ternary complexes generated using sRB3, which is the complex with the longest half-life of GTP exchange (see Fig.2C), suggesting that only about half of the tubulin-bound GTP is susceptible to hydrolysis (Fig.4A). Thus, in the presence of excess cold GTP, which restricts detection of hydrolysis to those complexes formed prior to the initiation of the time course, hydrolysis of labeled GTP approaches a plateau level at ∼507. This is below the level of hydrolysis observed under conditions allowing multiple rounds of [α-32P]GTP binding, i.e. in the absence of cold GTP. Interpretation of the experiment shown in Fig.4A is somewhat complicated by the fact that GTP/GDP ratios were determined in the total assay mix, and this includes [α-32P]GTP/GDP, which may dissociate from tubulin during the time-course. To ensure that only tubulin heterodimer-associated [α-32P]GTP/GDP was monitored, the experiment was repeated under conditions in which complexes of sRB3·tubulin heterodimers were isolated at each time point by passage over a desalting column prior to analysis. Using this stringent protocol, it is clear that hydrolysis approaches 507 both in the presence and absence of excess cold GTP (Fig. 4B), which indicates that GTP is only hydrolyzed at one of the two E-sites within the ternary complex. Moreover, this experiment allows an additional conclusion, namely that GTP exchange is efficiently blocked at both E-sites of the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex, even at 37 °C. Thus, preferential exchange with cold GTP at either of the two E-sites can be predicted to shift the observed plateau from 507 [α-32P]GTP, which is not observed. The extended helical region of Op18/stathmin family members is amphipathic, with conserved clusters of 3–4 hydrophobic residues phased to the same side of the helix (23Doye V. Soubrier F. Bauw G. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Koppel J. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12134-12137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are three of these hydrophobic “patches” located in repeat 1, as depicted in Fig.5A. These patches are well conserved among all Op18/stathmin family members, with few conservative substitutions. To determine whether hydrophobic patches 1–3 are important for specific tubulin heterodimer-directed activities, mutants with Ala substitutions of hydrophobic residues were prepared (designated Op18-pmut1–3; see Fig. 5A). By employing surface plasmon resonance, the effects of these mutations on the affinity for tubulin heterodimers was determined in PEM buffer in the absence of glycerol (Fig. 5B). The data show that mutations in patch 2 alone were without detectable effect, whereas mutations in patch 1 or 3 result in significantly decreased affinity. Moreover, combined mutations in patches 2 and 3 result in a substantial reduction in the affinity for tubulin heterodimers over and above that of mutations in patch 3 alone. The binding affinity of Op18 for tubulin heterodimers is strongly enhanced at pH values below the physiological range and shows an optimum at pH 6.5 (13Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25029-25036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To facilitate saturated tubulin binding of Op18-pmut derivatives with decreased binding affinity, tubulin GTPase and GTP exchange assays were performed at pH 6.5 and in the presence of 257 glycerol. Analysis of GTP exchange activity, presented in Fig.5C as the half-life of bound [α-32P]GTP, reveals various levels of decreased GTP exchange inhibitory activity. The observed differences could not be attributed to various degrees of saturation of tubulin binding, because each derivative was used at a sufficient concentration to reach a plateau level in GTP exchange inhibition (data not shown). Comparison with estimated binding affinities (Fig. 5B) shows an approximate correlation, which is consistent with the idea that the stability of the ternary complex is an important determinant of the magnitude of tubulin GTP exchange inhibition. Importantly, analysis of the initial rates of tubulin GTP hydrolysis stimulated by these mutants reveals that substitutions within patch 2 and patch 3 result in an increased hydrolysis rate, whereas mutations within patch 1 were without effect (Fig.5D). It is also noteworthy that combined Ala substitutions at patches 2 and 3 (i.e. Op18-pmut2/3) have an additive effect on the rate of hydrolysis. Thus, substitutions in these patches cause an increase in the conserved GTP hydrolysis rate within the tubulin heterodimer complex, and each one of the Op18-pmut derivatives shows a unique pattern of sub-phenotypes as regards the level of tubulin heterodimer-directed activities. Patches 2 and 3 of Op18 are both in contact with the औ-tubulin subunit containing the interfaced E-site of the two head-to-tail aligned tubulin heterodimers (see Fig. 5) (4Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S. Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M. Cell. 2000; 102: 809-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Muller D.R. Schindler P. Towbin H. Wirth U. Voshol H. Hoving S. Steinmetz M.O. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1927-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because mutations at these specific hydrophobic patches alter Op18-mediated stimulation of tubulin GTPase activity, the data are consistent with the idea that GTP hydrolysis occurs at the interfaced E-site as a result of interaction with the catalytic loop located on the neighboring α-tubulin subunit, as originally suggested by the structure of the complex (3Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Given that the rate of GTP hydrolysis is increased after substitutions of hydrophobic residues at patches 2 and 3, it appears that these patches are important in keeping the two heterodimers in a configuration that restrains the otherwise potent GTPase productive interactions that are facilitated by the head-to-tail arrangement of the heterodimers in protofilaments. Op18, RB3, and SCG10 are highly homologous proteins that generate similar ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complexes that differ greatly in their stability (20Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because excess cold GTP shows no effect on the rate or magnitude of [α-32P]GTP hydrolysis within the extraordinarily stable RB3·tubulin heterodimer complex (Fig. 4B), the present analysis indicates that exchange inhibition is essentially complete at both of the two E-sites within the complex. One of these E-sites is interfaced between the two head-to-tail-aligned tubulin heterodimers, and it can be envisioned that GTP at this interfaced E-site is well enclosed and protected from exchange (see model in Fig. 5A). However, the other E-site is completely exposed, and it follows that tubulin GTP exchange inhibition at this E-site must be explained by an allosteric effect. It is evident from the present analysis that differences in the stability of ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complexes are also manifested as major differences in the magnitude of GTP exchange inhibition at 37 °C (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, analysis of GTP exchange inhibition by Op18 derivatives with destabilizing Ala substitutions in hydrophobic patches also suggests that the stability of the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex is of primary importance for the potency of GTP exchange inhibition (Fig.5C). These findings suggest that complex dissociation is required for GTP exchange to occur. We have previously reported that GTP exchange inhibition by Op18 at 37 °C is partially dependent on the non-helical N-terminal region (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the present studies extend this finding to the sRB3 and sSCG10 proteins (Fig. 2, C andD). Binding analysis shows that the non-helical N-terminal region of Op18 contributes to the affinity of tubulin heterodimer binding (Fig. 3A), and it follows that the observed importance of this region for GTP exchange inhibition can readily be explained as an indirect consequence of increased complex stability. Consistent with this interpretation, it is clear from analysis of GTP exchange inhibition at 0 °C that the extended helix of Op18 is sufficient for optimal inhibition of GTP exchange at both sites of the complex (Fig. 3B). The present determination of the stoichiometry of GTP hydrolysis within the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex, combined with the phenotype of Ala substitutions at distinct hydrophobic clusters along the face of the extended helix of Op18, is most consistent with GTP hydrolysis occurring at the interfaced E-site only (see Fig.5A). The most likely mechanism involves interactions between the interfaced E-site and the catalytic loop located on the neighboring α-tubulin subunit, as originally suggested by the head-to-tail arrangement of heterodimers in the complex (3Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This simple model is also consistent with the finding that the rate of tubulin GTP hydrolysis within the complex is independent of the non-helical N-terminal region of Op18/stathmin family members (Fig. 2). It is notable that the conserved rate of GTP hydrolysis within a ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex is several orders of magnitude lower than during polymerization-facilitated interactions between the E-site and the catalytic loop of an adjacent heterodimer. This indicates that Op18/stathmin family members keep the two heterodimers in a configuration that restrains the otherwise potent GTPase productive interactions facilitated by the head-to-head alignment of heterodimers in protofilaments (10Nogales E. Whittaker M. Milligan R.A. Downing K.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified structural hydrophobic motifs that are at least in part responsible for restraining GTPase productive interactions, as evidenced by the observed phenotypes of Ala substitutions in the conserved hydrophobic patches 2 and 3 of Op18 (Fig. 5). It is of particular interest that substitutions at patch 2 resulted in increased GTP hydrolysis within the ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complex, with minimal effects on tubulin heterodimer binding affinity and GTP exchange inhibition. This indicates the specificity and importance of these hydrophobic patches for restraining GTPase productive interactions between the two head-to-tail-aligned tubulin heterodimers within the ternary complex. The present mutational analysis of conserved hydrophobic patches reveals a unique pattern of sub-phenotypes regarding the level of tubulin heterodimer binding, GTP exchange, and hydrolysis. Although there is a correlation between tubulin heterodimer binding affinity and GTP exchange inhibition, our data uncouple tubulin heterodimer binding affinities from the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. However, in order to generate GTPase productive ternary complexes, it is essential that binding should occur with sufficient positive cooperativity such that the formation of hydrolysis-incompetent binary complexes containing a single tubulin heterodimer would be minimized. In the absence of glycerol, the Op18-pmut1 derivative shows a positive binding cooperativity that is too low to efficiently form GTPase productive tandem tubulin heterodimer complexes (data not shown). This is also manifested as a low tubulin heterodimer binding affinity in the present plasmon resonance competition analysis, which was performed in a glycerol-free buffer (Fig. 5B). Consistent with decreased positive binding cooperativity under these conditions, Op18-pmut1 is inefficient in stimulating tubulin GTP hydrolysis if the assay is performed in the absence of glycerol (19Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the addition of glycerol to the buffer increases positive binding cooperativity (data not shown), and allows efficient generation of ternary tandem tubulin heterodimer complexes with normal levels of GTP hydrolysis (Fig.5D). This illustrates that glycerol, by altering cooperative tubulin heterodimer binding properties, may also alter specific phenotypes of mutant derivatives, which may in some cases confuse interpretation of in vitro results. In the present study, glycerol was included in the different assays to allow comparison of truncated/mutated derivatives with decreased tubulin heterodimer binding affinity, generating conditions in which binding approached saturation in all cases. It should be noted, however, that the Op18-pmut2 and 3 derivatives showed increased tubulin GTPase stimulatory activities both in the absence and presence of glycerol (data not show). Moreover, although decreased binding cooperativity may explain an apparent decrease in the stimulation of tubulin GTP hydrolysis as outlined above, the observed increase in stimulation of GTP hydrolysis caused by mutations of Op18 patches 2 and 3 cannot be explained by alterations in the level of binding cooperativity. That Op18 modulates the GTP exchange and hydrolysis properties of tubulin heterodimers has evoked speculation previously on the potential significance of these activities for the mechanism underlying catastrophe promotion (5Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Fridell K. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, catastrophe promotion, which requires the non-helical N-terminal region of Op18 (14Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Segerman B. Holmfeldt P. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), does not depend on the formation of GTPase productive/GTP exchange-inhibited ternary complexes. Hence, the present analysis, which was prompted by recent structural insights into the architecture of the ternary complex (3Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Gigant B. Curmi P.A. Martin-Barbey C. Charbaut E. Lachkar S. Lebeau L. Siavoshian S. Sobel A. Knossow M.
