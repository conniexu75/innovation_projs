https://openalex.org/W2042919721,"Analyses of atmospheric particles collected at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii from February 1979 through September 1982 reveal strong influxes of Asian dust in the spring of each year. Concentrations of a typical crustal element, aluminum, are more than an order of magnitude greater between February and June than during the remainder of the year (71 +/- 51 versus 6.7 +/- 2.3 nanograms per cubic meter). The mass of crustal material transported during the relatively short dust episodes accounts for an average of 80 percent of the total yearly mass of atmospheric particles at 3400 meters on Mauna Loa."
https://openalex.org/W1995902145,"Growing recognition that much of the evolutionary history of eukaryotic genomes reflects the operation of turnover processes involving repetitive DNA sequences has led to the recent formulation of models describing speciation as a consequence of such turnover. These models are of three general kinds: those attributing hybrid infertility to the process of transposition, those attributing hybrid infertility to mispairing between chromosomes of divergent repetitive DNA composition, and those assuming that change in repetitive DNA's can reset coordinated gene regulation. These models are discussed with respect to the kinds of evidence needed for their corroboration and to their significance for questions related to macroevolutionary punctuated equilibria and genetic revolutions."
https://openalex.org/W1982403216,"Loss of the genetic diversity of some of the world's crops has accelerated in recent decades, with many crops becoming increasingly susceptible to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. A global network of gene banks has therefore been established to provide plant breeders with the genetic resources necessary for developing more resistant crops that will enable farmers to maintain high yields. Most of these gene banks now store the germplasm of only the major crops such as cereals, potatoes, and grain legumes. Cultivated varieties of these crops are conserved as well as wild species that might otherwise become extinct. Tropical cash crops such as bananas and coconuts are also important food crops in many Third World countries, and more effort needs to be made to conserve the germplasm of these crops as well as of other important plants such as plantation crops, medicinal herbs, and fruit and timber trees."

https://openalex.org/W2033872281,"Ocean crust is the outermost layer of earth under the oceans. It is separated from the underlying mantle by a seismic transition zone called the Moho. A widely held view is that the Moho represents a petrologic change from basaltic-type rocks to a mantle composed mostly of olivine and pyroxene. According to this view, crust is formed by a steady segregation of basaltic melt, derived from partial melting of the mantle, into a crustal magma chamber wherein cooling and crystallization bring about steady-state accretion to the continuously spreading plates. There is sufficient disagreement between the predictions of this hypothesis and marine geophysical data to cause one to doubt the validity of this formation process. At least two other processes are more compatible with the geophysical data. In one, the crust is formed from the episodic injection of basaltic dikes from a mantle reservoir and the Moho is a primary petrologic boundary. In the other, the crust is treated as a mechanical boundary layer in which thermal contraction results in cracking; by comparison, in the mantle thermal contraction is accommodated by flow. The upper part of the crust is formed from episodic extrusion and intrusion of basaltic melt. The lower crust is formed by rapid hydrothermal alteration of mantle that may be continuously or episodically injected by viscous flow at temperatures below the melting temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2037323202,"The initial ratio of strontium-87 to strontium-86 rises systematically from 0.70395 to 0.70662 over the upper 10 percent of the Kiglapait layered intrusion. This ratio is strongly correlated with potassium and rubidium. Contamination, exchange, and magma mixing fail to account for the increase, which is ascribed to the imperfect retention of radiogenic strontium-87 in feldspar-like structural units of the melt inherited from the magma source. These accidents in chemical discrimination persist most readily in anhydrous melts."
https://openalex.org/W2088929478,"The single-crystal structure of Mn(CO)(3)(C(7)H(11)) is the first to be solved by direct methods based on time-of-flight neutron diffraction data obtained at the Argonne Intense Pulsed Neutron Source. The molecule contains an unusual three-center, two-electron manganese-hydrogen-carbon interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2003298789,"It has been suggested that enzymatic catalysis plays a major role in regulating the mass transport of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the oceans. Evidence for this mechanism was not found in a series of gas exchange experiments in which the gas transfer rate coefficients for samples obtained from various natural seawaters, with and without the addition of carbonic anhydrase, were compared with those from artificial seawater. Wind-induced turbulence appears to be the major factor controlling the ocean's response to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2011440639,"Saccharides with a molecular weight ranging from 182 to 50,000, which enter the cerebrospinal fluid at extremely slow rates when administered intravenously, all pass readily at similar rates from cerebrospinal fluid to blood after injection into a lateral cerebral ventricle. The mechanism of transfer appears to be a filtration of cerebrospinal fluid across a sieve-like boundary possibly located at the arachnoid villi."
https://openalex.org/W2054854007,"In the liver of the intact mouse, the conversion of exogenous folic acid to compounds with citrovorum-factor activity is inhibited completely by an amount of amethopterin similar to that bound to the enzyme folic acid reductase in vitro. Because this amount of amethopterin is several thousand times smaller than the LD(50), the toxic effects produced by the larger doses must be mediated via some additional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2068704057,A device for broadcasting electrical signals from the brain of an animal is described. It is small enough to be implanted under the animal's skin. That signals are broadcast without distortion is shown by the comparison of a broadcast recording of an electrocorticogram of a cat with a simultaneous recording made directly with wire leads.
