Patients given a course of electroconvulsive treatments for relief of depressive illness exhibited a temporal gradient of retrograde amnesia after five treatments. Memories acquired up to about 3 years before treatment were impaired, but memories acquired 4 to 17 yearss before treatment were not affected. The results suggest that the neural substrate of memory gradually changes with the passage of time after learning and that resistance to amnesic treatment can continue to develop for years."

https://openalex.org/W1963654127,Volatile organics from New Orleans drinking water and pooled plasma were collected on a solid phenyl ether polymer and analyzed by gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques. Thirteen halogenated hydrocarbons were identified in the drinking water. Five halogenated compounds were found in the plasma. Tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride were found in both the plasma and the drinking water. Considerable variation in the relative concentrations of the halogenated hydrocarbons was noted from day to day in the drinking water.

https://openalex.org/W2009311954,"INVESTIGATIONS have shown that senescence is accompanied by molecular changes in the structure of the eukaryotic genome. Some of these changes have been reported to result in the loss of some genetic material in the brain cells of ageing beagles1. Furthermore, the molecular weight of rat liver DNA decreases as a function of senescence2. If such changes occurred on a large scale, the resulting genetic damage could affect severely some of the crucial gene functions of an organism. We are studying the physical state of the DNA of senescing mice, and report here the accumulation of an increasing amount of single-stranded regions in the DNA with age."

https://openalex.org/W1981629432,"THE t complex of the mouse consists of a large series of genetic factors often characterised by embryonic lethality of the homozygotes, reduced male fertility of viable homozygotes, suppression of recombination over a relatively long chromosomal segment and relatively frequent occurrence in natural mouse populations. Most t factors also possess a component which interacts with the Brachyury (T) gene and causes complete absence of the tail in T/t heterozygotes. One of the most fascinating but least explored characteristics of the t factors is their effect on genetic segregation. A male mouse carrying a t factor in a heterozygous condition (t/−) often transmits the factor to almost 100% of its progeny, in defiance of the Mendelian principle requiring 1:1 segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2054046001,"IN tests of colour preference, rhesus monkeys have been found to have a strong aversion to light at the red end of the spectrum1,2. No comparable reaction to colours has been described in healthy human beings although in patients who are suffering from cerebellar or spinal disorders colours may assume a new potency. Thus it has been claimed that in cerebellar patients who exhibit the so-called ‘sensori-motor induction syndrome’, red light not only exacerbates the motor disorder but disrupts thought processes and leads to acute subjective distress, whereas blue-green light alleviates the symptoms3,4. Furthermore, Halpern and Feinmesser5 found that in such patients red light, besides causing discomfort in itself, increases the sensitivity to noxious auditory stimulation: in their experiments the ‘threshold of acoustic discomfort’ was consistently lowered when the patients wore red filters in front of their eyes. So we have investigated in monkeys whether the aversion to red light is increased when the preference tests are conducted in the presence of unpleasant background noise."

The dominance of the regressing phenotype is solely a function of a threshold dose of RFV. The minimum amount of RFV which induced regression of CFV leukemia is below the titer for induction of friend disease, but does correlate ith the titer of lymphocytic leukemia (helper) activity in the these stocks."
