https://openalex.org/W1538786835,"ATP citrate lyase has been purified from rat liver by a new procedure which results in high yields of an intact and stable enzyme. The pure lyase (specific activity approximately equal to 10 at 25 degrees C) exhibits a single protein band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis (Mr = 110,000). This procedure minimizes protease degradation that usually occurs when the enzyme is isolated by previously described isolation methods. In addition, the lyase is shown to be a phosphoprotein. 32P-labeled lyase has been purified from rat liver following an intraperitoneal injection of inorganic [32P]phosphate into the animals. It has been demonstrated that this phosphate (structural phosphate) behaves as a serine phosphate and is not the same as the enzyme-bound phosphate (catalytic phosphate) that is derived from ATP during the lyase reaction. There are 2 structural phosphate residues for each enzyme tetramer molecule. Removal of the structural phosphate has been accomplished using a partially purified phosphatase derived from rat liver. The dephospholyase has the same Vmax as the native phosphoenzyme. Evidence indicates that the structural phosphate resides in a protease-sensitive region of the native enzyme."

To obtain information about longer time processes, and to characterise more accurately the short time results, a 96-ps dynamical simulation of PTI at an average temperature of 306 K has been completed with the techniques used previously1; an extended equilibration period of 72 ps before simulation served to eliminate internal stresses. Analysis of the present simulation has confirmed most of the conclusions of the earlier study but has shown in addition that there are significant features of the dynamics that can be observed only over a longer period, âˆ¼100 ps."

https://openalex.org/W1549885152,"Bovine enterokinase was purified from duodenal mucosa. The purification included an initial extraction with 2% deoxycholate, ammonium sulfate fractionations, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and affinity chromatography on basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) (PTI)-Sepharose. The purified enzyme contained 35% carbohydrate; it had a molecular weight of 150,000, with a heavy (115,000) and light (35,000) chain connected by one or more disulfide bonds. Enterokinase hydrolyzed lysine and arginine substrates and slowly reacted with the trypsin active site titrant 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-guanidinobenzoate. The enzyme activated bovine trypsinogen with kinetic parameters similar to those of other preparations of enterokinase. Bovine enterokinase was inhibited by Kunitz pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with a Kassoc of 2 X 10(8) M-1 and only weakly by other proteinase inhibitors. The amino acid composition differed from bovine enterokinase isolated from duodenal contents (Anderson, L.E., Walsh, K.A., and Neurath, H. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 3354-3360). The mucosal enzyme and the duodenal contents enzymes also differed in the size of the heavy and light chains. The mucosal enterokinase more closely resembled the properties of porcine enterokinase (Baratti, J., Maroux, S., Louvard, D., and Desnuelle, P. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 315, 147-161). The amino acid composition and size of the light chain were also similar to bovine trypsin."

Complex I with higher buoyant density had 22% protein and 18% uronate, whereas Complex II had 11% protein and 23.6% uronate. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) analysis of the complexes indicated that both complexes contained large amounts of hyaluronic acid, 13.6% and 24.0% of the total GAG in Complexes I and II, respectively. Chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate constituted the remainder of the GAG. Chromatography on Sepharose CL 6B suggested that Complex I had an estimated molecular weight of 800,000 and Complex II, 250,000. The complexes were dissociated into proteoglycan and hyaluronate by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation under dissociative conditions. The proteoglycans free of hyaluronic obtained from the complexes had similar protein and GAG composition. The molecular weight of the proteoglycan was estimated to be 80,000 and that of the hyaluronate of the complex, 90,000."

https://openalex.org/W1568326379,"It has previously been shown that the glucocorticoid.receptor complex in the liver cytosol undergoes limited proteolysis when incubated with trypsin or the 1,000 to 10,000 x g sediment of liver homogenate. We now show that incubation of the largest form of the dexamethasone*receptor complex, the 6.1 nm complex, with an extract of purified lysosomes from rat liver results in the formation of two smaller glucocorticoid*receptor complexes with Stokes radii of 3.6 and 1.9 nm, respectively. No other intermediate forms of the steroid.receptor complex are found after incubation with the lysosomal extract. The 6.1 nm -+ 3.6 nm + 1.9 nm complex conversion is proportional to the amount of lysosomal extract added to the incubations and occurs at a higher rate when the incubation temperature is raised. The conversion is inhibited by the addition of gelatin to the incubations but does not appear to be inhibited by any of the specific cathepsin inhibitors antipain, leupeptin, or pepstatin or by pchloromercuribenzoate. It is suggested that lysosomal protease convert the glucocorticoid *receptor complex to smaller forms, one of which lacks the capacity to bind to DNA. This mechanism may be of importance for regulation of the number of glucocorticoid *receptor complexes that reach binding sites on the chromatin, or for inactivation and breakdown of the receptor, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1511273964,"The major high mannose-type glycopeptides present in Chinese hamster ovary cells have the compositions (Man)9(GlcNAc)2-Asn, (Man)8(GlcNAc)2-Asn, and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2-Asn. The structures of these glycopeptides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, Smith periodate degradation, and alpha- and beta-mannosidase digestion. Their complete structures are: manalpha1 leads to 2Manaalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc-Asn, Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc-Asn, and Manalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manalpha1 leads to 6(Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3)Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc-Asn. These structures are compared with the structures of the peptide-bound oligosaccharide intermediates that are processed to form complex-type oligosaccharides. From these results, it is proposed that the high mannose-type oligosaccharides are a product of incomplete processing of the protein-bound oligosaccharide along the same pathway which leads ultimately to the formation of a complex-type oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1592965617,"Two different allele-specific suppressor mutants of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe produce opal (UGA) suppressor tRNAs. This was shown by the use of a new in vitro assay for eukaryotic nonsense suppression: a wheat germ extract is programmed with rabbit globin mRNAs and the readthrough products are studied. alpha-Globin is elongated upon addition of ochre (UAA) suppressor tRNAs, whereas beta-globin yields a readthrough product with opal suppressor tRNAs. This simple and very sensitive assay allowed the purification of the opal suppressor tRNA from S. pombe strain sup3-e. The pure tRNA can be aminoacylated with serine; thus, we conclude that this suppressor tRNA inserts serine in response to the UGA termination codon of pure rabbit beta-globin mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1632722785,"Pyruvate carboxylases, purified to homogeneity from sheep and chicken liver, have been examined in the electron microscope and found to have a splayed tetrahedral structure which, in some views, appears similar to that described for this enzyme isolated from yeast. The square-planar tetrameric image previously ascribed to pyruvate carboxylases from vertebrate sources was shown to be that of a molecule which is not only larger than pyruvate carboxylase, but also devoid of biotin."

https://openalex.org/W1559025177,"Coenzyme A-dependent esterification of cholesterol was determined in intestinal mucosal homogenates prepared after duodenal perfusion of cholesterol-free lipid emulsions for 5 h in unanesthetized rats. Cholesterol esterification rates were lowest and the mucosal cholesterol pool was greatly reduced after the same lipid infusions that, in lymph fistula rats, had produced chylomicrons deficient in cholesterol esters. CoA-dependent esterification rates were sufficient to account for all the cholesterol esters secreted in mesenteric lymph chylomicrons. During triglyceride secretion by the gut, unesterified cholesterol for chylomicron membranes may be maintained both by suppressing mucosal CoA-dependent cholesterol ester formation and from a mobilizable unesterified cholesterol pool within the mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W1496442973,Two photoactivable derivatives of tetrodotoxin have been synthesized. Electrophysiological experiments on crab giant axons and competitive binding with [3H]-tetrodotoxin for the tetrodotoxin receptor indicate that they are only 4.5 to 7.5 times less active than tetrodotoxin itself. These compounds give a reversible block of the sodium channel in the dark but after ultraviolet irradiation they provoke an irreversible blockade of the channel.

https://openalex.org/W1513887160,"Uteroglobin is a protein secreted by the rabbit uterus in response to progesterone. In cell-free translation systems, the mRNA for uteroglobin codes for a protein larger in size than the secreted protein. To investigate the relationship between these two forms, the NH2-terminal sequences of pre-uteroglobin and of uteroglobin have been determined. Uteroglobin was purified from rabbit uterine flushings and pre-uteroglobin was obtained by immunoprecipitation of the products of translation of poly(A)-rich endometrial RNA in the wheat germ system in the presence of single or multiple radioactive amino acids. Sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation and the residue at each cycle was identified by chromatography. The larger size of pre-uteroglobin is accounted for by a 21-amino-acid leader sequence, containing 15 hydrophobic residues, at the NH2 terminus. The sequence Thr-Leu-Ala-Leu occurs twice in the leader region. In common with other secretory proteins, the transient hydrophobic extension at the NH2 terminus of pre-uteroglobin may function to assist transfer of the nascent peptide into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, as proposed in the signal hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1589430840,"Two water-soluble glycoasparagine storage products were isolated from the liver of a patient with inherited deficiency of lysosomal N-aspartyl-beta-glucosaminidase (aspartylglycosaminuria). The compounds were characterized using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of intact and specifically degraded derivatives. The storage compounds were identified as 2-acetamido-1-N-(4'-L-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine and alpha-D-mannopyranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-(1 leads to 4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 4)-2-acetamido-1-N-(4'-L-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine. Their amounts in the pathological liver were approximately 2.7 mg/g and 0.2 mg/g, wet weight, respectively. These glycoasparagines are structurally related to the inner core region of a number of different glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2095848376,"Total cytoplasmic RNA, isolated from bovine anterior pituitary glands, directed the synthesis of primarily two proteins in a wheat germ cell-free system. Analysis of wheat germ cell-free products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis, direct immunoprecipitation with prolactin aatibody, and prolactin- and growth hormone-specific radioimmunoassay indicated that the two proteins were pre-prolactin and pre-growth hormone. Agarose-urea-gel electrophoresis of poly(A)-containing RNA revealed the presence of a large symmetrical RNA peak with an estimated size of approximately 15 S. The RNA contained in this peak was eluted from the gel and translated in the wheat germ cell-free system. Analysis of the translation products by electrophoresis, direct immunoprecipitation, and radioimmunoassay resulted in the detection of only pre-prolactin. The extent of pre-prolactin mRNA purification was assessed by synthesizing DNA complementary to gel-purified pre-prolactin mRNA and then following the hybridization of this cDNA to gel purified pre-prolactin mRNA. The result of this hybridization is consistent with the cell-free translation studies, namely that pre-prolactin mRNA is the predominant mRNA component of pituitary poly(A)-containing RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1608662339,"Electron microscopic studies of chicken liver pyruvate carboxylase conducted under a variety of conditions show that this enzyme has an overall rhombic appearance and is comprised of four nonspherical subunits. The square planar tetramers originally identified by Valentine et al. (Valentine, R.C., Wrigley, N.G., Scrutton, M.C., Irias, J.J., and Utter, M.F. (1966) Biochemistry 5, 3111-3116) as pyruvate carboxylase have been shown to represent a minor protein contaminant found in many impure preparations of this enzyme. The contaminating protein has been separated from pyruvate carboxylase and further purified. It does not contain biotin and its constituent polypeptides are smaller than those of pyruvate carboxylase. This protein, whose function is not yet identified, shows a strong tendency to aggregate and is highly visible under many conditions of electron microscopy. Several lines of evidence support the thesis that the nonsquare tetramers are pyruvate carboxylase. When essentially homogeneous material is examined with a variety of different negative stains, numbers of intact molecules represent 20 to 70% of the visible protein. These tetramers, like pyruvate carboxylase, are very cold-labile and are protected from dissociation under these conditions by acetyl-CoA, a specific activator of this enzyme. Also, the structures form complexes with avidin and antibiotin antibody and thus, like pyruvate carboxylase, contain biotin."

All other amino acid derivatives form at a slower rate initially or continuously. The enzyme is protected against inactivation by iodoacetamide through NADH binding, suggesting that there is an essential histidine residue at or near the active site."
