https://openalex.org/W2030174121,"Values for the precession and obliquity of the earth 9000 years ago indicate that the global average solar radiation for July 9000 years ago was 7 percent greater than at present. When the estimated solar radiation values are used in a low-resolution climate model, the model simulates an intensified continent-scale monsoon circulation. This result agrees with paleoclimatic evidence from Africa, Arabia, and India that monsoon rains were stronger between 10,000 and 5000 years ago than they are today."
https://openalex.org/W2083841543,"Diamond occurs in ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks from Dabie Shan, Anhui Province, eastern China. Diamond-bearing rocks include eclogite, gamet-pyroxenite, and jadeitite. Diamond occurs in a mineral assemblage with coesite and jadeite. The diamonds and diamondiferous rocks of Dabie Shan are interpreted to be the products of ultrahigh pressure metamorphism in the underthrust basement of the Yangtze continental plate during the early Mesozoic, at greater than 4.0 gigapascals and 900°C. This interpretation is based on the distribution of rock units, the stability field of diamond, and isotopic data indicating a crustal origin for the rocks. Most diamonds occur as euhedral inclusions in garnets and are 10 to 60 micrometers across, although some are up to 700 micrometers across."
https://openalex.org/W2031815256,"In severely polluted areas, such as locally in Montshegorsk in northwestern Russia, all trees have died. However, measurements from Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland show a general increase of forest resources. The fertilization effects of pollutants override the adverse effects at least for the time being. Biomass was built up in the 1970s and 1980s in European forests. If there has been similar development in other continents, biomass accumulation in nontropical forests can account for a large proportion of the estimated mismatch between sinks and sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide."

Large birds, especially males with large beaks, survived best because they were able to crack the large and hard seeds that predominated in the drought. Selection intensities, calculated by O'Donald's method, are the highest yet recorded for a vertebrate population."
https://openalex.org/W2058433393,"The delta(13)C value of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean has decreased by about 0.4 per mil between 1970 and 1990. This decrease has resulted from the uptake of atmospheric CO(2) derived from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. The net amounts of CO(2) taken up by the oceans and released from the biosphere between 1970 and 1990 have been determined from the changes in three measured values: the concentration of atmospheric CO(2), the delta(13)C of atmospheric CO(2) and the delta(13)C value of dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean. The calculated average net oceanic CO(2) uptake is 2.1 gigatons of carbon per year. This amount implies that the ocean is the dominant net sink for anthropogenically produced CO(2) and that there has been no significant net CO(2) released from the biosphere during the last 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W2076906367,"Optical microcavities are resonators that have at least one dimension on the order of a single optical wavelength. These structures enable one to control the optical emission properties of materials placed inside them. They can, for example, modify the spatial distribution of radiation power, change the spectral width of the emitted light, and enhance or suppress the spontaneous emission rate. In addition to being attractive for studying the fundamental physics of the interaction between materials and vacuum field fluctuations, optical microcavities hold technological promise for constructing novel kinds of light-emitting devices. One of their most dramatic potential features is thresholdless lasing. In this way and others, controlled spontaneous emission is expected to play a key role in a new generation of optical devices."
https://openalex.org/W2080888474,Ocean-floor spreading tore southern Baja California from mainland Mexico 4 million years ago and has subsequently rafted it 260 kilometers to the northwest along the Tamayo Fracture Zone. Magnetic-anomaly profiles indicate spreading at the mouth of the gulf at 3.0 centimeters per year and a rise-crest offset of 75 kilometers inside the gulf across the Tamayo Fracture Zone.
https://openalex.org/W1991228902,"Profiles of stratospheric ozone and chlorine monoxide radical (ClO) have been obtained from balloon measurements of atmospheric limb thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths. The ClO measurements, important for assessing the predicted depletion of stratospheric ozone by chlorine from industrial sources, are in close agreement with present theory, The predicted decrease of ClO at sunset was measured. A tentative value for the stratospheric abundance of hydrogen peroxide was also determined."

https://openalex.org/W2054313177,Radio spectral line emission from hydroxyl radicals has been detected from four infrared stars. The emission from the infrared star NML Cygni at 1612 megahertz is the strongest radio emission line yet detected. Sixteen other stars with infrared excesses showed no detectable hydroxyl radio emission.

https://openalex.org/W1994040600,"Convergence across the San Andreas fault (SAF) system is partitioned between strike-slip motion on the vertical SAF and oblique-slip motion on parallel dip-slip faults, as illustrated by the recent magnitude M(s) = 6.0 Palm Springs, M(s) = 6.7 Coalinga, and M(s) = 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquakes. If the partitioning of slip minimizes the work done against friction, the direction of slip during these recent earthquakes depends primarily on fault dip and indicates that the normal stress coefficient and frictional coefficient (micro) vary among the faults. Additionally, accounting for the active dip-slip faults reduces estimates of fault slip rates along the vertical trace of the SAF by about 50 percent in the Loma Prieta and 100 percent in the North Palm Springs segments."

https://openalex.org/W2118093316,"An unusual new silicate, krinovite, has been discovered within graphite nodules in three iron meteorites. Its ratio of silicon to oxygen of 3 : 10 suggests a rare kind of silicate polymerization. The meteorite nodules in which it occurs exhibit a chemical fractionation that differs from that of both stone meteorites and terrestrial basalt."
https://openalex.org/W2039400630,"Lower Eocene flowers with Pistillipollenites macgregorii pollen represent the earliest megafossil evidence of the Gentianaceae. The Paleocene occurrence of P. macgregorii, the fossil's modern floral structure, and suggested trends in the evolution of pollen in the Gentianaceae indicate a considerably earlier origin for the family. Floral morphology typical of bee-pollinated flowers provides the earliest, albeit indirect, fossil evidence of bees."

https://openalex.org/W1980447303,"The fugitive carbon is the difference between the 7 billion or so tons that spew as carbon dioxide from smokestacks and burning tropical forests and the 3.4 billion tons known to stay in the atmosphere. Finding the other 3 billion or 4 billion tons has frustrated researchers for the past 15 years. The oceans certainly take up some of it. Any forecast of global warming has to be based on how much of the carbon dioxide released by human activity will remain in the atmosphere, and predictions vary by 30% depending on the mix of oceanic and terrestrial processes assumed to be removing the gas. What's more, those predictions assume that the processes at work today will go on operating. But not knowing where all the carbon is going raises the unnerving possibility that whatever processes are removing it may soon fall down on the job without warning, accelerating any warming. Such concerns add urgency to the question of whether the ocean harbors the missing carbon. But there's no simple way to find out. The obvious strategy might seem to be to measure the carbon content of the ocean repeatedly to see how much it increases year by year. Themore » trouble is that several billion tons of added carbon, though impressive on a human scale, are undetectable against the huge swings in ocean carbon that occur from season to season, year to year, and place to place.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1998828864,"Three nodules from a core taken north of Puerto Rico are composed chiefly of an x-ray amorphous, hydrated, iron-manganese oxide, with secondary goethite, and minor detrital silicates incorporated during growth of the nodules. No primary manganese mineral is apparent. The nodules are enriched in iron and depleted in manganese relative to Atlantic Ocean averages. The formation of these nodules appears to have been contemporary with sedimentation and related to volcanic activity."
