https://openalex.org/W2073795835,"Neural progenitor cells were encapsulated in vitro within a three-dimensional network of nanofibers formed by self-assembly of peptide amphiphile molecules. The self-assembly is triggered by mixing cell suspensions in media with dilute aqueous solutions of the molecules, and cells survive the growth of the nanofibers around them. These nanofibers were designed to present to cells the neurite-promoting laminin epitope IKVAV at nearly van der Waals density. Relative to laminin or soluble peptide, the artificial nanofiber scaffold induced very rapid differentiation of cells into neurons, while discouraging the development of astrocytes. This rapid selective differentiation is linked to the amplification of bioactive epitope presentation to cells by the nanofibers."
https://openalex.org/W2081546967,"Ferroelectric oxide materials have offered a tantalizing potential for applications since the discovery of ferroelectric perovskites more than 50 years ago. Their switchable electric polarization is ideal for use in devices for memory storage and integrated microelectronics, but progress has long been hampered by difficulties in materials processing. Recent breakthroughs in the synthesis of complex oxides have brought the field to an entirely new level, in which complex artificial oxide structures can be realized with an atomic-level precision comparable to that well known for semiconductor heterostructures. Not only can the necessary high-quality ferroelectric films now be grown for new device capabilities, but ferroelectrics can be combined with other functional oxides, such as high-temperature superconductors and magnetic oxides, to create multifunctional materials and devices. Moreover, the shrinking of the relevant lengths to the nanoscale produces new physical phenomena. Real-space characterization and manipulation of the structure and properties at atomic scales involves new kinds of local probes and a key role for first-principles theory."
https://openalex.org/W2135859072,"What are the components that control the assembly of subcellular organelles in eukaryotic cells? Although membranes can clearly be distorted by cytosolic factors, very little is known about the intrinsic mechanisms that control the biogenesis, shape, and organization of organellar membranes. Here, we found that the unconventional phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) could induce the formation of multivesicular liposomes that resembled the multivesicular endosomes that exist where this lipid is found in vivo. This process depended on the same pH gradient that exists across endosome membranes in vivo and was selectively controlled by Alix. In turn, Alix regulated the organization of LBPA-containing endosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2042661483,"Mammalian sex chromosomes have undergone profound changes since evolving from ancestral autosomes. By examining retroposed genes in the human and mouse genomes, we demonstrate that, during evolution, the mammalian X chromosome has generated and recruited a disproportionately high number of functional retroposed genes, whereas the autosomes experienced lower gene turnover. Most autosomal copies originating from X-linked genes exhibited testis-biased expression. Such export is incompatible with mutational bias and is likely driven by natural selection to attain male germline function. However, the excess recruitment is consistent with a combination of both natural selection and mutational bias."
https://openalex.org/W1989700145,"We employed a genetic approach to determine whether deficiency of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and deficiency of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) produce the same alterations in skeletal and calcium homeostasis and whether calcium can subserve the skeletal functions of 1,25(OH)2D and the VDR. Mice with targeted deletion of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (1α(OH)ase-/-) gene, the VDR gene, and both genes were exposed to 1) a high calcium intake, which maintained fertility but left mice hypocalcemic; 2) this intake plus three times weekly injections of 1,25(OH)2D3, which normalized calcium in the 1α(OH)ase-/- mice only; or 3) a “rescue” diet, which normalized calcium in all mutants. These regimens induced different phenotypic changes, thereby disclosing selective modulation by calcium and the vitamin D system. Parathyroid gland size and the development of the cartilaginous growth plate were each regulated by calcium and by 1,25(OH)2D3 but independent of the VDR. Parathyroid hormone secretion and mineralization of bone reflected ambient calcium levels rather than the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system. In contrast, increased calcium absorption and optimal osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis were modulated by the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system. These studies indicate that the calcium ion and the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system exert discrete effects on skeletal and calcium homeostasis, which may occur coordinately or independently.

Vitamin D plays a major role in modulating calcium and skeletal homeostasis and exerts a significant influence on the growth and differentiation of a variety of tissues (1Bouillon R. Okamura W.H.

The enzyme catalyzing the production of 1,25(OH)2D is 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase (1α(OH)ase or CYP27B1). Both the cDNA and gene encoding this mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme have been cloned from several species (6Takeyama K. Kitanaka S. Sato T. Kobori M. Yanagisawa J. Kato S.

The renal 1α(OH)ase is known to be tightly regulated by several factors including parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25(OH)2D per se (1Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 3Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 777-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). An alternate site of hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D can be catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24(OH)ase or CYP24), yielding the metabolite 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (13St-Arnaud R. Arabian A. Travers R. Barletta F. Raval-Pandya M. Chapin K. Depovere J. Mathieu C. Christakos S. Demay M.B. Glorieux F.H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2658-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In target tissues, 1,25(OH)2D is believed to exert most of its actions by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and by regulating the transcription of vitamin D target genes (14Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, nongenomic effects of 1,25(OH)2D have been reported in which 1,25(OH)2D interacts with a putative membrane receptor, mediating the opening of calcium and chloride voltage-gated channels and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Norman A.W. Okamura W.H. Bishop J.E. Henry H.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We (16Panda D.K. Miao D. Tremblay M.L. Sirois J. Farookhi R. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7498-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and others (17Dardenne O. Prud'homme J. Arabian A. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3135-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) have previously reported a mouse model deficient in 1,25(OH)2D by targeted ablation of the 1α(OH)ase gene (1α(OH)ase-/-). After weaning, mice, fed a diet of regular mouse chow, developed hyperparathyroidism, retarded growth, and the skeletal abnormalities characteristic of rickets. These abnormalities mimic those described in the human genetic disorder vitamin D-dependent rickets type I (also called pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets) (18Fraser D. Kooh S.W. Kind H.P.

Biol. 1986; 196: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have also reported mouse models with targeted ablation of the VDR gene (VDR-/-) (20Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 21Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S.

These animals develop manifestations similar to those with 1α(OH)ase ablation but also display alopecia. This constellation of abnormalities is observed in humans with VDR mutations in the inherited disorder vitamin D-dependent rickets type II (also called hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets) (23Beer S. Tieder M. Kohelet D. Liberman O.A. Vure E. Bar-Joseph G. Gabizon D. Borochowitz Z.U. Varon M. Modai D. Clin. Endocrinol. 1981; 14: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rescue of this phenotype has been successfully accomplished with a high calcium, high phosphorus, high lactose diet administered for at least 1 month after weaning (22Erben R.G. Soegiarto D.W. Weber K. Zeitz U. Lieberherr M. Gniadecki R. Moller G. Adamski J. Balling R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Donohue M.M. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3691-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been postulated that the major action of the VDR in skeletal growth, maturation, and remodeling is its role in intestinal calcium absorption (25Amling M. Priemel M. Holzmann T. Chapin K. Rueger J.M. Baron R. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If 1,25(OH)2D and VDR are both necessary and sufficient for the vitamin D endocrine system, then mutant animals deficient in either 1,25(OH)2D or VDR (1α(OH)ase-/- and VDR-/-, respectively) and the mutant animals deficient in both ligand and receptor (1α(OH)ase-/-VDR-/-) should exhibit the same phenotypic alternations in mineral and skeletal homeostasis and should respond in the same way to alterations in dietary calcium. Furthermore, if the major role of the VDR in skeletal function is to increase extracellular fluid calcium by increasing intestinal absorption, as has been postulated (26Li Y.C. Amling M. Pirro A.E. Priemel M. Meuse J. Baron R. Delling G. Demay M.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then the three mutant animals should also exhibit similar skeletal phenotypic changes as the serum calcium is altered. To test these hypotheses, we mated heterozygous animals with deletion of the 1α(OH)ase and the VDR and compared siblings that were homozygous for deletion of the genes encoding 1α(OH)ase, VDR, and both genes. The use of the double mutants permitted us to explore whether the elevated endogenous 1,25(OH)2D levels seen in VDR-/- mice might play a role in defining the phenotypes observed. We exposed these mutants to environmental conditions that would alter concentrations of the calcium ion or of the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand. The results demonstrate significant phenotypic differences that suggest discrete roles for the calcium ion and components of the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR endocrine system in modulating mineral and skeletal homeostasis. Derivation of 1α(OH)ase and VDR Double Null Mice—The derivation of the two parental strains of 1α(OH)ase-/- mice and VDR-/- mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells was previously described by Panda et al. (16Panda D.K. Miao D. Tremblay M.L. Sirois J. Farookhi R. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7498-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (20Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), respectively. VDR-/- mice were a generous gift of Dr. Marie Demay (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Briefly, a neomycin resistance gene was inserted in place of exons VI, VII, and VIII of the mouse 1α(OH)ase gene, replacing both the ligand binding and heme binding domains. RT-PCR of renal RNA from homozygous 1α(OH)ase-/- mice confirmed that no 1α(OH)ase mRNA is expressed from this allele (16Panda D.K. Miao D. Tremblay M.L. Sirois J. Farookhi R. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7498-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A neomycin resistance gene was inserted in place of exon III of the mouse VDR gene, replacing the second zinc finger of the DNA binding domain. RT-PCR of intestinal and renal RNA from homozygous VDR-/- mice confirmed that a truncated mRNA is expressed from this allele (20Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Mice heterozygous for the null 1α(OH)ase allele and mice heterozygous for the VDR allele were fertile (16Panda D.K. Miao D. Tremblay M.L. Sirois J. Farookhi R. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7498-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 20Li Y.C. Pirro A.E. Amling M. Delling G. Baron R. Bronson R. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9831-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). VDR+/- mice were mated with 1α(OH)ase+/- mice, and offspring heterozygous at both loci were then mated to one another to generate pups homozygous for both 1α(OH)ase and VDR null alleles [1α(OH)ase-/-VDR-/-]. Lines were maintained by mating 1α(OH)ase-/-VDR-/- males and 1α(OH)ase+/-VDR+/- females. These mice were maintained on a mixed genetic background with contributions from C57BL/6J and BALB/c strains. To enhance fertility of females, all breeders were maintained on a high calcium diet containing 1.5% calcium in the drinking water and autoclaved chow containing 1% calcium, 0.85% phosphorus, 0% lactose and 2.2 units/g vitamin D (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO). In Vivo Experiments—All animal experiments were carried out in compliance with and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mutant mice and control littermates were maintained in a virus- and parasite-free barrier facility and exposed to a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle. At 21 days of age, wild-type (WT) and mutant mice were weaned onto one of three different regimens and maintained on these until sacrifice at 4 months of age: 1) the high-calcium diet described above; 2) this same high-calcium diet plus three times weekly intraperitoneal injections of 1,25(OH)2D3, 0.0625 μg per mouse (27Vegesna V. O'Kelly J. Uskokovic M. Said J. Lemp N. Saitoh T. Ikezoe T. Binderup L. Koeffler H.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4389-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); or 3) a “rescue diet” (TD96348 Teklad, Madison, WI) of γ-irradiated chow containing 2% calcium, 1.25% phosphorus, 20% lactose, and 2.2 units/g vitamin D. Genotyping of Mice—Genomic DNA was isolated from tail fragments by standard phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation (16Panda D.K. Miao D. Tremblay M.L. Sirois J. Farookhi R. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7498-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To determine the genotype at both the 1α(OH)ase and VDR loci, four PCRs were conducted for each animal. To test for the presence of the wild-type 1α(OH)ase allele, DNA was amplified with forward primer 5′-AGACTGCACTCCACTCTGAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTTTCCTACACGGATGTCTC-3′. For the neomycin gene, the primers were neo-F 5′-ACAACAGACAATCGGCTGCTC-3′ and neo-R 5′-CCATGGGTCACGACGAGATC-3′. The wild type VDR allele was detected using forward primer 5′-CTGCCCTGCTCCACAGTCCTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGAGACTCTCCAATGTGAAGC-3′. The disrupted VDR allele was assayed using the neo forward primer 5′-GCTGCTCTGATGCCGCCGTGTTC-3′ and a neo reverse primer 5′-GCACTTCGCCCAATAGCAGCCAG-3′. PCR conditions were 30 cycles for all: 1α(OH)ase allele, 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; VDR and disrupted VDR allele, 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and neomycin, 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from mouse kidney and long bones, using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The forward and the reverse primers used for amplification of the mouse 1α(OH)ase mRNA were 5′-GCAGAGGCTCCGAAGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-TGTCTGGGACACGGGAATTC-3′, and primers for 24(OH)ase mRNA were 5′-ACCGTGGACAGAACGCAATGG-3′ and 5′-AAATCCAGAGCGTGCTGCCTG-3′. The forward and reverse primers for core binding factor a I (Cbfa I) mRNA were 5′-GTGACACCGTGTCAGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCACAGGAAGTTGGGAC-3′. For receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA, the forward and the reverse primers were 5′-CACACCTCACCATCAATGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGGGTTGGACACCTGAATGC-3′. The forward and the reverse primers for GAPDH used as a loading control were 5′-CATGGAGAAGGCTGGGGCTC-3′ and 5′-CACTGACACGTTGGCAGTGG-3′. The conditions for 32 cycles of PCRs were 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Biochemical and Hormone Analyses—Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase were determined by an autoanalyzer (Beckman Synchron 67; Beckman Instruments). Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 was measured by radioimmunoassay (ImmunoDiagnostic Systems, Bolden, UK), and intact PTH was measured by a two-site immunoradiometric assay (Immunotopics, San Clemente, CA). Skeletal Radiography—Femurs were removed and dissected free of soft tissue. Contact radiographs were taken using a Faxitron model 805 (Faxitron Contact, Faxitron, Germany) radiographic inspection system (22-kV voltage and 4-min exposure time). Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat TL film was used and processed routinely. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted from long bones and quantitated by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (30 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against Runx2/Cbfa I (MBL International, Woburn, MA) and tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Histology—Thyroparathyroidal tissue, femurs, and tibiae were removed and fixed in PLP fixative (2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.075 m lysine and 0.01 m sodium periodate) overnight at 4 °C and processed histologically as previously described (28Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The proximal ends of the tibiae were decalcified in EDTA glycerol solution for 5-7 days at 4 °C. Decalcified tibiae and other tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, after which 5-μm sections were cut on a rotary microtome. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or histochemically for collagen, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity as described below. Alternatively, undecalcified tibiae were embedded in LR White acrylic resin (London Resin Company Ltd., London, UK) and 1-μm sections were cut on an ultramicrotome. These sections were stained for mineral with the von Kossa staining procedure and counterstained with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemical Staining for Aggrecan and RANKL—The cartilage matrix protein, aggrecan, and the transcription factor, RANKL, were determined by immunohistochemistry as described previously (28Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, rabbit antiserum to bovine aggrecan (R130; courtesy of Dr. A. R. Poole, Shriners Hospital, Montreal, Canada) or affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of RANKL (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were applied to dewaxed paraffin sections overnight at room temperature. As a negative control, the preimmune serum was substituted for the primary antibody. After washing with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 10 min at room temperature followed by two 10-min washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG or biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG; Sigma), washed as before, and processed using the Vectastain ABC-AP kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Red pigmentation to demarcate regions of immunostaining was produced by a 10-15-min treatment with Fast Red TR/Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma; containing 1 mm levamisole as endogenous alkaline phosphatase inhibitor). The sections were then washed with distilled water, counterstained with methyl green, and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Histochemical Staining for Collagen, ALP, and TRAP—Total collagen was detected in paraffin sections using a modified method of Lopez-De Leon and Rojkind (29Lopez-De Leon A. Rojkind M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Dewaxed sections were exposed to 1% sirius red in saturated picric acid for 1 h. After washing with distilled water, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Biomount medium. Enzyme histochemistry for ALP activity was performed as previously described (30Miao D. Scutt A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31He B.

Briefly, following preincubation overnight in 1% magnesium chloride in 100 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 9.2), dewaxed sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a 100 mm Tris-maleate buffer containing naphthol AS-MX phosphate (0.2 mg/ml; Sigma) dissolved in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Sigma) as substrate and fast red TR (0.4 mg/ml; Sigma) as a stain for the reaction product. After washing with distilled water, the sections were counterstained with Vector methyl green nuclear counterstain (Vector Laboratories) and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Enzyme histochemistry for TRAP was performed using a modification of a previously described protocol (32Miao D. Scutt A. BMC Musculoskelet. Disord. 2002; 3: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dewaxed sections were preincubated for 20 min in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate and 40 mm sodium tartrate at pH 5.0. Sections were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the same buffer containing 2.5 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) in dimethylformamide as substrate and 0.5 mg/ml fast garnet GBC (Sigma) as a color indicator for the reaction product. After washing with distilled water, the sections were counterstained with methyl green and mounted in Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Double Calcein Labeling—Double calcein labeling was performed by intraperitoneal injection of mice with 10 μg of calcein/g of body weight (C-0875; Sigma) at 10 days and 3 days prior to sacrifice. Bones were harvested and embedded in LR White acrylic resin described as above. Serial sections were cut, and the freshly cut surface of each section was viewed and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. The double calceinlabeled width of cortex and trabeculae was measured using Northern Eclipse image analysis software version 6.0 (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Canada), and the mineral apposition rate was calculated as the interlabel width/labeling period. Computer-assisted Image Analysis—After hematoxylin and eosin staining or histochemical staining of sections from six mice of each genotype on each dietary regimen, images of fields were photographed with a Sony digital camera. Images of micrographs from single sections were digitally recorded using a rectangular template, and recordings were processed using Northern Eclipse image analysis software (28Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Miao D. He B. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To measure the size of the parathyroid glands, the border of the glands were traced on micrographs of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections and traced areas of parathyroid glands were recorded automatically by Northern Eclipse image analysis software. For measuring the width of growth plates of tibiae, the distances between the proximal (epiphyseal) and distal (metaphyseal) sides of the growth plate were traced on micrographs of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, and traced distances were recoded automatically by Northern Eclipse image analysis software. For determining the trabecular bone volume relative to the total volume (BV/TV) in collagen-stained sections, the osteoid volume relative to the bone volume (OV/BV) in von Kossa-stained sections, ALP-positive area and intensity (summary total gray) in ALP histochemical-stained sections, and the number and size of osteoclasts in TRAP histochemical-stained sections, thresholds were set using green and red channels. The thresholds were determined as described previously (28Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M. Karaplis A. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The trabecular volume was measured in the metaphyseal region from 0.5 mm below the distal (metaphyseal) side of the growth plate to 1.5 mm toward the diaphysis, and ALP and TRAP parameters were measured in the fields of metaphyseal regions. Bone Marrow Cell Cultures—Primary bone marrow cell cultures were performed as previously described (34Bai X. Miao D. Panda D. Grady S. McKee M.D. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2913-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Tibiae and femurs of 4-month-old mice fed a rescue diet were removed under aseptic conditions, and bone marrow cells were flushed out with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10-8m dexamethasone. Cells were dispersed by repeated pipetting, and a single cell suspension was achieved by forcefully expelling the cells through a 22-gauge syringe needle. 106 bone marrow cells were cultured in 55-cm2 Petri dishes in 10 ml of the above mentioned medium. The medium was changed every 4 days. The nonadherent cells containing hematopoietic elements were removed by gently pipetting when the medium was changed for the first time. Cultures were maintained for 18 days. At the end of the culture period, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with PLP fixative, and then stained. For determination of total colonies formed, cells were first washed in borate buffer (10 mm; pH 8.8) and then stained with 1% methylene blue (w/v) in borate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times in borate buffer alone and left to dry before the number of colonies was quantitated by image analysis as described. For determination of mineralized colonies, cells were exposed to a solution of Alizarin Red S, pH 6.2 (1 mg/ml), for 30 min at room temperature, after which the colonies were gently washed under running water and left to dry. After each staining, culture plates were photographed over a light box with a Sony chargecoupled device camera. Images were analyzed using Northern Eclipse image analysis software. The data were imported to a spreadsheet program and processed as previously described (34Bai X. Miao D. Panda D. Grady S. McKee M.D. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2913-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data from image analysis are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-way analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 being considered significant. Genotypic Selection of Mutant Mice—Representative PCR profiles used for genotyping the mutant mice are shown in Fig. 1a. The neomycin cassette replaced the second zinc finger of the DNA binding domain of the VDR (upper panel) and replaced both the substrate binding and heme binding domains of the 1α(OH)ase enzyme (lower panel) in the VDR-/- and 1α(OH)ase-/- mice, respectively. Expression of 1α(OH)ase and 24(OH)ase Genes—The 1α(OH)ase gene was expressed at higher levels in the VDR-/- mice than in wild-type mice when animals received a high calcium intake (Fig. 1b, left panel); this was not reduced by administering exogenous 1,25(OH)2D3 to these animals (Fig. 1b, right panel) but was reduced by eliminating hypocalcemia with the rescue diet (Fig. 1b, middle panel). Expression of the 24(OH)ase gene was r"

Phosphorylation of the activating protein 1 (AP1) transcription factor c-Jun, at multiple sites within its transactivation domain, is required for JNK-induced neurotoxicity. We report that in neurons the stability of c-Jun is regulated by the E3 ligase SCF(Fbw7), which ubiquitinates phosphorylated c-Jun and facilitates c-Jun degradation. Fbw7 depletion resulted in accumulation of phosphorylated c-Jun, stimulation of AP1 activity, and neuronal apoptosis. SCF(Fbw7) therefore antagonizes the apoptotic c-Jun-dependent effector arm of JNK signaling, allowing neurons to tolerate potentially neurotoxic JNK activity."
https://openalex.org/W1975035065,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, environmental stress conditions that damage the cell wall lead to activation of the so-called “compensatory mechanism,” aimed at preserving cell integrity through a remodeling of this extracellular matrix. Here we used DNA microarrays to investigate the molecular basis of this response to two agents that induce transient cell wall damage; namely Congo Red and Zymolyase. Treatment of the cells with these two agents elicited the up-regulation of 132 and 101 genes respectively, the main functional groups among them being involved in cell wall construction and metabolism. The main response does not occur until hours after exposure to the cell wall-perturbing agent. In some cases, this response was transient, but more sustained in others, especially in the case of the genes involved in cell wall remodeling. Clustering of these data together with those from the response to constitutive cell wall damage, revealed the existence of a cluster of co-regulated genes that was strongly induced under all conditions assayed. Those genes induced by cell wall damage showed an enrichment in DNA binding motifs for Rlm1p, Crz1p, SBF (Swi4p/Swi6p), Msn2p/Msn4p, Ste12p, and Tec1p transcription factors, suggesting a complex regulation of this response together with the possible involvement of several signaling pathways. With the exception of PHO89 and FKS2, none of the genes induced by Congo Red was up-regulated in a slt2 strain. Moreover, characterization of the transcriptional response to Congo Red in a rlm1 mutant strain revealed that only a few genes (i.e. PHO89, FKS2, YLR042C, and CHA1) were induced at least partially independently of the transcription factor Rlm1p, the rest being totally dependent on this transcription factor for their activation.

The cell wall is an external envelope that surrounds yeast cells. This structure is essential for maintaining cell morphology and to protect cells from the external environment by preserving their osmotic integrity. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell wall is composed primarily of β-1,3 glucan, β-1,6 glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins (1Lipke P.N. Ovalle R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Molina M. Gil C. Pla J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Microsc. Res.

These components are linked to each other as macromolecular complexes in which β-1,6 glucan acts as a cross-linker, being attached to the major components, β-1,3 glucan and mannoproteins, and occasionally to chitin (4Kapteyn J.C. Van Den E.H. Klis F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 5Kollar R. Reinhold B.B. Petrakova E. Yeh H.J. Ashwell G. Drgonova J. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Cabib E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17762-17775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). β-1,3 glucan is covalently linked to chitin to make up the inner cell wall, which is the main element responsible for the mechanical strength of this structure. Mannoproteins form the outer cell wall layer. Two main classes of proteins are coupled covalently to cell wall polysaccharides: GPI-dependent cell wall proteins (GPI-CWPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPI-CWP, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent cell wall proteins; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ORF, open reading frame; CR, Congo Red. 1The abbreviations used are: GPI-CWP, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent cell wall proteins; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; ORF, open reading frame; CR, Congo Red. which are generally linked to β-1,3 glucan through a β-1,6 glucan chain, and PIR proteins (PIR-CWPs), which are directly linked to β-1,3 glucan (6Mrsa V. Tanner W. Yeast. 1999; 15: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Kapteyn J.C. Van Egmond P. Sievi E. Van Den E.H. Makarow M. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1835-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For some of these cell wall mannoproteins, several functions have been characterized, including adhesion and cell wall construction (for a review see Ref. 3Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although in many cases their precise function is unknown. The cell wall cannot be a static structure since it needs to adapt to its surrounding growth conditions as the cell increases in size, and it also needs to be remodeled during morphogenetic processes such as mating, sporulation, or pseudohyphal growth (2Molina M. Gil C. Pla J. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Cid V.J. Duran A. del Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol.

Moreover, in its attempt to survive the cell wall can change in composition and/or structure in response to environmental stress (3Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Popolo L. Gualtieri T. Ragni E. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 111-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of this cellular response, which has been called “compensatory mechanism,” clearly illustrates the dynamic nature of the cell wall. This cell wall salvage response involves: (i) a remarkable increase in the chitin content; (ii) changes in the association between cell wall polymers (while only 2% of CWPs are linked directly to chitin in a wild-type cell, this linkage is 20-fold more abundant in gas1 cells) (11Kapteyn J.C. Ram A.F. Groos E.M. Kollar R. Montijn R.C. Van Den E.H. Llobell A. Cabib E. Klis F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) an increase in the bulk of CWPs; and (iv) a transient redistribution of β-1,3 glucan synthase complex throughout the cell (12Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All these mechanisms are involved in the repair of the cell wall under stress conditions. Although we are now beginning to understand some aspects of the regulation of cell wall construction, exactly how all these processes are regulated is still largely unclear. In addition to the activation of the SLT2-MAPK pathway in response to several environmental stimuli, such as high temperature (13Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), hypo-osmotic shock (14Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol.

Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), this pathway becomes also activated in response to cell wall damage. For example, treatments with cell wall-perturbing agents such Congo Red and Calcofluor White or Zymolyase, which degrades the β-1,3 glucan network, lead to activation of the Slt2p MAP kinase (16Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17De Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutant cells with a weakened cell wall, such as fks1Δ, gas1Δ, mnn9Δ, and others, show a constitutive activation of this pathway (18Groot P. Ruiz C. Vazquez de Aldana C. Dueñas E.

Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Slt2p finally activates several transcription factors, leading to changes in gene expression. Currently, two transcription factors have been identified as targets of Slt2p: the MADS-box transcription factor Rlm1p (23Dodou E. Treisman R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6515-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This latter is a heterodimeric complex of two proteins, Swi4p and Swi6p, that are involved in the activation of gene expression at the G1/S transition (27Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Signaling through Rlm1p regulates the expression of many genes involved in cell wall biogenesis (28Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Other works have also involved the Sho1p-Kss1p (29Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in the control of the cell integrity. More recently, using DNA macroarray technology we obtained a comprehensive view of the cellular response to constitutive cell wall damage by comparing the transcriptome of mutant cells deleted in several genes important for the construction of the cell wall (KRE6, GAS1, KNR4, FKS1) with the expression profiles of wild-type cells (19Lagorce A.

In addition to confirming the involvement of the SLT2-MAP kinase pathway, this genomewide analysis also led to the identification of the Calcineurin/Crz1p signaling pathway and the regulatory machinery from the general stress cellular response as regulators of the response to cell wall damage. Although the genomic characterization of the transcriptional response to cell wall mutations has allowed us to decipher relevant molecular aspects of the cell wall compensatory mechanism (19Lagorce A. Hauser N.C. Labourdette D. Rodriguez C. Martin-Yken H. Arroyo J. Hoheisel J.D. Francois J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20345-20357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), important clues regarding the kinetics and regulation of the response were lacking. In order to obtain additional insight into these aspects, we used an alternative approach involving the characterization of the transcriptional yeast response to the presence of two drugs, Congo Red and Zymolyase, which are known to cause cell wall damage and activate the Slt2p-MAP kinase pathway (17De Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The global transcriptional response to transient cell wall damage demonstrates that the larger fraction of genes induced are devoted to cell wall remodeling in order to ensure cell integrity under cell wall damage-inducing growth conditions. The direct role of the cell integrity pathway in the response was analyzed using mutant strains in some elements of this pathway. The expression profiles of strains deleted in SLT2 and RLM1 disclosed the essential contribution of these proteins and their corresponding signaling pathway to the regulation of the response. Strains—All experiments were performed with the S. cerevisiae BY4741 strain (MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0) and mutant derivatives provided by Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). Mutant strains (BY4741 background) present the corresponding gene completely deleted and replaced by the Geneticin resistance-codifying KanMX4 module. Culture Conditions—For routine cultures, S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). When necessary, Geneticin (200 mg/liter) (Invitrogen) was added. Yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 °C to an optical density of 0.8–1 (OD600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 OD and grown at 24 °C for 2 h 30 min. Next, the culture was divided into two parts. One part was allowed to continue growing under the same conditions (the non-treated culture) while the other one was supplemented with Congo Red to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. The severity of the treatment was calibrated to preserve more than 90% of cell viability. The mechanism of action of this drug is not known, although its interference with proper cell wall assembly has been well documented (31Kopecka M. Gabriel M. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). At this time, cells (∼5 × 108) were collected by centrifugation (t = 0 h sample). Then, for the wild-type strain cultures cells were collected by centrifugation at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h of growth, frozen at -80 °C, and processed for RNA extraction (see below). For the rlm1Δ and slt2Δ strains, cells were collected at 4 h. For the Zymolyase experiments, the procedure was identical but the medium was supplemented with 5 units/ml of Zymolyase100T (ICN Biomedicals Inc, Aurora, OH), and the times studied were 0 and 2 h. Preparation of Yeast Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells were grown, treated with Congo Red, and collected as described above. Lysis, collection of proteins, fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, as well as the detection of phosphorylated Slt2p, using an anti phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were performed as described by Martín et al. (32Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody (ICN Biomedicals Inc) was used at a dilution of 1:2000 to monitor the levels of actin. RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells (5 × 108)bythe “mechanical disruption protocol” using the RNeasy MIDI kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA concentrations were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. RNA purity and integrity were assessed using RNA Nano Labchips in an Agilent 2100B Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA Synthesis and Chip Hybridization—cDNA was synthesized from 25–30 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription, using the CyScribe™ First-Strand cDNA Labeling Kit, incorporating Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) into the cDNA corresponding to each sample to be compared. Labeled cDNA was dried in a vacuum trap and used as a hybridization probe after resuspension in 45 μl of hybridization solution (50% Formamide, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's, 20 μg of poly(A) (P-9403, Sigma) and salmon sperm (Invitrogen, 100 μg/ml). The printed microarrays, including the complete set of 6306 ORFs coded by the S. cerevisiae genome, used in this study were provided by the Microarray Centre of the University Health Network, Toronto, Canada (www.microarrays.ca). Slides were prehybridized in prehybridization solution (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin (A-7906, Sigma) for 1 h and were then hybridized overnight with labeled probe at 42 °C in a water bath. Before scanning, the chips were washed and dried in a Lucidea™ SlidePro Automated Hybridization Station (Amersham Biosciences). For each condition tested, comparison of treated and non-treated samples, the total RNA from two different cultures was analyzed, and, in addition, for each sample two different hybridizations were performed, including fluorochrome swapping in order to minimize transcriptional changes due to technical variability. This therefore corresponded to four DNA microarrays analyzed for each condition. Microarray Image Analysis—Microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at a resolution of 5 μm (PMT values ranging from 550 to 700 and laser power 100%). GenePix Pro 4.0 analysis software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) was used to locate spots in the microarray with the appropriate grid and to obtain the two Cy3/Cy5 image TIFF files. All images were further processed using GenePix 4.0 software according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data Processing and Statistical Methods—Flagged spots and spots with an average intensity minus background below the mean of the background (considering this as the median of the local background for each spot) for all the non-flagged spots in any of the channels (Cy3 or Cy5) were not retained for further analysis. Within this group, the spots showing in one channel a value of intensity minus background higher than 5 times the mean of the background for all spots in the microarray for that channel were recovered. The reproducibility of replicates in each microarray (two spots per ORF) was analyzed by creating a normal distribution log2 (RA × 1/RB), where RA and RB are the ratios of replicated spots after background subtraction and normalization. Replicates that exceeded the average by more than ±3 S.D. were discarded. Data analysis was accomplished using the GeneSight 4.0 software package (BioDiscovery Inc, El Segundo, CA). Locally weighed linear regression (lowess) analysis was performed as a normalization method to remove the intensity-dependent deviation in the log2(ratio) values. Significance analysis of the results was conducted using a Student's t test (GeneSight). Genes with p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly differentially expressed with respect to the treatment condition. The Sotarray Server from GEPAS (Gene Expression Pattern Analysis Suite) (gepas.bioinfo.cnio.es/tools.html); Bioinformatics Unit, CNIO, Spain) was used to perform the SOTA clustering and to visualize the resulting tree. The microarray data described here follow the MIAME recommendations and has been deposited at the NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with GEO accession numbers GSE959, GSE960, GSE961, GSE962, GSE963, GSE964, GS965, and GSE966. Promoter Analysis—For each gene induced at least 2-fold under the different conditions tested, 800-bp upstream from their start codon (ATG) were analyzed using the MEME algorithm (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/intro.htm), the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat) and Reduce (lognormal.bio.columbia.edu/reduce/), to identify possible common DNA motifs. Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools were also used to search for specific sequence motifs. Quantitation of mRNAs using Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR— First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 2.5 μg of total RNA, using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega) and following the recommendations of the manufacturer. As controls for genomic contamination, the same reactions were performed, but in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 25 μl containing 5 μl of a 100-fold dilution of the RT reaction and 12.5 μl of the 2× SYBRGreen Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) together with the specific forward and reverse primers (Sigma), designed using the Primer Express Software 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR conditions were selected accordingly to the Universal conditions (default conditions) recommended by the manufacturer of the instrument. Each cDNA was assayed in at least duplicate PCR reactions. After amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of the reaction. Basic analysis was performed using the SDS 1.9.1 software (Applied Biosystems). For quantification, the abundance of each gene was determined relative to the standard transcript of ACT1 and the final data of relative gene expression between the two conditions tested on each microarray were calculated following the 2-ΔΔCt method, as described in (33Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). The following forward and reverse primers, respectively, were used: ACT1, 5′-ATCACCGCTTTGGCTCCAT-3′ and 5′-CCAATCCAGACGGAGTACTTTCTT-3′; CRH1, 5′-ACTACCCAGATATCAAGCAAATACACA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCACCGTTAGAAATTTGAACA-3′; PIR3, 5′-CTCTATCGTTGCCAACAGACAGTT-3′ and 5′-CCAACCAGCAGCATAGATAGCA-3′; CCW14,5′-TCCACTAGCGAGGCTCACTCTT-3′ and 5′-TAACGGCGGTAGAAGTTGGTAGA-3′; PRM5, 5′-AGACATAAGGAAACCCGCAAAAA-3′ and 5′-ACGATTTACGCTACCATCACTTTCT-3′; MLP1, 5′-TGAATTATCAAGAATGCACAAAAGC-3′and 5′-TCCTTCCCTTCAAACATTGGTT-3′; PHO89, 5′-ACTGTCATGGCTACCCAATTAGG-3′ and 5′-TACATAAACCAACAGCGACAATACC-3′; PCL1, 5′-TGCTGGCACGAGTCCTATCA-3′ and 5′-CGACACGTTTCTCTGTTTTTCGTA-3′; EXG2, 5′-GGAGAATGGTCAGGCGCTATT-3′, and 5′-CCCACCCCAACACCATTTAG-3′; CHA1, 5′-ATTCAAGGTTTGGAAAGGTATGGTT-3′, and 5′-TCGTTTCCACCCCCACAAT-3′; CHS3, 5′-TTGGGTAACTGCAATTCAAGTGTTT-3′ and 5′-TACCGAACCGAAGACAGATTCAA-3′; FKS1, 5′-TCGTTACTTGTATCCAATGTCAAAGACT-3′and 5′-AGGCTGTATTGGCATGATCGTT-3′; YLR-042c, 5′-GTTCATTGTTCAAGCGCAACTT-3′and 5′-CCAAGGGCAGTATTCAAATCCT-3′; YHP1, 5′-GGCAGGTGAAGTTTTCAGCAA-3′and 5′-ACGCTGCGTTGGAAATTACC-3′; FKS2, 5′-CCGTCAAATCCGTCCTCCTAT-3′and 5′-GTACAAGCTGCAATACCTCCTAACC-3′. Congo Red Sensitivity—Cells were grown overnight in YEPD and adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.13 (∼2 × 103 cells per μl). Five microliters of samples plus three serial 1:10 dilutions were spotted onto plates of YEPD supplemented with Congo Red at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Growth was monitored after 2 days at 28 °C. Global Analysis of the Transcriptional Response to Transient Cell Wall Damage Caused by Congo Red Treatment in Yeast— The aim of this study was to characterize, in a comprehensive way, the response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the presence of transient cell wall damage and how this response is regulated. To achieve this, we exposed yeast cells, in the logarithmic growth phase, to 30 μg/ml of Congo Red (CR) and DNA microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression of 6306 open reading frames encoded by the yeast genome. We characterized the pattern of gene expression at time 0, 2, 4, and 6 h after exposure of the yeast to CR. The time-course experiments were performed by comparing the abundance of mRNA at each time in cells growing in the presence of CR relative to yeast cells growing in the absence of the drug (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). A complete data set of the genes induced in our study is shown in Table I. The analysis revealed that 132 genes were induced at least 1.8-fold at one or more of the time points tested (67 genes after 2 h, 58 genes after 4 h, and 75 genes after 6 h).Table IClassification into functional families of ORFs whose transcripts are induced after Congo Red or Zymoliase treatment ORFs whose transcripts are induced at least 1.8 fold after treatment with Congo Red (2, 4 or 6 hours) or Zymolyase (2 h). Data correspond to average value of induction after significance test was performed (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Confinement of metal oxide deposition to specific subdomains of the preorganized template yields high-fidelity, three-dimensional replication of the copolymer morphology, enabling the preparation of structures with multiscale order in a process that closely resembles biomineralization. Ordered mesoporous silicate films were synthesized with dielectric constants as low as 1.8 and excellent mechanical properties.

https://openalex.org/W2041924766,"Deletion of the c-src gene impairs osteoclast bone resorbing activity, causing osteopetrosis. Although it has been concluded that restoring only the Src adaptor function at least partly rescues the cell attachment and skeletal phenotypes, the contribution of Src kinase activity remains controversial. Src forms a complex with Pyk2 and Cbl after adhesion-induced stimulation of αVβ3 integrin. To demonstrate the importance of the Pyk2-Src association in osteoclasts and to distinguish the contributions of the Src adaptor and kinase activities in cytoskeletal organization and osteoclast function, we expressed mutants of Src and Pyk2 in osteoclasts using adenovirus vectors. Eliminating the Src-binding site on Pyk2 (Pyk2Y402F) markedly inhibited bone resorption by osteoclast-like cells, whereas kinase-dead Pyk2 had little effect. Kinase-dead Src, unlike kinase-dead Pyk2, markedly inhibited the bone-resorbing activity of wild type osteoclasts and failed to significantly restore bone-resorbing activity to Src-/- osteoclast-like cells. Activation of Src kinase by overexpressing kinase-dead Csk failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of Pyk2Y402F, suggesting that osteoclastic bone resorption requires both c-Src kinase activity and the targeting of Src kinase by Pyk2. Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of Cbl on Tyr-731 is reported to induce the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. Expressing the CblY731F mutant in osteoclasts markedly reduced their bone resorbing activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of CblY731 and the subsequent recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may be critical signaling events downstream of Src in osteoclasts.

Targeted disruption of the src gene in mice induces osteopetrosis, a disorder characterized by decreased bone resorption, without showing any obvious morphological or functional abnormalities in other tissues or cells (1Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). The osteopetrotic phenotype of src-/- mice is cell-autonomous and results from defects in mature osteoclasts, which normally express high levels of Src protein (2Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Lowe C. Yoneda T. Boyce B.F. Chen H. Mundy G.R. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The mobility of Src- osteoclasts is reduced by 60%, which is likely to account for at least some of the deficit in bone resorbing activity (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). It remains uncertain, however, if catalytically active Src is required for normal osteoclast function. Some investigators report the genetic rescue of the src-/- osteopetrosis by kinase-deficient mutants of Src (5Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Together with the findings of Felsenfeld et al. (6Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) that the adapter function of Src promotes fibroblasts motility, these results suggest that the predominant role of Src in osteoclasts might be as an adaptor molecule, recruiting other proteins that are necessary for the modulation of integrin-cytoskeletal links, cell attachment, and migration. On the other hand, there are reports that indicate that Src kinase activity is required for normal osteoclastic bone resorption (7Missbach M. Jeschke M. Feyen J. Muller K. Glatt M. Green J. Susa M. Bone (NY). 1999; 24: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), leaving the question of the contribution of Src kinase activity unsettled. The identity of the Src target(s) in the signaling pathways that are required for normal osteoclast mobility and resorption also remains to be resolved. We previously reported that Cbl basal phosphotyrosine content in osteoclasts is markedly Src-dependent, in contrast to several other known Src substrates (10Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and that Src forms an adhesion-induced complex with Cbl and the calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 in osteoclasts (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Replating Src+ osteoclasts on vitronection receptor induced the phosphorylation of all three proteins, whereas only Pyk2 was phosphorylated in replated Src-/- osteoclasts, indicating that Src phosphorylates Cbl in this complex. In a reconstituted model system (human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with the vitronection and Pyk2), Src kinase activity was required for adhesion-induced Pyk2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, we did not determine whether the absence of Src kinase activity affected OC function in vitro. We have, therefore, extended our investigation to examine the requirement for Src kinase activity in osteoclast function, taking advantage of the ability of adenoviral vectors to transduce foreign genes into osteoclasts (8Miyazaki T.

We found that both Src kinase activity and the Src SH2-dependent formation of the Pyk2/Src complex are required for bone resorption. Furthermore, we showed that inhibiting Src leads to a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of Tyr-731 in Cbl, the third component in the Pyk2-Src complex (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L.

Infection of osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) with adenovirus vectors was carried out following the method previously described (8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y.

Cells and Cell Cultures—Mouse primary osteoblastic cells were obtained from 1-day-old mouse calvaria by enzymatic digestion, and bone marrow cells were from tibiae of 6-week-old Src+/- or Src-/- mice. Osteoblastic cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were co-cultured with bone marrow cells (1 × 107 cells/dish) on 10-cm tissue culture dishes or collagen gel-coated dishes in the presence of 10 nm 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 1 μm prostaglandin E2. For biochemical assays, OCLs were purified as reported elsewhere (8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner.

Before experiments, RAW264.7 cells were starved for 18 h in medium containing 0.1% FBS and treated with 10 μm PP2 for 30 min. Coimmunoprecipitation—Cell cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min on ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 500 μg of total cell lysate protein with 2 μg of antibody for 2 h on ice, then adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing, the immune complex was recovered by centrifugation and washed 4 times with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% IGEPAL CA-630, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase activity was assayed as previously reported (8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, Src immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 60 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2) with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 1 μg of acid-treated enolase, then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 mm EDTA, 12% SDS, 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were plated on sterile FBS-coated glass coverslips. OCLs were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized with ice-cold acetone for 5 min. Coverslips for actin labeling were incubated in a 1:40 dilution (in phosphate-buffered saline) of rhodamine phalloidin stock solution (Molecular Probes) for 20 min. Cells were sequentially stained with appropriate primary antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody as previously reported (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were examined using a confocal imaging system (MRC-600; Bio-Rad). Pit Formation Assay—Functionally active OCLs were formed in co-cultures carried out on collagen gel as described elsewhere (8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the crude OCL preparation was transferred onto dentine slices and cultured for an additional 12 h. The resorbed area was measured using an image analysis system linked to a light microscope (Osteometrics). Survival of OCLs—The survival rate was measured as previously reported (12Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). OCLs were purified 3 days after the infection, and some of the cultures were subjected to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Other cultures were further incubated for 24 h, and then the number of living OCLs was counted. Cell viability/survival at the different time points is the number of morphologically intact tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells expressed as a percentage of the number of cells at time 0. Statistical Analysis—Each series of experiments was repeated at least three times. The results obtained from a typical experiment were expressed as the means ± S.D. Significant differences were determined using factorial analysis of variance. Pyk2Y402F Overexpression Inhibits the Pit-forming Activity of Osteoclast-like Cells—Pyk2 is highly expressed in the podosomes of osteoclasts (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 15Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and is autophosphorylated in response to integrin engagement (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of Pyk2 kinase activity and the autophosphorylation of Pyk2Y402 in osteoclast function, we constructed adenoviruses containing Xpress-tagged wild type Pyk2 (AxPyk2WT), autophosphorylation site-mutated Pyk2 (AxPyk2Y402F), or kinase-dead Pyk2 (AxPyk2K457A). We used a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that contains a reporter gene encoding GFP (AxGFP) as a control vector. The protein expression of the purified OCLs from cocultures infected with the recombinant viruses at different m.o.i. values was examined after 3 days of infection by Western blotting with anti-Xpress antibody or anti-Pyk2 antibody. Equal amounts of the three Pyk2 proteins were expressed in infected OCLs in a m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Cells infected with AxPyk2WT or AxPyk2K457A exhibited in a single large actin ring similar to the ring seen in the cells infected with the control AxGFP. In contrast, Pyk2Y402F-expressing OCLs contained actin patches and one or more small actin rings (Fig. 1B). Pyk2Y402 is autophosphorylated after cell attachment and binds to the Src SH2 domain (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 15Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, endogenous Src bound to Xpress-tagged Pyk2WT and Pyk2K457A but not to Pyk2Y402F (Fig. 1C). As expected, no phosphotyrosine 402 was detected in the cells expressing Pyk2Y402F. In contrast, a low level of phosphorylation of the Tyr-402 of Pyk2K457A was detected (Fig. 1D), indicating either that this residue can be phosphorylated by some other kinase in osteoclasts or that the small residual kinase activity of mutated Pyk2 is sufficient to catalyze a low level of phosphorylation. To investigate the functional consequences of overexpressing Pyk2WT, Pyk2Y402F, or Pyk2K457A, the bone resorbing activity of OCLs was quantified by measuring the areas of pits formed on dentine slices. As shown in Fig. 1E, the pit-forming activity of OCLs was strongly inhibited in proportion to Pyk2Y402F expression. In contrast, overexpression of Pyk2WT or Pyk2K457A had no effect on bone resorption. There was no significant difference in osteoclast survival among OCLs expressing the different Pyk2 proteins (data not shown). Thus, these data demonstrate that the interaction of Src with Pyk2, mediated by the SrcSH2 domain and the Pyk2 Tyr(P)-402, is required for the normal organization of the osteoclast actin cytoskeleton and for bone resorption. The Inhibitory Effect of Pyk2Y402F Overexpression on Bone Resorption Is Not Reversed by Up-regulating Src Kinase Activity—The effect of overexpressing Pyk2Y402F suggests that the recruitment of Src to autophosphorylated Pyk2 at adhesion sites is a key event in bone resorption, but it does not address the question of whether Src kinase activity is required or if the adaptor functions of Src SH2 and SH3 domains are sufficient. Indeed, Schwartzberg et al. (5Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) conclude from their in vivo results that the kinase activity of Src may be dispensable (5Schwartzberg P.L. Xing L. Hoffmann O. Lowell C.A. Garrett L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To address this question, we examined the effect of modulating Src kinase activity independently of the binding of Src to Pyk2. We first examined whether or not the up-regulation of Src kinase activity was sufficient to rescue the decreased pit-forming activity of Pyk2Y402F-expressing OCLs. For this purpose we co-infected OCLs with AxPyk2Y402F and adenovirus carrying kinase-dead C-terminal Src family kinase (AxCskKD), which prevents the phosphorylation of the negative regulatory Tyr-527 and increases Src kinase activity in OCLs (8Miyazaki T. Takayanagi H. Isshiki M. Takahashi T. Okada M. Fukui Y. Oda H. Nakamura K. Hirai H. Kurokawa T. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Co-infected OCLs expressed Pyk2Y402F and CskKD at levels similar to the cells infected with either Pyk2Y402F or CskKD alone (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, Src kinase activity in OCLs was up-regulated when CskKD was overexpressed alone or when it was co-expressed with Pyk2Y402F. The inhibitory effect of AxPyk2Y402F on osteoclast function was, however, not rescued by co-infection with AxCskKD (Fig. 2C), indicating that high Src kinase activity alone is not sufficient to rescue the decreased bone resorbing activity in the Pyk2Y402F-expressing OCLs and that the Pyk2-dependent recruitment of Src is necessary for bone resorption. Src Kinase Activity Is Required for Bone Resorption—We then examined the role of Src kinase activity in situations where Pyk2-dependent recruitment of Src was not altered. For this purpose, we constructed an adenovirus carrying kinase-dead Src (SrcK295M), kinase-dead Src with open conformation (SrcK295M+Y527F), or autophosphorylation site-mutated Src with open conformation (SrcY416F+Y527F). The open conformation allows that the adaptor domains of Src are available to bind other proteins. As shown in the upper and middle panels of Fig. 3A, the Src mutant proteins were expressed in infected OCLs in a m.o.i.-dependent manner. SrcK295M-expressing OCLs do not display the typical rounded appearance of AxGFP-infected OCLs, and the actin ring was disrupted in >90% of AxSrcK295M-infected OCLs (Fig. 3B). This morphology of SrcK295M-expressing OCLs is similar to that of Src-/- OCLs (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition, pit-forming activity was also inhibited, albeit never completely blocked, in proportion to the expression level of SrcK295M protein (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that it is the presence of the kinase activity of Src in the osteoclast adhesion structures and not just the Src protein that is necessary for actin ring formation and bone resorption. However, the autophosphorylation of Src promotes the adoption of the fully open active conformation (17Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 18Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), and thus, SrcK295M might not be an effective adaptor. To rule out the possibility that the dominant negative effects of SrcK295M could be due to a loss of adaptor function, OCLs were infected with AxSrcK295M+Y527F, which prevents the phosphorylation of the negative regulatory Tyr-527 and promotes the availability of the SH2 and SH3 domains to bind other proteins. To ensure that the mutant Src proteins were indeed binding to Pyk2 in OCLs, the Src proteins were immunoprecipitated from OCLs lysates, and the immune complexes were blotted to demonstrate the presence of Pyk2 (data not shown). The morphology and bone-resorbing activity of SrcK295M+Y527F-expressing OCLs was similar to that of OCLs infected with AxSrcK295M (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that it is the absence of kinase activity, not the possible failure to bind to Pyk2 and/or other proteins in the adhesion complex, that causes the loss of bone-resorbing activity. To further confirm the importance of Src kinase activity, we investigated the functional changes in OCLs infected with AxSrcY416F+Y527F. The Y416F mutation reduces kinase activity about 50% by preventing the phosphorylation of a tyrosine on the activation loop of Src (19Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 20Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Despite its open conformation, SrcY416F+Y527F partially inhibited osteoclast function, consistent with its reduced kinase activity. AxSrcY416F+Y527F-infected OCLs exhibited a few small actin rings (Fig. 3B) and still retained partial bone-resorbing activity (about 70% of control) at an m.o.i. of 100 (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that the localization of catalytically active Src in adhesion structures is required for actin ring formation and bone resorption. Src Kinase Activity Is Required for the Efficient Rescue of the Src-/- Osteoclast Phenotype—To further confirm the importance of Src kinase activity for osteoclastic bone resorption and to determine the influence of endogenous Src levels in our previous experiments, we introduced Src mutants into Src-/- osteoclasts. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mutant Src proteins were expressed in infected Src-/- OCLs. Under these experimental conditions, Src-/- OCLs were completely unable to form resorption pits in our assay. Interestingly, SrcK295M and SrcK295M+Y527F, which did not notably affect the cytoskeletal organization of OCLs, restored, albeit extremely minimally (less than 3%), some bone-resorbing activity in Src-/- osteoclasts (p < 0.001). This minimal effect could be due to the adaptor function of Src or to the very low residual kinase activity in these mutants. In contrast, the expression of SrcY416F+Y527F, which retains about 50% kinase activity, induced the formation of actin rings and very significantly increased bone-resorbing activity to ∼70% of control (Fig. 4, B and C). These results clearly show that Src kinase activity is indeed required to rescue the disruptive effect of Src deficiency on the cytoskeletal organization and bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Identification of Src Kinase-dependent Signaling Events— Having determined that both the Src adaptor function (binding to Pyk2) and Src kinase activity are required for bone resorption, we sought to identify downstream elements in Src-dependent signaling mechanism(s). We previously showed that Cbl is phosphorylated in an Src-dependent manner in osteoclasts and that bone resorption by OCLs in vitro is inhibited by both Src-and Cbl-specific antisense oligonucleotides (4Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by Src is essential for bone resorption. Of the 22 tyrosines in Cbl, those at positions 700, 731, and 774 are the principal sites of phosphorylation by Src family kinases (21Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Tyr-731 occurs within the sequence YEAM, which has been shown to provide a docking site for the SH2 domain(s) of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (22Ueno H. Sasaki K.

Based on a sequence entry (NCBI accession number BC018897) and screening of expressed sequence tags, we have cloned an alternative splice variant of GLUT9 from human kidney cDNA. The RNA of this splice variant consists of 13 exons and codes for a putative protein of 512 amino acids (GLUT9ΔN).

The GLUT9 protein localized by immunohistochemistry to human kidney proximal tubules, and subcellular fractionation of human kidney revealed the GLUT9 protein in plasma membranes and high density microsomal membranes. Treatment of kidney membrane proteins with peptide N-glycosidase F showed that GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN are expressed in vivo. Localization of GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN in three kidney-derived cell lines revealed a plasma membrane distribution for GLUT9 in COS-7 and HEK293 cells, whereas GLUT9ΔN showed a perinuclear pattern and plasma membrane staining in COS-7 and HEK293 cells, respectively. In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, GLUT9 trafficked to the basolateral membrane, whereas GLUT9ΔN localized to the apical membrane. Using heterologous expression of GLUT9 in Xenopus oocytes, GLUT9 appears to be a functional isoform with low affinity for deoxyglucose.

Transport of hexoses across plasma membranes of mammalian cells is mediated by active as well as passive mechanisms, represented by the protein families of Na+ glucose symporters (1Wood I.S. Trayhurn P. Br. J. Nutr. 2003; 89: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and facilitative glucose carriers (2Joost H.G. Bell G.I. Best J.D. Birnbaum M.J. Charron M.J. Chen Y.T. Doege H. James D.E. Lodish H.F. Moley K.H. Moley J.F. Mueckler M. Rogers S. Schurmann A. Seino S. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E974-E976Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), respectively. The family of facilitative transporters currently comprises 14 isoforms that differ in their tissue distribution, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity. A common structural feature shared among all members of the glucose transporter family (SLC2A family) is the presence of 12 transmembrane helices with N and C termini facing the cytoplasm and an N-linked glycosylation site. Highly conserved motifs, also referred to as sugar transporter signatures, are located in helices 6 and 12 (PESPR/PETK) and loops 2 and 8 (GRR/GRK) and further specify the sequence characteristics of SLC2A family members. Amino acid residues that are required for glucose transport/function as well as binding of the specific transport inhibitor cytochalasin B have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis analysis of GLUT1, the most intensively characterized isoform (4Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested the presence of additional isoforms (5Katz E.B. Stenbit A.E. Hatton K. DePinho R. Charron M.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 6Kayano T. Burant C.F. Fukumoto H. Gould G.W. Fan Y.S. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13276-13282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the availability of expressed sequence tag data bases and the sequencing and mapping of the human genome allowed the identification of several new members during the last few years, leading to a rather complex picture of glucose/hexose transport and whole body sugar homeostasis. To date, only few functional data are available for the new isoforms. However, based on sequence characteristics and phylogenetic alignments, three subclasses in the family can be distinguished (7Uldry M. Thorens B. Pfluegers Arch. 2003; 447: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This suggests a broader range of possible substrates and transport characteristics among these new isoforms that is not restricted to hexoses, as shown by the cloning of the H+/myo-inositol transporter isoform or GLUT13 (8Uldry M. Ibberson M. Horisberger J.D. Chatton J.Y. Riederer B.M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4467-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the characterization of human GLUT9 (9Phay J.E. Hussain H.B. Moley J.F. Genomics. 2000; 66: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that alternative splicing leads to differential targeting, suggesting possible new mechanisms in the regulation of hexose transport in mammalian cells. RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription-PCR, and PCR Cloning Total RNA from human tissues was prepared using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase (DNA-free™, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX)-treated total RNA was primed with random hexamers (Roche Applied Science) and reverse-transcribed using Superscript™ (Invitrogen). The human GLUT9 splice variant (GLUT9ΔN) was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using Klentaq LA polymerase (Wayne Barnes, Washington University) from human kidney cDNA based on the expressed sequence tag clone IMAGE:3949549 and NCBI accession number BC018897. The GLUT9ΔN coding sequence was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CGG GGT ACC CCC GCC ATG AAG CTC AGT AAA AAG GAC-3′ and 5′-GCC CTC TAG ATT AAG GCC TTC CAT TTA TCT TAC CAT. The PCR primers included the restriction sites for KpnI and XbaI for subsequent cloning into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The resulting GLUT9ΔN clone was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. To study the expression pattern of GLUT9 splice variants in human tissues, cDNAs were amplified with GLUT9- and GLUT9ΔN-specific forward primers (5′-ACT GAG ACC CAT GGC AAG GAA A-3′ and 5′-ATG AAG CTC AGT AAA AAG GAC-3′, respectively). A common reverse primer for both splice variants was used (5′-GAG TGT CTG GGT CTA TTG GA-3′), resulting in PCR amplicons of 326 and 229 bp for GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN, respectively. To ensure that an equal amount of cDNA was used for PCR amplification from different tissues, the housekeeping gene actin was amplified as an internal standard at a linear range of the PCR (forward primer, 5′-TGC GTG ACA TTA AGG AGA AG-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-CTG CAT CCT GTC GGC AAT G-3′). Human kidney biopsy samples were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) using a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder (Kimble/Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Nuclei, mitochondria, and plasma membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min (Beckman rotor JA-20, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A, homogenized, and layered on a 38.7% sucrose cushion in Tris/EDTA. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the plasma membrane containing interphase was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h. High density microsomes were obtained by centrifugation from the first supernatant at 50,000 × g for 1 h. The second supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 75 min to sediment the low density microsomal membrane fraction. Membrane pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored at -80 °C prior to further analysis. For preparation of membrane fractions from cell lines stably expressing GLUT9, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; BSA, bovine serum albumin. After rinsing in cold (4 °C) buffer A, cells were scraped into buffer A containing proteinase inhibitors. All subsequent steps were carried out as described above. Plasma membrane and high and low density microsomal protein fractions were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, and probed with an antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of human GLUT9 (KIDSAVTDGKINGRP). For detection of GLUT9 in human kidney membrane extracts, IgG-purified antiserum (HiTrap™ IgG, Amersham Biosciences) was applied at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (in 1% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20). Western blots were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce) and developed using the SuperSignal Dura Western kit (Pierce). For detection of human GLUT9 in overexpressing cell lines, anti-human GLUT9 serum (1:1000) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) were used. To determine the extent of glycosylation and the molecular masses of human GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN, 10 μg of plasma membrane extracts from transfected HEK293 cells were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) following the manufacturer's instructions. After enzyme incubation, the reaction was stopped adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described above. To show in vivo expression of GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN, 20 μg of human kidney high density microsomes were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F, and the protein samples were separated on a standard 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 × 20 cm). Western blotting was carried out as described above, and combined plasma membrane fractions from GLUT9- and GLUT9ΔN-transfected HEK293 cells were used as positive controls. Three kidney-derived cell lines were used to investigate the localization of human GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN. COS-7, HEK293, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, cells were split and seeded for 24 h, and transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transiently transfected cells were analyzed for expression by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting 48 h after transfection. Stable expression was achieved by splitting the cells 24 h after transfection into medium supplemented with 1 or 0.8 mg/ml G418 for HEK293 and MDCK cells, respectively. Clonal GLUT9- and GLUT9ΔN-expressing cell lines were obtained by serial dilution. To investigate the localization of GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN in polarized epithelial cells, clonal expressing MDCK cells were plated at high density (1.6 × 106 cells) onto 0.45-μm Falcon cell culture inserts (catalog number 3090, BD Biosciences) and cultured for 5 days under daily media renewal. After rehydration, paraffin-embedded human kidney sections (3 μm) were cooked in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.2, for antigen retrieval using a pressure cooker. After washing with PBS, nonspecific antibody binding was blocked for 1 h with 2.5% goat serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. IgG-purified human GLUT9 antiserum (10 μg/ml) diluted in the blocking buffer was applied overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, sections were developed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (ABC-AP kit AK-5001, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. IgG-purified rabbit preimmune serum was used as a negative control. Cryosections of human kidney were used for immunofluorescent staining of GLUT9. Sections stored at -80 °C were brought to -20 °C for 20 min, followed by fixation at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing with PBS, sections were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min and subjected to IgG-purified anti-GLUT9 antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. GLUT9 staining was detected using a cross-absorbed goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene). Topro-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and labeled phalloidin (Sigma) were used to counterstain nuclei and actin TRITC-labeled filaments, respectively. Sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc.) and examined by confocal microscopy using a Nikon C1 confocal microscope equipped with an Eclipse E800 upright microscope. Transiently or stably transfected cells expressing GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN were grown on coverslips or, in the case of polarized MDCK cells, on translucent polyethylene terephthalate membranes. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, and quenched by three washes with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 min, followed by three washes with PBS, and nonspecific antiserum binding was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with GLUT9 antiserum diluted 1:500 in 2% BSA, washed with PBS, and probed with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody (1:200 in 2% BSA in PBS). Cells were washed with PBS, and nuclei were stained with Topro-3 iodide for 10 min. After a final PBS wash, cells were mounted using Vectashield. Polarized MDCK cells grown on polyethylene terephthalate membranes from cell culture inserts were mounted using Secure Seal imaging spacers (Sigma). Specimens were examined by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 or Nikon C1 confocal microscope. Glucose Uptake into Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Glucose transport by GLUT9 was determined as uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose into Xenopus oocytes. Transport measurements were carried out as described in detail by Keller et al. (10Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 50 ng of RNA obtained from in vitro transcribed GLUT4 and GLUT9 cDNAs cloned into the pXOV vector (the GLUT4 construct was a kind gift Dr. Mike Mueckler). 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose uptake assays were performed 3 days after injection with groups of 8–10 oocytes incubated in 25 μm unlabeled deoxyglucose and 1 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose in modified Barth's solution for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of 100 μm cytochalasin B. Uptake was stopped by three washes with ice-cold modified Barth's solution with 100 μm phloretin. Individual oocytes were lysed in 1% SDS and mixed with scintillation liquid, and radioactivity was counted. Uptake rates were determined as picomoles of deoxyglucose transported per oocyte/30 min and compared with water-injected (control) oocytes. GLUT9 expression in Xenopus oocytes was determined by Western blot analysis of total membrane fractions. Total membrane proteins were obtained by homogenizing 10–20 oocytes in 1 ml of buffer A by 10 passages through a 25G needle on a 1-ml syringe; and after an initial centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, membranes were pelleted from the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 45 min. To determine the localization of GLUT9 in Xenopus oocytes, whole mount immunocytochemistry was carried out. Immunofluorescent staining of paraformaldehyde-fixed oocytes was performed as described for cell lines. Oocytes were mounted on slides using Secure Seal spacers to keep the cells intact. Cytochalasin B Binding Assay—Binding of cytochalasin B to GLUT9 was determined by a competitive cytochalasin B binding assay. Plasma membrane extracts from GLUT9-, GLUT4-, and empty vector-transfected HEK293 cells were processed as described (11Schurmann A. Doege H. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Buchs A. Joost H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding was initiated by adding 15 μg of plasma membranes (total volume of 30 μl) to a reaction mixture consisting of 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 μl of unlabeled cytochalasin B, and 20 μl of radiolabel mixture (2.5 μCi/ml [3H]cytochalasin B and 2.0 μCi/ml [14C]urea). Samples were placed on ice for 10 min, and membranes were pelleted at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and proteins were dissolved in 500 μl of BTS-450 tissue solubilizer (Beckman Coulter). After adding 10 ml of Ready Safe liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman Coulter), samples were counted in a scintillation counter for 3H and 14C. Nonspecific counts for cytochalasin B were corrected using [14C]urea. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression to determine Kd values using GraphPAD Prism Version 4.0 software. Genomic Organization and Structural Features of Human GLUT9 —The human GLUT9 gene, which maps to chromosome 4p15.3-p16, codes for two alternative RNAs (Fig. 1A). The original GLUT9 gene described by Phay et al. (9Phay J.E. Hussain H.B. Moley J.F. Genomics. 2000; 66: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) consists of 12 exons spanning 195 kb of the GLUT9 gene and codes for a 540-amino acid protein. Based on a sequence entry (NCBI accession number BC018897) and screening of human expressed sequence tags, we cloned an alternative splice variant of GLUT9 from human kidney cDNA, here referred to as GLUT9ΔN. The GLUT9ΔN splice variant consists of 13 exons spanning 215 kb of the GLUT9 gene and codes for a shorter putative protein of 512 amino acids. The two predicted proteins differ only in their N termini (Fig. 1B). The alternative splicing of the GLUT9 gene suggests that GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN are transcriptionally regulated by different promoters that are upstream of the corresponding exon 1 (12Ladd A.N. Cooper T.A. Genome Biology. 2002; http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/reviews/0008PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple protein alignments of the currently known GLUT protein sequences showed that GLUT9 belongs to the class II family of facilitative sugar transporters (see Fig. 8). Analysis of the deduced protein sequence for GLUT9 showed several motifs characteristic of the glucose transporter family such as the PESPR/PETK and GRR/GRL motifs in helices 6/12 and loops 2/8, respectively. Like the other members of the class II glucose transporter family, GLUT9 lacks the QLS motif in helix 7 (positions 279–281 of GLUT1) and the tryptophan residue corresponding to Trp388 in GLUT1. Furthermore, GLUT9 does not contain serine and threonine at the positions corresponding to amino acids 294 and 295 in GLUT1, respectively. A unique structural feature of GLUT9 is the replacement of two leucine residues in the large cytoplasmic loop with phenylalanine (positions 228 and 231 in GLUT1) and the replacement of leucine with threonine (position 278 in GLUT1). As for GLUT11, serine (position 285 in GLUT1) and phenylalanine (position 385 in GLUT1) are changed to cysteine and glycine, respectively. A specific motif of the class II family transporters is a PFI motif (PSI in GLUT7) in the last extracellular loop corresponding to amino acids 423–425 in GLUT1. Amino acids that were characterized to be involved in glucose transport and cytochalasin B binding by GLUT1 (4Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) differ in GLUT9 as well as in GLUT7 and GLUT11: Gln161, Val165, Gln282, Asn317, Glu329, Thr321, and Glu380 (Table I).Fig. 8Dendrogram of a multiple alignment of the human GLUT family members. All currently known human glucose transporter proteins were aligned using the ClustalW program. Two outliners (Drosophila melanogaster GLUT1 (drGlut1, NCBI database accession number NP_728558); and hexose transporter-1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (HXT1; NCBI database accession number NP_011962) were included in the alignment.

In contrast, mRNA for GLUT9ΔN was detected only in kidney and placenta (Fig. 2). To demonstrate endogenous expression of the GLUT9 protein in human tissues, we performed Western blot analysis of kidney membrane fractions using IgG-purified GLUT9 antiserum. A specific immunoreactive band was detected in plasma membrane and high density microsomal fractions in the range of 48–55 kDa (Fig. 3A). No signal was detected upon probing membranes with preimmune serum. Western blot analysis of kidney membrane fractions treated with peptide N-glycosidase F showed two bands at the molecular masses of deglycosylated GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN (Fig. 3B), indicating that both forms of GLUT9 are expressed as proteins in human tissue. To determine the localization of human GLUT9 in human tissues, we performed immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded as well as frozen kidney sections using an alkaline phosphatase detection system and immunofluorescence, respectively. We were able to show that GLUT9 is expressed in the proximal tubules (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining revealed that GLUT9 predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane in proximal tubule epithelial cells (Fig. 4B). Expression and Localization of Human GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN Proteins in Cell Lines—Using three different kidney-derived cell lines (COS-7, HEK293, and MDCK), we studied the effect of the two different N termini of human GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN on their subcellular localization. We first determined the immunoreactivity of our GLUT9 antiserum with the GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN proteins overexpressed in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN were detected in plasma membrane and high density microsomal fractions of likewise transfected cells, whereas empty vector-transfected cells did not show immunoreactivity in the corresponding area. Treatment of plasma membrane fractions with peptide N-glycosidase F revealed that GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN were highly glycosylated as shown by the shift in their molecular masses from a 55–60-kDa band to 45 kDa for GLUT9 and a from 48–55-kDa band to 42 kDa for GLUT9ΔN (Fig. 5B). To study the subcellular localization of GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN, we analyzed transiently transfected cells by confocal microscopy. In all three cell lines, GLUT9 localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6A), whereas a cell type-specific pattern was seen for GLUT9ΔN. In COS-7 cells, GLUT9ΔN remained intracellular, whereas in HEK293 cells, GLUT9ΔN localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in transiently transfected non-polarized MDCK cells, GLUT9ΔN showed a predominant vesicular pattern and as well as weak plasma membrane staining. Because GLUT9 is localized in human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells, we investigated whether GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN are targeted differentially in polarized MDCK cells, a well established epithelial cell model for the study of basolateral versus apical sorting of proteins. Staining of polarized MDCK cells stably expressing GLUT9 or GLUT9ΔN showed a striking difference in localization for the two proteins. Whereas GLUT9 was found exclusively in the basolateral membrane, GLUT9ΔN trafficked to the apical membrane of polarized MDCK cells (Fig. 6B). Functional Characterization of GLUT9 —Heterologous expression of GLUT9 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in deoxyglucose uptake compared with water-injected control oocytes. The transport mediated by GLUT9 was not inhibited by cytochalasin B. Compared with GLUT4-expressing oocytes, GLUT9 showed a lower overall uptake of deoxyglucose that was not inhibited by cytochalasin B (Fig. 7A). Immunofluorescent staining of Xenopus oocytes showed plasma membrane localization of GLUT9 (Fig. 7B). To further characterize the functional properties of GLUT9, we performed a cytochalasin B binding assay to determine whether GLUT9 binds cytochalasin B. Plasma membrane proteins from empty vector-, GLUT9-, and GLUT4-transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with radiolabeled cytochalasin B, and binding was assayed by competing with increasing concentrations of the unlabeled ligand. As illustrated in Fig. 7C, GLUT9-containing plasma membranes did not bind cytochalasin B and showed no difference in the binding curve compared with membranes from empty vector-transfected cells. The binding curve obtained for GLUT4 by nonlinear regression revealed a Kd value of 105.2 ± 16 nm (means ± S.D. from three replicates with r2 = 0.94), which is in the range of previously reported data (13Doege H. Bocianski A. Scheepers A. Axer H. Eckel J. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GLUT9 is a novel transporter protein that belongs to class II of the glucose transporter family. GLUT9 shows structural features that are conserved among all glucose transporter isoforms. These include the PESPR and PETK motifs after helices 6 and 12 and the GRK and GRR motifs in loops 2 and 8, respectively. A dendrogram aligning all human glucose transporter isoforms known today shows that the closest relatives of GLUT9 are GLUT5 and GLUT11 (Fig. 8). Comparison of amino acid residues in all isoforms that were found to be essential for GLUT1 function, glucose transport, and cytochalasin B binding (4Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reveals that members of the same class share homologies for those residues (Table I). Our characterization of GLUT9 shows that GLUT9 is a functional isoform, transporting deoxyglucose with a lower affinity compared with GLUT4. This transport was not inhibitable by cytochalasin B; and using a competitive binding assay, we showed that GLUT9 did not bind cytochalasin B. Because GLUT9 is targeted to the plasma membrane in Xenopus oocytes and is not retained intracellularly, uptake rates reflect maximum GLUT9-mediated transport. The absence of the QLS motif in GLUT9 might be responsible for the low transport rate for deoxyglucose, similar to its well characterized relative, GLUT5 (14Burant C.F. Takeda J. Brot-Laroche E. Bell G.I. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described for GLUT5, the transport of deoxyglucose is not inhibited by cytochalasin B (14Burant C.F. Takeda J. Brot-Laroche E. Bell G.I. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the transporter is not capable of binding cytochalasin B (15Inukai K. Katagiri H. Takata K. Asano T. Anai M. Ishihara H. Nakazaki M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4850-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another recently characterized member of the class II transporter family (GLUT11) transports glucose only at high glucose concentrations measured by reconstitution of the protein, and the transport is competed by fructose, suggesting that GLUT11 mediates fructose transport (13Doege H. Bocianski A. Scheepers A. Axer H. Eckel J. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GLUT11 shows a remarkably lower capacity for cytochalasin B binding compared with GLUT4 (13Doege H. Bocianski A. Scheepers A. Axer H. Eckel J. Joost H.G. Schurmann A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These data indicate that class II transporters share similar functional characteristics and lead us to suggest that another hexose than glucose might be the preferred substrate of GLUT9. Additional studies will focus on further characterizing the transport properties of GLUT9. A specific feature of GLUT9, reported thus far only for two other isoforms, GLUT11 (16Wu X. Li W. Sharma V. Godzik A. Freeze H.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 76: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Sasaki T. Minoshima S. Shiohama A. Shintani A. Shimizu A. Asakawa S. Kawasaki K. Shimizu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1218-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and GLUT14 (18Wu X. Freeze H.H. Genomics. 2002; 80: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is the presence of alternative splice variants expressed in a tissue-specific pattern. As for GLUT11 and GLUT14, alternative splicing of GLUT9 results in presumptive proteins that differ only in their N-terminal regions. Using an antibody directed against the C-terminal part of GLUT9 that does not distinguish between GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN, we showed that GLUT9 was expressed in human kidney proximal tubules, with a predominant staining of basolateral membranes. Although the expression of GLUT9 seems to account for basolateral staining, Western blot analysis of peptide N-glycosidase F-treated human kidney membrane fractions showed two bands resembling non-glycosylated GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN. Therefore, the two forms are expressed as proteins in human kidney. Studying the localization of GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN in three kidney-derived cell lines showed that GLUT9 trafficked to the plasma membrane in COS-7, HEK293, and MDCK cells. In contrast, GLUT9ΔN was retained intracellularly in COS-7 cells, whereas plasma membrane localization was seen in HEK293 cells and, upon polarization, in MDCK cells. Whereas COS-7 cells are fibroblasts, HEK293 and MDCK cells are epithelial, indicating that GLUT9ΔN harbors a targeting signal that specifically allows plasma membrane sorting in those cells. By overexpressing both splice variants in polarized MDCK cells, we showed that GLUT9 and GLUT9ΔN were differentially targeted to apical versus basolateral membranes, respectively. Interestingly, the N-terminal dileucine motif in GLUT9 does not retain the protein in an intracellular compartment, as seen for GLUT4, GLUT8, and GLUT12 (19Lisinski I. Schurmann A. Joost H.G. Cushman S.W. Al-Hasani H. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Ibberson M. Uldry M. Thorens B. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 18: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), indicating that other targeting motifs of GLUT9 direct its plasma membrane expression. Instead, the dileucine motif in GLUT9 might be responsible for its basolateral expression in MDCK cells, as seen for other proteins harboring this motif (23Miranda K.C. Khromykh T. Christy P. Le T.L.

However, residues other than the dileucine motif alone might be involved in basolateral targeting of glucose transporters in polarized MDCK cells since GLUT4 was shown to be retained in an intracellular compartment (26Pascoe W.S. Inukai K. Oka Y. Slot J.W. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C547-C554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have described for the first time that alternative splicing of a glucose transporter isoform results in differential targeting, a finding that has been described for other membrane proteins (27Quinones B. Riento K. Olkkonen V.M. Hardy S. Bennett M.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4291-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transporters (28Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18464-18470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Based on the characteristics of the class II glucose transporter family members with respect to their tissue- and cell-specific expression as well as their functional properties, these isoforms might be specialized in mediating vectorial transport of hexoses, preferentially fructose, in polarized cells and in particular epithelial cells. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of hexose transport in epithelial cells by alternative splicing, resulting in differential targeting.

T cell activation was mediated by the alphabeta T cell receptors and was specific for structure of the acyl and peptidic components of these antigens.

https://openalex.org/W2146915650,"Toll-like receptor-3 is critically involved in host defense against viruses through induction of type I interferons (IFNs). Recent studies suggest that a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TRIF) and two protein kinases (TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase (IKK)-ϵ) are critically involved in Toll-like receptor-3-mediated IFN-β production through activation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7. In this study, we demonstrate that TRIF interacts with both IRF-7 and IRF-3. In addition to TBK1 and IKKϵ, our results indicate that IKKβ can also phosphorylate IRF-3 and activate the IFN-stimulated response element. TRIF-induced IRF-3 and IRF-7 activation was mediated by TBK1 and its downstream kinases IKKβ and IKKϵ.

In addition, TRIF also induced apoptosis through a RIP/FADD/caspase-8-dependent and mitochondrion-independent pathway.

Upon ligand stimulation, a TIR domain-containing adapter protein such as MyD88 is recruited to the receptor signaling complex (4Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L.

Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Once IRAK is recruited to the receptor complex, it is activated and then dissociated from the receptor complex (7Cao Z. Yiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Dissociated IRAK interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), which then activates NF-κB through a kinase cascade containing transforming growth factor-β-associated kinase-1 and IκB kinase (IKK) (7Cao Z.

Biol. 2001; 7: 2475-2484Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Gene knockout studies suggest that MyD88 is required for cytokine induction triggered by a variety of ligands that signal through the TIR family members, such as IL-1β, IL-18, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2, CpG DNA, and poly(I·C) (11Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation induced by poly(I·C) (ligand for TLR3) and LPS (ligand for TLR4) is delayed (but not abolished) in MyD88-/- cells. In addition, poly(I·C) and LPS still trigger dendritic cell maturation (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3899) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that MyD88-independent pathways exist.Recently, three additional TIR domain-containing adapter molecules (TIRAP/Mal, TRIF/TICAM, and TIRP) were identified (12Bin L.-H. Xu L.-G.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). TIRAP is associated with TLR4. A dominant-negative mutant of TIRAP inhibits NF-κB activation triggered by TLR4, but not by TLR9 or the IL-1 receptor (13Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 14Horng T. Barton G. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene knockout studies indicate that TIRAP is essential for LPS-induced cytokine production, suggesting that TIRAP is required for TLR4 signaling. It has also been shown that TIRAP is involved in signaling triggered by ligands for TLR1, TRL2, and TLR6, but not by IL-1, IL-18, and ligands for TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 (17Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2002; 420: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 18Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar).TRIF is the third identified TIR domain-containing adapter molecule. In addition to NF-κB, TRIF also activates the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)/interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter. A dominant-negative mutant of TRIF inhibits TLR2-, TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR7-mediated NF-κB activation and TLR3-mediated activation of the IFN-β promoter (15Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). So far, TRIF is the only TIR domain-containing adapter protein that has been implied in TLR3-mediated production of IFN-β, suggesting that TRIF is involved in TLR3-induced activation of NF-κB as well as IFN-β.Recently, TRIF-deficient mice were produced by gene knockout and chemical mutagenesis approaches (19Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that TRIF-deficient mice are defective in both TLR3- and TLR4-mediated expression of IFN-β. Inflammatory cytokine production in response to the TLR4 ligand (but not to other TLR ligands) is severely impaired in TRIF-deficient macrophages. The major signaling pathways leading to production of inflammatory cytokines involve the transcription factor NF-κB and various mitogen-activated protein kinases. It was shown that TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation is severely impaired in TRIF-/- fibroblasts, suggesting that TRIF plays a major role in TLR3-induced NF-κB activation. In contrast, TLR4-mediated NF-κB and JNK activation is not significantly impaired in either MyD88- or TRIF-deficient fibroblasts. However, double knockout of MyD88 and TRIF completely abolishes TLR4-induced NF-κB and JNK activation (19Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar), suggesting that MyD88 and TRIF are mutually required for TLR4-induced NF-κB and JNK activation.Interestingly, although poly(I·C)-induced tumor necrosis factor production is abolished in all macrophages, LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor production is abolished only in a fraction of macrophages (19Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). These data suggest that LPS response in a subset of macrophages is TRIF-independent. Because LPS response in all macrophages is MyD88-dependent, it has been proposed that an unknown adapter protein functioning downstream of MyD88 may be involved in LPS signaling in TRIF-independent cells (19Hoebe K. Du X. Georgel P. Janssen E. Tabeta K. Kim S.O. Goode J. Lin P. Mann N. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Han J. Beutler B. Nature. 2003; 424: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In this context, the recently identified protein TIRP (12Bin L.-H. Xu L.-G. Shu H.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is mostly related to TRIF, provides a candidate adapter for the TRIF-independent signaling in the subset of macrophages.Although TRIF contains a TIR domain, its amino acid sequence is very divergent from other TIR domain-containing adapter protein sequences. The unique sequence and functions of TRIF suggest that it may interact with distinct downstream signaling proteins. It has been shown that TRIF interacts with IRF-3 to activate IFN-β (16Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that two serine/threonine protein kinases (IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1)) can phosphorylate IRF-3 and are involved in TRIF-induced IRF-3 activation (21Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar, 22Sharma S. tenOever B.R.

In this work, we show that TRIF induces ISRE and NF-κB activation and apoptosis through distinct intracellular signaling pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) (Sigma) and Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) epitopes, the caspase inhibitor ZAD-fm (Enzyme Systems, Livermore, CA), and Sendai virus (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To construct a TRIF bait vector, a cDNA encoding full-length TRIF was inserted in-frame into the Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).

The NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct was provided by Dr. Gary Johnson (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). The IFN-β-luciferase reporter construct was made by PCR amplification of the human IFN-β promoter fragment (-300 to +25) and cloning into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The NF-κB site-mutated IFN-β promoter-luciferase reporter construct was made by PCR.Mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-TRAF6, FLAG-TRAF6-DN, Myc-IKKβ, Myc-IKKβ-KA, FADD-DN, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1, Bcl-2, CrmA, and IκBα(SS/AA) (Dr. David Goeddel, Tularik Inc.); FLAG-IRAK1(K239S), FLAG-IRAK4-KA, and Myc-MyD88 (Dr. Zhaodan Cao, Tularik Inc.); p53mut (Dr. Bert Vogelstein, John Hopkins University); FLAG-IRF-3 and pCMV-BL-IRF-3/5D (Dr. John Hiscott, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research); and Myc-IKKϵ, Myc-IKKϵ-KA, Myc-TBK1, and Myc-TBK1-KA (Dr. Uli Siebenlist, National Institutes of Health) were provided by the indicated investigators. Mammalian expression plasmids for HA-tagged receptor-interacting protein (RIP), caspase-8(C360S), and FLAG- and HA-tagged TRIF and TIRAP were described previously (12Bin L.-H. Xu L.-G. Shu H.-B. J.

Mammalian expression plasmids for HA-tagged TRIF deletion mutants, HA-IRF-7, FLAG-IRF-7ΔN, FLAG-IRF-3ΔN, and FLAG-IRF-3/5D were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequent cloning into a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector containing a 5′-HA or 5′-FLAG-tag.Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate; and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Approximately 16 h after transfection, luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen) following the manufacturer's protocol. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activities.All reporter gene assays were repeated at least three times. Data shown are the average from one representative experiment. The S.D. values were <10% of the average values for all samples.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 293 cells (∼2 × 106) were transfected for 24 h. Transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (15 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody or control mouse IgG and 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of GammaBind G Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and 500 mm NaCl. The precipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and subsequent Western blot analysis was performed as described (12Bin L.-H. Xu L.-G. Shu H.-B. J. Biol.

All immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated at least three times, and similar data were obtained.In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cell transfection and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and then incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer plus 100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The beads were spun down and washed once with kinase buffer. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography.Apoptosis Assays—β-Galactosidase cotransfection assays for determination of cell death were performed as described (23Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.G.

Briefly, cells (∼1 × 105/well) were seeded on 12-well dishes and transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase and 1 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. Where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection received the same amount of total DNA. In the same experiment, each transfection was performed in duplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with X-gal as described previously (23Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

The numbers of surviving blue cells from five representative viewing fields were counted under a microscope. The dead cells with a shrunk and condensed morphology were not counted. Data from one of at least three representative experiments are shown.Sendai Virus Infection—293 cells (∼2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well dishes and transfected the next day with 0.5 μg of ISRE reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were washed with medium lacking fetal calf serum (washing medium) and then overlaid with washing medium containing Sendai virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, non-adsorbed viruses were removed by repeated washing of the cells. Cells were then cultured in fetal calf serum-containing medium for 18 h before luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed.DNA Fragmentation Assays—Transfected cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2% Nonidet P-40 containing 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. DNA in the lysate was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The pellets were dissolved in H2O and analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% gel.RESULTSTRIF Interacts with IRF-7 and IRF-3—To unambiguously identify TRIF-interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human B cell cDNA library with full-length TRIF as bait. We screened a total of ∼2 × 106 independent library clones and obtained 20 β-galactosidase-positive clones. One of the clones encodes the C-terminal domain (amino acids 297-503) of IRF-7. Previously, it has been shown that IRF-3 interacts with TRIF (15Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether IRF-7 is involved in TRIF signaling.We first determined whether the IRF-7 fragment obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening, which lacks its N-terminal DNA-binding domain (IRF-7ΔN), interacts with TRIF. We transfected expression plasmids for TRIF and IRF-7ΔN into 293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicate that TRIF interacted with IRF-7ΔN (Fig. 1A). In the same experiments, TIRAP (but not MyD88) also interacted with IRF-7ΔN (Fig. 1A). In similar experiments, TRIF also interacted with full-length IRF-7 (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that TRIF can interact with IRF-7. In these experiments, cleaved fragments of IRF-7 and IRF-7ΔN were also detected (Fig. 1, A and B).TRIF is a 712-amino acid protein that contains a large N-terminal domain, a middle TIR domain, and a C-terminal domain. To determine which domain of TRIF is responsible for interaction with IRF-7, we made a series of deletion mutants, including TRIF-(1-394) (containing its N-terminal domain), TRIF-(1-532) (containing its N-terminal and middle TIR domains), TRIF-(394-712) (containing its middle TIR and C-terminal domains), and TRIF-(532-712) (containing its C-terminal domain). 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged IRF-7 and FLAG-tagged TRIF mutants, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The results indicate that TRIF-(1-532) and TRIF-(394-712) (but not TRIF-(1-394) and TRIF-(532-712)) interacted with IRF-7 (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that the TIR domain of TRIF is required for its interaction with IRF-7. Similarly, TRIF and TIRAP (but not MyD88) interacted with IRF-3 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1D), and this interaction required the TIR domain of TRIF (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data suggest that IRF-7 and IRF-3 are involved in signaling by TRIF and TIRAP, but not by MyD88.IRF-7 and IRF-3 Are Involved in TRIF-induced IFN-β and ISRE Activation—It has been shown that TRIF can mediate TLR3- and TLR4-induced IFN-β activation (15Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). To examine the roles of IRF-7 and IRF-3 in TRIF-mediated IFN-β activation, we performed reporter gene assays. We found that overexpression of IRF-7 or IRF-3 alone barely activated the IFN-β promoter, but both could synergize with TRIF in activating IFN-β (Fig. 2A). Because the IFN-β promoter contains an NF-κB-binding site (28Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) in addition to two ISRE-binding sites, we mutated the NF-κB site in the IFN-β promoter and determined whether IRF-7 or IRF-3 could synergize with TRIF to activate the mutated IFN-β promoter. We found that mutation of the NF-κB-binding site greatly decreased TRIF-induced IFN-β activation, from ∼180- to ∼3-fold (Fig. 2B). However, IRF-3 or IRF-7 could still synergize with TRIF to activate the NF-κB-binding site-mutated IFN-β promoter (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2IRF-7 and IRF-3 are involved in TRIF-induced IFN-β and ISRE activation. A, TRIF synergizes with IRF-3 and IRF-7 to activate the IFN-β promoter. 293 cells (∼2 × 105) were transfected with the pGL3-IFN-β-luciferase reporter construct (0.3 μg) and expression plasmids for TRIF and IRF-3 or IRF-7 (1 μg each). Luciferase assays were performed 18 h after transfection. B, TRIF synergizes with IRF-3 and IRF-7 to activate the NF-κB site-mutated IFN-β promoter. The experiments were performed as described for A, except that the wild-type IFN-β reporter was replaced with the NF-κB site-mutated IFN-β reporter (IFNβΔκB). C, effects of IRF-3ΔN, IRF-7ΔN, CrmA, and IκBα(SS/AA) on TRIF-induced IFN-β activation. 293 cells (∼2 × 105) were transfected with the pGL3-IFN-β-luciferase reporter construct (0.3 μg), expression plasmids for TRIF, and the indicated plasmids (1 μg). Luciferase assays were performed 18 h after transfection. D, effects of IRF-3ΔN, IRF-7ΔN, CrmA, and IκBα(SS/AA) on TRIF-induced ISRE activation. The experiments were performed as described for C, except that the ISRE-luciferase reporter construct was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then determined the effects of IRF-7 and IRF-3 lacking their DNA-binding domains (mutants IRF-7ΔN and IRF-3ΔN, respectively) on TRIF-induced IFN-β activation. In reporter gene assays, both IRF-7ΔN and IRF-3ΔN strongly inhibited TRIF-induced IFN-β activation (Fig. 2C). Because TRIF activates NF-κB and induces apoptosis (see below), we determined whether CrmA and a non-degradable IκBα mutant, which inhibit TRIF-induced apoptosis and NF-κB activation, respectively (see below), could inhibit TRIF-induced IFN-β activation.

https://openalex.org/W2130956052,"DsbA, a thioredoxin superfamily member, introduces disulfide bonds into newly translocated proteins. This process is thought to occur via formation of mixed disulfide complexes between DsbA and its substrates. However, these complexes are difficult to detect, probably because of their short-lived nature. Here we show that it is possible to detect such covalent intermediates in vivo by a mutation in DsbA that alters cis proline-151. Further, this mutant allowed us to identify substrates of DsbA. Alteration of the cis proline, highly conserved among thioredoxin superfamily members, may be useful for the detection of substrates and intermediate complexes in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W2055409856,"Diffusion of oxygen molecules on transition metal oxide surfaces plays a vital role for the understanding of catalysis and photocatalysis on these materials. By means of time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we provide evidence for a charge transfer-induced diffusion mechanism for O2 molecules adsorbed on a rutile TiO2(110) surface. The O2 hopping rate depended on the number of surface donors (oxygen vacancies), which determines the density of conduction band electrons. These results may have implications for the understanding of oxidation processes on metal oxides in general."
https://openalex.org/W1996799677,"A cell synchronization protocol was established in which global and individual mRNA translational efficiencies could be examined. While global translational efficiency was reduced in mitotic cells, ∼3% of mRNAs remained predominantly associated with large polysomes during mitosis, as determined by cDNA microarray analyses. The 5′-non-coding regions of six mRNAs were shown to contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRES).

Cells of higher organisms can regulate gene expression at the translational level in response to a wide variety of stimuli and conditions. While much is known about the control of translational initiation and elongation in response to nutritional deprivation (1Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Google Scholar, 2Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Google Scholar) and environmental stress (2Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Google Scholar), the role of translational control in mammalian cell cycle progression is not well understood. It has long been known that specific proteins are needed at specific times during the cell cycle to ensure cell cycle progression. For the most part, the expression of these cell cycle-specific proteins is thought to be regulated at the transcriptional or posttranslational level (3Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Google Scholar). In cultured mammalian cells arrested at G2 and M phases, the rate of total protein synthesis was markedly decreased to about 25% of the rate in non-arrested, cycling cells (4Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Google Scholar). This reduction was shown to be, at least partly, due to inhibition of the initiation step of polypeptide synthesis (4Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Google Scholar, 5Fan H. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 655-670Google Scholar, 6Tarnowka M.A. Baglioni C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 99: 359-367Google Scholar). Subsequently, several eukaryotic initiation factors that regulate the assembly of 40 S ribosomes at the 5′ ends of capped mRNAs were observed to change their phosphorylation status (7Pyronnet S. Dostie J. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2083-2093Google Scholar, 8Pyronnet S. Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 13-18Google Scholar, 9Heesom K.J. Gampel A. Mellor H. Denton R.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1374-1379Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed likely that inhibition of translation initiation was caused by diminishing ribosome recruitment to capped mRNAs during mitosis. Viral mRNAs whose translation is initiated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; NCR, non-coding region; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase. 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; NCR, non-coding region; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase. mechanism (10Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar), such as polioviral and hepatitis C viral mRNAs (4Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Google Scholar, 11Cornelis S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 243-245Google Scholar) or mRNAs which lack significant structures in their 5′-non-coding regions (5′-NCRs), such as the mRNAs containing the late leader of adenovirus (15Huang J.T. Schneider R.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 271-280Google Scholar), were found to be selectively translated during mitosis due to their lessened requirement for eIF4F. More recently, additional IRES-containing mRNAs, those encoding ornithine decarboxylase and kinase p58PITSLRE, have been reported to be selectively translated during G2/M of the cell cycle in cultured cells (11Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Van Huffel S. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Google Scholar, 12Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Google Scholar). These findings raise the question whether all IRES-containing genes are preferentially translated during mitosis and whether any of these encoded products play roles in cell cycle progression. We have begun to address these questions by genomic analysis of cellular mRNAs that are associated with mitotic polysomes and are, thus, predicted to be translated during the overall translation repression in mitosis. We determined that many, but not all, IRES elements are present in mRNAs which are selectively translated during mitosis. Cell Synchronization and Transfection Protocols—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). To synchronize cells at the G1/S boundary, cells were treated at 50% confluence with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) or 5 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma). After 16 h, cells were washed and fed with fresh medium for 6 h before the addition of either 0.6 μg/ml colcemid (Invitrogen) or nocodazole (Sigma; Ref. 16Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. McIntosh J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Google Scholar). Synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry analysis after DNA staining with propidium iodide. To measure protein synthesis rates in non-synchronized and mitotic arrested cells, cells were incubated in DMEM with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min. Extracts were prepared and processed as described previously (17Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Google Scholar). DNA plasmids were transfected into 50–60% confluent cells with the Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). After a 24-h incubation, luciferase assays were performed or RNA samples for Northern analyses were prepared. Indirect Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were grown on 12-mm coverslips, fixed for 5 min in 100% methanol at -20 °C, and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Triton X-100. Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% calf serum for 40 min at 25 °C. Coverslips were then incubated with diluted rat antibodies against α-tubulin (a gift from P. Jackson, Stanford University) in IF buffer (PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing, coverslips were inverted into the IF buffer with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody for 30 min at 25 °C. Cover slips were washed twice with PBS, and once with PBS containing 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, drained, and mounted in vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) onto glass slides. Cells were viewed using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescent microscope. Pictures were acquired using a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera and Image Pro plus software with 40× or 60× objectives. 5′ RACE and Dicistronic Plasmid Constructions—The 5′ NCRs of selected mRNA species were converted to cDNA copies using the First-Choice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion). The DNA fragments were amplified by the Advantage-GC PCR kit (Clontech) and directly cloned into PCR2.1-topo vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of all inserted fragments were obtained. The 5′ NCRs were amplified by the PCR with 5′ primer containing EcoRI sequences and 3′ primers containing NcoI sequences. These fragments were inserted into dicistronic SV40/T7 plasmid, c-53, between EcoRI and NcoI sites, or a T7 promoter-containing dicistronic vector, c-84, as described previously (18Carter M.S. Sarnow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28301-28307Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed as described previously (17Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Google Scholar). Radio-labeled DNA hybridization probes were generated using the RadPrime Kit (Invitrogen). Polysomal Analysis—Polysomal mRNA was prepared as described previously (17Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide for 3 min at 37 °C before being harvested. Non-synchronized control cells were washed with PBS, harvested directly on the plate in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mg/ml heparin), and transfered to Eppendorf tubes. The mitotic cells were shaken off from plates and pelleted at 1000 rpm for 3 min. Mitotic cells were washed in PBS and lysed in lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto 10–50% sucrose gradients composed of same extraction buffer lacking Triton X-100. The gradients were sedimented at 35,000 rpm for 160 min in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions of equal volumes were collected from the top using an ISCO fraction collector system. RNAs were collected in 4 m guanidine HCl, precipitated after addtion of ethanol, and resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Analyses—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was detected with antibody number SC7150 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (19Gustin K.E. Sarnow P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8787-8796Google Scholar). To examine newly synthesized proteins, cells were grown in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h and metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine in DMEM (lacking methionine-cysteine) with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min. Labeled cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Equal amount of protein extracts, determined with the Bio-Rad protein reagent, were incubated with mouse anti-nucleophosmin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and anti-vimentin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies and agarose-protein A/G plus beads according to the procedure recommended by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The agarose beads-attached proteins were recovered by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and separated on SDS gels. The gels were dried and enhanced with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) before exposed to a phosphoimager screen. Quantification was performed using a STORM phosphoimager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled cDNA for Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Equal volume amounts of RNAs from pooled polysomal fractions were used to generate fluorescently labeled DNA probes as described (www.cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown). The human cDNA microarrays contained a set of ∼43,000 human cDNA clones, manufactured at Stanford University as described (www.cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown). The microarrays were scanned on a Axon laser scanner and analyzed using ScanAlyze (available at www.rana.lbl.gov/). The computed data were entered and further analyzed in Stanford Microarray Data Base (www.genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD/). Only genes for which the fluorescence signal in each channel exceeded certain cutoffs (including regression correlation, signal-noise ratio, signal intensity, and the tolerance of missing data among multiple measurements) were retrieved from the Stanford Microarray Data Base for the deterimation of the microarray distribution score S(x) (see Fig. 3) and significant analysis of microarray. To identify the individual candidates, three interphase arrays and three mitotic (thymidine/colcemid) arrays were applied to significant analysis of microarray (significant analysis of microarray; available at www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) analysis, which employs permutation of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate. Reduction of Protein Synthesis in G2/M-arrested HeLa Cells—To investigate translational control during mitosis, HeLa cells were synchronized in mitosis by a sequential block with thymidine and colcemid or with thymidine and nocodazole. Mitotic cells were shaken off from the plates, and the efficiency of synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. About 80–90% of cells treated with thymidine-colcemid or thymidine-nocadozole displayed a double content of DNA, confirming their arrest (Fig. 1A). To identify the specific mitotic phase in which cells were arrested, the microtubule structure of thymidine/colcemid-arrested cells and non-synchronized cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies directed against α-tubulin (Fig. 1B). Loss of functional spindle structures and condensed chromosomes in treated cells revealed that these mitotic cells were arrested at prophase or premetaphase of mitosis. To compare the translational efficiencies in mitotically arrested and non-synchronized cells, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and the incorporation of radio-labeled amino acids was measured. As reported previously (4Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11134-11139Google Scholar), both thymidine/colcemid- and thymidine/nocodazole-arrested cells showed a reduced incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids compared with non-synchronized cells (Fig. 1C). It has been recently reported that many synchronization protocols can induce apoptosis (20Gallaher B.W. Berthold A. Klammt J. Knupfer M. Kratzsch J. Bartsch M. Kiess W. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-grand). 2000; 46: 79-88Google Scholar, 21Puntoni F. Villa-Moruzzi E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 279-283Google Scholar). To examine whether the synchronization protocols used here triggered cells to enter apoptosis, caspase-induced cleavage of PARP was measured. Fig. 1D shows that little cleavage of PARP occurred in either thymidine/colcemid- or thymidine/nocodazole-treated cells. In contrast, notable amount of PARP was cleaved in another synchronization protocol, i.e. treatment of cells with aphidicolin and colcemid. These findings suggest that the global reduction of protein biosynthesis that was observed in thymidine/colcemide- and thymidine-nocodazole-treated cells was not a result of ongoing apoptosis. Reduced Association of Cellular mRNAs with Mitotic Polysomes—To examine the translation status of both total and individual mRNAs, cytoplasmic extracts from interphasic- and mitotic-arrested cells were fractionated in sucrose gradients (17Johannes G. Sarnow P. RNA. 1998; 4: 1500-1513Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that, in non-synchronized cells, most ribosomes were associated with mRNAs, sedimenting with polysomal fractions 8–10. In contrast, most ribosomes in mitotic extracts had dissociated from mRNAs, sedimenting as free 40 and 60 S subunits (Fig. 2). This finding argues for mitotic inhibition at the initiation step of translation. To monitor the association of individual mRNAs with ribosomes, the distribution of individual mRNAs in the polysome gradient was visualized by Northern blot analysis using gene-specific hybridization probes. mRNAs encoding β-actin and transforming growth factor-β were mostly associated with fractions 10 and 9, respectively, in non-synchronized cells. In contrast, these mRNAs shifted to the lower molecular weight fractions in mitotically arrested cells, indicating that these mRNAs were less efficiently translated in mitosis than in interphase. Identification of Mammalian mRNAs Species That Are Preferentially Associated with Mitotic Polysomes—To identify individual mRNA species which are selectively translated during mitosis, the polysomal distribution of mRNAs was examined using human cDNA microarray analyses (22Kuhn K.M. DeRisi J.L. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 916-927Google Scholar, 23Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Google Scholar). Specifically, the amount of individual cDNAs obtained from RNA in fractions 4–7 was compared with that obtained from RNA in polysomal fractions 9 and 10 (Fig. 2). Statistical analyses indicated (Fig. 3) that the majority of mRNAs shifted toward the lower molecular weight polysomal fractions during mitosis, arguing that the mitotic sedimentation profiles of β-actin and transforming growth factor-β mRNAs (Fig. 2) reflected an overall diminished association with ribosomes of mRNAs. However, at least 3% of the mRNA species (49 genes out of 1494 genes) continued to be associated with similar or more numbers of ribosomes in mitotic extracts, determined both by statistical analysis (Fig. 3) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Selected positive candidate genes are listed in Table I. Approximately one-third of these genes encode nuclear proteins, many of which are predicted to play roles in RNA metabolism (Table I).Table ISelective candidates of polysomal-associated mRNAs during mitosis identified by cDNA microarraysGene nameIMAGE IDTranslation Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ, 125,988 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit 10 (θ, 150/170 kDa)147,379 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B147,275Membrane and secreted proteins Tumor rejection anitgen (gp96)26,519 Glucose regulated protein, 58 kDa (GRP58)135,083 Calnexin268,178 Immediate early response 3810,724Nuclear proteins RAN-binding protein 778,695 Parathymosin81,0871/20,7029/809,603aMultiple IMAGE clones of a same gene on the DNA microarrays were identified as polysomal-associated candidates during mitosis Polymerase I and transcript release factor809,473Nuclear RNA-binding proteins Nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin) (NPM1)884,301 Nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1)275,871Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich, 46-kDa (SRP46)416,951DEAD/H (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp/His) box polypeptide 5 (RNA helicase, 68 kDa)126,775PAI-1 mRNA-binding protein268,178/236,055aMultiple IMAGE clones of a same gene on the DNA microarrays were identified as polysomal-associated candidates during mitosisSjogren syndrome antigen B (autoantigen La) (La)49,970Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B (hnRNPA/B)345,833Structure proteins Vimentin840,511Signaling proteins ras homolog gene family, member B277,305Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61)378,488Misc/others Amyloid β (A4) precursor protein (protease nexin-II, Alzheimers disease) (ABETA)526,616/856,575aMultiple IMAGE clones of a same gene on the DNA microarrays were identified as polysomal-associated candidates during mitosisHeat shock 70-kDa protein 8884,719/209,383/951,287aMultiple IMAGE clones of a same gene on the DNA microarrays were identified as polysomal-associated candidates during mitosisHeat shock 70-kDa protein 4856,567a Multiple IMAGE clones of a same gene on the DNA microarrays were identified as polysomal-associated candidates during mitosis Open table in a new tab We further substantiated the polysomal distribution of some of the mRNAs identified in the microaray analyses by Northern blot analysis using gene-specific hybridization probes. In contrast to β-actin mRNAs, mRNAs encoding the glucose regulated 58-kDa protein (GRP58), nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1-L1), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and the autoantigen La sedimented with the same polysomal fractions in non-synchronized and arrested cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast to the findings reported by Pyronnet et al. (12Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Google Scholar), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA shifted, like β-actin mRNA, to lower molecular weight polysomal fractions during mitosis (Fig. 4, A and B). Specifically, the majority ODC mRNAs was associated with ∼4–5 ribosomes (fraction 9) in non-synchronized cells. However, the bulk of ODC mRNA associated with only 1–3 ribosomes (fractions 7 and 8) in mitotically arrested cells. While the reason for this discrepancy is not known, different cell lines or cell synchonization protocols may have accounted for the observed difference. To determine whether mRNAs associated with polysomes during mitosis were translated, we measured the relative translational efficiencies of nucleophosmin, vimentin, and La mRNAs in non-synchronized and mitotis-arrested cells. Translation efficiency was defined as the amount of newly synthesized protein compared with total translational efficiency during mitosis. The amounts of total nucleophosmin, vimentin, and La mRNAs were very similar in non-synchronized and mitotic extracts. While the translational efficiencies of nucleophosmin and La mRNAs were somewhat enhanced during mitosis, the mitotic translational efficiency of vimentin mRNA was more pronounced (Fig. 5, A and B) compared with the bulk of cellular mRNAs. These findings argue that the polysomal association of these mRNAs reflected translation by ribosomes. mRNAs Preferentially Translated during Mitosis Contain IRES Elements—The cDNA microarray analyses identified two genes known to contain IRES elements that were preferentially translated during mitosis. Specifically, La and Cyr61 mRNAs were previously identified to be associated with polysomes during poliovirus infection (23Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Google Scholar). To examine whether the 5′-NCRs of identified mitotic polysomal-associated mRNAs could mediate cap-independent translation via an IRES-mediated mechanism, cDNA copies of the 5′-NCRs of several identified candidate mRNAs were obtained by 5′ RACE (Table II). As expected (10Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Google Scholar), there were no strong primary consensus sequences among them by multiple or pairwise alignment analyses. Also, the 5′-NCRs were of the same length and similar GC nucleotide content than the average mammalian mRNA. For comparison, cDNA copies were obtained from six mRNAs that represented the majority of cellular mRNAs that were not associated with polysomes during mitosis (β-actin, PMSA1, CSTB, HNRPA1, NUBS, and RPS5).Table IISummary of 5′-NCRs None of these 5′-non-coding regions contains AUG codons.GeneGene symbol5′-NCR lengthGC content%mRNA species that remain associated with a similar number of polysomes during mitosis Sjogren syndrome autoantigen B, LaLa10562.8 Cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61Cyr 6122378.0NucleophosminNPM19759.8Nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1NAP1L113963.4Amyloid β A4 precursor protein (ABETA)ABETA14776.0Glucose-regulated protein, 58 kDaGRP5811375.9Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/BhnRNPA/B22373.9VimentinVimentin14676.7mRNA species that are associated with fewer ribosomes during mitosis β-ActinACT8774.7 Proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha1 (NM 002786)PMAS110358.5Cystatin B (NM-00010)CSTB10973.4Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (X12671)HNRPA110457.9NADH-ubiquinone dehydrogenase 1 β subcomplex (AF2610900)NDUFB8472.4Ribosomal protein S5 (NM 001009)RPS55364.3 Open table in a new tab The cDNAs encoding the various 5′-NCRs were inserted between two cistrons in dicistronic plasmids, which can direct the expression of dicistronic mRNAs that contain the coding regions for Renilla and firefly luciferase as the first and second cistrons, respectively (Fig. 6A) (23Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Google Scholar). The first, Renilla luciferase, cistron is predicted to be translated by a cap-dependent initiation mechanism, while the second, firefly luciferase, cistron should be translated if preceded by an IRES element. The various dicistronic plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells and luciferase activities were measured. The six 5′-NCRs of mRNAs that were associated with fewer ribosomes in mitosis than in non-synchronized cells expressed the second cistron firefly luciferase either similarly or in 2–3-fold higher amounts as the dicistronic control mRNA construct that lacked an intergenic inserted region (Fig. 6B). Therefore, these 5′-NCRs did not contain significant IRES activities. In contrast, six out of seven 5′-NCRs from preferentially mitotic polysome-associated mRNAs significantly promoted the expression of firefly luciferase encoded in the second cistron, yielding 7–30-fold higher rates than seen in cells transfected with dicistronic actin 5′-NCR-containing mRNAs (Fig. 6B). To examine whether expression of the second cistron resulted from functionally monocistronic transcripts generated by nuclease activity, cryptic splicing, or expression of an unknown promoter in the insert 5′-NCR-encoding cDNA, the size and integrity of expressed dicistronic mRNAs from transfected cells were inspected by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 6C shows that each plasmid directed the synthesis of predominantely full-length mRNAs, arguing that full-length dicistronic mRNAs were the major templates for the second cistron translation. To test this hypothesis more rigorously, the SV40 promoters were deleted in all plasmids and luciferase activities were measured after transfection of these promoterless plasmids into cells. All but one of the constructs expressed little to no luciferase activity (data not shown). Surprisingly, the NAP1L1 leader cDNA sequences could mediate second cistron translation at the level of 10-fold higher than background (data not shown), demonstrating that smaller mRNAs may have contributed to the translation of the second firefly luciferase cistron in this case. This finding exemplifies that by Northern analysis an undetectable amount of functional monocistronic RNA can be generated in the dicistronic assay system, and additional control experiments are warranted to claim IRES activity. To test whether the 5′-NCR of NAP1L1 mRNA carried a bona fide IRES activity, full-length dicistronic control, and NAP1L1- or NPM1-NCR-containing mRNAs were generated in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase, and mRNAs were translated in HeLa S10 translation extracts. Fig. 6D shows that relative expression level of the second cistron in dicistronic NAP1L1-containing mRNA was more than 100-fold higher than in mRNAs lacking intercistronic sequences. This finding suggests that the NAP1L1 leader does contain IRES activity that is significantly higher than the various control 5′-NCRs (Fig. 6B). Overall, these findings indicate that IRES activities can be active during mitosis when translation of the bulk of the cellular mRNAs has declined. We have studied translational control in mitotically arrested HeLa cells using cell synchronization protocols that minimized the accumulation of apoptotic cells. Specifically, we examined whether selected individual mRNAs could be preferentially translated during the global translational repression during mitosis. To this end, polysomal mRNAs were analyzed by cDNA microarray analysis. The ribosome density on a particular mRNA was used as the indicator of the relative translational efficiency of the mRNA. By separating the mRNAs into non-polysomal fractions and polysomal fractions and comparing their relative abundance by microarray analysis, we examined the translation state of individual mRNAs in non-synchronized cells and mitotically arrested cells. The 5′-NCRs of selected mitotic polysome-associated mRNAs were 100–200 nucleotides in length (Table II). Six out of seven of those selected leader sequences functioned as IRES elements in dicistronic assays, suggesting that internal initiation is more efficient than cap-dependent initiation during mitosis. One possibility to this selective translational control is that cap-dependent and internal translation compete with each other for components of the translation apparatus. Many of the mRNAs which were associated with mitotic polysomes encoded nuclear RNA binding proteins, such as the La autoantigen or hnRNPA. Because certain nuclear RNA-binding proteins have been identified to stimulate IRES activity, such as La and hnRNPC (24Kim J.H. Paek K.Y. Choi K. Kim T.D. Hahm B. Kim K.T. Jang S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 708-720Google Scholar, 25Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 499-511Google Scholar, 26Sella O. Gerlitz G. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5429-5440Google Scholar), selective up-regulation of IRES-containing mRNAs could be favored by the increased accessibility of these nuclear factors during mitosis. The target IRES-containing mRNAs may encode proteins that are important to aid in cell cycle progression and facilitate specific IRES-mediated translation during mitosis in an autoregulatory manner. However, not all of the known cellular IRES-containing messages were associated with mitotic polysomes. For example, whereas IRES-contanining La (18Carter M.S. Sarnow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28301-28307Google Scholar) and Cyr61 (23Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13118-13123Google Scholar) mRNAs were preferentially detected in polysomal fractions during mitosis, IRES-containing c-Myc (27Stoneley M. Paulin F.E. Le Quesne J.P. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Google Scholar, 28Nanbru C. Lafon I. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Huez G. Prats A.C. J. Biol.

These findings seem to be, at first glance, at odds with observations reported by Pyronnet and Sonenberg (8Pyronnet S. Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 13-18Google Scholar) who used a sequential thymidine and aphidiolin block to synchronize HeLa cells at S phase, following cell cycle progression through the G2/M phase after release of the drugs. Synthesis of ODC protein peaked 8 h after release from S phase, but dropped dramatically thereafter (12Pyronnet S. Pradayrol L. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 607-616Google Scholar). It is possible that the up-regulation of ODC mRNA and protein occurred in G2, before cells entered mitosis. Because we focused in the present study on the translation activity of mRNAs in cells arrested in mitosis, up-regulation of ODC in G2 would have not been scored in our assays. Nevertheless, it is clear from all studies (8Pyronnet S. Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 13-18Google Scholar, 11Cornelis S. Bruynooghe Y. Denecker G. Van Huffel S. Tinton S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 597-605Google Scholar) that IRES element can be regulated in a cell cycle-specific manner and that IRESs are preferentially used by the mitotic translation apparatus. The task will now be to identify the different regulatory elements in mitotically active IRES elements and the proteins and cellular structures that modulate their activity. The outcome of these lines of investigation will determine roles for the internal initiation mechanism in cell cycle progression and point to posttranscriptional circuits that regulate cell growth.

Eukaryotic Lon is a homo-oligomeric ring-shaped complex localized to the mitochondrial matrix.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14929-14934Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis is required for the processive unfolding of a substrate that permits peptide bond cleavage. Conformational changes within the Lon holoenzyme likely coincide with the cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis, ADP dissociation, and ATP rebinding, as well as with the binding and hydrolysis of protein substrate.Lon belongs to a unique group of proteases that also bind DNA. Other proteases or protease components that bind DNA include the human adenovirus proteinase (AVP), 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, human adenovirus proteinase; AEBP1, adipocyte-enhancer binding protein 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); POLG, polymerase γ. 1The abbreviations used are: AVP, human adenovirus proteinase; AEBP1, adipocyte-enhancer binding protein 1; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); POLG, polymerase γ. the adipocyte-enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), Gal6p/bleomycin hydrolase, and the 19 S particle of the 26 S proteasome. AVP requires two co-factors for maximal protease activity: viral DNA and a viral peptide produced by AVP proteolysis. It is proposed that AVP utilizes its nonspecific DNA binding activity to locate its viral protein substrates (22McGrath W.J. Baniecki M.L. Li C. McWhirter S.M. Brown M.T. Toledo D.L. Mangel W.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13237-13245Google Scholar). By contrast, the AEBP1 repressor binds specifically to the adipocyte enhancer 1 element. The carboxypeptidase activity of AEBP1 is stimulated by adipocyte enhancer 1 element DNA and is required for transcriptional repression; however, the protein substrates hydrolyzed by AEBP1 remain unknown (23He G.P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Google Scholar, 24Muise A.M. Ro H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 341-345Google Scholar). In yeast, Gal6p has been shown to negatively regulate galactose metabolism and also to hydrolyze bleomycin, which is widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Studies show that DNA-binding mutants of Gal6p fail to protect yeast from bleomycin toxicity (25Zheng W. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3580-3585Google Scholar, 26Zheng W. Johnston S.A. Joshua-Tor L. Cell. 1998; 93: 103-109Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that the 19 S component of the 26 S proteasome binds specifically to the GAL1–10 promoter and functions in nucleotide excision repair and transcriptional elongation in yeast (27Ferdous A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12798-12805Google Scholar, 28Gillette T.G. Huang W. Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Johnston S.A. Friedberg E.C.

Lon shares structural and functional similarity with the ATPase subunits of the 19 S particle within their respective AAA domains. Based on these findings, it is predicted that the DNA binding activity of Lon is important for its physiological function.In vivo studies show that Lon has a role in DNA maintenance and expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strains lacking mitochondrial Lon suffer large deletions in mtDNA and do not process and express mitochondrial RNA transcripts that contain introns (30Suzuki C.K. Suda K. Wang N. Schatz G. Science. 1994; 264 (Correction (1994) Science264, 891): 273-276Google Scholar, 31van Dyck L. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 238-242Google Scholar, 32van Dyck L. Neupert W. Langer T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1515-1524Google Scholar). In Caulobacter crescentus, Lon is responsible for the cell cycle-dependent turnover of the CcrM DNA methyltransferase; lon mutants fail to initiate DNA replication and to complete cell division (33Wright R. Stephens C. Zweiger G. Shapiro L. Alley M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1532-1542Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, data suggest that Lon degrades the protein(s) that determine the helical density of F-type DNA mini-plasmids that replicate independently of the bacterial chromosome (34Maas R. Cell. 2001; 105: 945-955Google Scholar). In addition, studies performed in various bacterial species suggest that Lon regulates the protein levels of transcription factors that control development, antibiotic production, or pathogenesis (35Bonnefoy E. Almeida A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S. 1989; 86: 7691-7695Google Scholar, 36Bretz J. Losada L. Lisboa K. Hutcheson S.W. Mol.

Markovitz and co-workers (41Charette M.F. Henderson G.W. Doane L.L. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 195-201Google Scholar, 42Zehnbauer B.A. Foley E.C. Henderson G.W. Markovitz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2043-2047Google Scholar) purified the lon (capR9) gene product as a DNA-binding protein; independently, Chung and Goldberg demonstrated that this protein was identical to the ATP-dependent Lon/La protease (43Chung C.H. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 795-799Google Scholar). Both groups found that E. coli Lon bound to DNA nonspecifically, and both showed that the ATPase activity of Lon was stimulated by single- and double-stranded DNA. More recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that bacterial, mouse, and human Lon bind specifically to GT-rich DNA sequences (44Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Google Scholar, 45Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Google Scholar, 46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar). Although the sequence specificity of DNA binding is evolutionarily conserved, experiments show that mammalian Lon binds single-stranded DNA, whereas bacterial Lon binds double-stranded DNA (44Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Google Scholar, 45Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Google Scholar, 46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar). The binding site for human Lon in vitro is contained within a GT-rich DNA oligonucleotide whose sequence overlaps the light strand promoter of human mtDNA.Little is known about the sequence specificity and regulation of nucleic acid binding by Lon and whether Lon interacts with proteins involved in mtDNA metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that Lon binds not only to GT-rich DNA sequences found throughout the guanine-rich heavy strand of human mtDNA but also to GU-rich RNA. ATP inhibits Lon binding to DNA and RNA, whereas protein substrate increases the affinity of the protease for nucleic acid. We propose that DNA and RNA binding by the human mitochondrial Lon protease is regulated by conformational changes within the holoenzyme that are induced differentially by nucleotide and protein substrate. In cultured cells human Lon associates with components of mitochondrial nucleoids, which are large multi-protein complexes bound to mtDNA that support the stability, expression, and inheritance of the mitochondrial genome. We show that mtDNA polymerase γ and the Twinkle helicase co-immunoprecipitate with Lon. These results are consistent with the notion that Lon participates directly in the metabolism of mtDNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of Recombinant Human Lon—A cDNA encoding human Lon carrying an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a linker region (MGHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAHM) fused to methionine 115 was expressed in the E. coli Rosetta strain (Novagen). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 3% bactotryptone, 2% yeast extract, 1% MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 90 min at 37 °C. Relatively low levels of human Lon protein were expressed recombinantly as high levels of expression lead to an increase in Lon degradation and a decrease in cell viability. From ∼7 g of bacteria, 1–2 mg of pure Lon was obtained after the three-step purification described below.Purification of Recombinant Human Lon—The cells were harvested and suspended in Solution A (0.2 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a P11 column (Whatman; phosphocellulose) equilibrated with Solution A. The column was washed with Solution A and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.2–2.0 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The fractions eluted at 0.62–0.75 m NaCl were positive for the ∼100-kDa Lon monomer as demonstrated by immunoblotting with anti-Lon antiserum. These fractions were pooled, and the protein was concentrated, subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-300-HR column (Sigma), and then eluted using Solution A. The Lon-containing fractions were collected and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen). The column was washed three times with NTA buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol) and once with NTA buffer containing 50 μm imidazole. Lon bound to the column was eluted in three steps with NTA buffer containing 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 m imidazole. Purified human Lon was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and by immunoblotting using an anti-Lon antiserum.In Vitro Mutagenesis of Human Lon cDNA—The cDNA encoding the Lon S855A mutant in which serine at position 855 was replaced by alanine was produced using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Complementary oligonucleotide primers (coding sequence 5′-acccccaaggacggcccagccgcaggctgcaccatcgtc) were used to introduce a single point mutation that was verified by DNA sequencing. LonS855A is a fusion protein that carries the same amino-terminal hexahistidine tag and linker as described above.Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking—Cross-linking experiments were carried out as previously described (7Stahlberg H. Kutejova E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6787-6790Google Scholar, 8van Dijl J.M. Kutejová E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10584-10589Google Scholar). SDS-denatured or native Lon (300 pmol of monomer) was cross-linked using 0.1% glutaraldehyde for the time periods as indicated and then visualized on a 3% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.λ DNA Cleavage, Protease, and ATPase Assays—Lon (5 pmol of monomer) was incubated with λDNA (0.4 μg) in a 40-μl reaction containing 2 mm NaCl, 2 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 for the time periods as indicated at 37 °C; the reactions were run on a 0.9% agarose gel in TBE buffer. ATP-dependent degradation of casein was measured as described previously (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar, 47Thomas-Wohlever J. Lee I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9418-9425Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type Lon (7.4 pmol of monomer) or LonS855A (8.4 pmol of monomer) was incubated with 160 pmol of FITC-casein in a 40-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Mg(OAC)2 in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP at 37 °C. At various time points, the aliquots were withdrawn and quenched with 60% trichloroacetic acid and BSA and centrifuged at 4 °C. The level of fluorescence in the supernatant representing acid-soluble peptides derived from FITC-casein was measured spectrophotometrically. A calibration curve using known concentrations of FITC-casein was used to calculate moles of FITC-peptides generated. The ATPase activity of Lon was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP using thin layer chromatography (48Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Google Scholar) and phosphorimaging quantification. Purified Lon (12 pmol of monomer) or LonS885A (13 pmol of monomer) was incubated in a 30-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 2 mm Mg(OAC)2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, and 50 nm [α-32P]ATP at 37 °C. The aliquots were withdrawn at various time points and quenched with 0.5 m formic acid. Casein-stimulated ATPase activity was assayed in the same manner, except 440 pmol of casein was included in the reaction mixture.Oligonucleotides Used in Nucleic Acid Binding Assays—The following oligonucleotides were assayed: single-stranded oligonucleotide LSPas (5′-aat aat gtg tta gtt ggg ggg tga) as previously described (45Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Google Scholar, 46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar) and single-stranded mtDNA sequences 1as (5′-ggc gta ggt ttg gtc tag ggt), 2as (5′-gta gag ggg gtg cta tag ggt), 3as (5′-gta tgg ggg taa tta tgg tgg), 4as (5′-gga ggg ggg ttg tta ggg ggt), 5as (5′-cga ggg tgg taa gga tgg ggg), and 6as (5′-ggg gag ggg tgt tta agg ggt). The positions of oligonucleotides 1s–6s within human mtDNA (GenBank™ sequence NC_001807) are: 7114–7134, 8262–8282, 8395–8415, 10936–10956, 12387–12407, and 15526–15546, respectively. The LSPas RNA oligonucleotide was 5′-aau aau gug uua guu ggg ggg uga. The respective complementary sequences were also tested. Synthetic DNA or RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled, unincorporated radioactivity was removed, and the probes were adjusted to the same specific activity as previously described (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar). DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were suspended as a stock solution in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The oligonucleotides corresponding to LSPas DNA and RNA as well as to oligonucleotides G, G1, G2, and G3 form high order complexes resulting from four or more contiguous guanine residues. The uncomplexed forms of these oligonucleotides were gel-purified before end labeling.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was performed as previously described (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar) using radiolabeled probe (3.2 pmol) and purified Lon (5–10 pmol of monomer) incubated in a 30-μl reaction in the presence or absence of unlabeled LSPas or LSPs DNA or RNA (200-fold excess), polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (poly(dI-dC), 50 ng/reaction), or oligonucleotide A (200-fold excess).Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assay—DNA binding reactions (30 μl) containing Binding Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mm dithiothreitol), human Lon (5–10 pmol of Lon monomer), and 4 μl of labeled oligonucleotide (3.2 pmol) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Binding Buffer (200 μl) was added to each reaction, which was applied immediately to a nitrocellulose filter pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The nitrocellulose filters were washed with 10 ml of Binding Buffer and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting.DNA binding affinity of Lon for LSPas was determined using the filter assay. Total binding was determined by incubating Lon (0.8 pmol) with LSPas probe (8–16,000 fmol) in the presence and absence of casein (4 pmol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding unlabeled LSPas (800 pmol) to the reactions. Specific binding was calculated as total binding minus nonspecific binding. Prism 3.0 software was used to calculate the Kd by nonlinear regression as well as the standard deviation (based on data obtained from three independent experiments).Transient Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—293T cells were transfected as previously described (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar) with pCDNA3.1 or with pCDNA3.1 constructs carrying cDNAs encoding either polymerase γ (POLG) or Twinkle (kindly provided by Johannes Spelbrink, Tampere, Finland). Both POLG and Twinkle were tagged with the Myc epitope at their respective carboxyl termini. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cell extracts were prepared, and endogenous human Lon was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-Lon antibody bound to protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted with an anti-Myc epitope 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-40) or with an affinity-purified anti-Lon antibody using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitations, control experiments were performed in which the anti-Lon antibody was omitted. In addition, cell extracts (20 μg) were immunoblotted with the anti-Myc antibody to determine the expression level of transiently expressed POLG and Twinkle.RESULTSPurification of Recombinant Human Lon and Analysis of Its Enzymatic Activities—To analyze the DNA binding and enzymatic activities of Lon in vitro, the protein was expressed and purified from E. coli. Expression of a Lon fusion protein carrying an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 90 min; at this time point maximal expression and minimal degradation of Lon was observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Cell extracts were subjected to cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 2), and fractions containing Lon were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Lon-containing fractions were collected and finally purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1B, lane 4). A Lon mutant, LonS855A, in which a conserved serine at position 855 at the proteolytic active site was replaced by alanine, was also expressed and purified using the same protocol as for wild type Lon (data not shown). Glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments demonstrated that human Lon was a homo-oligomeric complex composed of six or seven ∼100-kDa subunits (Fig. 1C), similar to that shown for yeast Lon (7Stahlberg H. Kutejova E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6787-6790Google Scholar). Complete cross-linking of SDS-denatured Lon resulted primarily in monomers migrating at ∼100 kDa (lane 1). Complete cross-linking of the native protease resulted in a large molecular mass complex running at the top of the gel (lane 2), and partial cross-linking revealed that this complex was composed of six or seven subunits (lane 3).Because we aimed to study the DNA and RNA binding activity of Lon, experiments were performed to confirm that the purified protein was nuclease-free. Fig. 1D shows that after the final purification step Lon was free of endonucleases; λ DNA remained stable even after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C with Lon (lanes g and h). By contrast, λ DNA was completely degraded after incubation under the same conditions with Lon isolated after the size exclusion step (Fig. 1D, lane f). The absence of other nucleases was shown by the stability of single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA oligonucleotides incubated with purified Lon (data not shown).To demonstrate the protease activity of purified Lon, casein covalently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-casein) was used as a substrate (46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar, 47Thomas-Wohlever J. Lee I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9418-9425Google Scholar, 49Roudiak S.G. Shrader T.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11255-11263Google Scholar). The energy-dependent degradation of casein has been routinely employed to characterize bacterial, yeast, and mammalian Lon (1Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 350-375Google Scholar, 8van Dijl J.M. Kutejová E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10584-10589Google Scholar, 46Lu B.

A. 1993; 90: 11247-11251Google Scholar). The cleavage of FITC-casein by Lon was measured spectrofluorometrically as an increase in acid-soluble fluorescent casein peptides. Fig. 2A demonstrates that wild type Lon degraded FITC-casein in the presence of ATP but not in its absence; the rate of hydrolysis was 0.48 mol of casein/mol Lon/s. By contrast, LonS855A failed to degrade FITC-casein either in the presence or in the absence of ATP.Fig. 2Enzymatic activities of wild type Lon and LonS855A. A, ATP-dependent proteolysis of the model substrate FITC-casein assayed spectrophotometrically. Lon or LonS855A was incubated with substrate in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. B, hydrolysis of ATP was assayed by thin layer chromatography. Lon or Lon S855A was incubated with [α-32P]ATP in the presence and absence of casein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Substrate-stimulated ATPase activity of wild type Lon and the LonS855A mutant was determined using [α-32P]ATP and thin layer chromatography (48Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods. 2000; 22: 337-354Google Scholar). Wild type Lon exhibited a basal ATPase activity hydrolyzing 0.81 mol of ATP/mol Lon/s. The addition of casein stimulated hydrolysis 2-fold to 1.89 mol of ATP/mol Lon/s. By contrast, LonS855A lacked detectable ATPase activity either in the presence or in the absence of casein. Taken together these results demonstrate that purified wild type Lon is an active ATP-dependent protease and that LonS855A is an enzymatic mutant that lacks both ATPase and protease activity.Sequence-specific DNA and RNA Binding by Human Lon in Vitro—Previous work has demonstrated that mouse and human Lon specifically bind to a single-stranded GT-rich DNA oligonucleotide referred to as LSPas (45Fu G.K. Markovitz D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1905-1909Google Scholar, 46Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Google Scholar). The sequence of LSPas overlaps with the light strand promoter anti-sense strand of human mtDNA. By contrast, the complementary LSPs sequence is not bound by Lon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that human Lon specifically bound to DNA as well as RNA oligonucleotides carrying the LSPas sequence (Fig. 3, A and B). LSPas DNA binding by Lon led to a shift in probe mobility that was competed by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled LSPas DNA. No competition was observed upon the addition of poly(dI-dC) (50 ng) or deoxyribo-oligonucleotide A (200-fold excess) (Fig. 3A). Lon also bound specifically to LSPas RNA and not to its complementary LSPs RNA sequence (Fig. 3B). The binding to LSPas RNA was competed by the addition of LSPas DNA (see Fig. 5F). Lon binding to other GU-rich RNAs was also observed; this binding was competed by both LSPas RNA and DNA but not by spermidine (data not shown). Lon failed to bind to the respective complementary sequences of the GU-rich RNAs tested. These results demonstrate that the specificity of nucleic acid binding by Lon is determined by the sequence of purine and pyrimidine bases and not by the sugar phosphate backbone.Fig. 3Specific binding of Lon to DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. Binding of Lon to 32P-labeled LSPas DNA and RNA oligonucleotides was analyzed by EMSA. A, LSPas DNA probe was incubated either alone (lane 1); + Lon (lane 2); + Lon + 200-fold excess unlabeled LSPas (lane 3); + Lon + 50 ng poly(dI-dC) (lane 4); or + Lon + 200-fold excess DNA oligonucleotide A (lane 5).

https://openalex.org/W2054756404,"Fatty acids are common components of biological membranes that are known to play important roles in intracellular signaling. We report here a novel mechanism by which fatty acids regulate the degradation of tyrosinase, a critical enzyme associated with melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes and melanoma cells. Linoleic acid (unsaturated fatty acid, C18:2) accelerated the spontaneous degradation of tyrosinase, whereas palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid, C16:0) retarded the proteolysis. The linoleic acid-induced acceleration of tyrosinase degradation could be abrogated by inhibitors of proteasomes, the multicatalytic proteinase complexes that selectively degrade intracellular ubiquitinated proteins. Linoleic acid increased the ubiquitination of many cellular proteins, whereas palmitic acid decreased such ubiquitination, as compared with untreated controls, when a proteasome inhibitor was used to stabilize ubiquitinated proteins. Immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that treatment with fatty acids modulated the ubiquitination of tyrosinase, i.e. linoleic acid increased the amount of ubiquitinated tyrosinase whereas, in contrast, palmitic acid decreased it. Furthermore, confocal immunomicroscopy showed that the colocalization of ubiquitin and tyrosinase was facilitated by linoleic acid and diminished by palmitic acid. Taken together, these data support the view that fatty acids regulate the ubiquitination of tyrosinase and are responsible for modulating the proteasomal degradation of tyrosinase. In broader terms, the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might be regulated physiologically, at least in part, by fatty acids within cellular membranes.

In broader terms, the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might be regulated physiologically, at least in part, by fatty acids within cellular membranes. Although the dynamic roles of lipids, including fatty acids, as participants controlling many cellular activities (e.g. as mediators in the intracellular signaling network and precursors for ligands that bind to nuclear receptors) has been well studied (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 2Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), the role of fatty acids in regulating intracellular protein turnover in mammalian cells is poorly understood. Among the known pathways of intracellular protein breakdown that are functional in eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been in the limelight recently because of its importance in the selective elimination of abnormal proteins that may arise by mutations, neurotoxicity, or intracellular denaturation (3Ward C.L.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Tyrosinase (monophenol, l-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.14.18.1) is a type I membrane glycoprotein that is the critical rate-limiting enzyme involved in melanin biosynthesis (9Hearing V.J. Jiménez M. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 10del Marmol V. Beermann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Some pigmentary disorders such as oculocutaneous albinism are caused by the dysfunction of tyrosinase and related melanogenic enzymes, and the aberrant retention of those proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum results in their degradation by proteasomes, which leads to the hypopigmented phenotype (11Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D.P. Michalak M. Vijayasaradhi S. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Toyofuku K. Wada I. Valencia J.C. Kushimoto T. Ferrans V.J. Hearing V.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2149-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that tyrosinase is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and processed rapidly through the Golgi apparatus, in/after which active degradation of tyrosinase occurs spontaneously (13Saeki H. Oikawa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Jiménez M. Kameyama K. Maloy W.L. Tomita Y. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3830-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that tyrosinase can be degraded endogenously by proteasomes (11Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D.P. Michalak M. Vijayasaradhi S. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Mosse C.A. Hsu W. Engelhard V.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These studies support the notion that an ideal balance between tyrosinase synthesis and degradation is necessary for regulating pigmentation in mammalian skin, hair, and eyes.Free fatty acids have been shown to have remarkable regulatory effects on melanogenesis, i.e. unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) decrease melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity, whereas saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0) increase it (16Shono S. Toda K. Seiji M. Phenotypic Expression in Pigment Cells. University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo1981: 263-268Google Scholar, 17Ando H. Ryu A. Hashimoto A. Oka M. Ichihashi M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1998; 290: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In fact, linoleic acid has proven to be useful as a topical agent to prevent hyperpigmentary disorders, such as melasma, which are caused by tyrosinase dysfunction (17Ando H. Ryu A. Hashimoto A. Oka M. Ichihashi M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1998; 290: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Clinical Trial Group for Linoleic Acid-containing Gel. Nishi-nippon Hifuka. 1998; 60: 537-542Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Among the various fatty acids, linoleic acid and palmitic acid are abundant components of cell membranes in the epidermis (19Lampe M.A. Williams M.L. Elias P.M. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have been investigating the mechanisms by which these fatty acids regulate tyrosinase metabolism, e.g. synthesis, processing, and/or degradation. In those studies, we have found that tyrosinase mRNA levels were not altered following incubation with linoleic acid or palmitic acid, indicating that these fatty acids regulate tyrosinase activity via post-transcriptional events (20Ando H. Itoh A. Mishima Y. Ichihashi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that linoleic acid accelerated, but palmitic acid decelerated, the proteolysis of 35S-labeled tyrosinase (21Ando H. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ohashi A. Furumura M. Matsunaga J. Matsunaga N. Hearing V.J. Ichihashi M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1312-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism involved in the fatty acid-induced regulation of tyrosinase degradation is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fatty acids on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, where membrane proteins are selectively degraded, and we further explored the possibility of whether this pathway could be involved in the fatty acid-induced regulation of tyrosinase degradation.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—Antibodies used were as follows: αPEP7, a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a synthetic peptide (KLH-CDKDDYHSLLYQSHL-COOH, where KLH is keyhole limpet hemocyanin) that corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of mouse tyrosinase (22Jiménez M. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Ub(P4D1), a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody that corresponds to amino acids 1-76 representing the full length of bovine ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-20S proteasome, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) that recognizes the α-subunit; and anti-PA700, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem) that recognizes ATPase/non-ATPase subunits. MG132 1The abbreviations used are: MG132, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal, also known as Cbz-LLL) was from Calbiochem, whereas LLnL (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, also known as ALLN), cycloheximide, the saturated free fatty acid palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid), and the unsaturated free fatty acid linoleic acid (cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid) were all from Sigma.Cell Cultures and Treatments—B16F10 mouse melanoma cell lines, which stably express tyrosinase activity and produce melanin, were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Free fatty acids, proteasome inhibitors, and cycloheximide were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Final Me2SO concentrations were 0.1% or less, which did not influence cell viability or tyrosinase function. For evaluating alterations of tyrosinase content and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-related proteins, cells were treated with linoleic acid (25 μm) or palmitic acid (25 μm) for 24, 48, and 72 h. We showed previously that 25 μm of each fatty acid had no effect on the proliferation of B16 cells (21Ando H. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ohashi A. Furumura M. Matsunaga J. Matsunaga N. Hearing V.J. Ichihashi M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1312-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure tyrosinase degradation, cells were pretreated with linoleic acid (25 μm) or palmitic acid (25 μm) for 72 h and then treated with cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) for an additional 4 or 8 h in the presence of linoleic acid or palmitic acid, with or without incubation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (MG132 at 120 nm or LLnL at 3 μm). To detect ubiquitinated proteins and ubiquitinated tyrosinase, cells were treated with linoleic acid (25 μm) or palmitic acid (25 μm) for 24 h in the presence or absence of MG132 (120 nm). In these experiments, cells were grown to confluence, at which time they were harvested to detect ubiquitinated proteins. For confocal microscopy, cells were treated with linoleic acid (25 μm) or palmitic acid (25 μm) for 72 h in the presence or absence of MG132 (120 nm) for the last 24 h before fixation.Western Blot Analysis—Treated cells were solubilized in lysis buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 2.4 μm MG132, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were used as cell extracts. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The cell extracts were mixed with Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (2×) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Five or ten micrograms of total protein from each extract was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8-16% gradient Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted (as noted in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) in 2% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T for 2 h at 23 °C. Prior to the probing with the anti-ubiquitin antibody, the blotting membranes were denatured in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature (23Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), washed 5 times (5 min each) with TBS-T, and then blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk. After five washes with TBS-T, the blotting membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse whole antibodies (1:10,000) (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS-T for 2 h at 23 °C. After five washes with TBS-T, the immunoreactivities of the blots were detected using an ECL-plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The BenchMark prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen) was used to establish the molecular weight curve for the Western blotting. For reprobing, a Re-Blot Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International, Temecula CA) was used to strip the antibodies, and the blots were restarted from the blocking step with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T and then recycled for another antibody. The expression levels of tyrosinase and other proteins were quantified by measuring the optical densities of specific bands using an image analysis system with NIH Image software, version 1.62.Fig. 2Tyrosinase degradation after incubation with fatty acids.

Finally, absorbed proteins were eluted with 50 μl of Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. Each supernatant (20 μl) was separated on 8-16% Tris-glycine SDS gels and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Ub(P4D1) was used to detect ubiquitinated tyrosinase precipitated with αPEP7. The detection method was the same as the one indicated in the protocol for Western blot analysis.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using double indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (24Kushimoto T.

Cells were seeded in 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and incubated with linoleic acid or palmitic acid for 72 h at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours before fixation (48 h after cell seeding), 120 nm MG132 was added to some plates to stabilize the ubiquitinated proteins. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. After three further washes in PBS in room temperature, the cells were permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min at 4 °C and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum and 5% normal horse serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with a mixture of the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (at the dilution noted in the Fig. 5 legend) in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum and 2% normal horse serum overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in PBS at room temperature, the polyclonal antibody was reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Texas Red (1:100), and the monoclonal antibody was reacted with horse anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein (1:100) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by nuclear counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Reactivity was classified into three categories, according to whether they showed red, green, or yellow fluorescence. The yellow fluorescence was indicative of colocalization of the red and green fluorescence signals. All preparations were examined with a confocal microscope (LSM 510; Zeiss), equipped with helium-neon, argon, and krypton laser sources.Fig. 5Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showing the intracellular distribution of tyrosinase (Tyr, red) and ubiquitin (Ubi, green) after incubation with fatty acids. Cells were treated with linoleic acid (25 μm), palmitic acid (25 μm), or Me2SO only (control) for 72 h in the presence (MG132 +) or absence (MG132 -) of MG132 (120 nm) for the last 24 h of treatment before fixation. Cells were stained with antibody (αPEP7 at 1:20 or Ub(P4D1) at 1:5), followed by nuclear counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The small panels show tyrosinase and ubiquitin, whereas the large panels represent the merged images indicating colocalization of tyrosine and ubiquitin as yellow fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSInvolvement of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway in the Fatty Acid-induced Regulation of Tyrosinase Degradation—The amounts of tyrosinase and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-related proteins, i.e. ubiquitin (free mono-ubiquitin), 20 S proteasome (a core catalytic protease complex of the 26 S proteasome), and PA700 (also known as the 19 S proteasome, a regulatory complex that binds to both ends of the 20 S proteasome) (26Tanaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar), were determined by Western blotting after incubation with various concentrations of linoleic acid or palmitic acid for 72 h (Fig. 1). In agreement with previous results (21Ando H. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ohashi A. Furumura M. Matsunaga J. Matsunaga N. Hearing V.J. Ichihashi M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1312-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of tyrosinase was decreased by linoleic acid and increased by palmitic acid in a dose-dependent manner, and this was consistent with the colors of the cell pellets. In contrast, the amount of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway-related proteins did not change appreciably after incubation with either fatty acid, i.e. the effects of fatty acids on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway did not alter those proteins.We previously reported preliminary evidence that linoleic acid accelerates, whereas palmitic acid decelerates, the proteolytic degradation of tyrosinase, as revealed by pulse-chase analysis (21Ando H. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ohashi A. Furumura M. Matsunaga J. Matsunaga N. Hearing V.J. Ichihashi M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1312-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we assessed the fate of tyrosinase to confirm the rate of its proteolysis using cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, after prolonged treatment with fatty acids. The concentration of cycloheximide used was 1 μg/ml, a level shown previously to inhibit protein synthesis in these cells by >80% (13Saeki H. Oikawa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The degradation of tyrosinase occurred in a time-dependent manner after 4 or 8 h of treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). Furthermore, accelerated degradation of tyrosinase was observed (again in a time-dependent manner) in cells pretreated with linoleic acid for 72 h (lanes 4-6). In contrast, cells pretreated with palmitic acid for 72 h had increased levels of tyrosinase and showed a decelerated rate of tyrosinase degradation (lanes 7-9). The rate of tyrosinase degradation was increased or decreased by treatment with linoleic acid or palmitic acid, respectively (Fig. 2B).We next examined whether the linoleic acid-induced decrease of tyrosinase was due to its proteolytic degradation by proteasomes. We used the proteasome inhibitors MG132, a membrane permeable proteasome inhibitor that has been used to study the role of proteasomes in the breakdown of membrane proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (28Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar), and LLnL, which is a neutral cysteine protease inhibitor that also blocks proteasome-mediated proteolysis (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The concentration of each proteasome inhibitor used was determined by its cytotoxicity of <40% growth inhibition, i.e. the cell number after 72 h incubation with 120 nm MG132 was 73.4%, and with 3 μm LLnL it was 64.4%, compared with the control. Linoleic acid decreased the level of tyrosinase in a time-dependent manner, and this was most significant after pretreatment of the cells for 72 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). The decrease of tyrosinase induced by linoleic acid could be blocked by proteasome inhibitors (MG132 or LLnL) after co-incubation for 72 h (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). To further confirm the involvement of proteasomes in the linoleic acid-induced acceleration of tyrosinase degradation, we used cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. The decrease in tyrosinase protein in cells pretreated with linoleic acid for 72 h in the presence of cycloheximide could be abrogated by co-incubation with MG132 or LLnL (Fig. 3B). In contrast, treatment with trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane (E-64), an inhibitor of cysteine proteases that does not block proteasome activity (5Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka K. Ii K. Ichihara A. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15197-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or with (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (EST; also known as E-64d), which also inhibits lysosomal thiol proteases, had no effect on the accumulation of tyrosinase, even at concentrations as high as 30 μm (data not shown).Regulatory Effect of Fatty Acids on Cellular Ubiquitination and on Ubiquitinated Tyrosinase—To elucidate the mechanism by which the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the fatty acid-induced regulation of tyrosinase degradation, we evaluated the effects of fatty acids on cellular ubiquitination in general. To do that, it was necessary to stabilize ubiquitinated proteins, which would normally be immediately degraded by proteasomes, and we used MG132 at 120 nm to accomplish this. We determined an incubation time of 24 h to estimate the proper alteration of ubiquitination to compare the relative amounts of tyrosinase. Very low band intensities of ubiquitinated proteins were observed in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3 on the left), whereas increased band intensities of ubiquitinated proteins were observed in the presence of MG132 and in the presence or absence of fatty acids (Fig. 4A, lanes 4-6 on the left). Interestingly, treatment with linoleic acid in the presence of MG132 showed a 1.6-fold increase in ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 4A, lane 5, left), whereas treatment with palmitic acid in the prese"

This receptor, which contains a single C-type lectin-like domain and a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, is related to LOX-1 (lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein-1) and the β-glucan receptor (Dectin-1) and is variably spliced and highly N-glycosylated. We demonstrate that it preferentially associates with the signaling phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, but not with SHIP. Novel chimeric analyses with a construct combining MICL and the β-glucan receptor show that MICL can inhibit cellular activation through its cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif.

The functional balance of the immune system is regulated, in part, by inhibitory and activatory receptors found on all leukocytes as well as on many non-immune cells (1Long E.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 875-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Within these activatory and inhibitory receptor families, cytoplasmic consensus motifs have been identified and shown to associate with particular signaling mechanisms. These motifs include the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; CTLD, C-type lectin-like domain; LOX-1, lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein-1; BGR, β-glucan receptor; MICL, myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; SHP, Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SHIP, Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase; contig, group of overlapping clones. 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif; CTLD, C-type lectin-like domain; LOX-1, lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein-1; BGR, β-glucan receptor; MICL, myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte; SHP, Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SHIP, Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase; contig, group of overlapping clones. which become phosphorylated upon stimulation, sending their activatory signals through a variety of intracellular enzyme cascades and resulting in a wide range of cellular outcomes, and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which suppress such activatory signals by recruiting phosphatase enzymes that dephosphorylate ITAMs as well as other components of the activatory pathways. The array of inhibitory and activatory receptors expressed by natural killer cells has recently been the focus of much investigation (2McQueen K.L. Parham P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In humans, these receptors can be divided into two families: the Ig superfamily, including the killer cell Ig-like receptors (3Vilches C. Parham P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) that bind classical major histocompatibility complex class I or HLA G (non-classical), and the C-type lectin-like family (4Lopez-Botet M. Chambers W.H. Methods (Orlando). 1996; 9: 352-361Google Scholar), including the NKG2 receptors, which bind the non-classical HLA E or other distantly related molecules that are up-regulated on stressed, transformed, or infected cells (5Diefenbach A.

The C-type lectin and lectin-like proteins are classified into 14 groups based on the arrangement of their C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). 2Available at ctld.glycob.ox.ac.uk/. 2Available at ctld.glycob.ox.ac.uk/. In particular, group V receptors include the lectin-like NKG2 family mentioned above, but also a distinct subgroup of these receptors that are expressed predominantly on myeloid and endothelial cells (7Sobanov Y.

The members of this subgroup appear to bind diverse ligands, as exemplified by LOX-1 (lectin-like receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein-1) (8Mehta J.L. Li D. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the β-glucan receptor (BGR), which is an activatory phagocytic receptor for β-glucans (9Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). 3J. Herre, A. S. J. Marshall, E. Caron, A. D. Edwards, D. L. Williams, E. Schweighoffer, V. L. Tybulewicz, C. Reis e Sousa, S.

Brown, manuscript in preparation. Although they share structuralhomologywithclassicalcarbohydrate-bindingC-type(Ca2+-dependent) lectins (10Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the group V molecules are termed C-type lectin-like because they lack the residues involved in Ca2+ coordination (11Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a myeloid inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL), a novel group V C-type lectin-like receptor that contains an ITIM in its cytoplasmic tail and is most homologous to the LOX-1/BGR subgroup. We demonstrate that it is expressed at the cell surface and is highly N-glycosylated and that its expression is restricted to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes. We also show that it associates with the signaling phosphatases Src homology-2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 and SHP-2 and that it can inhibit cellular activation. Cell Lines and Growth Conditions—NIH3T3 fibroblasts, RAW264.7 monocytes, and the PT67 and HEK293T-based Phoenix ecotropic retroviral packaging cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, and CHO-Lec1 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, both with the supplements described above. All cell lines were obtained from the cell bank of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, for except CHO-Lec1 (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1735) (12Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L.

Cloning and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—All routine nucleic acid manipulation techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The complete MICL open reading frame was originally cloned into the pBluescript SK II+ vector (Stratagene) from human peripheral blood mononucleocyte cDNA using the Advantage HF2-PCR kit (Clontech) with primers 5′-AAAGGATCCTCTTTACATATTCATCAATG-3′ and 5′-AAACTCGAGACACTCCTTAAATGTATTTG-3′. Hemagglutinin (HA) and V5 epitope tags (used as described below) were generated using adaptor duplex oligonucleotides as described previously (16Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A.

All tags were inserted at the 3′-end of each sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal extracellular domain of each receptor. The MICL/BGR chimera was generated using overlap extension PCR (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar) with primers 5′-CTACAACTGATGAGTAACTTCCTATCAAGAAATAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTATTTCTTGATAGGAAGTTACTCATCAGTTGTAG-3′ such that the MICL 5′-sequence ran into the murine BGR sequence after 95 amino acids, translating as MICL88NISLQLMSMICL95/BGR83NFLSRNKENBGR91. PCR was used to generate cytoplasmic mutant constructs from the V5-tagged full-length MICL/BGR chimera, including the truncated mutant, in which the 5′-end of the gene encoding the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 1–39) was replaced with a start codon (AUG) and a Kozak sequence, and the ITIM mutant, in which the ITIM (VTYADL, amino acids 5–10) was mutated to VTFADL to inactivate the signaling domain. A schematic of all constructs (without epitope tags) that were used in these experiments is presented in Fig. 1. The fidelity of all clones was confirmed by sequencing. To obtain stable cell lines, constructs were subcloned into the pFBneo (Stratagene) or pMXs-IP (a gift from Professor Toshio Kitamura, University of Tokyo) (18Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T.

RAW264.7 and CHO-K1 cells were pretreated with 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin to increase transduction efficiency. All cell lines were used as non-clonal populations to reduce any founder effects and were generated and tested at least twice to confirm their phenotype. Stable cell lines were selected and maintained in 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin or 3 μg/ml puromycin. RNA Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Northern blotting was performed using a full-length MICL cDNA probe as described previously (19Willment J.A. Gordon S. Brown G.D. J. Biol.

Leukocytes were isolated from buffy coats (Bristol Blood Donor Services) and separated into adherent and non-adherent mononuclear cells using Ficoll-Paque™ Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and from fresh peripheral blood and separated into PMNs and total mononuclear leukocytes using Polymorphprep™ (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Sweden) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Fluorescent Zymosan Binding and Internalization and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) Assays—Fluorescence-based binding assays using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled zymosan (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were performed as follows. NIH3T3 transfectants were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates the day prior to each experiment. The cells were washed three times; 100 μg/ml laminarin (Sigma) was added when appropriate; and the cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to allow inhibition of BGR (21Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Following the addition of FITC-labeled zymosan (25 particles/cell), the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 60 min. After washes to remove unbound particles, the cells were lysed in 3% Triton X-100, and the amount of FITC-labeled zymosan bound by the cells was quantified using a Titertek Fluoroskan II (Labsystems Group Ltd.) as described (21Brown G.D.

For the internalization assays, NIH3T3 transfectants were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates the day prior to each experiment. At the start of the assay, the cells were washed three times with culture medium, and when necessary, cytochalasin D (1 μm; Sigma) was added to the cells 40 min prior to the start of the assay and then maintained throughout the experiment. Following the addition of FITC-labeled zymosan (5 particles/cell), the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30 min, washed to remove unbound particles, and then incubated for a further 90 min at 37 °C. External zymosan was stained with rabbit anti-zymosan antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) after blocking with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% heat-inactivated goat serum and then detected with allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were lifted and fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and flow cytometry analysis (carried out according to conventional protocols) was performed by gating on the FITC-positive cell populations, which had bound zymosan. The percentage of phagocytosis was determined by comparing the allophycocyanin-negative (internalized particles) and allophycocyanin-positive (non-internalized particles) cell populations. TNF-α production in RAW264.7 transfectants stimulated with zymosan was determined as described previously (16Brown G.D. Herre J. Williams D.L. Willment J.A. Marshall A.S. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). After taking samples for anti-TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the amount of FITC-labeled zymosan bound by the cells was quantified as described above. All graphical data are presented as the means ± S.D. from a representative experiment. Immunoprecipitation—To identify MICL-associated phosphatases in RAW264.7 transfectants, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm NaN3. Aliquots containing 5 × 107 cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-HA antibody. Excess antibody was then removed by washing, and the cells were resuspended in 2.25 ml of PBS and prewarmed to 37 °C for 3 min before stimulation with 250 μl of pervanadate (or PBS-only control), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Pervanadate (22Swarup G. Cohen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and incubated on ice for 45 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were added to 5 μl of anti-mouse Dynabeads® (precoated with 2% bovine serum albumin, Dynal Biotech) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and precipitated proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in reducing sample buffer. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for 90 min at 100 V. Proteins were probed with primary antibody in PBS containing 2% skimmed milk powder for 2 h at room temperature, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature and detection using ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-HA (HA.11, Covance), rabbit anti-SHP-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse anti-SHP-2 (clone 79, BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) (a gift from Dr. Gerry Krystal). MICL Is a C-type Lectin-like Transmembrane Receptor with a Cytoplasmic ITIM—We identified a novel human immunoreceptor that we named MICL (Fig. 2A) through data base searches for molecules homologous to BGR. The MICL gene consists of six exons and is located on the (+)-strand of chromosome 12 (locus 12p13.31) within the natural killer gene complex (23Yokoyama W.M. Plougastel B.F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), spanning ∼14 kb on GenBank™/EBI genomic contig NT_009714 (Fig. 2B). It is positioned at the telomeric end of a cluster of homologous genes that include LOX-1, BGR, CLEC-1, and CLEC-2 (Fig. 2C) (7Sobanov Y. Bernreiter A. Derdak S. Mechtcheriakova D. Schweighofer B. Duchler M. Kalthoff F. Hofer E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The predicted open reading frame encodes a 265-amino acid type II transmembrane polypeptide with an expected mass of ∼31 kDa and comprises one CTLD, a stalk/neck region, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail containing an archetypal ITIM (Figs. 1A and 2A). The CTLD contains the six canonical cysteines, present in almost all C-type lectins; and in the stalk, there are two extra cysteines that may allow homo- or heterodimerization (24Lazetic S. Chang C. Houchins J.P. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4741-4745PubMed Google Scholar). The ectodomain also contains several putative N-glycosylation sites and one predicted O-glycosylation site. 7Available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/ and www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region have been identified (at 255 and 790 bp in Fig. 2A), although only the latter one results in an amino acid substitution (Q244K). The Lys244 allele was previously deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession number NM_138337, but its functional significance is not yet known. MICL Shares Homology with LOX-1, BGR, CLEC-1, and CLEC-2 as Well as Other Inhibitory Receptors—MICL is most homologous to other human C-type lectin-like molecules on chromosome 12 that are found in the same cluster (Fig. 2C), including two novel transcripts with GenBank™/EBI accession numbers AY358265 and AY358810 (Fig. 3A). The predicted MICL CTLD sequence is most similar to those of AY358265, LOX-1, and BGR (Fig. 3B). Alignments of the CTLDs of MICL and related proteins show that they all contain the six conserved cysteines, but lack the Ca2+-binding residues that are present in classical C-type lectins such as rat MBP-A (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, none of the known sugar-binding motifs present in classical C-type lectins, e.g. EPN/QPD (11Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), are found in MICL. Analysis of the MICL cytoplasmic tail revealed homology to other ITIM-containing group V C-type lectin-like molecules (Fig. 3C) such as AY358810, CD72, and murine Ly49C. The ITIM is also similar to those of certain better characterized type I transmembrane receptors, viz. signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRP-α), ILT5, KIR3DL1, and KIR2DL4 (data not shown). Recently, the murine ortholog of MICL was identified (Gen-Bank™/EBI accession number XM_149798). This gene is located within the equivalent gene cluster on the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 6. The encoded protein has 49% overall identity (∼70% similarity) to human MICL and shares many of the features mentioned above, e.g. exon structure, N-glycosylation sites, and extra cysteines in the stalk. Similar MICL-related sequences are also present in other vertebrate genomes, including Rattus norvegicus, Bos tauros, and Danio rerio (data not shown). MICL Has at Least Three Alternatively Spliced Transcripts, and Expression Is Restricted to PMNs and Monocytes—We examined the expression of human MICL by northern blotting and RT-PCR analysis. By northern blotting using a full-length cDNA probe, we were able to detect MICL transcripts in several tissues, especially those rich in leukocytes. One predominant transcript of 1.5 kb was observed in positive tissues, as were several transcripts of greater length. High levels of MICL transcripts were detected in peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow, with lower levels in spleen, fetal liver, heart, colon, placenta, and lung (Fig. 4A) as well as testis (data not shown). Blotting with an alternative MICL cDNA probe and increased hybridization stringency gave identical results, thus confirming the specificity of the hybridizing bands (data not shown). We then determined the peripheral blood cell populations expressing MICL by RT-PCR and detected high levels of MICL transcripts in both PMNs and total mononuclear leukocytes (Fig. 4B). We separated the mononuclear leukocyte populations into non-adherent cells (predominantly lymphocytes) and adherent cells (predominantly monocytes), and the latter were also allowed to mature (from 1 to 7 days) into macrophages. MICL was detected in immature monocytes, but expression was gradually lost upon maturation toward macrophages; lymphocytes were MICL-negative. This experiment was repeated using blood from three separate donors, and comparable results were obtained, although the degree of MICL down-regulation concomitant with monocyte maturation was variable. Several human cell lines from a range of sources were also analyzed for MICL expression. Consistent with previous data, only the monocytic/promyelocytic cells tested (U937, HL-60, and MonoMac6) were clearly MICL-positive (Fig. 4C). Moreover, maturation of the monocytic/promyelocytic cell lines THP-1 and HL-60 by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which induces a macrophage-like phenotype, down-regulated MICL expression as shown by northern blotting (Fig. 4D). In contrast, when HL-60 cells were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid and Me2SO, which induce a PMN-like phenotype (25Collins S.J. Bodner A. Ting R. Gallo R.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), MICL expression was maintained. This PMN/monocyte-restricted mRNA expression was further corroborated by SAGE, 8E. J. Evans, personal communication. which identified MICL transcripts in only myeloid cells, viz. granulocytes, monocytes, and immature dendritic cells (26Evans E.J. Hene L. Sparks L.M. Dong T. Retiere C.

MICL was not detected in any SAGE library of lymphoid origin or in mature dendritic cells. All non-immune tissue libraries, except lung and liver, were also MICL-negative (28Lash A.E. Tolstoshev C.M. Wagner L. Schuler G.D. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Altschul S.F. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). 10Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE. Thus, MICL appears to be expressed preferentially by granulocytes and monocytes. RT-PCR analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 4B) identified three alternatively spliced isoforms of ∼800, 700, and 1100 bp (MICL-α, -β, and -γ, respectively). These were cloned and sequenced, and their predicted structures are depicted in Fig. 2B. MICL-α is the isoform characterized in this work; MICL-β lacks exon 2 (encoding the transmembrane region); and in the MICL-γ transcript, the second intron is un-spliced, resulting in the introduction of a stop codon after 18 codons. Transcripts similar to the MICL-γ isoform were also found in several human expressed sequence tags. MICL Is Highly Glycosylated and Is Expressed at the Cell Surface—To investigate MICL protein expression and function, we generated HA epitope-tagged MICL transfectants in a variety of cell lines. Because several similar C-type lectin and lectin-like proteins are not expressed at the cell surface when transfected into certain cell lines (29Colonna M. Samaridis J. Angman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Bellon T. Heredia A.B. Llano M. Minguela A. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Botet M. Aparicio P. J.

Taylor, manuscript in preparation. presumably due to the lack of accessory molecules, we examined the surface expression of MICL transfected into NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). Analysis by flow cytometry of live transfected cells demonstrated high levels of MICL expression at the cell surface, indicating that accessory molecules were not required. We also examined HA-tagged MICL expression by western blotting and observed bands between 40 and 75 kDa, which are much higher molecular masses than predicted from the polypeptide sequence alone (Fig. 5B). These bands were detected similarly under both reducing and nonreducing conditions in NIH3T3 and RAW264.7 lysates (data not all shown), suggesting they were due to glycosylation of MICL rather than dimerization. To confirm that MICL was glycosylated, we expressed MICL-HA in CHO-Lec1 cells, which are N-glycosylation-deficient (12Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 13Stanley P. Narasimhan S. Siminovitch L. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as well as in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells expressed glycosylated MICL in a similar fashion to NIH3T3 cells, but in CHO-Lec1 cells, the molecular mass of MICL was reduced to near its predicted unglycosylated mass (∼31 kDa). Therefore, MICL is expressed at the cell surface and is highly N-glycosylated. MICL Is Associated with SHP-1 and SHP-2, but Not with SHIP—ITIM-containing receptors are known to exact their inhibitory functions through the recruitment of phosphatase enzymes, including SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP (1Long E.O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 875-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine which, if any, of these phosphatases are recruited by the ITIM of MICL. To this end, we expressed HA-tagged MICL in RAW264.7 cells because this cell line is known to express all three phosphatases (31Angata T. Kerr S.C. Greaves D.R. Varki N.M. Crocker P.R. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24466-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R.

https://openalex.org/W2135798219,"In situ measurements of the relative humidity with respect to ice (RH i ) and of nitric acid (HNO 3 ) were made in both natural and contrail cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere. At temperatures lower than 202 kelvin, RH i values show a sharp increase to average values of over 130% in both cloud types. These enhanced RH i values are attributed to the presence of a new class of HNO 3 -containing ice particles (Δ-ice). We propose that surface HNO 3 molecules prevent the ice/vapor system from reaching equilibrium by a mechanism similar to that of freezing point depression by antifreeze proteins. Δ-ice represents a new link between global climate and natural and anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emissions. Including Δ-ice in climate models will alter simulated cirrus properties and the distribution of upper tropospheric water vapor."
https://openalex.org/W2141645337,"Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR), LRP5/6, were shown to interact with the Frizzled (Fz) receptors and to function as Wnt coreceptors. Here we show that mLRP4T100, a minireceptor of LRP1, another member of the LDLR family, interacts with the human Fz-1 (HFz1), previously shown to serve as a receptor transmitting the canonical Wnt-3a-induced signaling cascade. However, in contrast to LRP5/6, mLRP4T100, as well as the full-length LRP1, did not cooperate with HFz1 in transmitting the Wnt-3a signaling but rather repressed it. mLRP4T100 inhibitory effect was displayed also by endocytosis-defective mLRP4T100 mutants, suggesting that LRP1 repressive effect is not attributable to LRP1-mediated enhanced HFz1 internalization and subsequent degradation. Enforced expression of mLRP4T100 decreased the capacity of HFz1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) to interact with LRP6, in contrast to HFz1-CRD/Wnt-3a interaction that was not disrupted by overexpressing mLRP4T100. These data suggest that LRP1, by sequestering HFz1, disrupts the receptor/coreceptor complex formation, leading to the repression of the canonical Wnt signaling. Thus, this study implies that the ability to interact with Fz receptors is shared by several members of the LDLR family. However, whereas some members of the LDLR family, such as LRP5/6, interact with Fz and serve as Wnt coreceptors, others negatively regulate Wnt signaling, presumably by sequestering Fz."

https://openalex.org/W1997166409,"Outer dense fibers (ODF) are specific subcellular components of the sperm flagellum. The functions of ODF have not yet been clearly elucidated. We have investigated the protein composition of purified ODF from bovine spermatozoa and found that one of the most abundant proteins is a 30–32-kDa polypeptide. This protein was analyzed by sequencing peptides derived following limited proteolysis. Peptide sequences were found to match VDAC2 and VDAC3. VDACs (voltage-dependent, anion-selective channels) or eukaryotic porins are a group of proteins first identified in the mitochondrial outer membrane that are able to form hydrophilic pore structures in membranes. In mammals, three VDAC isoforms (VDAC1, -2, -3) have been identified by cDNA cloning and sequencing. Antibodies against synthetic peptides specific for the three mammal VDAC isoforms were generated in rabbits. Their specificity was demonstrated by immunoblotting using recombinant VDAC1, -2, and -3. In protein extracts of bovine spermatozoa, VDAC1, -2, and -3 were detected by specific antibodies, while only VDAC2 and -3 were found as solubilized proteins derived from purified bovine ODFs. Immunofluorescence microscopy of spermatozoa revealed that anti-VDAC2 and anti-VDAC3 antibodies clearly bound to the sperm flagellum, in particular to the ODF. Transmission electron immunomicroscopy supported the finding that VDAC2 protein is abundant in the ODF. Since the ODF does not have any known membranous structure, it is tempting to speculate that VDAC2 and VDAC3 might have an alternative structural organization and different functions in ODF than in mitochondria.

Colombini M. Finkelstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 30: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Since then, VDAC proteins have been discovered in most eukaryotic organisms ranging from yeast (2Mihara K. Sato R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to animals (3Linden M. Gellerfors P. Nelson B.D. Biochem.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of these proteins has been mainly achieved by purified protein reconstitution into planar bilayer membranes (for a review see Ref. 7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial porin displays a rather unspecific single channel activity with a molecular exclusion for hydrophilic permeable molecules of ∼3 kDa (4De Pinto V. Ludwig O. Krause J. Benz R. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VDAC displays a very sensitive voltage dependence when assayed under in vitro conditions (8Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 111: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). At voltages close to 0 mV, the channel exists mainly in its fully open state. Upon application of voltages larger than 20 mV, it switches to subconducting states (9Benz R. Brdiczka D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In these subconducting states, VDAC not only has a reduced permeability but also a reversed selectivity. For instance, the channel allows the diffusion of negatively charged solutes such as succinate, malate, and ATP in the fully open state, but not after switching to a subconducting state that is cation selective (10Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been assumed that the voltage dependence might be the mechanism used by VDAC to regulate mitochondrial function. Soon after the characterization of the VDAC protein and gene, molecular techniques permitted the discovery of homologous genes in several different eukaryotic organisms (11Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae it was shown that a second gene exists encoding a VDAC-like protein, termed VDAC2 by sequence homology (12Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In human, rat, and mouse three different VDAC genes encoding distinctly expressed isoforms have been reported (11Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M.

Human and mouse VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms display channel-forming activity in vitro and can complement VDAC-deficient yeast, while VDAC3 can only partially complement this defect (14Xu X. Decker W. Sampson M.J. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). On the basis of transcriptional analysis, mammalian VDAC isoforms are expressed in a wide variety of tissues (11Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M.

Hinsch Asmarinah E. Konrad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is only limited information regarding the physiological function of the alternative VDAC isoforms. The role of mitochondrial VDAC1 (porin isoform 1) in apoptosis has also been investigated in recent years (16Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 17Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Biochimie.

Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A recent report focused on the VDAC2 isoform as an important component of the cell death pathway (20Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Other unexpected information has come in the last few years following the reported possibility that VDAC may interact with other cellular proteins, especially those of the cytoskeleton (17Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. Biochimie. (Paris). 2002; 84: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Linden M. Karlsson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thinnes et al. (24Thinnes F.P. Gotz H. Kayser H. Benz R. Schmidt W.E. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1989; 370: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were first to report the existence of VDAC (porin 31 HL) in the plasmalemma of human lymphocytes. Most recently, VDAC was identified in the plasma membrane of human endothelial cells, and these investigators suggested that VDAC is the receptor for plasminogen Kringle 5 in these cells (25Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Currently, there is only scant information regarding the presence and the function of VDACs in mammalian spermatozoa. It has been demonstrated that male mice in which the VDAC3 gene was inactivated by targeted disruption in embryonic stem cells are infertile (26Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Beaudet A.L. Ruitenbeek W. Armstrong D. Hicks M.J. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39206-39212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The animals displayed normal sperm counts but exhibited markedly reduced motility due to structural defects in the sperm flagella. Recently, we reported the sequencing of the VDAC2 (porin-2) cDNA from bovine testis and demonstrated a high identity to the murine, rabbit, and human subtypes at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (15Hinsch K.D. Hinsch Asmarinah E. Konrad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). mRNA analysis revealed the expression of VDAC2 in the bovine testis; high levels of VDAC2 proteins were also found in spermatocytes, spermatids, and spermatozoa. In contrast, VDAC1 (porin-1) was exclusively localized to Sertoli cells (15Hinsch K.D. Hinsch Asmarinah E. Konrad L. Biochim. Biophys.

In this study, we show for the first time the extramembranous localization of VDAC type 2 and type 3 in the ODF of the sperm flagellum. The sperm tail can be subdivided into two compartments: the midpiece, which contains the mitochondria surrounding the ODF and the axoneme, and the principal piece, which contains the fibrous sheath, ODF, and the axoneme. The ODF have a distinguishable, characteristic shape, and the structure is highly insoluble. Functionally, the ODF have been suggested to maintain the passive elastic structure and elastic recoil of the sperm flagellum needed for flagellar bending and possibly also to protect it from shearing forces during epididymal transport (27Baltz J.M. Williams P.O. Cone R.A. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Depending on the species, mammalian ODF consist of at least 14 polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼11–87 kDa (28Henkel R. Stalf T. Miska W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1992; 373: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We found evidence that high amounts of VDAC2 and VDAC3 are present in the ODF of the bovine sperm flagellum. The possible role of such pore-forming VDAC proteins in sperm ODF, which represents a non-membranous structure in mammalian spermatozoa, will be discussed. Preparation of Outer Dense Fiber Proteins and Protein Sequencing— Bovine ejaculates were collected with the aid of an artificial vagina and samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen without dilution and stored at -80 °C. For the enrichment of ODF fractions, spermatozoa from about 50 ejaculates were used. ODF were purified by a previously published protocol (30Brito M. Gamete Res. 1986; 15: 327-336Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Hinsch E. Boehm J.G. Groeger S. Mueller-Schloesser F. Hinsch K.D. Reprod. Domest. Anim. 2003; 38: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) Purified bovine ODF were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. The SDS-insoluble and -soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. Slab gels were composed of 10% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.21% (w/v) bisacrylamide. Solubilized ODF polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. The prominent broad band with an apparent molecular mass of about 30 kDa was excised and stored at -70 °C until use. Elution of 30-kDa ODF polypeptides from the polyacrylamide gel, concentration of protein with an agarose-based concentration gel system, and tryptic digestion was performed as described previously (32Rider M.H. Puype M. van Damme J. Gevaert K. De Boeck S. d'Alayer J. Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. Vanderkerchove J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HPLC of the resulting peptides and microsequencing were performed as described by Ungewickell et al. (33Ungewickell E. Plessmann U. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant Human VDAC Isoforms—Primers used for the amplification of each human porin isoform were designed at the start and stop codons. The forward primers for VDAC2 and VDAC3 introduced a SacI restriction site, while the primer for VDAC1 introduced a BamHI site upstream of the amplified products. The reverse primers for the three VDAC isoforms introduced a SalI restriction site downstream of the amplified products. These primer sequences are listed in Table I. The template used for amplification of each human VDAC isoform was the corresponding cDNA.Table IPrimers sequences used for amplificationPrimersSequencesHVDAC1-ATG-Bam:5′-AAA GGA TTC ATG GCT GTG CCA CCC ACG TATHVDAC1-TAA-Sal5′-AAA TAG GTC TTA TGC TTG AAA TTC CAG TCCHVDAC2-ATG-Sac5′-TAG GAG CTC ATG TGT ATT CCT CCA TCA TATHVDAC2-TAA-Sal5′-TAG GTC GAC TTA AGC CTC CAA CTC CAGHVDAC3-ATG-Sac5′-TAG GAG CTC ATG TGT AAC ACA CCA ACG TAHVDAC3-TAA-Sal5′-TAG GTC GAC TTA AGC TTC CAG TTC AAA TCC Open table in a new tab The PCR reaction was performed according to a standard protocol in a volume of 50 μl. The final concentration of dNTPs was 0.2 mm each, MgCl2 was 1.5 mm, and the primer final concentration was 0.5 μm each. The PCR products were cloned into the linear TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). The fragments released from the TOPO-TA vector after digestion with the proper restriction enzymes were ligated into the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to obtain the plasmids pQE30HVDAC1, pQE30HVDAC2, and pQE30HVDAC3. These plasmids coded additionally for six histidines (His tag) upstream of the multiple cloning site containing the coding sequences. Transformed cells were spread on ampicillin- and kanamycin-containing agar plates. Positive clones were picked, and the plasmid DNA was extracted from a single colony, digested, checked on a 1% agarose gel for the correct fragment size, and finally sequenced to confirm product identity. Heterologous Expression of Human VDAC Isoforms—An overnight culture of modified Escherichia coli M15 cells transformed with the appropriate plasmid in LB medium was diluted 1:20 in 50 ml of fresh medium and grown to a density of 0.6 (OD600 nm). One ml culture was removed to serve as the non-induced control, and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce expression of recombinant VDACs. After a 5-h growth period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow the lysis of the inclusion bodies containing the recombinant protein. The urea suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and the supernatant was collected and loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the same buffer at pH 6.3 to remove proteins weakly adsorbed to the Ni-NTA. Elution was performed with the same buffer at pH 4.5. All the samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE to check protein induction and purity of the expressed proteins. Generation of Antibodies against Subtype-specific Synthetic Porin Peptides—The sequences of the synthetic peptides used as antigens are shown in Table II. The sequences were either derived from VDAC2 or VDAC3 amino acid sequences that were identified in bovine sperm ODF protein proteolytic peptides (Fig. 1) and/or were deduced from cDNA clones coding for bovine VDAC1, -2, and -3. Accession numbers and amino acid residue numbers were as follows: VDAC1 Bos taurus (POR1_BOVIN) P45879: amino acids 271–282; VDAC2 Bos taurus Q9MYV7: amino acids 236–247; VDAC3 Bos taurus (POR3_BOVIN) Q9MZ13: amino acids 16–25 (Fig. 2). Selection and synthesis of VDAC peptides, as well as cross-linking of peptides to KLH, were performed as described (34Hinsch E. Hagele W. Schill W.B. Hinsch K.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 424: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of anti-VDAC antibodies was performed using the respective synthetic VDAC peptides that were covalently linked to AminoLink columns (AminoLink Kit, Pierce, Bonn, Germany). Binding of synthetic peptides and antibody purification was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Antibody binding activity and specificity of the antibody reaction were evaluated by ELISA as described previously (35Hinsch E. Hinsch K.D.

The concentration of sperm cells were adjusted to 180 × 106/ml and suspended in 0.6 m NaCl in PBS to remove loosely attached seminal plasma proteins from the sperm surface. Following pre-extraction in 0.2% Triton X-100 in extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C, the spermatozoa were centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the sperm suspension was centrifuged at 6,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored at -80 °C until use. For the solubilization of ODF proteins, purified ODF obtained as previously described were extracted under reducing conditions using a buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 20 mg/ml Trasylol, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Recombinant and solubilized sperm protein fractions were dissolved in SDS-containing sample buffer. Protein was assayed according to the method of Lowry (36Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7113) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) in 12% (v/v) acrylamide (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting using antisera and affinity-purified antibodies was performed essentially as previously described (35Hinsch E. Hinsch K.D. Andrologia. 1996; 28: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes containing transblotted protein bands were blocked with 5% (v/v) teleostean gelatin (Sigma) in TTBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Thereafter, filters were incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified antibodies at appropriate dilutions. After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with 1:3000-diluted peroxidase-conjugated protein A for 1 h. Specific binding of antibodies was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and subsequent exposure to x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film, Düsseldorf, Germany) as recommended by the supplier. The specificity of the reaction of the polyclonal antiserum AS P1/6 was determined by pre-absorption with the peptide employed as immunogen. The antiserum was preincubated at 1:200 dilution with 10 μg of P1 peptide/ml for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently assayed by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence—Bovine spermatozoa from fresh ejaculates were washed twice by centrifugation. After the second wash, the concentration of spermatozoa was adjusted to 20–30 × 106 cells/ml with PBS (pH 7.4). Subsequently, sperm cells were frozen/thawed three times using liquid nitrogen and a 38 °C water bath. Thereafter, spermatozoa were spread across a glass slide (covered with 0.5% gelatin, 0.05% potassium chromate (III) sulfate in H2O), air-dried, and fixed for 3 min in a solution consisting of 60% (v/v) methanol, 30% (v/v) chloroform, and 10% (v/v) acetic acid (methacarn). Fixed spermatozoa were incubated with affinity-purified P2/45 anti-VDAC2 antibodies (15 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) or, as a control, with non-relevant rabbit IgG antibodies (15 μg/ml in PBS-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma) (1:2000 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Specific binding of antibodies was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled avidin (Sigma) (1:400) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, spermatozoa were mounted onto coverslips using Citifluor (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany) to avoid fading of fluorescence. Spermatozoa were examined for fluorescence using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Another immunofluorescence study was performed with cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa after removal of the mitochondrial sheath to reveal ODF epitopes (29Oko R. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 39: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cryopreserved spermatozoa (40 × 106 cells) were thawed in a water bath at 39 °C for 30 s and washed 3 × 5 min with 2 ml of PBS by centrifugation at 300 × g. The pellet was incubated 2 × 15 min at 4 °C with 4 ml of extraction buffer (2% v/v Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0,2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine). After each extraction, the sperm suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The last pellet was washed 2 × 10minwith2mlof50mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) by centrifugation at 1000 × g and 4 °C. The spermatozoa were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and spread across a glass slide (see above). Subsequently, detection of antibody binding was visualized by immunofluorescence as described above using the 1:50 diluted AS P3/31 antiserum. As negative control the respective pre-immune serum was used. Immunoelectron Microscopy—The preparation of bovine spermatozoa and preparations of ultrathin sections for immunoelectron microscopy has been described previously (38Hinsch E. Hagele W. van der Ven H. Oehninger S. Schill W.B. Hinsch K.D. Andrologia. 1998; 30: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Sections were exposed to antiserum AS P2/20 (15Hinsch K.D. Hinsch Asmarinah E. Konrad L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (1:5 dilution in TBS) or the respective preimmune serum (1:5 dilution in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were subsequently incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with colloidal gold (particle size of 10 nm) (Bio Cell, Cardiff, UK) at a 1:10 dilution for 45 min. Finally, sections were stained for 20 min with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, viewed, and photographed with a Philips 201 G transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Sequencing of 30–32 kDa ODF Proteins—The polypeptides from purified ODF were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1). The enriched ODF fraction consisted of six main polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 14, 28, 30, 32, and 50/52 kDa. In addition, some minor, well-focused and broad bands between 28 and 94 kDa were also visible. The broad 30–32-kDa band was excised and digested with trypsin. Proteolytic peptides were separated by HPLC and subjected to microsequencing. As shown in Fig. 2, sequencing of peptides derived from the 30–32-kDa band yielded four amino acid sequences. Comparison with published amino acid sequences revealed identical or similar sequences to VDAC2 and VDAC3. The amino acid sequences of peptides 1 and 2 are in agreement with the bovine VDAC3 sequence (position 16–25). However, the first and the last amino acid residues differed from the published VDAC1, -2, and -3 sequences. The amino acid sequence of peptide 3 is identical to the sequence of all three isoforms (positions 218–223 of VDAC1). Peptide 4 is identical to the bovine VDAC2 amino acid sequence (positions 236–247). To further identify the broad 30–32 kDa protein band from bovine ODF, Western blot analyses of extracted bovine sperm proteins were performed. Using antisera AS P1/6, AS P2/45, and AS P3/31, immunoblots with 0.2% Triton X-100 pre-extracted sperm proteins revealed that only traces of VDAC proteins could be identified (data not shown). Sperm proteins extracted in 2% Triton X-100 and an SDS extract of ODF were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and immunoreacted with a monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal end of human VDAC (mAb 4 anti-Porin 31HL, Ref. 39Babel D.

As a control, purified recombinant VDAC proteins were run on the same gels. As the blots clearly show (Fig. 3), AS P1/6 antibodies recognized a polypeptide of about 34 kDa in the Triton X-100 extract. No immunoreaction could be observed with the SDS extract of ODF or with the purified recombinant VDAC2 and VDAC3 proteins, while AS P1/6 strongly detected recombinant VD"
https://openalex.org/W1996063525,"Proteomic studies to find substrates of tyrosine kinases generally rely on identification of protein bands that are pulled down by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies from ligand-stimulated samples. One can obtain erroneous results from such experiments because of two major reasons. First, some proteins might be basally phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the absence of ligand stimulation. Second, proteins can bind non-specifically to the antibodies or the affinity matrix. Induction of phosphorylation of proteins by ligand must therefore be confirmed by a different approach, which is not always feasible. We have developed a novel proteomic approach to identify substrates of tyrosine kinases in signaling pathways studies based on in vivo labeling of proteins with light (12C-labeled) or heavy (13C-labeled) tyrosine. This stable isotope labeling in cell culture method enables the unequivocal identification of tyrosine kinase substrates, as peptides derived from true substrates give rise to a unique signature in a mass spectrometry experiment. By using this approach, from a single experiment, we have successfully identified several known substrates of insulin signaling pathway and a novel substrate, polymerase I and transcript release factor, a protein that is implicated in the control of RNA metabolism and regulation of type I collagen promoters. This approach is amenable to high throughput global studies as it simplifies the specific identification of substrates of tyrosine kinases as well as serine/threonine kinases using mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2052594374,The viscosities of aqueous fluids with 10 to 80 weight percent dissolved silicates have been measured at 600 degrees to 950 degrees C and 1.0 to 2.0 gigapascals by in situ observation of falling spheres in the diamond anvil cell. The viscosities at 800 degrees C range from 10(-4) to 10(0.5) pascal seconds. The combination of low viscosities with a favorable wetting angle makes silicate-rich fluid an efficient agent for material transport at low-volume fractions. Our results therefore suggest that there may be a direct relationship between the position of the volcanic front and the onset of complete miscibility between water and silicate melt in the subducting slab.
https://openalex.org/W1994413672,"Many birds perform visual signals during their learned songs, but little is known about the interrelationship between visual and vocal displays. We show here that male brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) synchronize the most elaborate wing movements of their display with atypically long silent periods in their song, potentially avoiding adverse biomechanical effects on sound production. Furthermore, expiratory effort for song is significantly reduced when cowbirds perform their wing display. These results show a close integration between vocal and visual displays and suggest that constraints and synergistic interactions between the motor patterns of multimodal signals influence the evolution of birdsong."

Phosphorylated gp140 was identified as a trypsin-sensitive precursor to p80. Identity was confirmed by digestion and phosphorylation studies with recombinant gp140-GFP. Plasmin, a serum protease, also converts gp140 to p80, providing biological significance to the cleavage in wounds. Phosphorylation of gp140 and p80 are mediated by Src family kinases at multiple Tyr residues including Tyr734. Dephosphorylation is mediated by PTP(s). Conversion of gp140 to p80 prolongs phosphorylation of p80 in response to suramin and changes in adhesion. This distinguishes gp140 and p80 and explains the relative abundance of phosphorylated p80 in trypsinized HKs.

Phosphorylated p80 (P-p80) in suspended HKs is dephosphorylated upon readhesion to laminin 5 via integrins α6β4 and α3β1. In work here, we purified and characterized p80. We wished to understand whether phosphorylated p80 identified in an in vitro deadhesion/readhesion screen (4Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) might be involved in physiologically significant wound activation. Quiescent epidermis adheres to laminin 5 in the BM via integrin α6β4 in hemidesmosome (HD) cell junctions. Wounding epidermis generates leading and following subpopulations of keratinocytes at the wound margin (5Lampe P.D. Nguyen B.P. Gil S. Usui M. Olerud J. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Leading keratinocytes migrate over exposed dermal collagen via integrin α2β1 and fibronectin via integrin α5β1. However, leading cells also deposit laminin 5 as a provisional BM and interact with these deposits via integrin α3β1 (5Lampe P.D. Nguyen B.P. Gil S. Usui M. Olerud J. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J.

The interaction of leading cells with deposited laminin 5 generates distinct transmembrane signals when compared with interaction with dermal ligands. For example, adhesion of HKs to laminin 5 via α3β1 promotes gap junction intercellular communication when compared with adhesion to collagen or fibronectin (5Lampe P.D. Nguyen B.P. Gil S. Usui M. Olerud J. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interactions of leading cells with collagen are inhibited by toxin B, an inhibitor of Rho GTPases, which does not inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent adhesion or spreading on laminin 5. Deposition of laminin 5 over exposed dermal collagen switches adhesion and spreading from toxin B-sensitive to toxin B-resistant (6Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol.

Consistently, we also found that adhesion to dermal ligands was less effective than laminin 5 in regulating phosphorylation of p80 (4Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of P-p80 upon adhesion to laminin 5, but not collagen, is resistant to cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of the actin cytoskeleton. Vanadate, an inhibitor of PTPs, prevents dephosphorylation of P-p80 upon adhesion, indicating that a PTP is required for the dephosphorylation. Phosphorylated p80 is detected in primary cultures of many epithelial cells (epidermal, esophageal, cervical, and gastric) but not primary cultures of fibroblasts or some immortalized epithelial cell populations (4Xia Y.

We concluded that adhesion-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of p80 on laminin 5 may report unique cell signals and functions in many epithelia. Here, we describe the purification of P-p80 from trypsin-suspended HKs and its characterization. The results integrate five novel observations. (i) A novel 140-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, gp140, is identified as the trypsin-sensitive precursor to p80 and contains extracellular CUB protein-protein interaction domains. (ii) gp140/p80 is identified as the product of the CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) gene that is overexpressed in human colorectal and lung cancers (9Scherl-Mostageer M. Sommergruber W. Abseher R. Hauptmann R. Ambros P. Schweifer N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4402-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), is a marker for hematopoietic stem cells, (10Conze T. Lammers R. Kuci S. Scherl-Mostageer M. Schweifer N. Kanz L. Buhring H.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 996: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is identical to SIMA135, a membrane glycoprotein elevated in metastatic human tumor cells (11Hooper J.D. Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T. Liang H. Claassen G.F. Tarin D. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). (iii) Tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 is mediated by Src family kinase(s) on several tyrosines including tyrosine 734 upon detachment of HKs with trypsin or treatment with suramin, a membrane-impermeable polysulfonated napthylurea (12Dhar S. Gullbo J. Csoka K. Eriksson E. Nilsson K. Nickel P. Larsson R. Nygren P. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). (iv) Significantly, trypsin conversion of gp140 to p80 is duplicated by serum plasmin. (v) This conversion decreases the rate of dephosphorylation of p80 relative to gp140 in response to detachment or suramin. The studies here suggest roles for plasmin and adhesion in regulating phosphorylation of gp140/p80 in epidermal wounds. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and PY20 (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) clone JL-8 (BD Biosciences), and rabbit antibodies against FAK Tyr(P)397 (catalog no. 44-624) and FAK Tyr(P)861 (catalog no. 44-626; BIOSOURCE, Hopkinton, MA) were purchased from the designated suppliers and used according to the manufacturers' suggestions. Phosphopeptides from gp140/p80 were synthesized by BIOSOURCE according to our specifications. Suramin, calpeptin, dephostatin, SU6656, PP2, ALLN (proteosome inhibitor), XAMR 0721 (suramin analogue), and PPADS (purinergic receptor antagonist) were purchased from either Calbiochem or Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Plasmin, thrombin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), protein G-agarose, trypan blue, NF023 (purinergic receptor antagonist), and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were from Sigma. Cell Culture, Drug Treatments, and Cell Extraction—HKs were isolated and grown in monolayer culture as previously described (13Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1985; 9: 83-93Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar), using defined medium (KGM, Cambrex, San Diego, CA). For phosphorylation studies, HKs were (i) treated with or without inhibitors for 30 min at the designated concentrations prior to (ii) treatment with or without suramin (35 μm) for 20 min and (iii) extraction with 2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline/1–2 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), sodium fluoride (NaF), and sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4; collectively buffer A) for 30 min at 4 °C. The Triton-soluble extract was collected by centrifugation, and the Triton-resistant pellet was extracted with 2 m urea, 1 m sodium chloride plus 1–2 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NEM, NaF, and Na3VO4 to collect the Triton-insoluble cellular material. Phosphatase Assay—Total phosphatase activity in lysates of HKs was assayed as described (14Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15579-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Tyrosine phosphatase activity (vanadate-inhibitable) was calculated as the difference between total phosphatase activities of a given sample measured with and without pervanadate. Purification of Tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 and gp140 —p80 and gp140 were purified from HKs using similar protocols as outlined below. However, p80 was purified from HKs suspended with trypsin-EDTA to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 as previously described (4Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, gp140 was purified from adherent HKs that were treated with suramin to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of gp140 and p80. Adherent HKs were removed from culture dishes with a cell scraper. Trypsin-EDTA or scrape suspended HKs were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1–2 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NEM, NaF and Na3VO4. Unless specifically stated, all subsequent steps used buffers that included these protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Total cellular membrane and cytosolic fractions were collected from the homogenate after centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The membrane fraction was extracted with buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (4 min, 2000 × g). The soluble material was incubated with WGA-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C; unbound or loosely attached protein was washed away with 1% Empigen BB, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4; and the bound material was eluted with 400 mm N-acetylglucosamine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were isolated from the WGA-eluted material by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10-agarose; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and eluted with 8 m urea with 0.1% Triton X-100 detergent, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The eluted phosphoproteins were further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE and analyzed as follows. Partial Amino Acid Sequencing of Purified p80 —Partial amino acid sequencing of purified p80 was performed by the Harvard microsequencing facility under the direction of William Lane. The purified p80 protein in gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (24 nmol of purified p80 based on AA analysis). Trypsin-digestion released peptides were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC on a Zorbax C18 column, and peaks of candidate peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to obtain mass number and homogeneity followed by sequencing by phenylthiohydantoin derivatization. This provided amino acid sequence from five different p80 peptides (peptides 65, 98, 38, 118, and 31; see “Results” and Fig. 2). Identification of GP140 by Mass Spectrometry—Identification of gp140 was performed in the FHCRC mass spectrometry facility by Philip Gafkin and Angela Norbeck. The SDS-PAGE-purified gp140 was subject to in-gel trypsin digestion, and the soluble samples were desalted using Millipore μC18 ZipTips and dried. The sample was then resuspended in 5 μl of water and analyzed by LC MS/MS with a ThermoFinnigan LCQ DECA XP mass spectrometer (15Gatlin C.L. Kleemann G.R. Hays L.G. Link A.J. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Data were collected in the data-dependent mode in which an MS scan was followed by MS/MS scans of the three most abundant ions from the preceding MS scan. The MS/MS data were searched against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base and a human subset of this data base using SEQUEST™ software. The resulting peptide matches were scored by SEQUEST™, and protein identifications were considered valid if the identified protein contained at least two peptides with Xcorr scores above 2.0 and the identification did not appear in a control sample from a blank portion of the gel. Preparation of Nondegenerated Oligonucleotide Probe from p80 Peptide Sequence—An RT-PCR protocol was used to obtain a nondegenerate oligonucleotide probe from amino acid sequence of p80 peptide 65. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of p80 peptide 65 and were kinase-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled primers were used in RT-PCR reactions with total RNA from HKs, isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen). For synthesis of the first strand cDNA, labeled degenerate antisense primer B (RAANACYTCNGGRTTGGT) was used followed by PCR amplification with a second labeled degenerate sense primer A (GTNGARTAYTAYATHCC). Both labeled primers were run in two PCRs run in parallel. The PCR products were then identified by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a 12% sequencing gel. One labeled band with approximate size of 45 bp was detected in each reaction. The DNA fragment was eluted from the gel with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl). The purified 45-bp fragment was subcloned into PCRII vector and sequenced. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed on purified DNA using dye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Screening of cDNA Library and Sequencing-selected cDNA Clones— The p80A/B oligonucleotide probe was labeled by random priming (109 cpm/μg DNA; Stratagene) and used to screen a human keratinocyte λgtll cDNA library. For screening, phage plaques were immobilized on nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll) membranes and prehybridized at 37 °C for 4 h in buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Blocked filters were incubated with labeled p80A/B probe at 37 °C for 14 h and washed (2× SSC and 0.1% SDS, room temperature), and positive plaques were purified. Phage were grown in Y1090 bacteria, and DNA was isolated (Lambda Preps DNA Purification, Promega, CA) and digested with EcoRI to release insert, which was gel-purified and transferred to BlueScript vector for sequencing. This screening approach identified and sequenced a single 2.0-kb p80 cDNA. Construction and Expression of GFP-gp140 —A full-length gp140/CDCP1 cDNA was constructed by sequential insertion of three partial cDNAs into the multiple cloning site of an pEGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech). The correct sequence of the full-length cDNA was confirmed. The resulting full-length gp140/CDCP1 cDNA without a stop codon was connected in frame at its 3′-end to the 5′-end of GFP. In this orientation, expression of gp140 would orient the GFP at the cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail of gp140. Therefore, the GFP would remain after proteolytic conversion of gp140-GFP to p80-GFP. The gp140-pEGFP-N1 plasmid was transfected into 293T cells or mouse keratinocytes with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Mouse keratinocytes were grown in KGM (Cambrex). 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum after transfection as indicated. Transient transfection of the gp140-pEGFP-N1 plasmid in cells produced GFP-gp140 on the surface of cells. However, stable transfection by selection in G418 was not successful. Apparently, toxicity of the GFP-gp140 construct limited stable transfection. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed with specific primary antibodies after transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose and the blocking of nonspecific binding sites with either 0.5% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40; Sigma), and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (chemiluminescence) or LiCor blocking buffer/phosphate-buffered saline (1:1; LiCor infrared imager). Primary antibodies were then either incubated with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako or Cappel) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) or incubated with species-specific Alexa Fluor 680- or IRDye800-conjugated secondary Abs (Molecular Probes or Rockland, respectively) and visualized with a LiCor Odyssey infrared imager (LiCor, Lincoln, NE). Immunostaining—Confluent cultures of HKs were incubated with and without PP2 kinase inhibitor (1 μm for 30 min) followed by or not followed by suramin (35 μm for 10 min). Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 0.1 m sucrose, pH 7.2, containing both vanadate and NEM to inhibit phosphatases and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 detergent. Cells were stained with Ab FAK Tyr(P)861 with and without synthetic gp140 phosphopeptide P-Y734 (10 μg/ml), and bound Ab was detected with rhodamine-conjugated secondary Ab. Images were collected with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with a Photometric SenSys cooled CCD digital camera (Roper Industries, Trenton, NJ) using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Adhesion Regulates Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of p80 —As previously shown (4Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), deadhesion of HKs with trypsin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a prominent 80-kDa membrane glycoprotein, p80, and decreases phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Subsequent readhesion of the suspended HKs onto laminin 5 via integrins α6β4 and α3β1 for 10 min increases phosphorylation of FAK and dephosphorylates p80 (Fig. 1, lane 3). This indicates that phosphorylation of p80 occurs upon trypsin suspension and dephosphorylation occurs upon readhesion. Vanadate addition prevents the dephosphorylation of p80 upon readhesion, indicating that dephosphorylation by a PTP is the primary reason for the disappearance of P-p80 (4Xia Y. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in the subsequent 1–6 h, p80 is transiently rephosphorylated and then dephosphorylated (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). This indicates that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of p80 also occurs in adherent HKs possibly as a result of transient changes in spreading or migration. These changes in phosphorylation of p80 raised questions regarding its identity and the outside-in signals that regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. Below, we purify and characterize p80, evaluate tyrosine kinase and PTP that balance phosphorylation of p80, and evaluate proteolysis in regulating phosphorylation. Purification of P-p80 from Trypsin-detached HKs and Partial Amino Acid Sequencing—Candidate studies failed to identify p80, necessitating purification of P-p80 for characterization. HKs were suspended with trypsin/EDTA to promote phosphorylation of p80. The P-p80 was isolated by (i) preparation of a membrane-rich fraction, (ii) extraction of the membranes with Triton X-100 detergent to obtain a soluble membrane extract, (iii) sequential purification of P-p80 from the extract on immobilized WGA to collect membrane glycoproteins followed by elution and affinity purification on immobilized anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20 or 4G10), and (iv) preparative SDS-PAGE. The purified P-p80 was detected with silver stain and digested with trypsin, peptides were fractionated by HPLC, and peptides were assigned mass by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid-sequenced. This provided amino acid sequences for five p80 tryptic peptides: (peptide 65, NH2-EERVEYYIPGSTTNPEVFK-COOH, mass = 2261.3 Da; peptide 98, NH2-FAPSFRQEAXXX-COOH, mass = 2771.6 Da; peptide 38, NH2-EEGVFTVTPDTK-COOH, mass = ∼1 kDa; peptide 118, NH2-XYSLQVPSDILHLPVELXDFXXK-COOH, mass = 2723.3 Da; peptide 31, NH2-GPAVGI-COOH, mass = ∼1 kDa). See Fig. 2 (P80 peptides identified) for localization of the peptides within the p80 amino acid sequence. Sequencing of a p80 cDNA Encoding a Transmembrane CUB Domain Protein—A nondegenerate p80 oligonucleotide probe was prepared based on the sequence of p80 peptide 65 and used to screen a HK cDNA library. The peptide 65 oligonucleotide probe identified a single 2-kb cDNA. This cDNA was cloned and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY375452). The nucleotide sequence of the 2-kb p80 cDNA was translated in all three reading frames, one of which encoded 716 amino acids, including four of the five p80 tryptic peptides (peptides 65, 98, 118, and 38; Fig. 2) but not peptide 31 (Fig. 2). This established that the p80 cDNA encodes most of the 80-kDa protein that was purified and sequenced. In this reading frame, an in-frame stop codon was present in the p80 cDNA sequence at positions 2155–2157. PCR experiments that followed indicated that the stop codon was an error in the p80 cDNA possibly originating in the cDNA library used for screening and identifying the original p80 cDNA. The 716 amino acids included 26 residues upstream of the initiating methionine identified by a Kozak consensus sequence. Numbering from the initiating methionine, the coding sequence includes 691 amino acids and the following protein motifs (Fig. 2): an amino-terminal signal peptide with a predicted cleavage site that would yield a phenylalanine amino terminus, three extracellular CUB protein-protein interaction domains (16Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), 11 potential N-glycosylation sites consistent with the known binding of p80 to WGA, and a transmembrane domain with a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic sequence. However, there were no detectable cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This is inconsistent with the observed tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. Further, the absence of p80 peptide 31 in the identified 716-amino acid sequence suggested that we did not have a full-length cDNA or the complete amino acid sequence of the carboxyl terminus of p80. p80 Is a Fragment of CDCP1 Containing Cytoplasmic Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites—Nucleotide sequence of the 2.0-kb p80 partial cDNA was compared with the human genome data base (available on the World Wide Web www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and identified nearly identical sequences that localized to chromosome 3p21. Significantly, published gene sequence designated CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1; accession number NM022842) and derived amino acid sequence (accession number AA033397) (9Scherl-Mostageer M. Sommergruber W. Abseher R. Hauptmann R. Ambros P. Schweifer N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4402-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of p80. Only Arg525 of p80 was distinct from Gln525 in CDCP1. Both MS-based amino acid sequencing of p80 (peptide 98) and LC MS/MS-based sequencing of peptides in gp140 confirmed that amino acid 525 was Arg (see sequence of peptides P6, 7 in Fig. 2 and peptides 6 and 7 under gp140 peptides in Fig. 4B). Consistently, a second published sequence for SIMA135 (11Hooper J.D. Zijlstra A. Aimes R.T. Liang H. Claassen G.F. Tarin D. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1783-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (accession number AAK02058) was 100% identical to derived p80 amino acid sequence. Two additional unpublished but submitted sequences (accession numbers BAB15511 and AA033397) were compared and found to be nearly identical to p80 when using the MULTALIN alignment program (available on the World Wide Web at npsapbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/align_multalin.pl). The CDCP1 gene was originally identified based on its elevated expression in human gastric and lung carcinomas (9Scherl-Mostageer M. Sommergruber W. Abseher R. Hauptmann R. Ambros P. Schweifer N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4402-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although no protein was identified, the CDCP1 gene encodes a putative transmembrane protein of 836 amino acids that extends 145 amino acids beyond the carboxyl terminal end of the 691 amino acids encoded by the p80 cDNA (Fig. 2). The additional 145 amino acids include the missing p80 nucleotide sequence for peptide 31 in the p80 cDNA. This established that p80 is CDCP1. The additional 145 residues contain 5 tyrosine residues. Two of these tyrosine residues define canonical phosphorylation sites for tyrosine kinases (residues 734 and 806; Fig. 2). In addition, two type II Src homology 3 ligand-binding sites (residues 716–721 and 772–777) were identified. The 836 amino acids and glycosylation sites of the CDCP1 gene should generate a glycoprotein considerably larger than p80. This raised the possibility that a larger or precursor form of p80 exists that is encoded by the CDCP1 gene. Suramin Promotes Tyrosine Phosphorylation of p80 and gp140 —We wished to determine whether a possible trypsin-sensitive precursor to p80 existed and whether phosphorylation of p80 might be regulated by known signaling pathways. Soluble factors (growth factors or cytokines: transforming growth factor β1, epidermal growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, interferon-γ) or drugs that regulate protein kinases (retinoic acid, TPA, suramin) were evaluated. The compounds were added to both adherent and trypsin/EDTA-suspended HKs. Effects of the compounds on phosphorylation of p80 were detected by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs (PY20 or 4G10). Most of these compounds had no detectable or inconsistent effects on phosphorylation of p80. In contrast, suramin, a polysulfonated napthylurea with multiple reported activities, stimulated a rapid and selective phosphoryl"
https://openalex.org/W2089972763,"The cardiotoxicity induced by the anticancer anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is attributed to reactions between iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to oxidative damage. We found that DOX forms ROS in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, as shown by dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation and the expression of stress-responsive genes such as catalase or aldose reductase. DOX also increased ferritin levels in these cells, particularly the H subunit. A considerable increase in ferritin mRNA levels showed that DOX acted at transcriptional level, but an additional potential mechanism was identified as the down-regulation of iron regulatory protein-2, post-transcriptional inhibitor of ferritin synthesis. Pretreatment with DOX protected H9c2 cells against the damage induced by subsequent exposure to ferric ammonium citrate, and experiments with 55Fe revealed that the protection was due to the deposition of iron in ferritin. Cytoprotection was also observed when DOX was replaced by glucose/glucose oxidase, a source of H2O2, thus suggesting that DOX increases ferritin synthesis through the action of ROS. This concept was supported by three more lines of evidence. (i) DOX-induced ferritin synthesis was blocked by N-acetylcysteine, a scavenger of ROS. (ii) Mitoxantrone, a ROS-forming analogue, similarly induced ferritin expression and protected the cells against iron toxicity. (iii) 5-Iminodaunorubicin, an analogue lacking ROS-forming activity, did not induce ferritin synthesis or protect the cells against iron toxicity. These results characterize a paradoxically beneficial link between anthracycline-derived ROS, increased ferritin synthesis, and resistance to iron-mediated damage.

It has been suggested that both iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate the cardiotoxicity induced by DOX, but the mechanisms through which iron and ROS interact and damage cardiac cells are still debated. It has long been known that one-electron redox cycling of a quinone moiety in the tetracyclic ring of DOX is accompanied by the formation of ROS, similar to superoxide ( O2˙-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Iron could act by converting these ROS into more potent and damaging oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (·OH) (1Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have demonstrated that both DOX-derived ROS and other anthracycline metabolites such as the side chain secondary alcohol metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol) may act by altering the function of the cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins (IRP) that govern iron homeostasis by binding to iron-responsive elements in the untranslated regions of mRNAs for transferrin receptor and ferritin (1Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Google Scholar). When activated, IRPs enhance transferrin receptor mRNA stability and block ferritin mRNA translation, thus favoring iron uptake over sequestration and forming a pool of iron available for metabolic use. Conversely, the down-regulation of IRP activity allows ferritin synthesis to proceed and reduces transferrin receptor expression, thus preventing an accumulation of potentially toxic excess iron (2Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Google Scholar, 3Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Google Scholar). Studies of cell-free systems and isolated cardiomyocytes show that the secondary alcohol moiety of DOXol oxidizes with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of cytoplasmic aconitase, a process that regenerates DOX while also inducing cluster disassembly and the consequent change of aconitase into active IRP-1 (4Minotti G. Recalcati S. Mordente A. Liberi G. Calafiore A.M. Mancuso C. Preziosi P. Cairo G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 541-552Google Scholar, 5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). Subsequent interactions of DOX with cluster-released iron form an anthracycline-iron complex that irreversibly oxidizes the newly formed IRP-1, thus giving a “null” protein that lacks RNA binding activity even in the presence of a reducing agent such as 2-mercaptoethanol (4Minotti G. Recalcati S. Mordente A. Liberi G. Calafiore A.M. Mancuso C. Preziosi P. Cairo G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 541-552Google Scholar, 5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). Quinone-derived ROS synergize with anthracycline-iron complexes in promoting the oxidation of IRP-1 to a null protein (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar); at the same time ROS play an independent role in promoting oxidative modifications in a clusterless IRP-2, thus priming it to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar, 6Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Google Scholar). DOX therefore seems to alter the normal functioning of both IRPs through a sequential action of DOXol and ROS on aconitase/IRP-1 or an independent action of ROS on IRP-2. These mechanisms may act as important links between anthracyclines and ROS and iron-mediated toxicity. It is worth noting that a number of chemical and physical or biological sources of ROS have been shown to induce transcriptional activation of ferritin synthesis, an effect that could be of benefit if the ferritin sequestered iron before it reacted with ROS to generate potent cell oxidants (7Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Google Scholar). Whether this occurs in cells exposed to DOX-derived ROS has not been formally established. To improve our understanding of the role of iron and ROS in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and given the central role that ferritin may play, we examined the expression of ferritin and its influence on iron-mediated toxicity in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes exposed to DOX. Cell Culture—The H9c2 embryonic rat heart-derived cell line was obtained from The American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1446), grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's-modified minimum Eagle's medium adjusted to contain 4 mm glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g//liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were treated for 24 h with various concentrations of DOX, 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-i-DNR) (Amersham Biosciences), or mitoxantrone (Mitox) (Sigma) or incubated for various periods of time with 5 milliunits of glucose oxidase (Sigma) in the presence of 25 mm glucose in complete growth medium. In some experiments 10 mm N-acetylcysteine (Sigma) was added to the culture medium 2 h before DOX treatment. When appropriate, after exposure to anthracyclines or glucose oxidase, the cells were washed and treated for 16 h with increasing concentrations of ferric ammonium citrate in complete medium. At the end of the various treatments, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and homogenized as described below. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The cells were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P 40 (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After the addition of dithiothreitol to make a 1 mm final concentration, the lysate was centrifuged at 16.000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were taken for ELISA or immunoblot analysis and the determination of IRP activity. RNA-Protein Gel Retardation Assay—The probe for the band-shift assay was transcribed from the linearized pSPT-fer plasmid containing the iron-responsive elements of the human ferritin H chain (8Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Google Scholar) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP in a commercially available kit (Promega Corp., Milan, Italy). Equal amounts of protein (2 μg, as determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit) from the cell lysates were incubated with a molar excess of an iron-responsive elements probe and sequentially treated with RNase T1 and heparin as previously described (9Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Google Scholar). After separation on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the RNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by means of direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager (Packard Instruments Co.). Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of the cytosolic extracts containing equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed in acrylamide-SDS gels and electroblotted to Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After assessing the transfer by means of Ponceau S staining, the membranes were saturated in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 30 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 20% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 80 and incubated with rabbit antiserum to IRP-2 (raised against a conserved sequence in the degradation domain of IRP2, 1:100 dilution), catalase (Sigma,1:5,000 dilution), and β-actin (Sigma, 1:10,000 dilution) to control equal protein loading. To detect ferritin, the proteins were separated on 7.5% native polyacrylamide gels, and the blots were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant mouse H ferritin subunit (10Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Levi S. Rovida E. Magni F. Albertini A. Arosio P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 212-218Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies and extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 80, the proteins were detected by means of chemiluminescence using an immunodetection kit (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proteins were quantified by means of densitometric scanning of the blots, making sure that all of the signals were in the linear range. All of the data were calculated by comparing the intensity of the bands within the same film exposure. The values were calculated after correction for the amount of β-actin. Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated as previously described (11Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Casalgrandi G. Rigo G. Ferrari A. Perini M. Ventura E. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 802-809Google Scholar), and equal amounts of RNA were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. To confirm that each lane contained equal amounts of total RNA, the ribosomal RNA content in each lane was estimated in ethidium bromide-stained gels by means of laser densitometry. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Biosciences) that were hybridized with the 32P-labeled DNA probes rat ferritin H and L subunit cDNAs (12Murray M.T. White K. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7438-7442Google Scholar, 13Leibold E.A. Aziz N. Brown A.J. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4327-4334Google Scholar) and human aldose reductase cDNA (14Barisani D. Meneveri R. Ginelli E. Cassani C. Conte D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 208-212Google Scholar). Quantitative determination was obtained by means of direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager (Packard Instruments Co.), and the values were calculated after normalization to the amount of ribosomal RNA. Determination of Ferritin Subunit Content—Ferritin concentrations were determined in cell lysates by means of ELISA using polyclonal antibodies raised against mouse recombinant H and L ferritin subunits, and calibrated using the corresponding recombinant homopolymers (10Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Levi S. Rovida E. Magni F. Albertini A. Arosio P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 212-218Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibodies and the absence of cross-reactivity have been previously described (10Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Levi S. Rovida E. Magni F. Albertini A. Arosio P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 212-218Google Scholar). The microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibody specific for mouse H or L ferritin. Soluble tissue homogenates or standard ferritins were diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin and added to the plates. The presence of ferritin was revealed by means of incubation with the same antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Peroxidase activity was developed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). Measurement of Oxidative Stress—ROS production in untreated or anthracycline-treated cells was monitored using the DCFH-diacetate fluorescent probe (Sigma), a cell-permeable indicator of ROS (15Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Kulisz A. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11619-11624Google Scholar). DCFH-diacetate is activated by cellular esterases, and then the DCFH is converted by H2O2 and peroxidases to the dichlorofluorescein fluorescent derivate. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were loaded with DCFH-diacetate (20 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C, thoroughly washed, trypsinized, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence intensity was measured by means of FACScan flow cytometry on the FLH-1 channel. MTT Assay—H9c2 cells were seeded in quadruplicate in 24-well plates and then left untreated or treated with DOX or DOX analogues for 24 h. They were subsequently exposed to increasing amounts of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) (Sigma) for 16 h. At the end of the treatments cell viability was measured using thiazolyl blue (MTT, Sigma) as an indicator of mitochondrial function (16Vistica D.T. Skehan P. Scudiero D. Monks A. Pittman A. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2515-2520Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) were added to each well with 450 μl of medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 2–3 h, formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 500 μl of the MTT solubilization solution and thorough pipetting up and down. Absorbance was read at 570 nm, and the background absorbance at 690 nm was subtracted. Analysis of 55Fe-labeled Ferritin—H9c2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of anthracyclines for 24 h at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's-modified minimum Eagle's medium plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin added with 2 μCi/ml [55Fe] ferric iron citrate (≅2 μm iron), which was prepared by mixing 55FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with citric acid in a 1:2 molar ratio. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in the same lysis buffer as that used for the immunoblot analysis (see above). An aliquot was taken for protein determination, and another was mixed with Ultima Gold (Packard Instrument Co.) to measure the amount of cellular 55Fe by means of liquid scintillation counting. To evaluate 55Fe incorporation into ferritin, the lysates were centrifuged, and equal amounts of proteins from the supernatants were analyzed by means of the non-denaturing PAGE system used for the immunoblotting followed by Coomassie Blue staining (to assess equal protein loading), autoradiography, and InstantImager counting. The ferritin band was identified by comigration with recombinant mouse H ferritin DOX Induces Ferritin Expression—We measured ferritin levels in H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed for 24 h to 5–10 μm DOX, concentrations reproducing the plasma peak reached by standard infusions in patients (17Gianni L. Vigano L. Locatelli A. Capri G. Giani A. Tarenzi E. Bonadonna G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 1906-1915Google Scholar). Western blot analyses performed using an antibody against the H subunit showed that DOX increased the amount of ferritin (Fig. 1A). The antibodies against the murine ferritin subunits were also used in an ELISA to quantify the increase in ferritin and ascertain whether DOX enhanced the levels of the H and/or L subunits. Fig. 1B shows that both ferritin subunits were increased by DOX, although there was a preferential induction (2.5–3-fold) of the H chain. The increase in the H subunits in the cells treated with 10 μm DOX was similar to that determined in cells exposed to iron, but the latter showed more evident accumulation of the L subunit. Mechanisms of Ferritin Induction—Fig. 2A shows that the IRP-1 activity measured using a band-shift assay increased in cells treated with 5 μm DOX. This result is consistent with the metabolization of DOX to DOXol and the ability of the latter to induce the complete disassembly of the Fe-S clusters associated with cytoplasmic aconitase, thus making the enzyme switch to IRP-1 (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). However, at 10 μm DOX, IRP-1 activity returned to control levels (Fig. 2A), and the same was also observed when the samples were treated with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol just before the band-shift assay (not shown). This finding was consistent with the fact that DOXol oxidized back to DOX, which then damaged IRP-1 by forming a complex with iron released from the cluster (4Minotti G. Recalcati S. Mordente A. Liberi G. Calafiore A.M. Mancuso C. Preziosi P. Cairo G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 541-552Google Scholar). As the redox activity of DOX-Fe complexes increased with the DOX:Fe ratio (18Minotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 277: 268-276Google Scholar), raising DOX from 5 to 10 μm favored the formation of DOX-Fe complexes that redox-coupled with ROS and caused the irreversible oxidation of IRP-1 into a null protein (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). In addition to altering IRP-1 activity, DOX diminished the binding activity and immunodetectable levels of IRP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. At 5 μm DOX, IRP-2 binding activity decreased by ∼70% (Fig. 2A), which was consistent with the 60% decrease in immunodetectable protein (Fig. 2B). The DOX-induced reductions in IRP-2 activity and levels were, therefore, consistent with the concentration-dependent increase in ferritin levels. This was less evident in the case of IRP-1, whose activation or inactivation at 5 or 10 μm DOX should have been accompanied by, respectively, lower or higher ferritin levels. It, therefore, seems that IRP-2, but not IRP-1, is involved in modulating ferritin levels after DOX treatment. However, Fig. 2C shows that DOX also increased the steady-state levels of mRNAs for the ferritin H and L subunits, with a preferential (3-fold) induction of H subunit mRNA. This suggests that ferritin levels increased not only because of translational activation linked to IRP-2 down-regulation but also because DOX increases net ferritin mRNA levels. ROS Formation in DOX-treated Cells—Because an increase in the transcription of the H ferritin subunit gene has been demonstrated under conditions of oxidative stress in a variety of experimental systems (7Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Google Scholar), we investigated whether ROS were involved in mediating ferritin induction in H9c2 cells exposed to DOX. We first assessed whether DOX causes oxidative stress in H9c2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with 5 and 10 μm DOX led to increases of, respectively, 2.2- and 3.1-fold in the levels of mRNA for aldose reductase, a well known stress-responsive gene (19Spycher S.E. Tabataba-Vakili S. O'Donnell V.B. Palomba L. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 181-188Google Scholar). Once again, the effect was similar to that observed when treating cells with iron, a specific inducer of aldose reductase (14Barisani D. Meneveri R. Ginelli E. Cassani C. Conte D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 208-212Google Scholar). Treatment with 5 and 10 μm DOX also increased the immunodetectable levels of catalase, another well known stress-responsive gene (20Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Radice L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 273-278Google Scholar), by respectively, 1.5 and 2.5 times (Fig. 3B). Measurements of the oxidation of DCFH (a widely used marker of intracellular ROS formation) showed that ROS production increased 2.5–3 times in the DOX-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data indicate that DOX-dependent ferritin induction occurs under conditions of increased ROS production. To investigate the role of oxidative stress in ferritin induction, we tested whether N-acetylcysteine (a known ROS scavenger) prevented ferritin accumulation. Fig. 3C shows that the oxidation of DCFH is inhibited in H9c2 cells treated with N-acetylcysteine before the addition of DOX. Under these conditions, DOX did not increase ferritin levels, a finding that is consistent with the role of ROS in this setting (Fig. 3D). ROS-mediated Ferritin Accumulation Protects against Iron Toxicity—The fact that ferritin has a cytoprotective effect in a number of experimental models (7Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether pre-exposure to DOX could protect H9c2 cells against the damage caused by an iron load. MTT assays showed that 16 h of iron loading caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of viable H9c2 cells, but pretreatment with DOX significantly improved the resistance of cells to iron-induced cell death (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the increased ferritin levels induced by DOX as a result of ROS-dependent gene activation (and perhaps IRP-2 down-regulation) protect against iron toxicity. To assess the role of ROS further while re-addressing the role of secondary alcohol metabolites reactive to aconitase/IRP-1, we treated the H9c2 cells with anthracycline analogues characterized by their capacity to induce the formation of ROS or secondary alcohol metabolites to a different extent in comparison with DOX. The role of ROS was probed using 5-i-DNR, an analogue that contains the side-chain carbonyl group required for alcohol metabolite formation but is less than 20% as effective as DOX in generating ROS because of the presence of an imino group in place of the quinone (Fig. 5). The role of secondary alcohol metabolites was probed using mitoxantrone (Mitox), an analogue that contains the quinone but lacks a carbonyl group in its side chain (Fig. 5). The experiments were performed bearing in mind that the generation of ROS and alcohol metabolites depended not only on the intrinsic biochemical behavior of these molecules but also on the extent to which they entered the cardiomyocytes. On the basis of the results of our previous pharmacokinetic studies (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar), 5-i-DNR and Mitox were used at concentrations of, respectively, 20 and 2.5 μm, which lead to the same level of uptake in cardiomyocytes as 5 μm DOX (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, measurements of DCFH oxidation confirmed that 5-i-DNR was unable to form ROS, which were formed by Mitox but apparently to a lesser extent than by DOX (Fig. 6A), probably because Mitox is an excellent reducing substrate for H2O2-activated peroxidases (21Reszka K.J. Matuszak Z. Chignell C.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1325-1330Google Scholar). It is quite possible that Mitox generated greater amounts of ROS than those detected by us, but its ability to react with peroxidases eventually diminished the yields of ROS, which were measured on the basis of DCHF oxidation by the same peroxidases. Having obtained information on ROS formation, we next determined whether 5-i-DNR and Mitox increased ferritin content and protected cells from iron toxicity. ELISA experiments showed that Mitox increases cell levels of ferritin (particularly the H subunit) to an extent that is similar to the increase induced by 5 μm DOX, a finding that is consistent with its ability to reach the same cell levels as DOX and to generate ROS (Fig. 6B). On the contrary, 5-i-DNR had essentially no effect on ferritin levels, which is consistent with its ineffectiveness in producing ROS. The data concerning ROS formation and ferritin levels were mirrored by those relating to iron-mediated toxicity. Fig. 6C shows that 5-i-DNR (which did not form ROS or increase ferritin levels) did not protect cardiomyocytes against the damage induced by subsequent exposure to an iron load, whereas the cells pretreated with Mitox could withstand iron toxicity in a manner that was not significantly different from that of DOX (p = 0.180), which is in line with the fact that Mitox generates ROS and increases ferritin levels. Finally, Mitox had essentially the same effects as DOX despite its inability to form a secondary alcohol metabolite, thus confirming that the changes in IRP-1 activity induced by secondary alcohol metabolites are of little importance in mediating ferritin up-regulation and the consequent protection against iron toxicity. To obtain further evidence that DOX-dependent ferritin induction was mediated by ROS and protected the cells from toxic iron, cardiomyocytes were exposed to a source of ROS other than DOX before undergoing iron treatment. We used the glucose/glucose oxidase reaction, which generates a constant flux of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 7, A–C, glucose/glucose oxidase led to the robust oxidation of DCFH, increased the levels of the L and (especially) H ferritin subunits, and protected the cardiomyocytes against the damage induced by a subsequent iron exposure. Effect of DOX on Intracellular Iron Distribution—To obtain more direct correlations between ferritin induction and cytoprotection, we examined the fate of the radioactive iron taken up by H9c2 cells during the course of exposure to a trace amount of 55Fe in the presence or absence of DOX. Autoradiography of non-denaturing gels of soluble cell homogenates showed that ferritin accounted for the vast majority of the 55Fe-labeled proteins (Fig. 8). Ferritin-associated radioactivity increased if the cells were also treated with DOX or Mitox but was not significantly enhanced by 5-i-DNR. In comparison with the cells exposed to 55Fe alone, those exposed to 55Fe plus DOX or the other drugs did not show any significant increase in the total cell content of 55Fe determined by means of the liquid scintillation counting of aliquots of cell homogenates (not shown). This indicates that the different abilities of DOX, Mitox, and 5-i-DNR to increase the incorporation of 55Fe into ferritin was not mediated by enhanced cellular iron uptake and/or reduced iron release but reflected the different extents to which the drugs up-regulate ferritin levels. The cardiac toxicity of DOX has been attributed to its ability to generate ROS and promote iron-catalyzed oxidative damage. The results of the present study show that DOX produces ROS in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, as indicated by the increased levels of stress-responsive genes such as aldose reductase and catalase and by direct measurements of DCFH oxidation (Fig. 3). However, our results also show that DOX up-regulates ferritin levels in cardiomyocytes and that this offers excellent protection against the toxicity induced by subsequent iron exposure. The ferritin-inducing effect of DOX consisted of a preferential increase in the H subunits (Fig. 1), a finding that is consistent with those of previous studies showing that H ferritin increases under conditions of ROS generation (9Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Google Scholar, 22Tacchini L. Recalcati S. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 946-953Google Scholar, 23Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Google Scholar). The role of ROS in inducing the synthesis of H ferritin and that of the H subunits in protecting against iron toxicity was demonstrated by various lines of evidence. First, ferritin synthesis was blocked by N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger (Fig. 3). Second, neither H ferritin synthesis nor cytoprotection against iron was observed when DOX was replaced by 5-i-DNR, an analogue lacking ROS-forming activity, whereas both were seen when DOX was replaced by Mitox, an analogue that is still capable of producing ROS (Fig. 6). Third, DOX-induced cytoprotection did not correlate with any substantial change in cellular iron uptake or release but did correlate with the facilitated sequestration of iron inside ferritin (Fig. 8). Finally, anthracycline treatment led to a concomitant increase in L-type subunits, but this was small in comparison with the increase in H-type subunits and did not correlate with the ability of the analogue to provide protection against iron; in fact, the increase in L-type subunits was similar with all three drugs (Fig. 6). We also found that 2.5 μm Mitox and 5 μm DOX are comparably taken up by cardiomyocytes and consistently induce similar increases in H ferritin, although ROS generation seemed to be less with Mitox. This last finding may introduce a caveat if ROS is involved in mediating the anthracycline-induced increase in ferritin anthracyclines. As mentioned above, this inconsistency may reflect the interference of Mitox with the DCFH assay for ROS, thus diminishing the apparent yield of detectable ROS. Another possibility is that the induction of H ferritin may require a threshold level of ROS formation above which ferritin synthesis continues regardless of any additional formation. Finally, it is possible that many genes may be activated by DOX and contribute to mediating protection against iron. The protective efficacy of anthracycline pretreatment against subsequent iron loading is reminiscent of the preconditioning seen with H2O2, a process in which exogenous H2O2 or hypoxia-induced mitochondrial release of H2O2 protects cells against subsequent damage induced by, for example, ischemia-reperfusion (24Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Shao Z. Li C. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18092-18098Google Scholar, 25da Silva M.M. Sartori A. Belisle E. Kowaltowski A.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 285: 154-162Google Scholar). We found that glucose oxidase (a source of H2O2) can replace DOX in increasing ferritin levels and protecting against iron (Fig. 7), finding that is important in two respects; (i) it confirms that the effects of DOX are mediated by ROS, and (ii) it indicates similarities between the protection induced by DOX and that induced by H2O2 preconditioning. We investigated whether ferritin synthesis was enhanced by DOX as a result of changes in IRP-1 or IRP-2 activities. Our data support the possible role of ROS-dependent IRP-2 degradation in relieving a translational block of ferritin synthesis, as shown by the comparisons of the concentration-dependent patterns of ROS formation, IRP-2 degradation, and the increase in ferritin after treatment with 5 and 10 μm DOX as well as the comparisons of the effects of DOX, Mitox, and 5-i-DNR. On the contrary, neither the DOX/analogue comparisons nor the bell-shaped concentration-dependent pattern of IRP-1 activation or inactivation by 5 or 10 μm DOX seem to correlate with the pattern of enhanced ferritin synthesis (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 6). However, we acknowledge that it is important to understand how ferritin synthesis increased after treatment with 5 μm DOX, when the degradation of IRP-2 was counteracted by the activation of IRP-1. In a previous study (26Recalcati S. Taramelli D. Conte D. Cairo G. Blood. 1998; 91: 1059-1066Google Scholar), we found that cytokine-treated macrophages underwent a similarly converse up-regulation of IRP-1 and down-regulation of IRP-2, whereas the level of ferritin synthesis increased as if the degradation of IRP-2 somehow served the prevailing mechanisms regulating it. All of these findings may be reconciled by the fact that the iron-responsive elements of ferritin mRNA are preferentially bound by IRP-2 (27Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E.A. Walden W.E. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Google Scholar). In any case, the ability of anthracyclines to protect against iron (DOX = Mitox >> 5-i-DNR) correlates with ROS formation, IRP-2 degradation and increased ferritin synthesis (5Minotti G. Ronchi R. Salvatorelli E. Menna P. Cairo G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8422-8428Google Scholar). IRP-2 degradation is, therefore, a possible determinant of increased ferritin synthesis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, but we also found that DOX considerably increased steady-state ferritin mRNA levels. Although we did not directly demonstrate increased ferritin transcription, we suggest that such a remarkable increase reflects an action at transcriptional level mediated by the direct targeting of the 5′ sequences that are conserved in the regulatory regions of H and L ferritin genes as well as many other anti-oxidant response genes (23Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation, therefore, seems to be a prevalent mechanism of anthracycline-induced ferritin synthesis, which is possibly further accelerated as a result of IRP-2 degradation relieving a translational block. The transcriptional activation of ferritin expression and the consequent up-regulation of steady-state mRNA levels would also be sufficient to overcome a translational block possibly caused by any transient activation of IRP-1. We are currently identifying and characterizing ROS-sensitive ferritin regulatory sequences. Other investigators have obtained similar evidence supporting the preferential accumulation of iron in ferritin after the exposure of cancer or cardiac cells to DOX; however, increased ferritin iron sequestration occurred in the absence of ferritin induction, and the overall mechanism of the anthracycline/iron/ferritin interactions remained uncertain, partially because the anthracycline concentrations were often too high to be of pathophysiological relevance (e.g. 20 μm) (28Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 888-900Google Scholar). In our study we found that anthracycline-derived ROS were related to ferritin induction and that increased ferritin levels were related to the ability of cardiac cells to withstand iron toxicity. Our results, therefore, offer the basis for a reappraisal of the role of ROS and iron in the cardiac damage induced by anthracyclines and suggest that there may be conditions under which anthracycline-derived ROS do not exacerbate iron toxicity but actually improve cell defenses against iron. This may be the case when chemotherapy increases the plasma levels of non-transferrin-bound iron, an effect that is due to the suppression of erythropoietic activity or the leakage of iron from necrotic tumoral foci (29Bradley S.J. Gosriwitana I. Srichairatanakool S. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 337-343Google Scholar, 30Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Mufti G. Bomford A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 202-204Google Scholar). This iron pool may well contribute to inducing cardiotoxicity if it enters cardiomyocytes and reacts with ROS, but our results suggest that one such mechanism of toxicity may be prevented by the sequestration of iron in the ferritin shells formed by the prior redox activation of anthracyclines. This concept is supported by the fact that plasma anthracycline levels peak within min of drug administration (17Gianni L. Vigano L. Locatelli A. Capri G. Giani A. Tarenzi E. Bonadonna G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 1906-1915Google Scholar), whereas it takes days before the peak plasma levels of non-transferrin-bound iron are reached (29Bradley S.J. Gosriwitana I. Srichairatanakool S. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 337-343Google Scholar). There is, therefore, sufficient time for anthracylines to induce ferritin synthesis and prevent the toxicity induced by subsequent exposure of the heart to iron, a pathological condition that we have mimicked by treating isolated cardiomyocytes with anthracyclines before an iron load. In conclusion, we have characterized a paradoxical “antioxidant” mode of action of anthracyclines, which is mediated by ferritin synthesis and leads to a long-lasting protection that persists after removal of DOX from the medium or after the decay or clearance of the drugs from biological fluids or tissues. These results raise some doubts against the widely accepted concept of the oxidative nature of cardiotoxicity but support the idea that antioxidants do not always protect laboratory animals against cardiotoxicity or mitigate or delay cardiotoxicity in patients. It clearly remains to be established what the precise mechanism of cardiotoxicity is and how it may be prevented or mitigated by the use of iron chelators such as dexrazoxane (31Myers C. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 10-14Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that iron and ROS become toxic as a result of reactions that extend beyond canonical oxidative damage and, among other mechanisms, may involve alterations in the metabolic use of iron (1Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Google Scholar) or its recruitment in pro-apoptotic signals that have not yet been characterized (32Kalyanaraman B. Joseph J. Kalivendi S. Wang S.

In the absence of lipid, however, apoE does not bind the receptor. Whereas the x-ray structure of lipid-free apoE3 N-terminal (NT) domain is known, the structural organization of its lipid-associated, receptor-active conformation is poorly understood.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a key regulator of plasma cholesterol homeostasis.

Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar) are a critical step for the cellular uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins. Transgenic mice overexpressing apoE manifest decreased plasma cholesterol levels on chow diet and a marked resistance to hypercholesterolemia on a high cholesterol/fat diet (4Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 2084-2091Google Scholar). On the other hand, apoE-deficient subjects display features of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (5Schaefer E.J. Gregg R.E. Ghiselli G. Forte T.M. Ordovas J.M. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1206-1219Google Scholar) and apoE null mice exhibit massive accumulation of remnant lipoproteins (6Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar), documenting the direct relevance of apoE in lipoprotein metabolism. However, structural features of lipid-associated apoE responsible for its receptor interaction properties are not understood at the molecular level.ApoE comprises two independently folded structural and functional domains that are linked by a protease-sensitive loop segment. The globular 22 kDa N-terminal (NT) domain houses the LDLR recognition site, whereas the 10 kDa C-terminal (CT) domain bears high affinity lipoprotein-binding and self-association sites (7Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Google Scholar, 8Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Google Scholar). The NT domain is composed of four elongated amphipathic α-helices organized as an up-and-down helix bundle in the absence of lipid (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Google Scholar, 10Segelke B.W. Forstner M. Knapp M. Trakhanov S.D. Parkin S. Newhouse Y.M. Bellamy H.D. Weisgraber K.H. Rupp B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 886-897Google Scholar). Helix 4 of the NT domain (residues 131-164) harbors key residues required for interaction with lipoprotein receptors (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). However, lipid association is a requirement for apoE (full-length or NT domain) to display receptor recognition capability, with apoE bound to model lipid particles displaying receptor binding ability comparable with that of native apoE-containing lipoproteins (11Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Google Scholar). Upon interaction with lipid it has been proposed that the NT domain helix bundle “opens” to expose the hydrophobic faces of its amphipathic helices to potential lipid surface binding sites, thereby achieving a receptor-active conformation (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar, 12Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Google Scholar). Monolayer surface balance studies at the air/water interface provide evidence that the NT domain occupies a larger surface area than can be accounted for by its globular 4-helix bundle conformation (13Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis. III. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 175-181Google Scholar), consistent with adoption of an “open” conformation. Subsequent fluorescence energy transfer analysis revealed that helical segments in the NT domain realign as a function of the transition from lipid-free helix bundle to lipid-bound state (12Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 93-99Google Scholar, 14Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Google Scholar). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopic studies (15Raussens V. Fisher C.A. Goormaghtigh E. Ryan R.O. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25825-25830Google Scholar) indicate that apoE-NT α-helices orient perpendicular to phospholipid (PL) acyl chains in discoidal complexes, although another report indicates a parallel orientation (16De Pauw M. Vanloo B. Weisgraber K. Rosseneu M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10953-10966Google Scholar). Recent NMR spectroscopy studies provided evidence for increased solvent exposure of positively charged amino acid side chains in the receptor-binding region upon interaction of the NT domain with lipid (17Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34459-34464Google Scholar).With regard to the CT domain, the precise molecular features responsible for high affinity lipid binding are not known, although it is believed that CT domain interaction with lipids is mediated by putative amphipathic α-helices (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). Using deletion mutagenesis, Westerlund and Weisgraber (18Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Google Scholar) demonstrated that residues 267-299 contribute to the lipoprotein binding properties of apoE. In other studies, Dong et al. (19Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Google Scholar) reported that residues 260-272 are important for complete lipoprotein association.To address questions relating to the alignment and orientation of the receptor-binding region of the NT domain and lipid-binding sites in the CT domain of lipid-associated apoE, we examined the relative ability of spatially defined nitroxide-labeled PL to quench the fluorescence of a panel of unique single Trp apoE3 variants in reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL). It was determined that the engineered Trp residues in helix 4 align uniformly, close to the center of the PL bilayer, thereby presenting the receptor-binding site as a positively charged, curved helical segment analogous to that displayed on spherical lipoprotein particles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and the nitroxide spin probes 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(X-DOXYL)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (where X = 5, 7, 10, 12, or 16) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The single Trp synthetic peptides K2WL9AL9K2A and K2GL9WL9K2A were a generous gift of Dr. Erwin London at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Human thrombin was obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. All other reagents were analytical grade.Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Single Trp mutants were introduced in a Trp null apoE3-NT (residues 1-183) variant by site directed-mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli as described (14Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Google Scholar, 20Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Google Scholar). Full-length apoE3 bearing single Trp residues at position 257 or 264 were constructed using the QuikChange® mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a strategy similar to that described elsewhere (14Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and double-stranded DNA sequencing in both directions. Single Trp-containing apoE3 variants were expressed and purified as thioredoxin fusion proteins in E. coli upon subcloning into a pET32a(+) vector (17Lund-Katz S. Zaiou M. Wehrli S. Dhanasekaran P. Baldwin F. Weisgraber K.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34459-34464Google Scholar, 21Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 224-230Google Scholar) following manipulations to optimize codon usage for bacterial expression (22Vogel T. Weisgraber K.H. Zeevi M.I. Ben Artzi H. Levanon A.Z. Rall Jr., S.C. Innerarity T.L. Hui D.Y. Taylor J.M. Kanner D. Yavin Z. Amit B. Aviv H. Gorecki M. Mahely R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8696-8700Google Scholar). Intact apoE preparations without the GST fusion protein were at least 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE.Preparation and Characterization of rHDL—ApoE3 variants (2-3 mg/ml) were dissolved in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol/mg of protein. The solutions were dialyzed against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. rHDL were prepared as described previously (23Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Google Scholar) using POPC, a specified apoE3 variant, a given DOXYL-PL, and sodium cholate, except that the lipids were subjected to bath sonication for 30 min prior to addition of sodium cholate. The DOXYL moieties were located at positions C-5, C-7, C-10, C-12, or C-16 along the stearoyl chain of POPC at the sn-2 position. Initial PL:DOXYL-PL:apoE molar ratios were 49:9:1. For each apoE3 variant, particles were reconstituted with and without DOXYL-PL to characterize the Trp fluorescence contribution in the presence and the absence of quencher, respectively. In rHDL lacking DOXYL-PL, the corresponding PL mass was replaced by POPC to maintain uniformity in particle lipid to protein ratio. The rHDL were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (24Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Google Scholar) to remove unbound protein and/or vesicular structures. Particle hydrodynamic properties were assessed by gradient native polyacrylamide electrophoresis and/or Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (24Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Google Scholar).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Photon Technology International Quantamaster spectrometer in photon counting mode. For each variant, an aliquot of the rHDL samples, with or without quenchers, was diluted in buffer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 303 to 375 nm at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm in order to minimize the contribution of tyrosine fluorescence in apoE. Emission and excitation band-passes were 3.0 nm. Fluorescence analysis was carried out at 25 °C in a semi-microquartz cuvette. The spectra were corrected for background fluorescence of buffer alone. The spectra were not corrected for the spectral characteristics of the emission and excitation monochromators.Trp Depth Calculations—The parallax method for determining the depth of penetration of a fluorophore in a lipid bilayer was derived by Chattopadhyay and London (25Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Google Scholar) from conventional relationships of static quenchers to randomly distributed fluorophores. The differences in fluorescence intensities of the fluorophore in the presence of known concentrations of nitroxide quencher groups at known locations in a PL acyl chain are used to calculate the depth of the fluorophore relative to the quenchers (see Ref. 23Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of the method theory). The distance of the Trp from the center of the bilayer (Zcf) is given by Zcf=Lcs+[-ln(Fs/Fd)/πC-Lds2]/2Lds(Eq. 1) where Fs is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the shallow quencher, Fd is the same for the deep quencher, Lcs is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the shallow quencher, Lds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers, and C is the concentration of the quencher molecules per Å2. Equation 1 is valid when nitroxide groups that are shallow in the membrane quench the Trp residue. When the Trp is buried deep within the membrane, however, it is subjected to quenching from groups in the opposite leaflet the lipid bilayer. For this situation, a second relationship is required to account for trans-bilayer quenching, Zcf=Lcd-[ln((Fs/Fo)2/(Fd/Fo))/πC)-2Lds2+4Lcd2)/4(Lds+Lcd)](Eq. 2) where F0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher, Lcd is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the deep quencher, and Lds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers. Equation 2 was used in this study whenever a Trp residue was determined to be <6 Å from the center of the membrane by Equation 1.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected on a Jasco J600 or J720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlling device and interfaced with a computer. The molar ellipticity ([θ]) in degrees cm2 dmol-1 at 222 or 208 nm was calculated from the equation [θ] = (MRW·θ)/(10d·c), where MRW is the mean residue weight of the apoE CT domain calculated to be 114.31, θ is the measured ellipticity in degrees at 222 or 208 nm, d is the cuvette path length in cm, and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. The α-helical content of each rHDL preparation was derived from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm by established procedures (26Lund-Katz S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23008-23015Google Scholar, 27Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Google Scholar). In other analyses, lipid-free apoE3 was incubated overnight in the absence or in the presence of trifluoroethanol (50% v/v) prior to CD analysis. In addition, spectra of apoE3-DMPC complexes were obtained (28Narayanaswami V. Szeto S.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37853-37860Google Scholar).Thrombin Digestion—The effect of lipid association on accessibility to thrombin digestion was examined by treating 20 μg of apoE3 in a lipid-free or DMPC-bound state (14Fisher C.A. Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33601-33606Google Scholar) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 with 1 milliunit of thrombin for 3 h at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed on a 4-20% acrylamide gradient by SDS-PAGE with untreated lipid-free or -bound apoE3 as control.Analytical Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure (29Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) or by A280 measurements using an extinction coefficient of 1.34 for 1 mg of full-length apoE3 protein/ml or 1.32 for 1 mg of apoE3 NT domain protein/ml. PL content was determined by phosphorus analysis (30Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Google Scholar).RESULTSExperimental Strategy—Receptor binding analyses of genetically engineered and naturally occurring variants of apoE have demonstrated that residues in the region of residues 134-150 of apoE3 are indispensable for receptor binding activity (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Google Scholar). High resolution structural information on lipid-free human apoE3-(1-191) reveals that helix 4 spans residues 131-164 (9Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Google Scholar), thereby encompassing the entire receptor-binding element. Using a variety of biophysical approaches, it has been shown that the NT domain helix bundle undergoes a conformational change upon interaction with lipid (see Ref. 31Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Google Scholar for a review). Whereas the precise structural alteration that accompanies lipid association of the NT domain is not known, this conformational adaptation confers the protein with LDLR recognition properties (32Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Google Scholar). Because the lipid-bound apoE3-NT mimics full-length apoE3 in terms of receptor binding activity, we used this domain in studies designed to characterize the orientation and positioning of helix 4 in lipid-associated apoE3-NT. Isolated recombinant apoE3-NT domain was reconstituted with PL to generate a homogeneous population of discoidal lipid particles that are known to be LDLR-active (32Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Google Scholar). To evaluate the disposition of the receptor-interaction site with respect to the lipid surface, a series of apoE3-NT domain variants possessing a single Trp residue positioned along the length of helix 4 (at positions 141, 148, 155, or 162; see Fig. 1) were subjected to fluorescence spectroscopy. By examining the relative ability of a series of DOXYL-PL (with the nitroxide moiety located at different positions along the fatty acyl chain) to quench apoE3-NT Trp fluorescence, the relative position of the Trp probes with respect to PL bilayer can be deduced. For example, if helix 4 retains its general organization and aligns with its helical axis parallel to the PL acyl chains, large differences in nitroxide quenching behavior would be anticipated for the different single Trp variants positioned at every second turn of the helix. On the other hand, if helix 4 aligns perpendicular to the PL acyl chains, the extent of nitroxide quenching will be similar for each of the single Trp variants.Characterization of apoE3 Variant Lipid Particles—Reconstituted lipid particles composed of POPC, a given DOXYL-PL, and a unique single Trp apoE3 variant, were found to be of uniform size as judged by native gradient PAGE analysis. In each case the particles displayed an average diameter of 115 ± 10 Å, consistent with findings reported for wild type apoE3-NT domain (20Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Google Scholar). No differences were observed in the physical characteristics of complexes prepared with POPC alone versus POPC plus DOXYL-PL. A similar lack of a structural perturbation from the DOXYL-PL was previously noted for particles made with apoA-I (23Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Google Scholar, 33Panagotopulos S.E. Horace E.M. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the apoE3 variants employed in this study retained their lipid binding ability and that incorporation of DOXYL-PL in the reconstituted particles did not significantly alter their size or hydrodynamic properties. Furthermore, far UV circular dichroism analysis of a subset of the disc particles employed in this study consistently yielded 70-75% α-helix content.Trp Fluorescence Studies—Prior to analysis of the Trp quenching patterns in rHDL containing the different single Trp apoE3 variants, control experiments were performed to validate the quenching protocol and to ensure that the nitroxide moieties quench at the expected depth under the conditions employed to reconstitute apoE3 into lipid particles. Two hydrophobic α-helical peptides that possess a single Trp residue at different points along the length of the helix were employed. Ren et al. (34Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that these peptides traverse the membrane of small unilamellar vesicles and orient parallel to the acyl chains. Peptide 1 (K2WL9AL9K2A) contains a membrane-spanning sequence composed primarily of repeating leucines flanked by pairs of lysine residues. The Trp in peptide 1 is located near one end of the helix. Peptide 2 (K2GL9WL9K2A) is similar in design but contains a Trp at the center of the peptide sequence. Hence, when inserted into a membrane the Trp in peptide 1 is expected to locate close to the polar/apolar interface, as depicted in Fig. 2A, whereas peptide 2 is expected to be located near the center of the bilayer. Reconstitution of peptides 1 and 2 into vesicles containing specific DOXYL-PL and fluorescence analysis revealed that the Trp in K2WL9AL9K2A was maximally quenched when the DOXYL moiety was located at position C-5, 12 Å from the bilayer center (Fig. 2B). The extent of quenching observed decreased as the DOXYL moiety was positioned further down the acyl chain. Peptide 2 exhibited the opposite quenching pattern, wherein Trp fluorescence was minimally quenched when the DOXYL moiety was located at C-5 and was maximally quenched by C-16 DOXYL-PL (2 Å from the bilayer center). The calculated depths of these Trp residues were 15.4 ± 2.2 Å for peptide 1 and 3.0 ± 2.6 Å from the bilayer center for peptide 2.Fig. 2Nitroxide lipid quenching of single Trp-containing, transmembrane peptides in small unilamellar vesicles. A, schematic representation of the positioning of PL DOXYL moieties (black circles) with respect to a model transmembrane helix. The situation for both the shallowest (C-5, left) and deepest (C-12, right) DOXYL moieties are shown. The asterisk indicates the shallow Trp in peptide 1 (K2WL9AL9K2A). B, small unilamellar vesicles containing peptide 1 (K2WL9AL9K2A (filled circles)) or peptide 2 (K2GL9WL9K2A (open circles)) and X-DOXYL-PL (where X = carbon position 2, 6, 8, 10, or 12 on the fatty acyl chain) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molar ratio of POPC:X-DOXYL-PL:peptide was 65:12:1. Emission spectra were recorded between 303 and 375 nm (excitation wavelength of 295 nm), and F/F0 was plotted as a function of the calculated distance of the various DOXYL groups on the fatty acyl chains from the center of the bilayer (34Ren J. Lew S. Wang Z. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ApoE3 NT rHDL—The wavelength of maximal fluorescence emission intensity (λmax) for each single Trp apoE3 variant (excitation 295 nm) was determined in the absence of nitroxide labeled PL (Table I). In each case reconstitution of the single Trp variant apoE3 NT variant with POPC resulted in a λmax value of ∼330-332 nm. Considering that solvent-exposed Trp residues exhibit λmax values in the range of 350 nm, this result indicates that these Trp residues are not exposed to the aqueous environment and, therefore, are well suited for lipid-based quenching studies. We then determined the effect of specific DOXYL-PL on the fluorescence intensity of lipid associated single Trp apoE3-NT variants. Data are shown as a plot of F/F0 (where F and F0 represent fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of quencher, respectively) versus DOXYL moiety distance from the PL bilayer center. In the case of Trp-141 apoE3-NT, the DOXYL-PL with the quencher located at position C-5 of the fatty acyl chain (12 Å from bilayer center), was the least effective (Fig. 3, top panel). As the DOXYL moiety was positioned further along the fatty acyl chain (i.e. deeper into the membrane), Trp-141 fluorescence was increasingly quenched, with maximal quenching observed with quencher located at the C-12 position and decreasing at C-16. ApoE3-NT variants with Trp at position 148 or 162 displayed a similar pattern of quenching. In the case of Trp-155 apoE3 NT domain, we confined our study to lipid particles possessing DOXYL moieties at positions C-5 and C-12 because of sample limitations. Despite this, we were able to calculate a reliable depth of penetration for this variant (see below). To determine the precise location of the Trp residues with respect to the bilayer, the distance of each Trp from the center of the bilayer was calculated using parallax analysis (25Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Google Scholar). This method uses the quenching ratio from a pair of quenchers, one shallow and one deep in the membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”). PL with DOXYL moieties at C-5 and C-12 were chosen for the calculation for two reasons: (i) this pair provides information close to the bilayer surface and relatively close to the bilayer center, respectively, and (ii) detailed information for the quenching of the two control peptides (employed in this study) and 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD)-labeled phospholipid with quenchers located at positions C-5 and C-12 is available (35Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Google Scholar, 36Baratti J. Maroux S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 488-496Google Scholar). Table I summarizes the fluorescence characteristics and quenching data for the rHDL particles of the apoE3 variants. Each of the four single Trp apoE3-NT variants exhibited a narrow range of depth of location, between 4.4 and 5.7 Å, indicating that positions 141, 148, 155, and 162 along the hydrophobic face of helix 4 localize to similar depths in the PL bilayer.Table IFluorescence characteristics and parallax analysis of single Trp apoE3 variants in rHDL particlesApoE3 variantλmaxaWavelength of maximum fluorescence.ZcfbDepth of penetration of the Trp residue measured from the bilayer center (0 Å); calculated from Equations 1 and 2 under “Experimental Procedures.”nmÅNT domainTrp-141330.0cBecause of poor recovery from the gel filtration column, these samples were measured in duplicat"

Sclerosteosis is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by general skeletal overgrowth (1Truswell A.S. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1958; 40: 208-218Google Scholar). Symptoms of sclerosteosis include gigantism, entrapment of cranial nerves, increased intracranial pressure due to widening of the calvarium of the skull, and increased thickness and density of both trabecular and cortical bone (2Beighton P.

Homozygous deletion of mouse Cbfa1 leads to a complete absence of bone formation due to an arrest in osteoblast maturation that prevents endochondral ossification (17Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Google Scholar, 18Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K.

Mice heterozygous for Cbfa1 develop bone abnormalities strikingly similar to those of patients suffering from the heritable genetic disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), an observation, which led to the discovery that Cbfa1 haploinsufficiency is the cause of CCD (17Otto F.

Although Cbfa1 was originally implicated in osteoblast differentiation, a further role for Cbfa1 in mature bone was demonstrated by creation of a transgenic mouse line expressing a dominant negative form of Cbfa1 using the bone-specific osteocalcin promoter. The inactivity of this promoter in pre-osteoblasts allowed these animals to develop a normal skeleton, but they later developed an osteopenic phenotype due to decreased bone formation, indicating that Cbfa1 plays a role in postnatal osteoblast function as well (21Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Google Scholar). Surprisingly, an osteopenic phenotype also developed in transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type Cbfa1 from the pro-α (I) collagen promoter. This phenotype, caused by a late stage blockage of osteoblast maturation that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of osteocytes, suggests that Cbfa1 negatively regulates a late stage of osteoblast/osteocyte development (22Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Google Scholar). Among the target genes of Cbfa1/RUNX2 is osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific gene that is the most highly expressed non-collagenous protein in bone (23Gallop P.M. Lian J.B. Hauschka P.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 1460-1466Google Scholar). Mice in which both osteocalcin genes were deleted showed an increased rate of bone formation, implicating osteocalcin as a negative regulator of bone growth, although the mechanism has not been fully defined (24Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Google Scholar). The osteocalcin promoter features three Cbfa consensus motifs, and studies have shown Cbfa1 to be important for both basal and vitamin D-regulated osteocalcin transcription (10Javed A. Gutierrez S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7491-7500Google Scholar). A C/EBP binding motif in the proximal osteocalcin promoter also has been shown to be functional, and the C/EBPβ protein has been shown to synergistically cooperate with Cbfa1 at this promoter through a direct interaction (25Gutierrez S. Javed A. Tennant D.K. van Rees M. Montecino M. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1316-1323Google Scholar). E-box consensus binding sites are present in the osteocalcin proximal promoter as well, and one particular E-box appears functionally important, with mutations reducing transcriptional activity by greater than 50% in the rat ROS17/2.8 osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line (26Tamura M. Noda M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 773-782Google Scholar). To gain insight into the pathway by which the newly discovered SOST gene might inhibit osteoblast differentiation and/or activity, we use a comparative genomics approach to identify conserved elements in the mouse and human noncoding sequences near the SOST genomic locus. A 1.8-kb fragment of the proximal promoter is well conserved between humans and mice and is active in the SAOS-2 but not the MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell line, paralleling the pattern of SOST expression in these cells. Promoter deletion analysis demonstrates that a 140-bp element just upstream of the SOST gene accounts for this transcriptional activity. The active region contains two E-boxes, a C/EBP binding site, and a Cbfa1 binding site. Mutational and gel mobility shift analyses demonstrate that transactivation by Cbfa1 accounts for the difference in SOST expression between the two cell lines. These observations are further supported by the expression of Cbfa1 in SAOS-2 cells but not MG-63, and the ability of transfected Cbfa1 to stimulate a SOST reporter in MG-63 cells. An upstream E-box is functional and may be a target of MyoD regulation, but does not account for the difference in SOST expression between these two cell lines. Our results identify SOST as a novel target gene for Cbfa1, and suggest a possible feedback inhibition role for the SOST protein in maintaining Cbfa1 at levels appropriate for osteoblast function and/or development. SOST Genomic Sequence Analysis—Approximately 200 kb of human genomic sequence from chromosome 17q12-q21 2Celera Human Genome Database, release R25, unpublished data. containing SOST and bounded proximally by MEOX1 and distally by DUSP3, was compared with the syntenic region from the mouse genome 2Celera Human Genome Database, release R25, unpublished data. in an attempt to identify conserved sequence elements (CSEs) in non-coding sequence that could serve as a starting point for the identification of factors that affect the regulation of SOST. A CSE is defined as a 100 bp or greater sequence with minimum 50% identity. Both the human and mouse sequences were masked for repeats prior to comparison using Repeat-Masker. 3A. G. A. Smit and P. Green, unpublished results and repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu/cgi-bin/RepeatMasker. Alignment of the human and mouse sequences was estimated using BLASTn (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) with default parameters. The alignment was scanned with a 100-bp window, and the percent identity within the window was calculated and plotted using VISTA (30Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M.

Reporter and Expression Constructs—The SOST promoter sequence selected for further study spans nucleotides -2000 to -190 of the SOST gene locus relative to the position (+1) of the initiation methionine for the SOST open reading frame (6Balemans W.

Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 537-543Google Scholar). The sequence was amplified from human genomic DNA (Promega) by PCR using the following 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively: 5′-TCTCCCCCGGGTGTGGATCATTTAGAGGTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCCTAGATCTCCCAAAGACTTCTCCTCTAGCTC-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with SmaI and BglII and inserted into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) digested at the same sites. PCR was carried out using HotStarTaq master mix (Qiagen) with the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Large-scale deletion mutations of the SOST promoter were constructed by digestion at native restriction sites (MluI, HpaI, SphI, HindIII, BamHI, EcoRV), treatment with Klenow or T4 DNA polymerase to fill in overhangs, digestion with BglII, and insertion into pGL2-Basic (Promega) digested with SmaI and BglII. Finer-scale deletions and point mutations involving the SOST promoter fragment between the EcoRV and BglII sites were generated using a PCR-based approach with oligonucleotides spanning the ends of the desired promoter sequence and bearing BglII, EcoRV, or SmaI restriction sites. Oligonucleotides used to generate mutations in transcription factor binding sites were as follows (mutated nucleotides are underlined). Upstream E-box mutant primer: 5′-GCTCCCCCGGGCCAGGTAAACGGAGGTGCCGGAGAGCAGG-3′. Downstream E-box mutant primer (reverse orientation): 5′-GCGGAAGATCTCT-CCGTTTACACCCAGAGAGAGGGGGCGTGTGA-3. Cbfa1 site mutant primer: 5′-GCTCCGATATCTGAAGTAAAGTGCCGCCAGCACGTGGGAG-3′. Similar primers, but with longer flanking 5′- and 3′-sequences, were used to mutate the Cbfa1 and Ebox sites in the full-length SOST-luc promoter via PCR-based mutagenesis. Expression constructs for human MyoD1 and Cbfa1/RUNX2 were created using the mammalian expression vector pDC409, which has been previously described (32Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Google Scholar). MyoD1 cDNA was generated by PCR using 5′-CCGTAAACGTCGACGCCATGGAGCTACTGTCGCCACC-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CGCCTAGATCTTCAGAGCACCTGGTATATCGG-3′ as a reverse primer, using HotStarTaq (Qiagen) as described above for 25 cycles with the IMAGE clone 2961494 (Research Genetics) as template. Cbfa1 cDNA was generated by PCR using SAOS-2 cDNA as a template with 5′-CCGACGGTCGACACCATGCGTATTCCCGTAGATCCG-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CCGGAAGATCTTCAATATGGTCGCCAAACAGATTC-3′ as a reverse primer using the Advantage GC PCR kit (Clontech) with 1 m GC Melt reagent under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Cbfa1 sequences recovered from SAOS-2 cDNA included both the wild-type gene and an alternatively spliced variant lacking Exon 4, as described in the text. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfection, Histology, and Cell Culture Conditions—The SAOS-2 and MG-63 human osteosarcoma cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (Eagle) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, Earle's BSS, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%) and penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. SAOS-2 and MG-63 cells were fixed and stained for alkaline phosphatase activity using the Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Sigma Diagnostics, part 85L-3R) and counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma). For transfection, cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning). After 24 h, cells were transfected in duplicate with a mixture of FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), MEM, and 1 μg DNA/well, including 20 ng/well of the pSEAP2-control secreted alkaline phosphatase vector (Clontech). p-Bluescript (Stratagene) was used when needed to provide a final total of 1 μg DNA per well. 48 h after transfection, cell supernatants (100 μl) were harvested and assayed using a SEAP Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Clontech). Cell lysates were harvested using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assays System (Promega). SEAP and luciferase samples were transferred to white opaque 96-well plates (Costar) and assayed using a MicroBeta Trilux luminescence counter (Wallac). Luciferase values were normalized to SEAP data to correct for well-to-well variations in transfection efficiency. Each construct shown was tested in a minimum of two experiments with consistent results. Cell Treatment, RNA Harvest, and Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR— SAOS-2 and MG-63 cells were plated at 106 cells/plate on 10-cm plates (Corning) and treated with either 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (Calbiochem) at 10-7m, Osteogenesis Induction Medium (OIM; see below), both vitamin D3 and OIM, or neither for 72 h prior to harvest. OIM consisted of: 0.1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 μm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma), and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma). RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and its quality was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Double-stranded cDNA was prepared with a Super Script Choice Kit (Invitrogen) using 1 μg of input RNA and 50 ng of random hexamers. RT-PCR of MyoD family members was performed using the following intron-spanning primers: for MyoD, 5′-AAGTAAATGAGGCCTTTGAGACAC-3′ and 5′-CGATGCTGGACAGGTAGTCTAGG-3′; for Myogenin, 5′-AGTGCCATCCAGTACATCGAG-3′ and 5′-TGGGTTAACCTTACATGGATGAG-3′; for Myf5, 5′-AACTACTATAGCCTGCCGGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTTCGTCCTGTGTATTAGG-3′; for Myf6, 5′-GAGCGCCATCAGCTATATTGAG-3′ and 5′-ATACTTGCTCCTCCTTCCTTAGC-3′. PCR reactions were carried out for 40 cycles using the Advantage GC PCR kit (Clontech) with 1 m GC Melt reagent as described above. For positive control samples, cDNA from human heart (Clontech) and human fetal skeletal muscle (Clontech) libraries was combined. Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA samples were treated with DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX), and reverse-transcribed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using random hexamers. Samples were distributed on plates at either 5 or 20 ng per well and run in triplicate. TaqMan primer/probe sets were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were as follows: huSOST 5′ oligo, 5′-CACCACCCCTTTGAGACCAA-3′; huSOST 3′ oligo, 5′-GGTCACGTAGCGGGTGAAGT; huSOST TaqMan probe 5′-CTGCCGCGAGCTG-3′; huCbfa1 5′ oligo, 5′-CCCGTGGCCTTCAAGGT-3′; huCbfa1 3′ oligo, 5′-TGACAGTAACCACAGTCCCATCTG-3′; huCbfa1 TaqMan probe, 5′-ACCTCTCCGAGGGCTA-3′. Forward and reverse primer concentrations for human SOST and Cbfa1 were optimized and determined to be 300, 900, and 300, 50 nm each; the 6-FAM labeled TaqMan probe was used at 200 nm. Forward and reverse primer concentrations for the housekeeping gene HPRT were 300 nm each; the VIC-labeled TaqMan probe was used at 200 nm. Multiplex TaqMan PCR reactions were set up in 25-μl volumes with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. Threshold cycle values (CT) were determined using Sequence Detector software version 1.7a (Applied Biosystems) and transformed to 2-ΔCT for relative expression compared with HPRT. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Nuclear extracts were prepared from SAOS-2 and MG-63 cells growing on 10-cm plates at a density similar to that used in transfection experiments (2.1 × 106 cells/plate) using a Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay reagent (Pierce), and extracts were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use. Probes for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were end-labeled using 2 μl of Redivue [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified over G-25 Sephadex Quick Spin Columns (Roche Applied Sciences). The probe spanning nucleotides -331 to -257 in the SOST promoter was generated by PCR using the Advantage GC PCR kit (Clontech) with 1 m GC Melt reagent for 27 cycles with the following primers: 5′-ATCTGAAAACCACAGCCGCCA-3′ and 5′-AGAGGGGGCGTGTGAGGC-3′. The 75-nt probe was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered using the Qiaex II Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Smaller probes encompassing regions A–D as designated in Fig. 3C were generated by heating complementary nucleotides in a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 5 min in a heat block at 95 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Top strand probe sequences used were as follows: probe A, 5′-ATCTGAAAACCACAGCCG-3′; probe B, 5′-CCAGCACGTGGGAGGTGCC-3′; probe C, 5′-CCGGAGAGCAGGCTTGGGCC-3′; probe D, 5′-CCTTGCCTCACACGCCCCCT-3′. The probe B competitor top strand probe with a mutant MyoD site (underlined) was: 5′-CCAGGTAAACGGAGGTGCC-3′. Labeling reactions used 0.5 pmol of PCR-generated probe or 1.75 pmol annealed oligonucleotides. For the EMSA binding reactions, 12,000 cpm labeled probe (∼70 fmol) was incubated 20 min at room temperature in Gel Shift Binding Buffer (Promega) with 2 μg of SAOS-2 or MG-63 nuclear extract in a total reaction volume of 10 μl prior to electrophoresis on a 6% DNA Retardation Gel (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 280Vat4 °C. Gels were briefly fixed and then dried and exposed to film (Kodak) at -80 for exposure for 10 to 120 min. For competition experiments, unlabeled annealed oligonucleotides (1.75 pmol) were preincubated for 10 min with nuclear extract before probe addition. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were present at ∼15-fold molar excess. Mutant oligonucleotides described in Fig. 4A (lanes 4–12) contained the probe A sequence as described above except for the single base substitutions described in the figure. The “flanking mutant” competitor (lane 3) used the following top strand sequence: 5′-GCACTGAAACCACAGAATAAG-3′. For supershift reactions, incubations were carried out as normal and then antibody (2 μg) was added and reactions were incubated 30 additional min at 4 °C. Antibodies used were the PEBP2αA/Cbfa1 (S-19) goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the Integrinβ2 K-19 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). SOST Proximal Promoter Cloning and Function in SAOS-2 versus MG-63 Cells—To search for homology between noncoding sequences in the SOST genomic locus, we used the VISTA program to compare mouse and human sequences deposited in the respective Celera databases (Fig. 1A) (30Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Google Scholar, 31Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Google Scholar). Human and mouse noncoding sequences showed greater than 50% homology in regions immediately upstream of the SOST open reading frame, in the gene's first intron, immediately downstream of the transcribed sequence, and in several more distant 3′-regions. Because noncoding sequences immediately upstream of genes may contain important proximal control elements, we decided to focus on the well-conserved 1.8-kb sequence directly upstream of the SOST gene. This region, referred to hereafter as the SOST promoter fragment, contained ∼780 bp of highly conserved sequence in its 5′-end and a shorter well-conserved region just upstream of the SOST open reading frame (Fig. 1A). We inserted the 1.8-kb sequence into the pGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) and tested the ability of this promoter fragment to drive luciferase expression in the SAOS-2 and MG-63 osteosarcoma cell lines. By several criteria, SAOS-2 cells appear to represent a more differentiated osteoblast cell type than MG-63 cells. SAOS cells stain intensely positive for alkaline phosphatase and appear more rounded, whereas MG-63 cells are only weakly positive for alkaline phosphatase activity and have a spindly fibroblast-like appearance (Fig. 1B). When we examined both cell lines for SOST expression using Taqman PCR, basal SOST expression was readily detected in SAOS-2 but not MG-63 cells (Ct cutoff = 36), consistent with the previously reported expression of SOST in differentiated osteoblast cells (Fig. 1C) (6Balemans W. Ebeling M. Patel N. Van Hul E. Olson P. Dioszegi M. Lacza C. Wuyts W. Van Den Ende J. Willems P. Paes-Alves A.F. Hill S. Bueno M. Ramos F.J. Tacconi P. Dikkers F.G. Stratakis C. Lindpaintner K. Vickery B. Foernzler D. Van Hul W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 537-543Google Scholar). 4B. R. Sevetson and P. Yang, unpublished data. SOST expression appeared to be up-regulated by vitamin D in SAOS-2 cells, and could be weakly induced by a combination of vitamin D and OIM (Osteogenesis Induction Medium) in MG-63 cells, but was not detected in untreated MG-63 cells. To test whether our SOST promoter fragment contained elements necessary to recapitulate the differences in SOST expression between SAOS-2 and MG-63 cells, we transfected the reporter construct into both cell types. The SOST-luc reporter consistently showed a 5-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with empty vector in SAOS-2 cells but no such increase in MG-63 cells, in agreement with the expression pattern of the SOST protein in these cell lines (Fig. 1D). This result suggested that SAOS-2 cells endogenously express a specific factor(s) that could bind this promoter element to up-regulate the expression of SOST. Deletion Analysis of the SOST Proximal Promoter Fragment—To delineate the promoter element(s) required for SAOS-specific SOST expression, we generated a series of deletion constructs using the promoter region's native restriction sites. Because we particularly wished to test the function of a large block of well-conserved (82% identity) sequence in the 5′-region of the promoter, we deleted promoter elements in a 5′ to 3′ fashion (Fig. 2A). Deletion of 5′-promoter elements encompassing the well-conserved region did not decrease luciferase activity, but instead revealed an ∼2-fold repressive effect of this region. Because this upstream element was dispensable for SAOS-specific activity of this promoter construct, we chose not to characterize it further. Further deletions to the 5′-boundary of the EcoRV restriction site, leaving only 140 nt of 3′-SOST promoter sequence, also failed to reduce SAOS-specific SOST activity, suggesting that the remaining 140 nt contained SAOS-specific regulatory positive elements. To confirm this observation, we tested a construct containing all SOST promoter sequences except those downstream (3′) of the EcoRV site. This construct had activity similar to that of empty vector alone (Fig. 2A, bottom construct), confirming that important promoter elements were contained in this 140-nt sequence. Finer scale deletion analysis of the EcoRV fragment (Fig. 2B, EcoRV: 1744-1836) suggested that its 5′-sequence encompassed important regulatory elements. Sequence examination revealed consensus binding sites for a number of transcription factors in this region, including two E-box elements and single binding sites for Cbfa1/RUNX2 and C/EBP proteins (Fig. 2C). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis of Active SOST Promoter Fragment—Because SOST is expressed in SAOS-2 but not MG-63 cells, we reasoned that nuclear extracts from these two osteosarcoma lines would bind differentially to the active element(s) of the SOST promoter, permitting isolation of the factor(s) responsible for SAOS-specific expression. Further deletion analysis within the EcoRV promoter fragment demonstrated that 5′-sequences could not be deleted without a loss of activity, but that some 3′-sequences, including the downstream E-box, could be eliminated without affecting promoter activity (Fig. 3A). Thus, a minimal region of 75 nt retained maximal transcriptional activity and was chosen as a probe in gel mobility shift assays. The lack of contribution of the downstream E-box was also confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 6A). Nuclear extracts were prepared from untreated SAOS-2 and MG-63 cells and incubated with the 32P-labeled probe containing the minimal active SOST element, followed by gel electrophoresis. Both SAOS-2 and MG-63 nuclear extracts produced a slow-migrating band of essentially equal mobility (Fig. 3B, top arrow), but SAOS-2 extracts also produced a faster migrating band that was not detected in MG-63 cells (Fig. 3B, bottom arrow). To identify the region of the probe responsible for the faster migrating SAOS-specific band, we tested the nuclear extracts using 32P-labeled annealed oligonucleotide pairs representing the portions of the full-length probe designated A, B, C, and D (Fig. 3B). Probes B and D weakly bound factors present in both MG-63 and SAOS-2 cells, whereas probe A strongly and specifically bound to a factor present only in SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 3B, lane 2).

The LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway has been well characterized, but little is known of proteins involved in its complex intracellular sorting and trafficking. Sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) has recently been implicated in LDLR intracellular trafficking. We show here that endogenous SNX17 is highly expressed in several cell types and is localized partially in early endosomes. We found that the PX domain of SNX17 is required for its endosomal localization but does not interact directly with the LDL receptor. A novel domain containing a FERM-like domain of SNX17 is needed for its interaction with the LDL receptor. Mutations in the NPXY motif of the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic tail that disrupt internalization also disrupt its interaction with SNX17, whereas mutations elsewhere had little effect. When transiently overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, SNX17 localized to large vesicular structures and disrupted normal trafficking of the LDL receptor in a PX domain-dependent manner. These results suggest that SNX17 plays a role in the cellular trafficking of the LDL receptor through interaction with the NPVY motif in its cytoplasmic domain and interaction of the PX domain with subcellular membrane compartments.

These vesicles then release their protein coat and fuse with other vesicles to form early endosomes, where acidification causes dissociation of the ligand-receptor complex. The ligand is transported to the lysosomes and degraded, while the LDL receptor recycles back to the plasma membrane, specifically to the basolateral surface in polarized cells, either directly from the early endosomes or via recycling endosomes (1Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Nature. 1979; 279: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Much of what is known about the LDL receptor pathway has come from studies of its malfunction in cells from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, who usually have mutations in the LDL receptor gene that affect many different aspects of the pathway. The LDL receptor pathway also malfunctions in individuals with null mutations in the gene for a novel adaptor protein called ARH (from autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia) that is essential for internalization of the receptor from the cell surface (2Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H.

Invest. 2002; 110: 1695-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Apart from ARH, little is known about other proteins involved in the complex pathways of intracellular sorting and trafficking of the LDL receptor. Based on the effects of single amino acid substitutions, the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor appears to contain the necessary information for many aspects of LDL-receptor trafficking, including clustering in clathrin-coated pits, internalization, recycling, and sorting of the receptor to the basolateral membrane in polarized cells. For example, an FDNPXY motif has been shown to be essential for internalization of the receptor, because mutations in this motif result in LDL receptors that fail to cluster in clathrin-coated pits. The FDNPVY motif of the LDL receptor binds to the PTB domain of ARH in vitro, providing further evidence that ARH functions as an accessory protein for endocytosis of the LDL receptor. A basolateral sorting signal comprising a proximal motif that overlaps with the NPXY internalization motif and a second distal motif has been shown to be important both for sorting of newly synthesized receptor to the basolateral plasma membrane and for sorting of the receptor after internalization (4Yokode M. Pathak R.K. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region of the LDL receptor that interfere with its basolateral sorting have also been identified in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (5Koivisto U.M. Hubbard A.L. Mellman I. Cell. 2001; 105: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but the one or more proteins that contribute to the sorting machinery have yet to be identified conclusively. The existence of novel genetic defects in internalization prompted us to investigate additional proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking and sorting of the LDL receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human liver cDNA library with the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor, we identified a novel protein that interacted strongly with the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor (6Burden J. Eden E.R. Sun X.-M. Soutar A.K. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151 (abstract): 242Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Florian and colleagues (7Florian V. Schluter T. Bohnensack R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identified this same protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin. These authors assigned the protein to the sorting nexin family as sorting nexin-17 (SNX17), based on the presence of a characteristic PX domain (8Haft C.R. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Stockinger and co-workers (9Stockinger W. Sailler B. Strasser V. Recheis B. Fasching D. Kahr L. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) identified the murine homologue of SNX17 as a protein that bound to the cytoplasmic tail of murine LR-8, another member of the LDL-receptor gene family. These authors reported that stable expression of SNX17 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased the internalization index of LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL and concluded that SNX17 must be involved in trafficking of the LDL receptor. To investigate how SNX17 functions in intracellular trafficking, we have mapped the domains or residues in the two proteins that are important for their interaction and have investigated which domains of SNX17 determine its subcellular localization. Plasmid Constructs—pLexA (LexA-(1–202), HIS3, Ampr) was used for the expression of all bait proteins in yeast. The cDNA for the whole cytoplasmic tail (nucleotides 2441–2817) of the LDL receptor was amplified and cloned as an EcoRI-SmaI fragment into the pLexA EcoRI-NotI sites downstream of the LexA sequence to produce pLexA-LDLR/CT. pLexA-LDLR/CTB contains the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic tail cDNA (nucleotides 2441–2509) with a STOP codon introduced at codon 812. Each of the NPVY (amino acids 804–807) residues in pLexA-LDLR/CT were individually replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Unique Site Elimination mutagenesis kit, Amersham Biosciences, St. Albans, UK); in some cases fragments were amplified from plasmids kindly provided by H. Hobbs (10Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SNX17 mutant constructs were amplified by PCR and cloned as EcoRI or EcoRI/XhoI fragments into pLexA or pB42AD. For mammalian expression or in vitro translation, full-length and truncated variants of SNX17 were cloned into pcDNA3.1 with a FLAG tag encoded at the carboxyl terminus of SNX17. They were also cloned into pEGFP (Invitrogen) to produce a fusion protein with GFP at the amino terminus of SNX17 or into pcDNA3.1 modified to produce a fusion protein with monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP) at the amino-terminal end of SNX17. The RFP mammalian expression vector, a kind gift of Drs. P. Cullen and D. Stephens (Bristol), was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of monomeric RFP (11Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar), itself kindly provided by Dr R. Tsien, into pcDNA3.1. For plasmids encoding GST fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor (amino acid residues 790–839 of the LDL receptor), appropriate fragments were amplified and cloned into pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Analysis of Fusion Proteins—Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48[p8op-lacZ] was grown and used for all transformations as described by the supplier (Yeast Protocols Handbook, Clontech, Basingstoke, UK). For analysis of fusion proteins, yeast extracts were prepared from mid log phase cultures of transformants in rich medium with galactose and raffinose at 30 °C and assayed for total protein content (DC protein assay kit, Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Extracts were fractionated by reduced SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-LexA (diluted 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Autogen Bioclear UK Ltd., Calne, UK) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako Ltd., Cambridge, UK) 1:5000, with detection by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). β-Galactosidase activity was determined in a chemiluminescence assay (Galacto-Light™ kit Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) in a tube luminometer (Turner, Steptech Instruments Services Ltd., Bedfordshire, UK). Physical Interaction of SNX17 with the Cytoplasmic Domain of the LDL Receptor—GST-cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins were bound to glutathione S-Sepharose beads according to the supplier's instructions (Bulk GST purification module, Amersham Biosciences). [35S]Methionine-labeled SNX17 fragments were produced by in vitro translation from pcDNA3.1 constructs (TnT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega, Southampton, UK). Labeled product (10 μl) was incubated with GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (approximately 25 μl of a 50% slurry of beads) in 125 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 16 h on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS gel sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (5% v/v), and aliquots (15 μl) were loaded onto 13% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and analyzed by autoradiography. Detection of Endogenous Protein—A commercial rabbit antiserum was raised to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide from the amino terminus of SNX17 (MHFSIPETESRSGDSGGSAY) (Harlan-Sera Laboratory Ltd., Loughborough, UK). A cytosolic and membrane fraction of cells was prepared by centrifugation as described previously (12Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other antisera for immunoblotting were rabbit anti-LDL receptor (Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) and mouse anti β-subunit of AP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., supplied by Cambridge BioScience, Cambridge UK). Confocal Microscopy—Human skin fibroblasts were seeded into wells containing sterilized coverslips at ∼75% confluence and used for transfection after 2–3 days when they reached 90–95% confluence. Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. The day after transfection, cells were fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, blocked, and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (w/v) saponin. When antibodies were used, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h (mouse/rabbit anti-EEA1, BD Biosciences, Cowley, Oxford UK; diluted 1/40) and then with Alexa 488/568-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG (highly cross-absorbed; Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands, diluted 1/100–1/200) for 1 h, both at ambient temperature. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories Inc., Peterborough, UK). Cells were viewed by using a Leica confocal microscope using the 100× oil objective, and the images were analyzed using Leica confocal software (Leica Microsystems (UK) Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). CHO cells were seeded into wells containing sterilized coverslips at ∼50% confluence, then transiently transfected with the FuGENE-plasmid DNA complex (ratio 3:1) 16 h after seeding, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, UK). For some experiments, SNX17 constructs were co-expressed with the human LDL-receptor cDNA (13Sun X.M. Patel D.D. Bhatnagar D. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in CHO-ldlA7 cells that lack endogenous LDL receptors (a kind gift from Dr. M. Krieger). The day after transfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in cold acetic acid (5% v/v) in ethanol for 20 min at ambient temperature, then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and blocked in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, 1/100) at 4 °C overnight, then with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (highly cross-absorbed; Molecular Probes Europe BV, diluted 1/100), at ambient temperature for 1 h, then mounted on slides with Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells co-transfected with the human LDL receptor were stained with anti-FLAG antibody as described above. The cells were then washed and incubated with rabbit anti-LDL-receptor Ab (diluted 1/200; Progen Biotechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) at 4 °C overnight, washed, and then incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (highly cross-absorbed; Molecular Probes, diluted 1/100) and finally mounted as described above. Screen of a Liver Yeast Two-hybrid Library for Proteins Interacting with the Cytoplasmic Tail of the LDL Receptor—When ∼1.8 × 106 clones of a human liver cDNA library were screened with amino acid residues 789–839 of the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic tail, 31 clones reproducibly showed strong to moderate interaction. Of these, thirteen (42%) encoded a known cDNA (14Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), now named sorting nexin-17 (SNX17) (7Florian V. Schluter T. Bohnensack R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the rest were classed as probable false positives (15Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Biol. Proced. Online. 1999; 1: 1-16Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). No growth occurred when yeast were transformed with pB42AD-SNX17 alone or together with empty pLexA vector, and no blue color was seen in yeast transformed with pLexA-CT and pB42AD-SNX17 but grown in the absence of the inducer. Direct physical interaction between SNX17 and the LDLR cytoplasmic domain was confirmed in a pull-down assay with the LDLR-cytoplasmic tail fused to immobilized GST and SNX17 translated in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, SNX17 bound to the GST-LDLR cytoplasmic tail, but not to GST alone or to an unrelated GST fusion protein (GST-luciferase). The NPVY Motif in the LDL Receptor Is Required for Its Interaction with SNX17—Because it has been suggested that SNX17 is involved in LDL receptor trafficking, we investigated the effect of mutations in the LDL receptor that have been shown to influence different aspects of its trafficking, for example internalization (10Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Davis C.G. van D.I. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or basolateral sorting (4Yokode M. Pathak R.K. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To analyze their effect on the ability to interact with SNX17, stable transformants of yeast expressing the SNX17/activation domain construct were co-transformed with wild type or mutant pLexA-LDLR/CT mutants and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. All the variants were expressed at approximately the same level (Fig. 2A). Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail at residue 812 (LDLR E812X) reduced the strength of interaction with SNX17 to ∼30% of that with the complete tail (Fig. 2B). This reduction in binding was considerably greater than the reported effect of this same mutation on internalization of the LDL receptor (74% of normal (10Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Nonetheless, with the value for the truncated tail set at 100%, the effect of replacing each of the NPVY residues in the cytoplasmic tail with alanine on the interaction between the truncated tail and SNX17 was very similar to that observed previously on internalization (Fig. 2C), in that substitution of Asn-804, Pro-805, or Tyr-807 in the truncated tail reduced its interaction with SNX17 by 75–80%, and the same substitutions were reported to reduce internalization by 65–85% (10Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, substituting alanine for the valine residue, which is poorly conserved in the NPVY (or NPXY) motif in different proteins, has little effect on the interaction between SNX17 and the cytoplasmic tail, reducing it by only 20% and reportedly reducing internalization by only 35% (10Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that replacing Tyr-807 with alanine in the cytoplasmic tail of the LDL receptor abolished its interaction with SNX17 in the pull-down assay (Fig. 1). We investigated whether other motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein might be involved, because truncation of the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic domain is known to remove residues important for sorting of the receptor to the basolateral surface of polarized hepatic cells (4Yokode M. Pathak R.K. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For this, we explored the effect of changing specific amino acids in the proximal and distal basolateral sorting signals proposed by Mellman and co-workers (Fig. 3A and Refs. 17Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 18Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Mellman I. Ann. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and in the NPVY motif in the whole cytoplasmic tail. The proximal motif overlaps with the internalization signal and shares the critical tyrosine for endocytosis (Tyr-807). The distal signal has no bearing on internalization but can mediate efficient basolateral sorting regardless of receptor expression levels. It contains two tyrosine residues at 824 and 826, but only substitution of tyrosine Tyr-824 was shown to result in significant mis-sorting of LDL receptors (∼30%) to the apical membrane. We generated three additional cytoplasmic tail constructs, as shown in Fig. 3A. We found that truncation of the tail at 834 had no significant effect on its interaction with SNX17, whereas substituting either of the tyrosine residues with alanine reduced the interaction, to 40% for Tyr-824 and 48% for Tyr-826 (Fig. 3B). Substituting Asn-804, Pro-805, or Tyr-807 with alanine in the full-length tail reduced the interaction with SNX17 to very low levels, whereas substitution of Val-806 had little effect (Fig. 3C). Clearly the integrity of much of the sequence of the cytoplasmic tail upstream of residue 834 is needed for full binding to SNX17, but not surprisingly, these results do not allow us to distinguish clearly between different roles for SNX17 in cellular trafficking. A Novel Domain of SNX17 Interacts with the Cytoplasmic Tail of the LDL Receptor—To identify which domains of SNX17 interact with the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic tail, fragments of the protein were expressed in yeast as fusion proteins with the activation domain and assayed for interaction with the LexA-LDLR/CT construct in yeast. As shown in Fig. 4, the PX domain (amino acid residues 5–91), the FERM-like domain (residues 113–275), the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the protein (residues 277–471), and a combination of the PX and FERM-like domains (residues 5–275), did not interact with the LDL receptor cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, a fragment comprising the FERM-like and carboxyl-terminal domains (residues 113–470) interacted as strongly as the full-length protein. Expression of a series of truncations of this protein revealed that regions at both ends are critical for interaction with the LDL receptor (Fig. 4B). At the amino-terminal end of the fragment, removal of residues 113–137 reduced the interaction to 7.8% of control. At the carboxyl-terminal end, removal of 45 residues increased its ability to interact with the LDL-receptor tail 2-fold, whereas loss of another 36 residues, leaving residues 113–389, resulted in interaction of 113% of control, which was abolished by removal of 56 additional residues. Thus the smallest fragment that retained the ability to interact strongly with the LDL-receptor cytoplasmic tail was the region comprising residues 113–389. Pull-down assays of the SNX17 fragments translated in vitro by immobilized GST-LDLR cytoplasmic tail fusion protein provided independent qualitative confirmation of these findings (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Direct interaction between SNX17 and the LDL receptor cytoplasmic tail. GST fusion proteins comprising GST alone (GST) or GST fused to the cytoplasmic tail of the LDL receptor (GST-LDLR-CT/807Y) were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled SNX17 proteins translated in vitro. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads and subjected to SDS-PAGE, as indicated in lanes 1–7.

This was comparable to the calculated molecular mass of 47 kDa and similar to that of the protein expressed from the cDNA in heterologous cells. When fibroblast extracts were subjected to centrifugation at 150,000 × g, some SNX17 was present in the membrane pellet, although the majority of the protein was cytosolic (Fig. 6). In contrast, virtually all the LDL receptor protein and the majority of adaptor-protein complex 2 (AP-2) were found in the membrane pellet. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of human skin fibroblasts stained with specific antibodies revealed that a proportion of endogenous SNX17 was vesicular, where it co-localized with EEA1, suggesting that it was associated with early endosomes (Fig. 7A). Not all EEA1 structures contained SNX17, but all vesicular SNX17 appeared to be in EEA-containing structures. It was not possible to show specific interaction between endogenous SNX17 and endogenous LDL receptors; in our hands, protein interactions with intact endogenous LDL receptor protein are difficult to demonstrate, because stringent conditions are required to solubilize this integral membrane protein.Fig. 7Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showing partial co-localization of endogenous SNX17 and GFP-SNX17 with early endosomes.A, human skin fibroblasts were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with rabbit anti-human SNX17 and mouse anti-EEA1, followed by incubation with ALEXA568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (red, left panel) and ALEXA488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (green, center panel). The right panel shows the SNX17/EEA1 overlay; the inset shows an enlargement of the area indicated. B, human skin fibroblasts were transfected with constructs expressing GFP-SNX17 (top), GFP (center), or GFP-SNX17113–425 (minimal LDL-receptor binding domain; bottom), then fixed, permeabilized, and stained 18 h after transfection with rabbit anti-EEA1/ALEXA568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG.

Subcellular localization of the expressed proteins was examined by confocal microscopy of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. When expressed transiently at low levels in human skin fibroblasts, full-length SNX17-GFP showed the same intracellular distribution as the native protein (Fig. 7B, top panel), suggesting that the fusion protein functioned normally when expressed at a moderate level. In contrast to the full-length fusion protein, GFP alone or GFP fused to residues 113–425 of SNX17 (GFP-SNX17113–425) the fragment that bound most strongly to the LDL receptor tail, was entirely cytosolic (Fig. 7B, middle and lower panels), as were GFP fusion proteins with the FERM-like domain (residues 113–274) or the carboxyl-terminal third domain (residues 275–470) (data not shown). Interestingly, no GFP could be detected in cells when the PX domain alone was expressed as a GFP fusion protein. Overall, these data suggested that the intact SNX17 protein is required for normal endosomal localization but implied that the PX domain may be critical, as has been seen for the endosomal localization of other sorting nexins. For example, substitution of a critical lysine residue in the PX domain of SNX 1 has been shown to disrupt its ability to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and thereby localize in early endosomes (20Cozier G.E.

Comparison of the sequences of SNX1, SNX4, and SNX17 with the p40Phox sequence indicated that this lysine residue was conserved in all four sequences (Fig. 8). To explore this, we also expressed SNX17 fused to the carboxyl terminus of monomeric red fluorescent protein (11Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y.

Thirty-one kinds of GGN5 analogues were synthesized, and their biological activities were analyzed against diverse microorganisms and human erythrocytes. The structural properties of the peptides in various solutions were characterized by spectroscopic methods. The N-terminal 13 residues of GGN5 were identified as the minimal requirement for biological activity. The helical stability, the amphipathic property, and the hydrophobic N terminus were characterized as the important structural factors driving the activity. To develop shorter antibiotic peptides, amino acid substitutions in an inactive 11-residue analogue were examined. Single tryptophanyl substitutions at certain positions yielded some active 11-residue analogues. The most effective site for the substitution was the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface in the amphipathic helical structure. At this position, tryptophan was the most useful amino acid conferring favorable activity to the peptide. The introduced tryptophan played an important anchoring role for the membrane interaction of the peptides. Finally, two 11-residue analogues of GGN5, which exhibited strong bactericidal activity with little hemolytic activity, were obtained as property-optimized candidates for new peptide antibiotic development.

Most organisms produce membrane-active peptides that exhibit antibiotic, fungicidal, hemolytic, virucidal, and tumoricidal activities (1Bechinger B. J. Membr.

In particular, cationic, linear, helical peptides, which are the most well characterized group of antimicrobial peptides, function by the “barrel-stave” and/or “carpet-like” mechanism, leading to bacterial membrane permeation (1Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 5Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar, 9Maloy W.L. Kari U.P.

In membrane environments, the peptides generally adopt an amphipathic helical structure, positioning the hydrophobic residues on one side and the hydrophilic residues on the other side of the helical axis, whereas they assume a random coil conformation in aqueous solutions. Recently, antimicrobial peptides have become a potential source of new antibiotics to combat the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria (4Hancock R.E.W. Scott M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 5Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Several antimicrobial peptides such as magainin, a 23-residue antimicrobial peptide, have been successful in pharmaceutical and commercial development (5Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6852) Google Scholar). Particularly, from the first discovery of bombinins in Bombina variegata (7Csordas A. Michl H. Toxicon. 1969; 7: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the skin of anurans (frogs and toads) has proven to be a rich source of peptides with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities (6Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 8Goraya J. Knoop F.C. Conlon J.M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After the discovery of the magainins in 1987 (15Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar), attention has been increasingly focused upon amphibian skin peptides as potential therapeutic agents (2Boman H.G. Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, the rather large molecular sizes of natural antimicrobial peptides have been a significant obstacle in their pharmaceutical development as therapeutic agents. To reduce the peptide size, active regions that are shorter than the parent antimicrobial peptides have been identified (16Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Subbalakshmi C. Nagaraj R. Sitaram N.

Although much has been revealed about the physicochemical and structural properties conferring the antimicrobial activity, less is known about the mechanisms for depressing the hemolytic activity. Thus, antimicrobial peptide engineering to optimize the antimicrobial activity has often failed in affording the ability to selectively diminish the hemolytic activity. Six kinds of peptides, named gaegurins (GGNs), 1The abbreviations used are: GGN, gaegurin; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; NATA, N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide; TFE, trifluoroethanol; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; CD, circular dichroism; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; DQF-COSY, double-quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy; [θ]m.r.w.λ, mean residue molar ellipticity at any wavelength λ. have been isolated from the Asian frog Rana rugosa (23Park J.M. Jung J.E. Lee B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 948-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because they exhibit strong antimicrobial activity with little hemolytic activity, some GGNs are considered as target molecules for new antibiotic development by peptide engineering (21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4367-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We previously solved the structure of the shortest gaegurin, GGN5, in SDS micelles (22Park S.-H. Kim H.-E. Kim C.-M. Yun H.-J. Choi E.-C. Lee B.-J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this work, as part of an effort to develop new, low molecular mass peptide antibiotics, we searched for the shortest GGN5 analogue peptide with favorable bioactivity (high antimicrobial activity with no significant hemolytic activity) by systematic peptide modifications. In addition, the structure-activity relationship of the peptide in membranemimetic environments was investigated by spectroscopic methods. We expect that the present results will provide useful information as well as an exemplary scheme of peptide engineering to develop potent target molecules for new antibiotic development. Materials and Peptide Preparation—Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids and Rink resins were obtained from Advanced Chemtech, Inc. HPLC solvents were from Fisher Scientific. DPC and SDS-d25 were obtained from Avanti and Isotec, respectively. NATA was obtained from Aldrich. TFE, non-deuterated SDS, and acrylamide were obtained from Sigma, and all other chemicals were either analytical or biotechnological grade, obtained from various manufacturers. Peptides were synthesized automatically on a peptide synthesizer (Model 90, Advanced Chemtech, Inc.) by solid-phase methods using standard Fmoc chemistry (24Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To obtain the peptide amide, 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-amino-methyl)phenoxy resin was used. Side-chain protection groups included Fmoc-O-t-butyl-l-serine and N-Fmoc-N-t-butoxycarbonyl-l-lysine. Coupling procedures were performed with diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation. Fmoc group removal from the peptide chain was performed with 25% piperidine in dichloromethane. Cleavage of the resin and the protecting group was performed with 10% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. The product was purified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on C-18 columns from Merck-Hitachi. The purity and the correct mass of the product peptide were identified by HPLC and ion spray mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial and Hemolytic Assay—Antimicrobial activity was determined by the standard broth microdilution method (22Park S.-H. Kim H.-E. Kim C.-M. Yun H.-J. Choi E.-C. Lee B.-J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Jorgensen J.H. Ferraro M.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 26: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by measuring the MIC values against diverse microorganisms. In brief, from cell cultures (106-108 colony-forming units/ml) incubated in the presence of various concentrations (3.1–200 μg/ml in 2-fold dilution) of peptides, the MIC was defined as the lowest peptide concentration that completely inhibits the cell growth. To evaluate the antimicrobial property, the killing curve assay in a standard protocol (26Jacqueline C. Caillon J. Le Mabecque V. Miègeville A.-F. Donnio P.-Y. Bugnon D. Potel G. J. Antimicrob.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 782-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed against two different strains: Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium, and Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacterium. Briefly, from individual cell cultures containing various concentrations (at 0×, 0.25×, 0.5×,1×,2×, and 4× MIC) of the peptides, the surviving bacteria were counted after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h of incubation by subculturing 100-μl serial dilutions (10–1-, 10–2-, 10–3-, 10–4-, 10–5-, 10–6-, 10–7-, and 10–8-fold dilutions in 0.9% sodium chloride) of samples on LB agar plates. Hemolytic activities were measured for the peptides with antimicrobial activities as described previously (22Park S.-H. Kim H.-E. Kim C.-M. Yun H.-J. Choi E.-C. Lee B.-J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A 10% (v/v) suspension of human red blood cells with the appropriate amount of each peptide was incubated for 30 min. After centrifugation, the A550 of the supernatant was measured. The relative attenuation, as compared with that of the suspension treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, was defined as the percentage of hemolysis. CD Spectroscopy—For CD spectroscopy, a precise amount of the peptide powder was dissolved to a final concentration of 50 μm in various solvents: 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), TFE/water mixtures, 5 mm DPC micelles, and 10 mm SDS micelles. Before the CD measurement, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 by the addition of 0.1 n HCl or NaOH. CD spectra were obtained at 20 °C on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.2-cm-path length cell. CD scans were taken at 293 K from 250 to 190 nm, with a 1-nm bandwidth, a 4-s response time, a scan speed of 50 nm/min, and a 0.5-nm step resolution. Three scans were added and averaged, followed by subtraction of the CD signal of the solvent. Finally, the CD intensity was normalized as the mean residue molar ellipticity (21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4367-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), [θ]m.r.w. (deg·cm2·dmol–1). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emissions of 5 μm peptide and NATA dissolved in various solvents (water, 10 mm SDS micelles, and 5 mm DPC micelles, respectively, at pH 4.0) were monitored on a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer at 20 °C using a 10-mm quartz cell. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to ensure that the light was absorbed almost entirely by tryptophanyl groups (28Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Emission scans were taken from 300 to 450 nm, with a 5-nm excitation and emission bandwidth, a 0.5-s response time, and a scan speed of 1000 nm/min. The fluorescence-quenching experiment was performed by the standard method suggested by Eftink and Ghiron (28Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 486-493Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 30Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5546-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission was quenched by the progressive addition (4 μl at each time) of an 8 m acrylamide solution into the 2-ml sample solution. KSV (collisional or Stern-Volmer quenching constant) was determined together with V (static quenching constant) by plotting F0/(F·expV[Q]) versus the molar concentration of the quencher ([Q]; [Ac] in this work using acrylamide) for various V until a linear plot was obtained, according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation (28Eftink M.R.

NATA was used as a control material for fluorescence experiments, as it is an indole derivative that closely mimics a tryptophan residue involved in peptide bonds (21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E.

Two-dimensional DQF-COSY, total correlation spectroscopy (60-ms mixing time), and NOE spectroscopy (200-ms mixing time) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer at 313 K. Solvent suppression was achieved using selective low power irradiation of the water resonance. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced directly to the methyl signals of sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate. Sequence-specific assignments of the proton resonances were achieved by spin system identification from the total correlation spectroscopy and DQF-COSY spectra, followed by sequential assignments through the NOE connectivities (21Won H.-S.

Minimal Requirement for the Activity—Prior to the design of the GGN5 analogues, the previously reported structure of GGN5 (22Park S.-H. Kim H.-E. Kim C.-M. Yun H.-J. Choi E.-C. Lee B.-J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was inspected and characterized into three components (Fig. 1): the hydrophobic N terminus (residues 1–4), the C-terminal cyclic loop (residues 18–24) by a conserved disulfide bond, and the body of an amphipathic α-helix (residues 3–20) kinked at Pro14. The N-terminal hydrophobic region has been suggested to anchor the peptide within the membrane, whereas the C-terminally conserved disulfide bond (14Goraya J. Wang Y. Li Z. O′Flaherty M. Knoop F.C. Platz J.E. Conlon J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Park J.M. Jung J.E. Lee B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Additionally, the helical kink at Pro14 was important for the selectivity rather than for the antimicrobial activity. All of these previous results led us to focus on the N-terminal 13 residues preceding Pro14 as the minimal requirement for the activity. Indeed, in the present work, GGN5N13 (a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 13 residues of GGN5; analogue 4 in Fig. 2) exhibited antimicrobial activity comparable with that of the intact GGN5, although its hemolytic activity was more than 3-fold higher (Table I). Other synthetic N-terminal fragments of GGN5 that were shorter than GGN5N13 (analogues 1–3 and 5 in Fig. 2) and other 13-residue fragments of GGN5 (analogues 6–9 in Fig. 2) showed no biological activity (Table I). Thus, the N-terminal 13 residues of GGN5 could be identified as the minimal requirement for activity.Fig. 2Sequence alignment of GGN5 and its analogue peptides.

Open table in a new tab The conformational preferences of the synthetic GGN5 fragments in different environments were investigated by CD spectroscopy.

DPC micelles, with a zwitterionic surface, and SDS micelles, with a negatively charged surface, were used as model systems that more closely resemble the amphiphilic environment of a biological phospholipid bilayer (10Oren Z.

In Fig. 3, the far-UV CD spectra are presented for GGN5N13, while for the other peptides, the absolute value of [θ]m.r.w.222 and the ratio [θ]m.r.w.222/[θ]m.r.w.208 are plotted. In aqueous buffer, all of the GGN5 analogues produced CD spectra with a single minimum near 200 nm, proving the absence of ordered structure. In 50% TFE/water, 10 mm SDS micelles, and 5 mm DPC micelles, their CD signals at 208 and 222 nm were intensified, which indicates that a helical conformation was stabilized. This type of conformational change, from a random coil in aqueous solutions to an α-helix in membrane-mimetic environments, is common among many membrane-binding peptides (1Bechinger B. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) including the native GGN5 (inset in Fig. 3A). Although all of the synthetic GGN5 fragments showed the same conformational preferences in various solvents, they differed from one another in their helical contents deduced from |[θ]m.r.w.222| and in the detailed spectral shape represented by [θ]m.r.w.222/[θ]m.r.w.208 (21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4367-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GGN5N13, the only bioactive peptide among the synthetic N-terminal fragments, showed the highest helical content, while the others, which were inactive, showed much lower helix contents (Fig. 3B). Particularly in detergent micelles, the helical content of GGN5N13 was comparable with that of the intact GGN5, although its potential helical propensity evaluated in 50% TFE/water was lower than that of GGN5. Based on the GGN5 structure (Fig. 1), the GGN5 fragment peptides would exhibit an amphipathic characteristic, which is important for the membrane interaction (6Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 21Won H.-S. Park S.-H. Kim H.E. Hyun B. Kim M. Lee B.J. Lee B.-J. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), by adopting helical structures. Since the most stabilized helical conformation would afford the peptides maximal amphipathicity, the helical stability in membrane-mimetic environments could be directly correlated to the activities, including both the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. Taken altogether, the comparative analysis of the CD parameters indicated that the helical content or helical stability would be a critical factor for the biological activity of the synthetic GGN5 fragments. In addition, the remarkable difference in the hemolytic activity, despite the comparable helicity, between GGN5 and GGN5N13 indicates that the C-terminal part, from Pro14 of GGN5, directs the selectivity between bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Sequence Modification of GGN5N13—For the activity modulation of GGN5N13, two kinds of amino acid substitutions affecting the amphipathic property were tested (analogues 10 and 11 in Fig. 2); the G3K substitution would be more amphipathic, and the G3K/S10L substitution would increase the hydrophobic portion (refer to Fig. 1B). The CD parameters were nearly identical between GGN5N13 and the analogues (Fig. 3B), and thus these substitutions had no significant struc"

We hypothesized that in inactive ϵPKC, the RACK-binding site is engaged in an intramolecular interaction with a sequence resembling its RACK, termed ϕϵRACK. An amino acid difference between the ϕϵRACK sequence in ϵPKC and its homologous sequence in ϵRACK constitutes a change from a polar non-charged amino acid (asparagine) in ϵRACK to a polar charged amino acid (aspartate) in ϵPKC. Here we show that mutating the aspartate to asparagine in ϵPKC increased intramolecular interaction as indicated by increased resistance to proteolysis, and slower hormone- or PMA-induced translocation in cells. Substituting aspartate for a non-polar amino acid (alanine) resulted in binding to ϵRACK without activators, in vitro, and increased translocation rate upon activation in cells. Mathematical modeling suggests that translocation is at least a two-step process. Together our data suggest that intramolecular interaction between the ϕϵRACK site and RACK-binding site within ϵPKC is critical and rate limiting in the process of PKC translocation.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational changes in PKC from an inactive to an active state results in exposure of domains required for PKC anchoring to the particulate fraction and in increased sensitivity of the enzyme to proteases (1Dekker L.V.

Therefore, the inactive state exists in a closed conformation, with the proteolytic sites protected, whereas the active state is in an open conformation with exposed proteolytic sites. Structural alterations from the closed to open states involve disruption of intramolecular interactions within the enzyme. An intramolecular interaction in inactive PKC between the catalytic site and a site in the regulatory domain that resembles a substrate phosphorylation site but lacks a serine or threonine phosphoacceptor (pseudosubstrate site) has been previously identified (3Pears C.J. Kour G. House C. Kemp B.E. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Deletion of the pseudosubstrate (ϕ-substrate) site generated a constitutively active enzyme (6House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and mutations of the basic residues in the ϕ-substrate site reduced the affinity of the catalytic site to the ϕ-substrate site generating a constitutively active enzyme, preferentially localized to the cell particulate fraction (6House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conversion of the alanine in the ϕ-substrate site to a glutamic acid, mimicking a phosphorylated amino acid, resulted in loss of binding of the ϕ-substrate site to the catalytic site, creating a constitutively active enzyme (6House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Finally, a peptide corresponding to the ϕ-substrate site is a competitive inhibitor of PKC catalytic activity (6House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that translocation of PKC is associated with binding of each activated PKC isozyme to a corresponding anchoring protein, termed RACK, for receptor for activated C-kinase (7Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). RACKs also function as molecular scaffolds, binding and regulating other signaling proteins. For example, RACK1 binds dynamin-1 (8Rodriguez M.M. Ron D. Touhara K. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13787-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), Src (9Chang B.Y.

RACK2 (ϵRACK), also known as b′cop, is a member of the coatomer complex, COPI, and binds several coatomer proteins and the small G protein ARF (14De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Since isozyme-specific PKC binding to respective RACKs occurs upon enzyme activation, we predicted that PKC activation involves a conformational change that induces the unmasking of the RACK-binding site in PKC (15Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21395-21398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed the existence of a second intramolecular interaction in inactive PKC. This intramolecular interaction forms between the RACK-binding site and another site in PKC, termed the pseudo-RACK (ϕRACK), which resembles and mimics a sequence in the RACK (15Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21395-21398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is likely that even in unstimulated cells, PKC exists in at least two conformations: an active open conformation, that has the RACK- and PL-binding sites exposed, and an inactive closed conformation, with these sites unavailable for binding to RACK and PL. In the presence of activators, the open conformation would be stabilized, shifting the equilibrium between the two conformations toward the active state. ϕRACK sequences were identified by searching for regions of homology between each PKC isozyme and its RACK. In ϵPKC, the sequence HDAPIGYD (ϵPKC 85–92), named ϕϵRACK, has ∼75% homology with a sequence in ϵRACK consisting of amino acids NNVALGYD (ϵRACK 285–292). A peptide corresponding to the ϕϵRACK sequence functions as an ϵPKC-selective agonist. We predicted that the agonist activity occurs because the ϕϵRACK peptide binds the ϵRACK-binding site in ϵPKC, interfering with the intramolecular interaction between the ϕϵRACK and the ϵRACK-binding site, and thus stabilizing the open form. Since, after treating cells with a ϕϵRACK peptide, ϵPKC was co-localized with ϵRACK (17Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M. Wu G. Lorenz J.N. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12798-12803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we suggested that the ϕRACK peptide is eventually replaced by the RACK, possibly because the affinity of the RACK-binding site to the ϕRACK peptide is lower than the affinity of the RACK-binding site to the RACK (16Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A notable difference between the ϕϵRACK sequence in ϵPKC and the homologous sequence in ϵRACK involves an amino acid change from a polar charged amino acid (aspartate (Asp-86)) in ϵPKC to a polar non-charged amino acid (asparagine (Asn-286)) in ϵRACK. Such a change in charge fits the prediction that the proposed intramolecular interaction mediated by the ϕϵRACK site and the RACK-binding site in ϵPKC lacks a crucial interaction and is subsequently competitively replaced by the ϵRACK upon enzyme activation (18Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to test the importance of the intramolecular interaction between the ϕϵRACK site and the ϵRACK-binding site and its influence in the process of ϵPKC translocation and function. If the ϕϵRACK site is engaged in an intramolecular interaction with the RACK-binding site, we expected that a mutation in the ϕϵRACK site, which increases the resemblance of the ϕϵRACK site to the ϵRACK, should stabilize this intramolecular interaction and yield a more closed conformation. To test this hypothesis, we mutated Asp-86 in the ϕϵRACK site to an Asn-86, so that the ϕϵRACK site would more closely resemble the ϵRACK or to a non-polar amino acid, alanine (Ala). We then determined the sensitivity of the mutants and wild-type enzyme to protease digestion and their dependence on activators for binding to ϵRACK in vitro. These mutants were also expressed in mammalian cells as GFP fusion proteins and the effect of the mutation on translocation rates was examined. Materials—Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Anti-ϵPKC V5 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Cultures—CHO-Hir cells (kindly provided by Bio Image A/S, Soeborg, Denmark) were kept in culture in F-12(HAM) nutrient mixture supplemented with glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (US qualified, Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, Invitrogen). MCF7 cells (a gift of James Ford, Stanford University) were kept in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were cultured at 37 °C 5% CO2. Insect cells were grown at 26 °C, Sf9 cells were cultured in SF900II SFM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and antibiotics. Hi5 insect cells were cultured in Insect Xpress (Bio Whittaker) containing antibiotics. Constructs—The EGFP-ϵPKC construct used in these studies was kindly provided by Bio Image A/S, Soeborg, Denmark. This construct contained two amino acid substitutions (Q34A and S336G), when compared with the human ϵPKC sequence deposited in GenBank™, accession number X65293. Site-directed mutagenesis of this clone was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were: for D86N forward primer (5′-GTAGCCTATGGGGGCATTGTGAAAGACAGCCAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTGGCTGTCTTTCACAATGCCCCCATAGGC TAC-3′). For D86A forward primer (5′-CTGGCTGTCTTTCACGCTGCCCCCATAGGCTAC) and reverse primer (5′-GTAGCCTATGGGGGCAGCGTGAAAGACAGCCAG-3′). The ϵPKC mutants were fully sequenced and subcloned by cutting and re-ligating into the XhoI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) sites into pEYFP C1 and pECFP C1 (Clontech). For expression in the baculovirus expression system GFP-ϵPKC was cut with XhoI and BamHI to release the insert, filled in with Klenow (New England Biolabs) and cloned into pvL1392 (BD Biosciences) digested with SmaI (New England Biolabs). The human ϵRACK construct cloned into PZeoSV used in these studies was kindly provided by Bio Image A/S, Soeborg, Denmark. The ϵRACK insert was released by cutting with ScaI (New England Biolabs) and XhoI, blunt-ended with Klenow, and re-ligated into the SmaI site of PacG3X (BD Biosciences). ϵRACK was expressed as a GST fusion protein. Transient Transfections—Transfections of CHO-Hir, MCF-7, and Sf9 cells was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Insect Cell Protein Expression—Baculovirus was produced in Sf9 cells and all proteins were expressed in Hi5 cells. Expression of all constructs was optimal at 72-h post-transfection. Infected Hi5 cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors: leupeptin (25 μg/ml), aprotinin (25 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 μg/ml), SBTI (20 μg/ml), E64 (25 μg/ml) (Sigma)). The soluble fraction was isolated after a 30-min spin at 49,000 × g, and the supernatant was stored in 50% glycerol at –20 °C until further use. Arg C Proteolysis Assay—ArgC digests were performed as described (19Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude insect cell lysate containing ∼70 ng of PKC (determined by Western blot comparison with standardized PKC (Pan Vera)) was digested in 520 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with 20 μl of endoproteinase ArgC (Roche Applied Science, 25 units/ml) at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points run on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by Western blot using anti-ϵPKC antibodies. ϵRACK Binding Assay—Insect cells expressing either ϵPKC or GST-ϵRACK were lysed as described above. GST-ϵRACK, 10 ng was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), and washed thoroughly with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Immobilized GST-ϵRACK was then incubated with the soluble fraction of insect cell lysates containing 100 ng of wild type, D86A, or D86N ϵPKC protein, in the presence or absence of phospholipid activators (PL) (phosphatidylserine 12 μg/reaction and, sn-1,2 dioleoylglycerol 400 ng/reaction) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following a thorough washing with wash buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and proteins separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of ϵPKC interacting with ϵRACK was determined by Western blot probing for ϵPKC with anti-ϵPKC-V5 antibodies. Blots were then re-probed with anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to verify that the same amount of GST-ϵRACK was present in each binding assay. Alternatively, GST-ϵRACK was incubated with 200 ng of soluble GFP-ϵPKC and GFP-ϵPKC mutants. Soluble GFP-ϵPKC and GFP-ϵPKC mutants were obtained from 48-h-transfected CHO-Hir cells that were serum-starved 24 h after transfection. Cells were then lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 12 mm β-mercapthoethanol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (25 μg/ml), aprotinin (25 μg/ml) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma)) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then used for binding experiments. Following up to an hour of binding at 4 °C in the presence of PL in homogenization buffer, beads were washed four times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and proteins separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, as described above. Immunoprecipitation—CHO-Hir cells were washed two times in serum-free medium and serum-starved 12–24 h after transfection. Cells were then kept in serum-free medium for ∼12 h before the experiment. Cells were lysed in homogenization buffer as described above. The supernatant was then used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies 3E6 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, lysates (∼2 mg/ml) were precleared in protein G-agarose beads (25-μl packed volume, Invitrogen) for at least 30 min and spun at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then incubated with 1 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies for at least 2 h. Protein G-agarose beads (25-μl packed volume) was then added to the lysate-antibodies complex and incubated for at least 2 h (all incubations were done at 4 °C). Beads were subsequently washed three times with Buffer 1 (50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5), once with Buffer 2 (50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and once with Buffer 3 (50 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). For kinase assays, beads were washed an additional time with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Kinase Assay—The ability of the different ϵPKC mutants to phosphorylate substrates was assayed by following the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into myelin basic protein according to a method modified from Kikkawa et al. (20Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) myelin basic protein phosphorylation was measured either by liquid scintillation or for immunoprecipitation experiments, by autoradiography. For the kinase reaction of immunoprecipitated enzyme, beads were resuspended in 20 μl of a kinase reaction buffer composed of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) 0.3 μCi/reaction, ATP (Sigma) 9 μm/reaction, myelin basic protein (Sigma) 12 μg/reaction, and MgCl2 50 mm/reaction. 4 μl of phospholipids were added per reaction when needed. Phospholipids were prepared as described (20Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer and boiling. Samples were then run on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose exposed for autoradiography. The same nitrocellulose was then developed with anti ϵPKC (V5) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to verify the amount of fusion protein immunoprecipitated. Analysis of PKC Translocation by Western Blot—After 24 h of transfection cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h and incubated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (LC Laboratories) for the indicated times and concentrations at room temperature and subsequently fractionated as previously described (21Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To assess PKC distribution the different cell fractions were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred for Western blot analysis and probed with anti-ϵPKC V5 antibodies. Lysates of overexpressed GFP-ϵPKC were diluted to ∼20 ng/well. At this concentration endogenous ϵPKC was not detected. Microscopy and Analysis—CHO cells were grown on glass cover slips, and serum-starved as described above. For each experiment, cells were transferred to a commercially available metal coverslip holder (Molecular Probes) in which the coverslip formed the bottom of a 1 ml bath. The media was then replaced with extracellular buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 30 mm glucose). Cells were stimulated by either PMA (100 nm), or with ATP (1 mm) in extracellular buffer. Fluorescence images of GFP-tagged constructs were obtained using the 488 nm excitation line of a laser scanning confocal microscope (Pascal, Zeiss), and emission was collected through a 505–550 nm band pass filter. Cells were imaged on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100 m) using a 40× Zeiss Plan-apo oil immersion objective with 1.2 numerical aperture (NA). For dual color imaging of CFP and YFP fusion proteins, a spinning disk Nipkow confocal microscope was used. Cells were viewed using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope with a 40× oil immersion Olympus objective (1.35 NA) and images were acquired with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and 2X2 pixel binning. CFP was excited with the 442 nm laser line of a helium-cadmium laser (Kimmon) whereas YFP was imaged with the 514 nm line of an argon ion laser (Melles-Griot). To selectively photobleach YFP labeled proteins in local regions of the cytoplasm for FRAP experiments, the 514 nm line of an Enterprise laser (Coherent) at maximal power (∼400 milliwatts) was used. For these experiments, we used a 60× oil immersion objective (1.4 NA). Under these conditions, and by placing an iris in the beam path, it was possible to bleach 80% of the YFP fluorescence in 500 ms in an area of the cytosol measuring ∼35 um2. Real-time confocal images were acquired every 10–15 s for 20 min for experiments utilizing PMA, and every 5 s for a total duration of 3 min in the case of cells stimulated with ATP. Reagents were added to the cell chamber after the fifth image in each time series. Control time lapses were acquired using the same imaging conditions used in the experiments to check that the level of general dye photobleaching did not exceed 10–30%. All images were acquired at room temperature. Images were exported as 12 or 16 bit files and changes in fluorescence intensity were measured using Metamorph® data analysis software (Universal Imaging). To monitor the translocation of PKC, a small region of interest was selected in the cytosol of each cell and fluorescence intensity values graphed against time after subtraction of background values and normalized so that the initial fluorescence was 100%. Averages of 10–15 cells from three independent experiments were used. Statistical Analysis and Mathematical Modeling—For quantitative analysis auto radiographs were scanned and quantified using NIH Image software. Analysis of fluorescence data was performed using Metamorph® (Universal Imaging Corporation). To determine statistical significance we used a one-tail type 2 Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). Significance of time course curves was determined using two-way ANOVA test (Stat View®). Mathematical modeling, was obtained from data of cells expressing similar levels of the different ϵPKC ϕϵRACK mutants. Non-linear least squares curve fitting analysis was performed using the EViews software (QMS) and differential equation analysis was performed using Berkeley Madonna™. Sensitivity to Protease Degradation of the Different ϕϵRACK ϵPKC Mutants—If the Asp-86 in the ϕϵRACK site is engaged in an intramolecular interaction with the RACK-binding site, we expected the D86N mutant to reside more in the closed state, and therefore be more resistant to proteolysis. In contrast, the D86A mutant should favor an open conformation and therefore be more susceptible to proteolysis. To test this hypothesis, ϵPKC Wt and mutants expressed in insect cells were subjected to proteolysis by the endopeptidase, Arg C as previously shown for βPKC (19Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation by Arg C was monitored by the decrease of full-length ϵPKC. Although under these experimental conditions D86A mutation did not alter susceptibility of the enzyme to degradation by Arg C when compared with the wild-type enzyme, the D86N mutant was significantly more resistant to proteolysis than either D86A or wild type (Fig. 1, A and B). Binding of the ϵPKC Mutants to ϵRACK—RACKs bind active PKC (22Mochly-Rosen D. Henrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Mol. Biol. Cell (formerly Cell Regulation. 1990; 1: 693-706Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). If the intramolecular interaction between ϕϵRACK and the RACK-binding site stabilizes the inactive closed form, increasing or decreasing the affinity of this intramolecular interaction should cause a corresponding decrease or increase in the ability of the enzyme to bind to its RACK. To test this prediction, we determined the binding of insect cell-expressed ϵPKC (Wt and ϕϵRACK mutants) to immobilized GST-ϵRACK in the presence and absence of phospholipid (PL) activators. Binding of D86A ϵPKC mutant to ϵRACK in the absence of PL activators was at least 2-fold greater than binding of either D86N or wild-type enzymes (Fig. 1, C and D). Binding of D86N and of wild-type enzyme to ϵRACK was significantly increased in the presence of PL, whereas binding of the D86A mutant to ϵRACK was not increased (Fig. 1, C and D). In the presence of an equal concentration of PL, there was less ϵRACK binding of D86N ϵPKC than either D86A or wild-type ϵPKCs. These results are consistent with the prediction that the ϵRACK-binding site in the D86A mutant is already available for binding to ϵRACK, whereas this site is masked in both wild-type or D86N ϵPKCs and becomes accessible for binding only upon activation. Rate of Translocation of ϵPKC and ϵPKC Mutants in Cells— The above in vitro studies of ϕϵRACK mutants and wild-type ϵPKC support our hypothesis that ϕϵRACK is involved in an intramolecular interaction that stabilizes the inactive closed state. To further test this hypothesis, we examined the rate of translocation of ϕϵRACK mutants and wild-type ϵPKC in cells in response to stimulation. We proposed that part of the process of translocation requires disruption of the intramolecular interaction between the ϕϵRACK site and the ϵRACK-binding site. Therefore, we expected that modulation of this intramolecular interaction should affect translocation rates of ϵPKC. To investigate this hypothesis, ϵPKC ϕϵRACK mutants were fused at their N termini to GFP, CFP, or YFP proteins and translocation was analyzed both by cell fractionation and by real-time imaging. In an in vitro kinase assay, we first confirmed that the GFP fusion proteins had similar catalytic activity. As seen in Fig. 2A, immunoprecipitated GFP-ϵPKC mutants phosphorylated myelin basic protein to a similar extent upon activation. We next confirmed that fusion of GFP to the ϵPKC mutants does not interfere with the binding of the enzymes to ϵRACK in vitro. Fig. 2B demonstrated a selective binding of wild type and the two GFP-ϵPKC mutants to GST-ϵRACK. We also confirmed that the wild-type and ϕϵRACK ϵPKC mutants were sensitive to activation by phorbol ester and that they translocated from the soluble to the particulate fraction of the cell upon activation. Translocation of the ϵPKC mutants was determined using two different cell lines, MCF-7 and CHO. CHO cells were stimulated for 10 min with 100 nm PMA (Fig. 2C). MCF-7 cells were stimulated with 10 nm PMA for 10 min (Fig. 2D), since stimulation of MCF-7 cells with higher doses of PMA caused a detachment of the cells. After treatment with PMA, cells were fractionated into soluble and particulate fractions, and GFP-ϵPKC was detected and quantified by Western blot analysis using anti-ϵPKC. Only GFP-ϵPKC fusion proteins (∼110 kDa) and not the endogenous ϵPKC (∼80 kDa) were detected when 20 ng of protein was loaded per lane, and all the mutants had a similar level of expression (Fig. 2, C and D). On PMA treatment, there was a greater increase in D86A ϵPKC in the particulate fraction than either D86N or wild-type ϵPKCs (Fig. 2, C and D). This is not due to PKC degradation; the total amount of ϵPKC was not changed upon activation. Therefore, GFP-ϵPKC ϕϵRACK mutants were catalytically active and responded to activation by PMA by translocating from the soluble to the particulate fraction of the cell. Using two different cell lines, we found th"
https://openalex.org/W2082221765,"HMGB-1/-2 are coregulatory proteins that facilitate the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of steroid receptor members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. We investigated the influence and mechanism of action of HMGB-1/-2 (formerly known as HMG-1/-2) on estrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERβ. Both ER subtypes were responsive to HMGB-1/-2 with respect to enhancement of receptor DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity in cells. Responsiveness to HMGB-1/-2 was dependent on the C-terminal extension (CTE) region of the ER DNA binding domain (DBD) and correlated with a direct protein interaction between HMGB-1/-2 and the CTE. Thus the previously reported higher DNA binding affinity and transcription activity of ERα as compared with ERβ is not due to a lack of ERβ interaction with HMGB-1/-2. Using chimeric receptor DBDs, the higher intrinsic DNA binding affinity of ERα than ERβ was shown to be due to a unique property of the ERα CTE, independent of HMGB-1/-2. The CTE of both ER subtypes was also shown to be required for interaction with ERE half-sites. These studies reveal the importance of the CTE and HMGB-1/-2 for ERα and ERβ interaction with their cognate target DNAs.

These studies reveal the importance of the CTE and HMGB-1/-2 for ERα and ERβ interaction with their cognate target DNAs. Nuclear hormone receptors comprise a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate gene expression through interaction with specific hormone response elements (HREs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DBD, DNA binding domain; ER, estrogen receptor; CTE, C-terminal extension; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DBD, DNA binding domain; ER, estrogen receptor; CTE, C-terminal extension; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. in target genes. The superfamily can be subdivided into: 1) classical steroid hormone receptors that typically interact with palindromic hexameric HREs as homodimers, 2) nonsteroidal or class II nuclear receptors for ligands such as thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, vitamin D, and fatty acids, that function primarily as heterodimers with RXR (retinoid X receptor) bound to direct repeat HREs, and 3) orphan receptors without known ligands that interact with HREs in various dimer and monomer configurations. The nuclear receptors are related through a common domain structure including conserved C-terminal ligand binding (LBD) and centrally located DNA binding domains (DBD), and a variable N-terminal domain that is required in many nuclear receptors for maximal transcription activity (Refs. 1Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar and 2Mangelsdorf D. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6062) Google Scholar, reviews). The DBD consists of a highly conserved core with two asymmetric zinc fingers and an ∼30 amino acid segment, termed the C-terminal extension (CTE) (Fig. 1A). Within the core DBD, α-helix 1 extends between the two zinc fingers and makes base specific contacts in the major groove of the HRE DNA. The second α-helix (helix 2) does not contact DNA but is important for the overall folding of the core DBD (3Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski L.P. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 4Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CTE is not conserved and adopts different structural motifs dependent on the class of nuclear receptor (6Khorasanizadeh S. Rastinejad F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 7Senkus Melvin V. Edwards D.P. Steroids. 1999; 64: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the CTE of different receptors does appear to share a functional role to stabilize the receptor-DNA complex by extending the protein-DNA interface beyond that of base-specific contacts made by the core DBD. The CTE of class II receptors (TR and VDR) forms an α-helix (helix 3) that projects across the minor groove between HRE half-sites, making extensive contacts along the phosphate backbone required for high affinity DNA binding and correct spacing with the RXR heterodimer (8Rastinejad F. Perlman T. Evans R. Sigler P. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 9Shaffer P.L. Gewirth D.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2242-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CTE of orphan receptors forms an extended loop conformation that makes base-specific contacts in the minor groove immediately 5′ of the HRE. A short peptide motif termed a “GRIP-box” (RXGRZP where X is any amino acid and Z is a hydrophobic residue) mediates interaction of orphan receptor CTEs with the minor groove (10Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. Miyoshi Y. Lazar M.A. Rastinejad F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Gearhart M. Holmbeck S.M.A. Evans R.M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CTE is also required for monomeric orphan receptor recognition of extended HRE half-sites through interaction with specific tri-nucleotide sequences in the minor groove just 5′ of the HRE (12Wilson T.E. Farner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 13Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although no structural information is available as yet, biochemical evidence indicates the CTE of steroid receptors also has a role in mediating high affinity DNA binding, by interacting with high mobility group proteins, HMGB-1 and HMGB-2, that function to facilitate receptor binding to cognate target DNA sites (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25115-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HMGB-1 and closely related HMGB-2 (formerly known as HMG-1 and -2) are members of a family of proteins that bind to duplex B-DNA with moderate affinity and little sequence specificity, but recognize and bind with high affinity to various distorted DNA structures. The nomenclature of HMGB-1 and -2 was adopted in 2001 to designate the canonical HMG “Box” DNA binding domains of these proteins (15Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to recognizing distorted DNA targets, the HMG Box also binds in the minor groove and induces sharp bends and distortions in linear duplex DNA. Thus by increasing the flexibility of DNA, HMGB-1/-2 are thought to have a general architectural role in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes involved in regulation of transcription (see reviews in Refs. 16Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 17Bustin M. Mol. Cell.

Although HMGB-1/-2 enhance DNA binding and transcription activity of all steroid hormone receptors analyzed, including receptors for progesterone (PR), androgen (AR), glucocorticoids (GR), mineralocorticoids (MR), and estrogen (ER-α), they have no influence on class II nuclear receptors (19Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell.

This selective effect on the steroid class of nuclear receptors is dependent on the CTE and correlates with a direct protein interaction between HMGB-1/-2 and the CTE that does not occur with class II receptors (14Senkus Melvin V.

Classens F. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HMGB-1/-2 also interacts with select groups of apparently unrelated sequence-specific transcription factors including p53 (22McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell.

The biological actions of estrogen are mediated by two estrogen receptor subtypes, ERα and ERβ, expressed from separate genes (29Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-Å. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4209) Google Scholar). The precise physiological role of the two ER subtypes is not yet well defined. Genetic ablation experiments in mice suggest the effects of estrogen on development and differentiation of female reproductive target tissues are mediated predominantly by ERα, whereas ERβ is more important in development of the ovary and perhaps other non-reproductive tissues (Ref. 30Crouse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar for review). ERα is a more potent transcriptional activator than ERβ in cell culture based assays (31McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and in cell-free transcription assays with chromatin templates containing multiple EREs (32Cheung E. Schwabish M.A. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERα and ERβ exhibit similar ligand-dependent transcriptional activities with naked DNA templates in vitro, indicating a role for chromatin in distinguishing the intrinsic activities of the two ERs (32Cheung E. Schwabish M.A. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Swapping experiments with the N-terminal regions of ERα and ERβ showed that this differential transcription potency both in vivo and in vitro is largely attributable to the N-terminal domain (31McInerney E.M. Weis K.E. Sun J. Mosselman S. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4513-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Cheung E. Schwabish M.A. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In tissues that express both ERs, a role for ERβ as an attenuator of ERα activity has been suggested (33Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lindberg M.K. Movérare S. Skrtic S. Gao H. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-Å. Ohlsson C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the core DBDs of ERα and ERβ are nearly identical with a 96% amino acid identity, ERα has been reported to have a higher affinity for estrogen response elements (EREs) than ERβ (35Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 36Loven M.A. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell.

Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and only ERα is capable of inducing a directed bend in ERE target DNA (38Schultz J.R. Loven M.A. Senkus Melvin V. Edwards D.P. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8702-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The differential ability to induce a directed bend in DNA has been attributed to the CTEs of ERα and ERβ (38Schultz J.R. Loven M.A. Senkus Melvin V. Edwards D.P. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8702-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the higher DNA affinity of ERα is not known, but is likely due to differences in the CTE or other regions outside the highly conserved core DBDs. The only member of the steroid class of nuclear receptors that has not been analyzed for interaction with HMGB-1/-2 is ERβ. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to further examine the role of the steroid receptor CTE in DNA binding and response to HMGB-1/-2 by performing a comparative analysis of ERα and ERβ. HMGB-1/-2 stimulated DNA binding and transcription activity of both ERα and ERβ and the CTE was required for physical interaction with and functional responsiveness to HMGB-1/-2. The CTE was also found to be responsible for the different intrinsic DNA binding affinities of ERα and ERβ independent of HMGB-1/-2. Unexpectedly, the CTE was also required for ERα and ERβ interaction with half-site EREs. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The expression vectors for GST-HMGB-1 and the ERα DBD (amino acids 198–288) have been described previously (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25115-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All other DNA-binding domain (DBD) vectors were constructed similarly by subcloning into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences), with an in-frame glutathione S-transferase (GST) for expression as a GST fusion protein. Chimeric DBDs were subcloned using “splicing by PCR overlap extension” as previously described (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25115-25124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and also inserted into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). DBD-GST fusion proteins were expressed in Bl21 bacterial cells and purified by a three-step procedure including affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose resins and thrombin cleavage to remove the GST moiety, DNA cellulose, and FPLC gel filtration by Superdex-30 chromatography. The final product was concentrated by an Amicon stirred cell concentrator (39Melvin V.S. Edwards D.P. Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. Humana Press, Totawa, NJ2001: 39-54Google Scholar). Purified DBD concentrations were determined by comparison to known concentrations of lysozyme on silver stain SDS gel electrophoresis. Relative DNA binding affinity differences were verified using independently purified DBDs, and protein concentrations were determined independently by Lowry assay and UV spectrophotometric quantitation methods using extinction coefficients of 13,260 for both ERα and ERβ DBDs. Production and Purification of Baculovirus-expressed Recombinant Proteins—Full-length human PR-A and HMGB-2 with N-terminal 6× histidine tags, and human ERα and ERβ with N-terminal FLAG sequences (DYCDDDDK) were expressed from baculovirus vectors in Sf9 insect cells as described (19Boonyaratanakornkit V.

For ERα and ERβ, estradiol 17β (200 nm) was added to Sf9 cell cultures to activate receptors during expression in vivo. His-tagged proteins were purified by nickel affinity resins as previously described for PR except that HMGB-2 was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT to exchange the β-mercaptoethanol for DTT and prevent oxidation (14Senkus Melvin V.

FLAG-tagged ERα and ERβ were purified as described (40Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) except that the receptors were eluted from anti-FLAG-affinity resins in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide, and 0.5 mg/ml insulin. The eluates were then dialyzed against elution buffer with higher Nonidet P-40 (0.2%) and lacking the FLAG peptide. Purified proteins were analyzed by silver stain or Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel electrophoresis and judged to be at ≥90% pure. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs for full-length ERα and ERβ were performed as described previously (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J. Biol.

Binding reactions were carried out for 30 min at 4 °C and samples were then electrophoresed at 4 °C on non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels (40:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) containing 2.5% glycerol impregnated in the gels, and 0.25× TBE (0.02 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02 m boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) as running buffer. Isolated DBDs used a binding reaction containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or Igepal CA630 (Sigma), and samples were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried, autoradiographedm and free [32P]DNA and [32P]DNA-protein complexes were quantitated by direct scanning of gels for radioactivity by a series 400 Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Data were expressed graphically as the normalized fraction of DNA bound versus DBD concentration. For EMSAs that exhibited two mobility ER-complexes, bound DNA was taken as the sum of both complexes. The fraction bound DNA was calculated as 1-(free DNA/(bound DNA+free DNA)). The data were normalized by setting the fraction of DNA bound at saturation to 1.0 and all other values were a fraction of 1.0 (41Hoopes B. LeBlanc J. Hawley D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation typically occurred at fraction bound values of 0.7 to greater than 0.9. All DNA binding curves were best fit to the following equation: y = ((1/Kd)·(xn))/(1 + ((1/Kd)·(xn)), where y is the normalized fraction DNA bound, x is the total DBD concentration, and n is the Hill cooperativity coefficient. The Hill cooperativity coefficient varied from n = 1 to 2, and the curves shown are the best fit of the data by Kaleidagraph using an R value = 1. The apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) was determined as the DBD concentration at which y = 0.5 from the average curve of at least three independent experiments. Double-stranded DNA fragments were end-labeled by Klenow fill-in of 5′-overhanging ends with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP: EREpal 5′-gatcGATTTGTCAAGGTCACTGTGACCTTGACACAGT-3′; TCA-EREhalf 5′-gatcGATTTGTCAAGGTCAGATGGCGGGCACAGTCTAG-3′; and TAG-EREhalf 5′-gatcGATTTGTAGAGGTCAGATGGCGGGCACAGTCTAG-3′. Mammalian Cell Transfection—CV-1 cells were transfected by an adenovirus-mediated method as previously described (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J. Biol.

The total amount of plasmid DNA in each transfection was equalized with empty vector (pBlueScript) such that each well received equimolar amounts of plasmid DNA. A pRSV-βGal plasmid was included in each transfection as an internal control for well-to-well variation in transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities with a Monolight 2010 luminometer as described previously (14Senkus Melvin V. Roemer S.C. Churchill M.E.A. Edwards D.P. J.

Luciferase values were corrected for variations in transfection efficiency by calculating luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios (LUC/βGAL). GST Pull-down Assays—Bacterial cell lysates expressing GST or GST-HMGB-1 were incubated in suspension with 25 μl of glutathione Sepharose beads in 500 μl lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) for 1h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and followed by washing in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). Receptor DBDs (1 μg), were added and incubated in suspension for 1 h (250 μl) at 4 °C. Beads were then pelleted, washed in binding buffer, and protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western immunoblot with a rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against peptide sequences in the ER DBDs (42Smith D.F. Lubahn D.B. McCormick D.J. Wilson E.M. Toft D.O. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2816-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HMGB Enhances the DNA Binding Affinity and Transcriptional Activity of ERβ—Although ERα and ERβ can activate many of the same target genes in response to estrogen, ERβ has been reported to exhibit a 3–4-fold lower affinity for EREs and as much as a 10-fold weaker transcriptional activity than ERα (31McInerney E.M.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether a difference in interaction with HMGB-1/-2 contributes to these distinct activities of ERα and ERβ. We previously found that HMGB-1 and -2 are functionally interchangeable with respect to stimulating the DNA binding affinity of steroid receptors in vitro and enhancing transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (19Boonyaratanakornkit V. Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Therefore, HMGB-1 and -2 were used interchangeably and are collectively referred to as HMGB in the remainder of this article. Receptor DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) by varying the concentration of receptors in the presence of a constant amount of 32P-labeled DNA probe. The DNA duplex fragment contains a consensus palindromic ERE based on the well characterized ERE in the vitellogenin gene (36Loven M.A. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that is recognized by human and other species of ER. As shown in Fig. 2 A and B, purified full-length ERα and ERβ bound to EREpal in a dose-dependent, saturable manner. Based on apparent dissociation constants (Kdapp) estimated from the ER concentration at half-maximal DNA binding, ERα bound to the EREpal with a 4-fold higher affinity than ERβ (Fig. 2B). This affinity difference is consistent with previous reports that ERα has a higher affinity for EREpal than ERβ (35Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19858-19862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 36Loven M.A. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell.

For both ERs, addition of HMGB significantly left-shifted the DNA binding curves (Fig. 2B), indicating an increase in binding affinity for EREpal. In the absence of HMGB, ERα and ERβ produced two protein-DNA complexes and both contained ERα or ERβ, respectively, as demonstrated by supershifts with ERα- or ERβ-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). The exact nature of the two mobility ER complexes is not known. Both complexes were obtained in the absence of HMGB, indicating that they do not represent ER-complexes containing and lacking HMGB. Because it is well accepted that ER preferentially binds to EREpal as a dimer, suggests the faster mobility complex contains an ER dimer, whereas the slower mobility complex contains a higher order ER oligomer (Fig. 2A). At low concentrations of ER (α and β), addition of HMGB stimulated the formation of both mobility complexes, but at high receptor concentrations, HMGB predominantly stimulated the slower mobility complex concomitant with a decrease of the faster mobility complex (Fig. 2A). Multiple mobility ER complexes have been reported previously, but the relevance of the different complexes to ER function is not known (36Loven M.A. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). HMGB was not retained as a stable component of the stimulated complexes, as they have the same mobility as the unstimulated complexes (Fig. 2A) and are not supershifted by HMGB antibodies (data not shown). Ternary HMGB complexes by EMSAs have not typically been detected with steroid receptors or other transcription factors, suggesting HMGB acts as"
https://openalex.org/W2048547613,"Gankyrin, a recently discovered oncoprotein, is a promising target for drug therapy because it is overexpressed in most hepatocellular carcinomas. Since gankyrin interacts with MAGE-A4, we made several MAGE-A4 mutants and assessed their effects on cell growth. We found that the C-terminal 107 amino acids of MAGE-A4 (MAGE-A4ΔN1) induced p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis. MAGE-A4ΔN1 increased the p53 protein level, but decreased the p21Cip1 transcript and protein levels. During apoptosis Bcl-xL was down-regulated and mitochondrial integrity was disrupted. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Miz-1 as a MAGE-A4ΔN1-binding protein. MAGE-A4ΔN1 was recruited through association with Miz-1 to the p21Cip1 promoter and down-regulated transcription of p21Cip1. In 293T cells and U-2 OS cells, full-length MAGE-A4 was processed to generate a C-terminal fragment of 104 amino acids with activities similar to MAGE-A4ΔN1. Processing was inhibited with a broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, but not by site-directed mutagenesis of aspartic acids in MAGE-A4, suggesting an indirect involvement of caspase(s) in the processing. The amount of the processed form was increased by exposure of cells to adriamycin. Transduction with a HIV Tat-MAGE-A4ΔN1 fusion protein suppressed anchorage-independent growth of gankyrin-overexpressing cells in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal fragment of MAGE-A4 induces apoptosis at least partly by binding to Miz-1, and that the fragment may be exploited as an anticancer agent. Furthermore, the finding that a C-terminal fragment with pro-apoptotic activity is generated from full-length MAGE-A4 after genotoxic stress in human cells suggests a novel function for MAGE-A4.

De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar). MAGE genes are highly expressed in various forms of cancer, but not in most healthy adult tissues except for the testis (2Forslund K.O. Nordqvist K. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MAGE genes encode tumor-specific antigenic peptides presented by HLA class I molecules to CD8+ T lymphocytes (3van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomoz P. Lurquin C. De Plaen E. van den Eynde B.

Despite recent reports that some members of the MAGE family play important roles in cell cycle control and apoptosis (6Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the physiological functions of MAGE proteins remain mostly unknown. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common cancers in the world, develops from transformed hepatocytes during the course of chronic liver diseases (7Okuda K J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When transformed hepatocytes expand in vivo, they encounter various microenvironmental stresses, such as hypoxia, decreased growth factor availability, and lack of nutrient supply, all of which activate apoptosis (8Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 9Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). In addition, activated oncogenes also trigger apoptosis (10Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22068) Google Scholar). Therefore, resistance to apoptosis is one of the essential alterations for development of HCCs. Gankyrin (also known as PSMD10 and p28) is an oncoprotein overexpressed in most HCCs (11Higashitsuji H.

Gankyrin binds to Cdk4 and counteracts the inhibitory function of the tumor suppressors p16INK4A and p18INK4C (14Tsai L.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3977-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis, gankyrin is overexpressed from the earliest stage of tumor development (15Park T.J. Kim H.S. Byun K.H. Jang J.J. Lee Y.S. Lim I.K. Mol. Carcinog. 2001; 30: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that gankyrin is a major player in cell cycle control and tumorigenesis in HCCs. The POZ domain/zinc finger transcription factor Miz-1 binds to the core promoter of the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1 gene (16Peukert K. Staller P. Schneider A. Carmichael G. Hanel F. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5672-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 17Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Although the p21Cip1 promoter is highly responsive to p53, both p53 and Miz-1 are necessary for up-regulation of p21Cip1 and cell cycle arrest upon UV irradiation (18Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V.

Activation of p53 induces either cell cycle arrest mediated by transcriptional activation of p21Cip1 or apoptotic cell death (9Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev.

The transactivation activity of Miz-1 has been shown to be inhibited by interaction with Myc (17Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and the recruitment of Myc to the p21Cip1 promoter by Miz-1 results in repression of p21Cip1 transcription, even in the presence of activated p53 (21Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Thus, Myc switches the p53-dependent response of cells from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. Previously, we have found that MAGE-A4 specifically interacts with gankyrin and suppresses its tumorigenic activity (22Nagao T. Higashitsuji H. Nonoguchi K. Sakurai T. Dawson S. Mayer R.J. Itoh K. Fujita J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, to further characterize the antitumorigenic activity of MAGE-A4 and to facilitate development of a therapeutic approach against HCCs, we made several mutants of MAGE-A4 and analyzed their effects on cell growth. We found that a C-terminal fragment of MAGE-A4 has strong pro-apoptotic activity, at least partly, by binding to Miz-1, and that a similar fragment is generated from full-length MAGE-A4 in human cells. Plasmids—Wild-type MAGE-A4 cDNA and mutant derivatives tagged with HA or FLAG cDNA, and gankyrin cDNA and Miz-1 cDNA tagged with HA cDNA were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pMKit-neo as previously described (11Higashitsuji H.

Point mutations were introduced into plasmid DNA by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The bicistronic pIRES-hrGFP-1a vector (Stratagene) was used to express human p53, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A4 mutants together with GFP. The pact-p53 plasmid expressing human wild-type p53 was kindly provided by Dr. S. Ishii, Tsukuba, Japan. A cDNA encoding 6 N-terminal histidines and the 11-amino acid protein transduction domain from the HIV tat protein (YGRKKRRQRRR) (23Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G.

Dowdy, La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture—Mouse NIH/3T3 cells and derivative GK-S25 cells overexpressing gankyrin, human U-2 OS cells, HuH-7 cells, PLC/PRF/5 cells, H1299 cells, HeLa cells, 293T cells, and monkey COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected with plasmid DNAs as described (22Nagao T.

For some experiments, cells were treated with the following chemicals (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or vehicle alone: adriamycin (0.1 and 1.0 μm), Z-VAD-FMK (20 and 50 μm), Ac-LDESD-CHO (50 μm), Z-SEVD-FMK (50 μm), and Z-LEHD-FMK (50 μm). The numbers of surviving cells were counted by the trypan blue dye exclusion method using a hemocytometer under a microscope. To assess the anchorage dependence of growth in vitro, 5 × 102 cells were incubated with recombinant proteins and assayed as previously described (22Nagao T. Higashitsuji H. Nonoguchi K. Sakurai T.

Statistical differences between sample means were calculated by analysis of variance, followed by the unpaired Student's t test. Western Blot Analysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Northern Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (11Higashitsuji H. Itoh K. Nagao T. Dawson S.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies were anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan), anti-SC35 antibody (Sigma Aldrich), anti-α-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p53 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), anti-His antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and anti-Bcl-xL antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexin, KY). Polyclonal antibodies were mouse anti-Miz-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-β-actin antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (DAKO, Kyoto, Japan) and anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO). Interaction of transiently expressed exogenous MAGE-A4 or its mutants with exogenous Miz-1 was examined by co-transfecting COS-7 or HeLa cells with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged MAGE-A4 or MAGE-A4ΔN1, FLAG alone, HA-tagged Miz-1, or HA alone in various combinations. Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (24Higashitsuji H. Higashitsuji H. Nagao T. Nonoguchi K. Fujii S. Itoh K. Fujita J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cellular DNA Content—Cells were harvested with 4 mm EDTA/PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma Aldrich). The DNA content of the cells was analyzed with a flow cytometer (EPICS XL; Beckmann Coulter, Tokyo, Japan). To selectively analyze cells expressing transfected cDNA, only cells manifesting a high level of GFP fluorescence was analyzed. TUNEL Assay—U-2 OS cells and HuH-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the C-terminal 107 amino acids of MAGE-A4 in the expression vector or vector alone using LipofectAmine Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 36 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then labeled by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The same field of cells was examined under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma Aldrich) staining and immunofluorescence. Measurement of Caspase Activities—Approximately 4 × 105 cells were used for measurement of caspase activities. Caspase-8- and caspase-9-like activities were measured using IETD-p-nitroanilide (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and LEHD-p-nitroanilide (MBL) as substrates, respectively. The fluorescence of the released p-nitroanilide was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—To assess mitochondrial membrane potential, H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1-IRES-hrGFP or vector alone. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated in the medium containing 500 nm of MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then trypsinized and resuspended in PBS. The red X-rosamine fluorescence of the GFP-positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence staining was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA) or anti-cytochrome c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (24Higashitsuji H. Higashitsuji H. Nagao T. Nonoguchi K. Fujii S. Itoh K. Fujita J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bound antibodies were reacted with FITC-linked anti-mouse and TRITC-linked anti-rabbit IgGs (Amersham Biosciences) and observed under a confocal laser microscope (Olympus). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Using the C-terminal 107 amino acids of MAGE-A4 as bait, a U-2 OS cell cDNA library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid method as described (22Nagao T. Higashitsuji H. Nonoguchi K. Sakurai T. Dawson S. Mayer R.J. Itoh K. Fujita J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Experiments—COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged Miz-1 and FLAG-tagged MAGE-A4ΔN1, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Higashitsuji H. Higashitsuji H. Nagao T. Nonoguchi K. Fujii S. Itoh K. Fujita J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out for 10 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors. 32P-labeled oligonucleotides spanning the site of the human p21Cip1 gene (-46 to -32) was used as a probe (21Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Reporter Assays—Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the -518 to +32 region of the p21Cip1 gene as a promoter were co-transfected with pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) and increasing amounts of plasmids expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 onto HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method. After 30 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Wild-type MAGE-A4 and Mutants Fused to HIV Tat Protein—The His-tagged Tat-fused proteins were expressed in and purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) as described (23Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3)pLysS cells from overnight culture were spun down and then sonicated in buffer Z (8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0). The supernatant of the centrifuged sonicate was loaded onto an Econocolumn (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) packed with a 3-ml Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Eluted proteins were then desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in PBS, aliquoted, and flash frozen in 10% glycerol, and stored at -80 °C. Bovine serum albumin passed through a PD-10 column in PBS was used as a control. Tumorigenicity in Nude Mice—12 female BALB/c Slc-nu/nu athymic mice (4 weeks old) were injected s.c with GK-S25 cells (8 × 106 cells each) suspended in PBS. The cells were pre-incubated either with 500 nm Tat-MAGE-A4ΔN1 or bovine serum albumin (six mice each) in PBS for 60 min, washed in PBS, and then injected. Tumor size was calculated by measuring the length, width, and thickness with calipers. This work was carried out under the Japanese Law Concerning the Care and Control of Animals, and has been approved by the Animal Research Committee, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University. Pro-apoptotic Activity of N-terminally Truncated MAGE-A4—MAGE-A4 directly interacts with gankyrin and suppresses its tumorigenic activity, although it shows no effect on cell cycle progression or apoptosis (22Nagao T. Higashitsuji H. Nonoguchi K. Sakurai T. Dawson S. Mayer R.J. Itoh K. Fujita J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10668-10674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). While investigating the effects of MAGE-A4 and its deletion mutants on cell growth, we noticed that a C-terminal fragment of MAGE-A4 (residues 211-317, MAGE-A4ΔN1) induced cell death (Fig. 1A). At 48 h after transfection, about 25% of U-2 OS cells expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 together with GFP were positively stained with PI. The effect was comparable to that of p53. As expected, the percentage of PI-positive cells expressing GFP and full-length MAGE-A4 (residues 1-317) or the N terminus of MAGE-A4 (residues 1-210) were not different from that expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1A). To assess whether MAGE-A4ΔN1 induced cell death by apoptosis, we measured the DNA content of cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, a significant increase in the percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA content was observed in U-2 OS cells expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 compared with those expressing full-length or N terminus of MAGE-A4 or GFP alone. The kinetics of the change in the DNA content of cells expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 was similar to that induced by p53 (Fig. 1C). At 45 and 60 h after transfection, 20-25 and 55-60%, respectively, of transfectants showed sub-G1 DNA content. Essentially similar results were obtained when MAGE-A4ΔN1 was expressed together with GFP in HuH-7 hepatoma cells (data not shown). We next examined the pro-apoptotic activities of the C termini of other MAGE-A family proteins structurally similar to MAGE-A4, i.e. MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, and MAGE-A12 (1Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar) in U2-OS cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, MAGE-A4ΔN1 showed the strongest pro-apoptotic activity among MAGE-A family members studied. When we performed TUNEL staining of HuH-7 cells after transfection with plasmids expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1, TUNEL positive HuH-7 cells displayed chromatin condensation (Fig. 1E). Significantly, more HuH-7 cells expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 were TUNEL positive compared with those transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these results demonstrated that MAGE-A4ΔN1 induces apoptosis in human cancer cells, while full-length MAGE-A4 does not. The apoptosis-inducing effects of various MAGE-A4 mutants were next examined by selectively analyzing U-2 OS transfectants bicistronically expressing GFP. As shown in Fig. 2, MAGE-A4ΔN1 induced apoptosis as efficiently as p53. Further deletion of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids from MAGE-A4ΔN1 decreased its pro-apoptotic activity, indicating that both N-terminal (residues 211-226) and C-terminal (residues 288-317) amino acids were essential for maximal activity. Induction of p53-dependent and p53-independent Apoptosis by MAGE-A4ΔN1—Most apoptotic mechanisms are dependent on caspase activities (25Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Science. 2003; 299: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK prevented apoptosis induced by MAGE-A4ΔN1 in U-2 OS cells (Fig. 3A). Two caspase-activating pathways that lead to apoptosis are well characterized, i.e. the caspase-8-activating pathway and the caspase-9-activating pathway (8Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 25Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Science. 2003; 299: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 26Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The former is initiated from cell surface death receptors, while the latter is triggered by various stress signals and involves changes in mitochondrial integrity. A significant increase in caspase-9 activity, but not caspase-8 activity, was detected in U-2 OS cells expressing MAGE-A4ΔN1 (Fig. 3B). Within the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, the ratio of Bcl-2 family death agonists to antagonists dictates the susceptibility of cells to an apoptotic stimulus (27Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 works as death antagonists either by preventing the release of mitochondrial caspase-activating factors such as cytochrome c or by sequestration and inhibition of caspases via interaction with APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1) (8Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 26Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 28Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When we examined the level of Bcl-2 family members in U-2 OS cells overexpressing MAGE-A4ΔN1, a decrease in the level of Bcl-xL, but no change in the levels of other Bcl-2 family members including Bax and Bid were observed (Fig. 3C and data not shown). The tumor suppressor p53 induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in many experimental systems and increases caspase-9 activity (9Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether p53 is involved in MAGE-A4ΔN1-induced apoptosis. We first determined the levels of p53 in U-2 OS cells after transfection with cDNAs expressing MAGE-A4 or its various mutants (Fig. 3D). Plasmids expressing luciferase were co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. An increase in the p53 protein level was observed in MAGE-A4ΔN1 transfectants. MAGE-A4ΔN1ΔC2 and MAGE-A4ΔN1ΔC3, which showed pro-apoptotic activities (Fig. 2B) also increased p53 levels. These findings are consistent with the notion that p53 is involved in the MAGE-A4ΔN1-induced apoptosis. p21Cip1 is known to protect cells from p53-induced cell death in addition to inhibiting cell proliferation (20Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3E, MAGE-A4ΔN1 decreased the levels of p21Cip1 transcript and protein. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that MAGE-A4ΔN1 induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. However, despite low p53 levels apoptosis was observed in MAGE-A4ΔN2 and MAGE-A4ΔN3 transfectants (Figs. 2B and 3D). Furthermore, MAGE-A4ΔN1 showed more potent pro-apoptotic activity than that expected from the up-regulated level of p53 (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that some of the observed pro-apoptotic activities of MAGE-A4ΔN1 are p53-independent. To assess this possibility, we examined the sensitivity of p53-defective cells, i.e. HuH-7 and PLC/PRF/5 hepatoma cell lines containing mutant p53 (30Hsu I.C. Tokiwa T. Bennet W. Metcalf R.A. Welsh J.A. Sun T. Harris C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 987-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and H1299 lung cancer cell line deficient in p53 (31Mitsudomi T. Steinberg S.M. Nau M.M. Carbone D. D'Amico D. Bodner S. Oie H.K. Linnoila R.I. Mulshine J.L. Minna J.D. Gazder A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar) to MAGE-A4ΔN1-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4B, MAGE-A4ΔN1 induced apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53. The p53-independent MAGE-A4ΔN1-induced apoptosis was also dependent on a caspase(s) (Fig. 4C), and was accompanied by increased caspase-9, but not caspase-8, activity (Fig. 4D). In H1299 cells, expression of MAGE-A4ΔN1 disrupted mitochondrial integrity (Fig. 4E), and induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that p53-independent apoptosis caused by MAGE-A4ΔN1 is mediated via a mitochondrial pathway. Interaction of MAGE-A4ΔN1 with Miz-1 Resulting in Suppression of the p21Cip1 Expression—To further characterize the pro-apoptotic activity of MAGE-A4ΔN1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using MAGE-A4ΔN1 as bait.

In vertebrates, different clades of serpins distribute predominantly to either the intracellular or extracellular space. Although much is known about the function, structure, and inhibitory mechanism of circulating serpins such as α1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) and antithrombin III (SERPINC1), relatively little is known about the function of the vertebrate intracellular (clade B) serpins. To gain a better understanding of the biology of the intracellular serpins, we initiated a comparative genomics study using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. A screen of the C. elegans genomic and cDNA databases revealed nine serpin genes, tandemly arrayed on chromosome V. Although the C. elegans serpins represent a unique clade (L), they share significant functional homology with members of the clade B group of intracellular serpins, since they lack typical N-terminal signal peptides and reside intracellularly. To determine whether nematode serpins function as proteinase inhibitors, one family member, srp-2, was chosen for further characterization. Biochemical analysis of recombinant SRP-2 protein revealed SRP-2 to be a dual cross-class inhibitor of the apoptosis-related serine proteinase, granzyme B, and the lysosomal cysteine proteinases, cathepsins K, L, S, and V. Analysis of temporal and spatial expression indicated that SRP-2 was present during early embryonic development and highly expressed in the intestine and hypoderm of larval and adult worms. Transgenic animals engineered to overexpress SRP-2 were slow growing and/or arrested at the first, second, or third larval stages.

Serpins have been identified in animals, plants, insects, and certain viruses (1Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.I. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 2Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). More recently, serpins have been detected in prokaryotes (3Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A search of genome data bases provides evidence for >500 serpins that are grouped into 17 clades (plus >10 unclassified orphans) based upon phylogenetic relationships (4Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In humans, ∼35 serpins have been identified. These serpins are distributed among nine clades (A-I), and most are secreted and function in the circulation or extracellular spaces. These serpins regulate proteinases involved in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement activation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. In contrast, serpins belonging to clade B reside predominantly intracellularly and have been implicated in regulating apoptosis, tumor progression, and metastasis (5Silverman G.A. Whisstock J.C. Askew D.J. Pak S.C. Luke C. Cataltepe S. Irving J.A. Bird P.I. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 301-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, their biological functions in terms of an intact organism have not been well defined. To date, no naturally occurring mutations with an identifiable phenotype have been identified in humans or rodents. Moreover, targeted mutagenesis studies in mice have revealed no overt phenotype (serpin b2) (6Dougherty K.M. Pearson J.M. Yang A.Y. Westrick R.J. Baker M.S. Ginsburg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or appear to be embryonic lethal (serpin b5) (7Zhang M. Hendrix M.J.C. Maspin. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2002: 96-116Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to develop a more tractable model to study intracellular serpin activity within the context of a whole organism. Data base analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome reveals the presence of several intracellular serpins (8Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bottomley S.P. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Proteins. 1999; 36: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Zang X. Maizels R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of these genes and the ease of genetic manipulations in this organism make it possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of serpin biochemistry within the context of a whole animal. As a first step, we identified and cloned nine serpin genes. Sequence analysis suggested that all of the nine are transcribed, but only five are likely to encode for functional proteinase inhibitors. Initial biochemical characterization of one family member, SRP-2, demonstrated that it functions as a dual, cross-class inhibitor of both serine and cysteine proteinases.

To determine whether SRP-2 played a role in C. elegans development, null mutants and transgenic animals overexpressing SRP-2 were generated. Whereas null mutants showed no overt developmental phenotype, animals overexpressing SRP-2 displayed severe developmental abnormalities characterized by slow growth, defective molting, and early (L1/L2) larval arrest/death. Although the mode of SRP-2 action is currently unknown, we hypothesize that SRP-2 plays a role in regulating proteinase activity during development and that an imbalance in the serpin/proteinase equilibrium has deleterious consequences during C. elegans development. cDNA Isolation and DNA Sequencing—First strand cDNA was prepared from total C. elegans RNA using Superscript™ II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The full-length srp-2 cDNA containing the putative open reading frame and the 5′/3′-UTR sequence was amplified using splice leader (SL1) sense (5′-TATATACTCGAGGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTG-3′) and srp-2, 3′UTR-specific antisense (5′-TATATACTCGAGCTTTATTTCTTCCAAAAAATATTCCGATC-3′) primers. An XhoI restriction site was included in the primers (underlined) to simplify cloning. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pBluescript®II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced using the automated DNA sequencing facility of the Mental Retardation Research Center, Children's Hospital (Boston, MA). Sequences were analyzed using MacVector 7.1 (Accelrys Inc., Princeton, NJ), ClustalW 1.8, and BLAST programs (Wormbase (available on the World Wide Web at www.wormbase.org/) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Construction of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins—A 1.1-kb cDNA fragment containing the complete coding sequence of SRP-2 was generated by PCR from the pBluescript®II KS plasmid containing the full-length srp-2 cDNA. The sense (5′-ATATGAATTCCCGACAATGTCCGATAACGC-3′) and antisense (5′-TATATACTCGAGTCAAGCATGAACCCCAAGG-3′) primers were designed to facilitate in-frame insertion into the bacterial expression vector, pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR product was digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI (sites underlined in primers), gel-purified, and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pGEX6P-1 vector. Recombinant clones were verified for intact srp-2 sequence and in-frame insertion by DNA sequencing. Purification of GST-SRP-2 Fusion Protein—The GST-SRP-2 fusion protein was batch-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) using a modification of a procedure previously described (10Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 ng of pGEX-SRP-2 plasmid was transformed into the competent Escherichia coli strain, BL21, and cultured overnight at 37 °C on LB plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were collected using 5 ml of LB broth and inoculated directly into a flask containing 1 liter of LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The bacteria were grown in a 37 °C shaker to an A600 of 0.5. The flask was cooled on ice for 3 min and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 500 μm. To reduce formation of inclusion bodies, induction was carried out at 25 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The frozen cell pellet was lysed by incubating in 60 ml of freshly made prep buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml lysozyme and a Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and transferred to a fresh tube containing 2 ml of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B. To facilitate the binding of the recombinant protein, the tube was gently shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g and washed twice in prep buffer and twice in PBST (10 mm phosphate buffer, 27 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). The GST-SRP-2 protein was eluted from the beads using three 1-ml washes of glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Protein concentration in the eluate was determined by Bradford analysis (Protein Assay Kit II; Bio-Rad), and protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis. Thermal Stability Assay—Aliquots of recombinant GST-SRP-2 protein (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) were incubated for 7 min at temperatures ranging from 25 to 75 °C. The solution was placed on ice for 1 min and centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see below). Enzymes, Inhibitors, and Substrates—Human cathepsin B (catB), catG, catL, and catS; human chymotrypsin; human neutrophil elastase; human kallikrein; human pancreatic trypsin; and human plasmin were purchased from Athens Research and Technology Inc. (Athens, GA). catK and -V were prepared as described (11Bromme D. Li Z. Barnes M. Mehler E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Bromme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Human granzyme B was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Rat granzyme B was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Craik (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Endoproteinase Glu-C (V8) was purchased from Worthington. Papain was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Mast cell chymase was a generous gift from Dr. Norman Schechter (University of Pennsylvania). Subtilisin A and urokinase-type plasminogen activator were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human caspases-3, -8, and -9 were purchased from A. G. Scientific, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Inhibitors (Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DEVD-FMK), Z-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-FMK (Z-IETD-FMK), Z-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-FMK (Z-LEHD-FMK), and Z-Val-Ala-Asp-FMK (Z-VAD-FMK)) were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products. Diisopropylfluorophosphate and acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-aldehyde were purchased from Calbiochem. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane (E64) were purchased from Sigma. Ecotin was a generous gift from Dr. Charles Craik. Enzyme substrates were purchased from Sigma (succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA), methoxy-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA, and d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA)), Bachem Bioscience, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA) (acetyl-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp-pNA (Ac-IEPD-pNA), H-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA (EGR-pNA), and succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Glu-pNA (Suc-AAPE-pNA)), Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) ((Z-Phe-Arg)2-R110) (Z-FR)2-R110)), and Enzyme Systems Products (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC), Ac-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asp-AFC (Ac-IEPD-AFC), Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-AFC (Ac-IETD-AFC), and Ac-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-AFC (Ac-LEHD-AFC)). Phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 27 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was used in enzymatic reactions with trypsin, plasmin, human neutrophil elastase, chymotrypsin, kallikrein, subtilisin A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and mast cell chymase. Cathepsin reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) was used with papain and catB, -K, -L, -S, and -V. Unique reaction buffers were used with catG (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 7.4), endoproteinase-Glu-C (V8) (25 mm ammonium carbonate (pH 7.8) or 50 mm Tris adjusted to pH 7.8 using H3PO4), caspases (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4), and granzyme B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20). Determination of Enzyme and Inhibitor Concentrations—The specific activity of granzyme B was determined as follows. Trypsin was active site-titrated using 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) (13Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Assuming 1:1 stoichiometry, the concentration of ecotin was standardized against the active site-titrated trypsin. Granzyme B was standardized against the active site-titrated ecotin, assuming 1:1 stoichiometry, using Ac-IEPD-pNA or Ac-IEPD-AFC as the substrate. Activities of the cysteine proteinases (catK, -L, -S, and -V) were determined by active site titration using E64 as previously described (14Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). The concentration of recombinant SRP-2 was determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit II), thermal stability (see above), and amino acid composition analysis by postcolumn ninhydrin dectection on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Instruments). Assays for Inhibition—Proteinase inhibitory activity of SRP-2 was determined by mixing enzyme and inhibitor in the appropriate buffer, incubating for 15 min at 25 °C, and measuring residual enzyme activity as previously described (10Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Residual enzyme activity was determined by measuring substrate hydrolysis over time (velocity) using either a THERMOmax (in the case of -pNA substrates) or fmax (in the case of -AFC and -R110 substrates) microplate readers (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For the UV-visible substrate, -pNA, a wavelength of 405 nm was used. For the fluorescent substrates, -AFC and -R110, the excitation/emission spectra were 390 nm/510 nm and 485 nm/538 nm, respectively. The concentrations of enzyme, inhibitor and substrate are listed in Table II and the buffers are listed above.

The inhibitor, SRP-2 (concentration range 0-50 nm), was incubated with the enzyme, granzyme B, for 15 min at 25 °C. The substrate, Ac-IEPD-AFC, was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. The velocity of substrate hydrolysis was measured using the fmax microplate reader. The partitioning ratio of the inhibitor-enzyme association was determined by plotting the fractional activity (velocity of the inhibited enzyme reaction/velocity of the uninhibited enzyme reaction) versus the initial ratio of the inhibitor to enzyme ([I]0/[E]0) (14Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). The x-intercept (i.e. the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI)) was determined by linear regression analysis. Enzyme Kinetics—The interaction of SRP-2 with human granzyme B was determined by the progress curve method (15Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Under these pseudo-first order conditions, a constant amount of enzyme (25 nm) was mixed with different concentrations of inhibitor (0-800 nm) and substrate (final concentration 100 μm). The rate of product formation was measured using the fmax microplate reader. Since the inhibition of human granzyme B is assumed to be irreversible over the course of the reaction, product formation is described as shown below, where the amount of product formation (P) proceeds at an initial velocity (vz) and is inhibited over time (t) at the following rate (kobs). P=vz/kobs×(1-e-kobst)(Eq. 1) For each combination of enzyme and inhibitor, a kobs was calculated by nonlinear regression of the data using Equation 1. A second order rate constant (k′) was determined by plotting a series of kobs versus the respective inhibitor concentration and measuring the slope of the line (k′ = Δkobs/Δ[I]). Since the inhibitor is in competition with substrate and the rate depends on the SI, the second order rate constant (k′) was corrected for the substrate concentration, SI of the enzyme and inhibitor, and the Km of the enzyme for the substrate in order to calculate the ka as shown. ka=k'×(1+[S]/Km)×SI(Eq. 2) The Km of human granzyme B for Ac-IEPD-AFC in granzyme B assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) was 585 μm. Complex Formation—SRP-2-granzyme B complexes were formed by incubating 9 μg of GST-SRP-2 protein with 0.5 μg of human granzyme B in granzyme B assay buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. The mixture components were separated by SDS-PAGE and higher molecular weight protein bands were visualized following staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. SRP-2-catV complexes were formed by incubating 1 μg of GST-SRP-2 with 50 ng of catV in cathepsin assay buffer for 3 min at 25 °C. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, complex bands were visualized by immunoblotting (see below). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblottng—Proteins were mixed with 2× gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), heated to 95 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The running buffer was 25 mm Tris-base, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3. Protein bands were visualized after staining in a solution containing 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid. For immunoblot detection, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C onto reinforced nitrocellulose (NitroPure, Osmonics Inc., Westborough, MA). The transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, and 190 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The immunodetection of SRP-2 was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-SRP-2 antibody diluted to 1:2000 as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted to 1:2000 as a secondary antibody. The immunoblot was visualized using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Matrix-associated Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-MS)—Human granzyme B (1 μg) was mixed with SRP-2 (25 μg) in granzyme B assay buffer (20 μl) for 15 min at 25 °C. For catV, 125 ng of enzyme was mixed with 6 μg of GST-SRP-2 in cathepsin assay buffer (20 μl) for 3 min at 25 °C. The mixture components were separated by MALDI-MS at the Wistar Protein Microchemistry Facility (Philadelphia, PA). Worm Strain and Culture Conditions—The wild-type worm strain used in this study was C. elegans Bristol (N2). Worms were routinely cultured at 25 °C on standard nematode growth medium agar plates (17Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) seeded with E. coli strain OP50 (Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC), available on the World Wide Web at biosci.umn.edu/CGC/CGChomepage.htm). Generation of the srp-2 promoter::gfp and srp-2::gfp Expression Constructs—A translational srp-2 promoter::gfp fusion gene was made by ligating a 6.3-kb genomic fragment, containing the first three exons of the srp-2 gene and 5.5 kb of the upstream promoter sequence in frame into the GFP expression vector pPD95.81. For the srp-2 overexpression construct, the 5.5-kb promoter region, the full-length (1.6-kb) srp-2 gene (minus the stop codon), and the 0.85-kb gfp fragment was cloned into the canonical expression vector pPD49.26. The gfp gene used in these experiments contained five engineered introns and the mutation S65C for enhanced expression and fluorescence, respectively. The plasmids pPD95.81 and pPD49.26 were a kind gift from Dr. Andrew Fire (Carnegie Institution of Washington, Baltimore, MD). Transgenic Animals Expressing srp-2 Promoter::gfp and srp-2::gfp Fusion Genes—To obtain germ line expression of the srp-2 promoter::gfp and srp-2::gfp fusion genes, appropriate plasmid DNA (100 ng/μl) was microinjected into the gonads of young adult hermaphrodites as previously described (18Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Most injected DNA exist as extrachromosomal arrays that are lost frequently during meiosis and mitosis. Thus, we also generated strains where the transgene was stably integrated into the C. elegans genome. Approximately 100 L4 larvae of a transgenic line carrying the extrachromosomal array of srp-2 promoter::gfp or srp-2::gfp were irradiated with γ rays from a 137Cs source (3500 rads). GFP-positive worms were transferred, in pairs, to 25 plates and allowed to grow for ∼10-12 days. Worms were harvested with 5 ml of M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42 mm Na2HPO4, 86 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and a small aliquot (50 μl) was transferred to 25 new plates with food. Following 4-5 days of growth, 150 GFP-positive worms (six from each plate) were cloned onto individual plates. Stable integrants were identified, 3 days later, by the presence of 100% GFP-positive worms on the plate. To remove background mutations, worms were backcrossed six times using the wild-type N2 males. Identification of Novel Serpin Genes in C. elegans—The availability of a complete sequence of the C. elegans genome prompted us and others to consider whether serpin genes were present in this organism. By mining genome data bases, Whisstock and colleagues (8Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bottomley S.P. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Proteins. 1999; 36: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) identified seven amino acid sequences bearing significant sequence homology to the archetypical serpin, α1-antitrypsin. In a similar report, Zang and Maizels (9Zang X. Maizels R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) confirmed electronically the presence of the seven serpin genes and provided evidence for an additional serpin sequence, bringing the total number to 8. These reports, however, were based on data obtained in silico, and no attempt was made to verify gene expression by cDNA cloning. To determine whether these serpin genes are expressed, we designed oligonucleotide primers specific to the eight serpin genes and performed reverse transcription-PCR on C. elegans total RNA. Appropriately sized (∼1.2-kb) cDNA fragments were amplified and subcloned into the plasmid, pBluescript (pBS). Sequence analysis confirmed amplification of full-length cDNAs corresponding to the GENEFINDER-predicted genes, C05E4.1, C05E4.3, C03G6.18, C03G6.19, F20D6.4, F09C6.5, and F09C6.4. However, only a partial cDNA corresponding to F20D6.3 was isolated. To determine whether additional serpin genes were present in the C. elegans genome, newer versions of the C. elegans WORMPEP (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_elegans/wormpep/) and genomic data bases were rescreened using the BLAST algorithm (available on the World Wide Web at www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nph-Blast_Server.html) and the human SERPINB4 as the query sequence. In addition to the eight serpins previously reported, we identified an additional serpin sequence, Y32G9A.4, expanding the total number of C. elegans serpins to nine. Furthermore, a screen of Yuji Kohrara's EST data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/c-elegans/html/CE_INDEX.html) identified yet another previously unidentified sequence, yk411c9, mapping to the YAC, Y32G9A. The yk411c9 sequence was identical to the nucleotide sequence of serpin, Y32G9A.4, except for a single base pair change, converting a Met → Val, in the P1 position of the RSL. Although this change appears to be conservative, it could alter the proteinase-inhibitory profile of the serpin. Further scrutiny is required to determine if this single nucleotide difference represents a simple cloning artifact, a sequencing error, a polymorphism, or the presence of two genes. The proximal hinge region and the distal “serpin signature motif” of the RSL in the C terminus of a se"
https://openalex.org/W1989862231,"Programmed cell death is regulated in response to a variety of stimuli, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, that can mediate cell cycle arrest through p21/Waf1 and apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Bax equilibrium and caspases. Neuronal cell apoptosis has been reported to require p53, whereas other data suggest that neuronal cell death may be independent of p53. Comparison of wild type PC12 to a temperature-sensitive PC12 cell line that depresses the normal function of p53 has permitted investigation of the importance of p53 in a variety of cell functions. This study examined the role of p53 in trophic factor withdrawal-mediated apoptosis in both naïve and differentiated PC12 cells. Our data show that as PC12 cells differentiate they are more poised to undergo apoptosis than their undifferentiated counterparts. Survival assays with XTT (sodium 3′-1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid) and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) demonstrated that lack of p53 is initially protective against apoptosis. The window of protection is about 20 h for naïve and 36 h for differentiated cells. Apoptosis involved caspases 3, 6, and 9. However, caspase 3 activation was absent in cells lacking p53, concomitant with the delayed apoptosis. When the expression of caspase 3 was silenced with interference RNA, wild type PC12 cells revealed a morphology and biochemistry similar to PC12[p53ts] cells, indicating that caspase 3 accounts for the observed delay in apoptosis in p53 dysfunction. These results suggest that p53 is important, but not essential, in factor withdrawal-mediated apoptosis. Parallel pathways of caspase-mediated apoptosis are activated later in the absence of functional p53. Programmed cell death is regulated in response to a variety of stimuli, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, that can mediate cell cycle arrest through p21/Waf1 and apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Bax equilibrium and caspases.

Parallel pathways of caspase-mediated apoptosis are activated later in the absence of functional p53. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a conserved mechanism that is strictly regulated and specifically activated in response to a wide variety of stimuli such as ultraviolet radiation (1Lu X.

In addition, up-regulation of p53 activates mediators of apoptosis, such as caspase 3 (23Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Campenot R.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1021-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although primary cell culture is a powerful tool to study signal transduction, PC12 cells contain a more homogeneous population, develop a faithful neuronal phenotype, and are available in large amounts for biochemical study. Moreover, our laboratory has produced a stably transfected PC12 cell line (29Hughes A.L. Gollapudi L. Sladek T.L. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37829-37837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) carrying a retroviral, temperature-sensitive plasmid vector that overexpresses a conformationally inactive p53 pool that abrogates the normal function of p53 at the non-permissive temperature (30Sladek T.L. Jacobberger J.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1305-1313PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, comparison of wild type PC12 to the temperature-sensitive PC12 cell line, allows investigation of the importance of p53 in a variety of cell functions, including differentiation. PC12[p53ts] cells respond to NGF similarly to PC12 cells and differentiate into the neuronal phenotype; however, PC12[p53ts] cells fail to activate p21/WAF1 and lack cell cycle arrest (29Hughes A.L. Gollapudi L. Sladek T.L. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37829-37837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PC12 cells, without exposure to NGF, are dependent on serum, and withdrawal of serum initiates apoptosis (31Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). After about 7-10 days of NGF treatment, PC12 cells terminally differentiate into a neuronal phenotype, become dependent on NGF, and undergo apoptosis after NGF withdrawal even in the presence of serum (31Mesner P.W. Winters T.R. Green S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1669-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus trophic factor withdrawal allows a 2-fold approach toward studying different aspects of apoptosis: (a) serum withdrawal in naïve PC12 cells and (b) NGF withdrawal in terminally differentiated, neuronal-like PC12 cells. Trophic factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis is a relevant approach toward programmed cell death, because it mimics what happens, for example, in the dysfunctional nervous system as trophic factor production is compromised, contributing to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (31Mesner P.W.

The fundamental pathways of apoptosis have been delineated in several cell types. Trophic factor withdrawal serves as a stress factor on the mitochondria, which influences cytochrome c release, Bcl-2/Bax equilibrium (38Deckwerth T.L. Easton R.M. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 152: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (39Cande C. Cohen I. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Larochette N. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These events activate cysteine-dependent, aspartate-specific proteases (caspases) that act as effectors and executioners of apoptosis (40Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor protein p53 is upstream of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein (41Vekrellis K. McCarthy M.J. Watson A. Whitfield J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. Development. 1997; 124: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bax has an opposing effect on Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic, mitochondrial protein (41Vekrellis K. McCarthy M.J. Watson A. Whitfield J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. Development. 1997; 124: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In apoptotic cells Bax overcomes the protective role of Bcl-2, leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria (42Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar). Procaspase 9, cytochrome c, and Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor-1) (42Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar) form a complex called the apoptosome (43Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6273) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, procaspase-9 undergoes autocatalysis to yield an active caspase 9 that activates caspase 3 (43Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6273) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 3 cleaves cytoplasmic filaments, nuclear proteins, and enzymes responsible for DNA metabolism and repair, thus leading to programmed cell death (44Vaughan A.T. Betti C.J. Villalobos M.J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because programmed cell death follows an orchestrated sequence of events, temporal markers of apoptosis occur in stages (45Cooray S. Best J.M. Jin L. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Nakano H. Shinohara K. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 310: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Early apoptosis coincides with subtle membrane disruptions, leading to a change of topology in the bilayer, so that phosphatidylserines that mostly reside in the cytoplasmic leaflet can also be detected in the outer leaflet (47Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). The annexin V assay uses this concept to detect apoptotic cells in early stages. Caspase 3 activation is used as a middle marker of apoptosis downstream of caspase 9 activation (44Vaughan A.T. Betti C.J. Villalobos M.J. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Late in the apoptotic pathway, DNA fragmentation is observed (48Baxter G.D. Collins R.J. Harmon B.V. Kumar S. Prentice R.L. Smith P.J. Lavin M.F. J. Pathol. 1989; 158: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All of these assays were used in this study. The role of p53 in neuronal cell apoptosis remains controversial, because some groups have demonstrated that p53 participates in programmed cell death (49Morrison R.S. Kinoshita Y. Johnson M.D. Guo W. Garden G.A. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 50Alves Da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol.

This study tested the hypothesis that p53 is involved in trophic factor withdrawal-mediated apoptosis in naïve and differentiated PC12 cells. We report here that p53 is needed for early apoptosis but that a delayed apoptosis occurs even in the absence of p53. Terminally differentiated PC12 cells underwent apoptosis more quickly and shared the same requirement for p53. RNAi silencing of caspase-3 mimicked the p53 temperature-sensitive cells in both naïve and terminally differentiated cells, thus implicating this pathway in early apoptosis. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Exponentially dividing PC12 cells, PC12[vec], or PC12[p53ts] cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as described previously (25Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4861) Google Scholar, 30Sladek T.L. Jacobberger J.W. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1305-1313PubMed Google Scholar) and supplemented with 15% serum (10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, Invitrogen), l-glutamine (final solution concentration: 4 mm, Sigma), 10 IU penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.025 μg/ml Amphotericin B (last three were added as 6 ml of antibiotic/antimycotic from Invitrogen, #15240-062, into 500 ml of final solution). PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. The experiments were carried out at the non-permissive temperature of 38.5 °C. Under “Results” the PC12[p53ts] cells were compared with the PC12[vec] cells, and the results for the wild type PC12 cells were not shown for simplicity. Differentiation was achieved by placing PC12, PC12[vec], or PC12[p53ts] cells in a poly-l-ornithine-coated Petri dish in the presence of 15% serum and NGF (2 nm) for 7 days to obtain 7-day differentiated cells or for 14 days to obtain terminally differentiated cells. To ensure maximum bioavailability, NGF and serum were replaced every 2 days. Induction of Apoptosis—In the case of naïve cells, serum was removed by washing the media four times in PBS (pH 7.4) and once in serum-free media (DMEM without serum but with l-glutamine and antibacterial/antimycotic). The cells were then placed in the incubator at 38.5 °C with 10% CO2. Apoptosis was induced in 7-day differentiated cells or terminally differentiated cells by washing the cells three times in PBS, pH 7.4, and once in serum-free media. Next the cells were placed in 1% serum without NGF and 10 μg/ml anti-NGF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min (in the incubator at 38.5 °C with 10% CO2) and then placed in 1% serum without NGF. The cells were then placed in the incubator at 38.5 °C with 10% CO2 for various time points. Western Blotting—Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, harvested with SDS lysis buffer (5% SDS, 0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol), sonicated, and spun at 15,000 × g. Lysate containing 50 μg of protein per lane (BCA protein quantification, Pierce) was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-p53 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal caspase 9 p35 (H-170, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, and rabbit polyclonal caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibody incubation was performed in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (Tris base saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) and followed by staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), diluted at the recommended ratio, in TBS-T and 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Washing with TBS-T was performed between all steps. All Western blots were visualized using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and Fuji XR film. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Lanes were scanned in a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 to quantitate relative levels. Trypan Blue Survival Assay—Cells were suspended in 0.4% trypan blue in PBS (pH 7.4), and 200 cells were counted. The cells that excluded the blue dye and had a well defined cellular outline were scored as live. Cells that did not exclude the dye were considered dead. The percentage of live cells in the total number of cells was plotted and averaged over at least three times. XTT Survival Assay—XTT (sodium 3′-1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid), a yellow tetrazolium salt, is cleaved by the mitochondrial dehydrogenase in metabolically active cells to form an orange formazon dye. The formazon dye was measured in an optimal spectrophotometric range of 450 to 500 nm with a Tecan Genios plate reader. All assays were performed in 96-well tissue culture plates coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-ornithine. Aliquots of 103-104 cells in 100 μl were plated per well with an Eppendorf repeat pipettor and allowed to adhere overnight. For survival assays, cells were washed four times with serum-free DMEM and then incubated in 100 μl of the serum-free DMEM with varying concentrations of NGF for varying time periods. All cells were kept at 38.5 °C with an atmosphere of 10% carbon dioxide. Then 50 μl of XTT was added to give a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, and absorbance was measured multiple times over a 4- to 20-h period thereafter. All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times with assays performed in triplicate. Annexin V Staining—A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V assay was used as a sensitive method of membrane disruption detection utilizing a fluorescent microscope according to a modified Oncogene Science protocol. Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-ornithine-coated tissue culture plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and stained live in respective culture medium with 10 μl of Media Binding Reagent (Oncogene Science) followed by addition of 1.25 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate per 5 × 105 cells. The cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, washed five times with PBS, and submerged in 500 μl of cold PBS. Next, 10 μl of propidium iodide were added, and the sample was placed in the dark and promptly analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Plates were photographed immediately at 20 times magnification with a Nikon F9 camera on a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope. The propidium iodide is a cell-impermeable dye that is excluded from cells, unless they are necrotic. TUNEL Assay—The TUNEL assay uses an enzyme (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) to add biotinylated nucleotides to the strand breaks found in the DNA of apoptotic cells. Two types of TUNEL assay were used: a microscopic qualitative assay and a quantitative assay that utilized a plate reader (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Qualitative, microscopic TUNEL assay was performed by the manufacture's protocol. Briefly, naïve, 7-day differentiated, or terminally differentiated PC12 or PC12[p53ts] cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated slides, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and washed with PBS. The cells were then covered with Cytonin (Trevigen), washed with PBS twice, treated with the quenching solution (methanol with 3% H2O2), washed in PBS, and placed in labeling buffer (Trevigen). Next, the sample was incubated in the labeling reaction mixture containing TdT deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (Trevigen), cobalt, TdT enzyme, and labeling buffer. The reaction was quenched in Stop Buffer, washed in PBS, covered in strep-horseradish peroxidase solution, washed in PBS, and placed in diamidobenzidine solution. Finally, the sample was washed several times in PBS, counterstained in Methyl Green, and visualized by light microscopy. Quantitative TUNEL assay was performed on ∼2 × 104 cells per well of a 96-well plate. Washed cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, washed, dried with 100% methanol, washed, treated with proteinase K, and washed with PBS. The remaining procedure was identical to the qualitative TUNEL up to the strep-horseradish peroxidase step, after which the samples were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Next, 100 μl/well of TACS™-sapphire dye (Trevigen) were added. The reaction was stopped with 500 μl/well of 2 n HCl, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a Genios Tecan plate reader. Caspase Activity—Cell lysate (50 μg of protein, by BCA assay) was added to the colorimetric caspase substrate, containing the p-nitroaniline (pNA) moiety that upon cleavage by activated caspase absorbs at 405 nm (CaspACE assay, Promega), and was measured in a Genios Tecan multifunctional, multichannel fluorometric plate reader. A z-VAD-FMK inhibitor, which inhibits all caspases, was used to confirm that caspase was being measured. In some instances, a specific inhibitor was used to confirm the specificity of the reaction. Colorimetric caspase substrates and inhibitors were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and included the following: caspase 2 (substrate: Ac-VDVAD-pNA and inhibitor: Ac-VDVAD-FMK), caspase 3 (inhibitor Ac-DEVD-FMK), caspase 6 (substrate: Ac-VEID-pNA and inhibitor: Ac-VEID-FMK), caspase 8 (substrate: Ac-LETD-pNA), and caspase 9 (substrate: Ac-LEHD-pNA and inhibitor: Ac-LEHD-FMK). A fluorometric caspase 3 assay was purchased from Promega, and experimental procedures are similar to the colorimetric caspase 3 substrate analysis. Live cell caspase 3 activity was studied in situ with a fluorescently labeled, cell-permeable caspase substrate/inhibitor that binds irreversibly to active caspase 3 and produces a detectable fluorescence (Serological Corp., Norcross, GA; formerly Intergen). The company's protocol was followed, and the fluorescent level read at 535 nm (excitation 485 nm) in a Tecan Genios plate reader. Preparation and Transfection of siRNA—The caspase 3 sequence (accession number NM_012922) was used in a BLAST 2 search to rule out sequence homologies to other peptides in the rat genome. Candidate sequences for siRNA were designed by the following rules, as recommended by the manufacturer (Xeragon, Germantown, MD): (a) the DNA target sequence was at least 100 bp from the 3′ and from the 5′ end of the DNA sequence; (b) the length of the siRNA was 21 nucleotides with a GC content between 45-55%; and (c) a dTdT was designed for the 3′ overhang. Two non-overlapping sequences with these criteria were purchased from Xeragon with a 3′-fluorescein, 6-carboxyfluorescein. The first target DNA sense strand from the 5′ position was designed against nucleotide 192 of the caspase 3 target DNA: 5′-UGGUACCGAUGUCGAUGCAdTdT-3′-fluorescein. The second target DNA sense strand from 5′ position was designed against nucleotide 390 of the caspase 3 target DNA: 5′-CGGACCUGUGGACCUGAAAdTdT-3′-fluorescein. The transfection of the siRNA was performed when cells were undergoing serum deprivation or NGF withdrawal according to the recommended protocol using a TransMessenger system (Qiagen). Generally, transfection efficacy of about 50% was obtained in naïve cells and about 40% in differentiated cells, determined by fluorescent microscopy. Statistics—Student's t test or ANOVA was done as indicated. Student's t test was calculated to determine significance (p < 0.05; 95% confidence level). When the same cell line (e.g. PC12[p53ts]) were treated and compared, a paired t test was calculated. When different cell lines were compared (e.g. PC12[vec] to PC12[p53ts]) after the same treatment and at the same time point, a Student's t test was carried out to establish a 95% confidence interval: p < 0.05). Statistical treatments were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 2.01), San Diego, CA. Differences between means were examined using one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post-hoc comparison. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. All results are presented as mean ± S.D. Data were graphed using SigmaPlot 2000 or Microsoft Excel. Lack of Functional p53 Protects against Serum or Factor Withdrawal-induced Apoptosis in PC12 Cells—Control PC12 cells were compared with the PC12[p53ts] cells that lack a functional p53 pool to determine whether lack of functional p53 protects the naïve PC12 cells against serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Trypan blue survival assays in naïve cells showed that, after serum withdrawal, 50% of naïve PC12 cells lost viability after 25 h, and 90% had died after about 84 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, 50% of PC12[p53ts] cells survived after 70 h, and 90% of cell death was not reached until ∼120 h after serum withdrawal. This"

In addition to the large number of genes, limited processing of these proteins by a variety of enzymes enhances the complexity of the total spectrum of chemokine variants. We have recently shown that the native chemokine CXCL10 is processed at the C terminus, thereby shedding the last four amino acids. The present study was performed to elucidate the mechanism in vivo and in vitro and to study the biological activity of this novel isoform of CXCL10. Using a combination of protein purification and mass spectrometric techniques, we show that the production of C-terminally truncated CXCL10 by primary keratinocytes is inhibited in vivo by a specific inhibitor of pro-protein convertases (e.g. furin) but not by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases. Moreover, CXCL10 is processed by furin in vitro, which is abrogated by a mutation in the furin recognition site. Using GTPγS binding, Ca2+ mobilization, and chemotaxis assays, we demonstrate that the C-terminally truncated CXCL10 variant is a potent ligand for CXCR3. Moreover, the inverse agonist activity on the virally encoded receptor ORF74 and the direct antibacterial activity of CXCL10 are fully retained. Hence, we have identified furin as a novel chemokine-modifying enzyme in vitro and most probably also in vivo, generating a C-terminally truncated CXCL10, which fully retains its (inverse) agonistic properties.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Google Scholar). Their action is primarily achieved through ligand-specific activation of seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors expressed on target cells. In addition to the large number of genes encoding chemokines, processing of these proteins by (a limited number of) enzymes increases the complexity of chemokine signaling. Besides the large body of evidence on chemokine processing by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (CD26) (2Van Damme J. Struyf S. Wuyts A. Van Coillie E. Menten P. Schols D. Sozzani S. De Meester I. Proost P. Chem.

Apart from a range of biological effects on chemokine receptor activation, processed chemokines occasionally gain very unexpected, sometimes not even chemokine receptor-related, activities (9Zhang K.

In general, alterations at the N terminus down-regulate chemokine receptor potencies and are therefore considered important mechanisms to modulate inflammatory responses. Several naturally occurring truncations of chemokines have been identified from which it is still unknown which system is involved in their formation. Interestingly, several of these represent C-terminal truncations, as in the case of CXCL7 (11Ehlert J.E. Petersen F. Kubbutat M.H. Gerdes J. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6338-6344Google Scholar, 12Ehlert J.E. Gerdes J. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4975-4982Google Scholar) and CCL20 (13Schutyser E. Struyf S. Menten P. Lenaerts J.P. Conings R. Put W. Wuyts A. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4470-4477Google Scholar). One specific C-terminal truncation of CXCL7, found in platelets, involves the removal of the last two amino acids. In contrast to intact CXCL7, this form has potent antibacterial activity (10Krijgsveld J. Zaat S.A. Meeldijk J. van Veelen P.A. Fang G. Poolman B. Brandt E. Ehlert J.E. Kuijpers A.J. Engbers G.H. Feijen J. Dankert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20374-20381Google Scholar), pointing to a role central role of the C-terminal amino acids in the innate immune activity of this chemokine. For the chemokine receptor CXCR3 three ligands are known (CXCL9, -10, and -11). The CXCR3 receptor is highly expressed on activated T-lymphocytes and CXCR3+ T-cells have been implicated in several pathological conditions. For example, CXCR3 and its ligands are involved in allograft rejection (14Hancock W.W. Lu B. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Faia K. King J.A. Smiley S.T. Ling M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Exp.

Phys. 1998; 110: 183-196Google Scholar). In the skin, expression of CXCR3 targeting chemokines by keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells contributes to the influx of T-lymphocytes (17Flier J. Boorsma D.M. Bruynzeel D.P. Van B.P.

Pathol. 2001; 194: 397-404Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that the CXCR3 ligands also possess direct antibacterial activity (19Cole A.M. Ganz T. Liese A.M. Burdick M.D. Liu L. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 623-627Google Scholar), suggesting a role for these chemokines in the innate immune response. All three CXCR3 ligands are sensitive to N-terminal truncation by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (20Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29839-29845Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that native CXCL10 that is produced upon stimulation of primary human keratinocytes with interferon-γ is partially processed to a CXCL10 molecule that lacks the last four C-terminal amino acids (22Hensbergen P.J. Der Raaij-Helmer E.M. Dijkman R. Der Schors R.C. Werner-Felmayer G. Boorsma D.M. Scheper R.J. Willemze R. Tensen C.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4992-4999Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to identify the enzymatic system responsible for the in vivo cleavage of CXCL10 and to determine the biological activity of this novel CXCL10 variant using several different biological assays. We demonstrate that furin can cleave CXCL10 in vitro and that an inhibitor of pro-protein convertases (e.g. furin) prevents processing of CXCL10 in vivo. We therefore identify furin as a novel chemokine-processing enzyme. The resulting CXCL10 variant retains full (inverse) agonistic activities. Materials—Human CXCL9, -10, and -11 and murine CXCL10 were obtained from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Human CXCL11 and CXCL10 were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Purified furin and the pro-protein convertase inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone were purchased from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland). Porcine pancreas carboxypeptidase B was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Recombinant human IFN-γ 1The abbreviations used are: IFN-γ, interferon γ, CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ORF, open reading frame; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PC, pro-protein convertases. and TNF-α were from Strathmann Biotech GmbH (Hannover, Germany). Poros 50 R2 was obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). DEAE-dextran (chloride form) was obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Invitrogen, fetal bovine serum was purchased from Integro B. V. (Dieren, The Netherlands) and penicillinstreptomycin was from BioWhittaker Europe (Verviers, Belgium). pNF-κB-Luc was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA.) Cell Culturing and Stimulation—Keratinocytes were obtained from human foreskin and grown in single cell suspensions in low calcium (0.1 mm) serum-free medium (keratinocyte-SFM, Invitrogen) as described earlier (22Hensbergen P.J. Der Raaij-Helmer E.M. Dijkman R. Der Schors R.C. Werner-Felmayer G. Boorsma D.M. Scheper R.J. Willemze R. Tensen C.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4992-4999Google Scholar). The culture of primary human dermal fibroblasts was established as described earlier (23Ponec M. Weerheim A. Kempenaar J. Mulder A. Gooris G.S. Bouwstra J. Mommaas A.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 348-355Google Scholar). To induce chemokine expression, cells were stimulated with 2000 units/ml human rIFN-γ (keratinocytes) or 500 units/ml human rIFN-γ + 500 units/ml human rTNFα (fibroblasts), for 6 h. Following this stimulation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to MCDB153 medium (Invitrogen) and allowed to secrete chemokines for 18 h at 37 °C. Application of Proteinase Inhibitors in Keratinocyte Cultures—Human keratinocytes were cultured and stimulated as described above. After stimulation and washing of the cells, keratinocyte-derived chemokines were produced in the presence of either 25 μm decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone or 20 μg/ml Marimastat. Purification of CXCR3-targeting Chemokines—Supernatants from chemokine expressing cells were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1. The column was subsequently washed with 5 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.1) containing 0.35 m NaCl. This was followed by elution of heparin-binding proteins using 2 ml of 1.5 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.1). Chemokines were further purified using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 2.1 × 250 mm Nucleosil C-18 column (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Proteins were eluted using a continuous gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile (in 0.02% HCl) over 60 min and collecting 1-min fractions. In Vitro Processing and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Chemokines—Recombinant chemokines at a concentration of 2 μm were incubated with furin (5 units/ml) alone, or in combination with carboxypeptidase B (0.5 units/ml) in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.6) at 37 °C for 3 h. To establish the time course of furin-mediated cleavage of human CXCL10, recombinant CXCL10 (0.5 μm) was incubated with 0.1 units of furin in 20 μl of 100 mm HEPES and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.6, for 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 30, and 60 min at 37 °C. After digestion, chemokines were desalted using Poros 50 R2, packed in a pipette tip. Peptides were eluted in 60% acetonitril/0.02% HCl and measured by MALDI-MS (Reflex, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) using dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix. To determine kinetic parameters of CXCL10 conversion by furin, different concentrations of CXCL10 were incubated with 0.1 units of furin and incubated for 15 min. The ratio of the abundance of the intact and the cleaved forms was measured by MALDI-MS and used to calculate the amount of substrate converted. Data were subsequently fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For large scale production of C-terminally truncated CXCL10, in vitro digestions were carried out using 25 μg recombinant CXCL10 using 10 units of furin in combination with 0.3 units of carboxypeptidase B, and used this material in several bioassays. As a control, intact recombinant CXCL10 was treated identically, though without the enzymes. GTPγS Binding—CXCR3-expressing CHO cells (24Tensen C.P. Flier J. Raaij-Helmer E.M. Sampat-Sardjoepersad S. Van Der Schors R.C. Leurs R. Scheper R.J. Boorsma D.M. Willemze R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 716-722Google Scholar) were scraped in their medium, pelleted, and resuspended in GTPγS binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were kept on ice for 20 min and subsequently sonicated (2 × 15 s, with 2-min interval). Large cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 200 × g. Cell membranes were pelleted from the supernatant at 48,000 × g and resuspended in GTPγS binding buffer and incubated (1 μg) for 20 min at 30 °C with 1 μm GDP in a total volume of 200 μl. Following incubation with various concentrations of chemokines for 10 min at 30 °C, membranes were incubated with 0.3 nm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by filtering the membranes through a GF/B filter (Whatman) using ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7), pH 7.4). Filters were transferred to counting vials and membrane-bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation in a Wallac 1410. Ca2+ Mobilization—Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured as described previously (24Tensen C.P. Flier J. Raaij-Helmer E.M. Sampat-Sardjoepersad S. Van Der Schors R.C. Leurs R. Scheper R.J. Boorsma D.M. Willemze R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 716-722Google Scholar). In brief, CHO cells stably transfected with human CXCR3 were loaded with 1 mm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl esther (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Upon receptor stimulation, fluorescence recordings were made in a continuously stirred 1-ml cuvette at 37 °C using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Lawrenceville, NJ). Chemotaxis—Human peripheral blood T-cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy donors and stimulated with IL-2 (100 units/ml) and PHA (1 mg/ml) to induce CXCR3 expression, as described previously (24Tensen C.P. Flier J. Raaij-Helmer E.M. Sampat-Sardjoepersad S. Van Der Schors R.C. Leurs R. Scheper R.J. Boorsma D.M. Willemze R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 716-722Google Scholar). Chemotaxis of these cells toward chemokines was studied using a Transwell assay starting with 5 × 106 cells/100 μl for each individual assay. ORF74 Constitutive Activity—The cDNA of HHV-8-encoded ORF74 (GenBank™ accession number U71368 with a silent G-to-T mutation at position 927 (a gift from Dr. T. W. Schwartz)) was inserted into pcDEF3 (A gift from Dr. J. A. Langen) after PCR amplification. COS-7 cells were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with pcDEF3-ORF74 or pcDEF3 (mock) and pNF-κB-Luc using the DEAE-dextran method. After transfection, cells were seeded in 96-well white plates (Costar, Corning, NY) in serum-free culture medium in the presence of indicated ligands. 48 h after transfection, cells were assayed for NF-κB-driven luciferase expression. Luminescence was measured in a Wallac Victor (PerkinElmer). Antibacterial Activity—Radial diffusion assays (RDAs) were performed as previously described (19Cole A.M. Ganz T. Liese A.M. Burdick M.D. Liu L. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 623-627Google Scholar), using Escherichia coli ATCC 054 and Listeria monocytogenes EGD. The underlay consisted of 1% agarose and 1:100 dilution of trypticase soy broth in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 × 106 bacteria. Within the solidified agarose, a series of 3-mm diameter wells were punched and 5 μl of chemokines were added. Plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C to allow peptide diffusion. The underlay was then covered with overlay (6% trypticase soy broth agar and 1% agarose in H2O), and the plates were allowed to solidify. Antimicrobial activity was determined as a clear zone around the well after 16-h incubation at 37 °C, and are represented in radial diffusion units: (diameter of clear zone in millimeters – well diameter) × 10. Production of CXCL10 by IFN-γ-stimulated Primary Human Keratinocytes—We have previously shown that stimulation of human keratinocytes with IFN-γ induces the production of the CXCR3 targeting chemokines CXCL9, -10, and -11 (24Tensen C.P. Flier J. Raaij-Helmer E.M. Sampat-Sardjoepersad S. Van Der Schors R.C. Leurs R. Scheper R.J. Boorsma D.M. Willemze R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 716-722Google Scholar). Following heparin affinity chromatography these chemokines can be purified by reversed-phase chromatography (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, upon mass spectrometric analysis of HPLC-purified keratinocyte-derived CXCL10, we found two different molecules of CXCL10, one complete form (1–77) and a C-terminally truncated form (1–73) that lacks the last four amino acids Lys-Arg-Ser-Pro (Fig. 1B). The sequence -Lys70-Glu-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-Ser-Pro77 (KER- SKRSP) found in the C-terminal part of human CXCL10 contains a consensus sequence (Arg-Xaa-(Lys/Arg)-Arg-Xaa) for the pro-protein convertase furin. This tempted us to speculate that human CXCL10 is processed in vivo by furin convertase. In analogy with other systems (e.g. insulin and neuropeptides), additional trimming to serine by a carboxypeptidase would yield fully processed CXCL10-(1–73). To explore the possibility that CXCL10 is processed by such a system, we first treated IFN-γ-stimulated keratinocytes with the cell permeable pro-protein convertase inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone and determined the form of CXCL10 produced by these cells. As predicted, the production of CXCL10-(1–73) was almost completely inhibited by decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (Fig. 1C). It has recently been shown that several chemokines are substrates for matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (3McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Google Scholar, 25Van Den Steen P.E. Proost P. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Blood. 2000; 96: 2673-2681Google Scholar). Several of these MMPs are activated upon cleavage by furin (26Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that inhibition of furin could have indirectly inhibited the production of CXCL10-(1–73) by preventing activation of MMPs. We therefore also treated IFN-γ-stimulated keratinocytes with the broad range MMP inhibitor Marimastat (20 μg/ml). This treatment did not have any effect on the relative amounts of CXCL10-(1–77) and CXCL10-(1–73) that were produced by these cells (Fig. 1D). To exclude the possibility that the appearance of CXCL10-(1–73) in the medium of IFN-γ stimulated keratinocytes was an artifact of culturing conditions, we also cultured keratinocytes in medium (Defined SFM, Invitrogen) that did not contain bovine pituitary extract. After stimulation with IFN-γ these cells produced similar amounts of CXCL10-(1–73) as shown in Fig. 1B. In Vitro Cleavage of Human CXCL10 with Furin and Carboxypeptidase B—To directly demonstrate that human CXCL10 is a substrate for furin, we performed in vitro digestions with commercially available human CXCL10. This CXCL10 contains an extra N-terminal methionine (Met-CXCL10-(1–78)). We first treated a 2 μm solution of Met-CXCL10-(1–78) with 5 units/ml of furin at 37 °C for 3 h and compared this with CXCL10 left at 37 °C without furin. The mass of Met-CXCL10-(1–78) is 8773 Da (Fig. 2A, Table I). After treatment with furin, the mass of the recombinant CXCL10 shifted to 8589 Da (Fig. 2B, Table I). This matches with a Met-CXCL10-(1–76) molecule lacking the last two amino acids Ser-Pro, resulting from cleavage after the dibasic sequence Lys-Arg preceding these two C-terminal amino acids. This is exactly as would be expected from furin-mediated cleavage of CXCL10. Upon treatment of the furin processed CXCL10 with the basic specific carboxypeptidase B in vitro (0.5 units/ml), this molecule was further processed to Met-CXCL10-(1–74) with a mass of 8305 Da (Fig. 2C). This matches with the removal of the basic amino acids Lys-Arg, the two C-terminal amino acids of CXCL10 after treatment with furin (Table I). Intact human CXCL10 was insensitive to treatment by carboxypeptidase B alone (data not shown). Altogether, these data show that sequential treatment of CXCL10 with furin followed by a basic specific carboxypeptidase results in the formation of CXCL10 lacking the last four amino acids.Table ICharacterization of intact and furin cleaved CXCR3 targeting chemokinesChemokineAAaAA, amino acids.Theoretical mass (Da)Experimental mass (Da)Intact+Furin+Furin+CPBbCPB, carboxypeptidase B.Intact+Furin+Furin+CPBbCPB, carboxypeptidase B.Human Met-CXCL10788773.58589.38304.98773.88588.98305.5 CXCL10 (R72M)778617.38617.58617.5 CXCL91031172111722See Fig.5 CXCL11738303.08303.68303.3Mouse Met-CXCL10788828.68660.38376.08828.38660.38375.7a AA, amino acids.b CPB, carboxypeptidase B. Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Furin-mediated Cleavage of Human CXCL10 —To determine the time dependence of the furin-mediated cleavage of human Met-CXCL10 in vitro, 0.5 μm solutions of human Met-CXCL10 were incubated with 5 units/ml of furin at 37 °C for different periods of time. MALDI-MS was used to determine the relative amount of Met-CXCL10-(1–78) and Met-CXCL10-(1–76). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, cleavage was completed within 1 h of incubation with furin. In addition, the concentration dependence of the conversion rate of CXCL10 was determined (Fig. 3B). This analysis revealed a Km of 5 μm. A Mutation in the Furin Consensus Site Prevents Cleavage of Human CXCL10 —A cDNA encoding the human CXCL10 protein has long been used as a template for production of human CXCL10 protein (27Luster A.D. Unkeless J.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1985; 315: 672-676Google Scholar). This predicted protein, however, differs from that identified on the basis of mass spectrometric analysis of the native protein (22Hensbergen P.J. Der Raaij-Helmer E.M. Dijkman R. Der Schors R.C. Werner-Felmayer G. Boorsma D.M. Scheper R.J. Willemze R. Tensen C.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4992-4999Google Scholar), because it contains a methionine at position 72 instead of an arginine (CXCL10 R72M). A commercially available variant of recombinant human CXCL10 has this methionine at position 72 (PeproTech) and therefore has the C-terminal sequence -Lys-Glu-Met-Ser-Lys-Arg-Ser-Pro. Because this sequence does not comply with the furin consensus sequence shown above, we predicted that this recombinant human CXCL10 is not sensitive to furin cleavage. Upon treatment of this mutant recombinant protein with furin, we indeed found that it was not processed (Table I). This confirms that the arginine at position 72 is essential for furin-mediated cleavage of human CXCL10. CXCL10 Production in Cytokine-stimulated Primary Fibroblasts—Unlike other pro-protein convertases, furin is widely expressed in different cells and tissues. To determine whether processing of CXCL10 is keratinocyte specific or also occurs in another cell type, we stimulated primary human dermal fibroblasts with IFN-γ and TNF-α at concentrations that have previously been shown to highly induce mRNA levels of the CXCR3 targeting chemokines in these cells (28Tensen C.P. Flier J. Rampersad S.S. Sampat-Sardjoepersad S. Scheper R.J. Boorsma D.M. Willemze R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 167-172Google Scholar). Following heparin affinity chromatography, chemokines were purified using reversed phase chromatography (Fig. 4A). Mass spectrometric analysis of a CXCL10-containing fraction (indicated with a bar in the chromatogram), showed that also in these cells CXCL10 was (partially) processed to a molecule with a mass of 8173 Da (Fig. 4B), corresponding to CXCL10-(1–73). In contrast to keratinocyte-derived CXCL10, however, most of the fibroblast produced CXCL10 was intact (1–77). In addition, masses corresponding to N-terminally truncated CXCL10-(3–77) and CXCL10-(3–73) were identified, most probably reflecting N-terminal processing of CXCL10 by dipeptidylpeptidase IV. In addition to CXCL10, we identified masses matching CCL5-(1–68) and CCL5-(3–68) in this sample (Fig. 4B), the latter most probably representing the dipeptidylpeptidase IV processed form of CCL5 (20Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1865-1872Google Scholar). The identity of CCL5 was confirmed by sequence analysis of a tryptic fragment of this protein (EYFYTSGK, amino acids 26–33 of CCL5). No masses were identified that would match with furin-mediated cleavage of CCL5, which is in agreement with the fact that CCL5 does not contain a furin consensus sequence. Furin-mediated Cleavage of Other CXCR3-targeting Chemokines—In contrast to human CXCL10, human CXCL9 and -11 do not contain the furin consensus sequence Arg-Xaa-(Lys/Arg)-Arg, although they contain many basic residues in their C-terminal region. As it has been shown that also proteins containing sequences that do not fully fit the consensus sequence can be substrates for furin, we also incubated 2 μm solution of recombinant human CXCL9 and -11 with 5 units/ml furin at 37 °C for 3 h. This demonstrated that human CXCL11 is not a substrate for furin (Table I). On the other hand, human CXCL9 was cleaved at five different positions in the C-terminal part of the molecule, all after a basic amino acid residue (Fig. 5). Under identical conditions used for the complete processing of human CXCL10 (Fig. 2), however, human CXCL9 was only partially processed. Close inspection of the protein sequence of CXCL10 from species other than human showed that the furin consensus sequence is highly conserved. Mouse CXCL10 for example, contains the C-terminal furin consensus sequence (in bold) Ser-Gln-Lys-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-Ala-Pro, suggesting it could also be processed after the second dibasic site. In agreement with this, we found that upon treatment with furin, the mass of recombinant mouse Met-CXCL10 shifted from 8828 to 8660 Da (Table I). This corresponds to the loss of the C-terminal amino acids Ala-Pro. No other masses were identified in the mouse CXCL10 treated with furin, showing that the other di-basic sequence in the C terminus of this CXCL10 (see above) is not a substrate for furin. Activation of CXCR3—The ability of the novel CXCL10 variant to activate CXCR3 was tested using three different bioassays. First, Met-CXCL10 stimulated GTP binding to Gα in CXCR3-transfected CHO cells was determined using a GTPγS binding assay (Fig. 6A). This revealed that Met-CXCL10-(1–74) retained full activity on CXCR3. Similar results were obtained in Ca2+ mobilization in CXCR3-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 6B) and chemotaxis of primary human T-cells (Fig. 6C). Overall, the above results show that the agonistic properties of Met-CXCL10-(1–78) and -(1–74) for CXCR3 are similar, indicating that the C-terminal part of CXCL10 is not essential for proper CXCR3 activation. Inverse Agonism of ORF74 —The genomes of several viruses contain sequences that show a high similarity with chemokine receptors. The Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (human herpesvirus 8), for example, contains a gene (ORF74) encoding a seven-transmembrane receptor that shows the highest similarity with human CXCR1, 2 and 3. This viral receptor shows a high level of constitutive activity, which is most probably causally related to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (29Yang"

SHPS-1 also contributes to cell-cell communication through association with CD47. Although functional alteration of SHPS-1 is implicated in cellular transformation, the role of the CD47-SHPS-1 interaction in carcinogenesis has been unclear. A soluble SHPS-1 ligand (CD47-Fc) has now been shown to bind to Melan-a non-tumorigenic melanocytes but not to syngeneic B16F10 melanoma cells. Treatment of B16F10 cells with 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which prevents N-glycan processing, restored the ability of SHPS-1 derived from these cells to bind CD47-Fc in vitro, indicating that aberrant N-glycosylation of SHPS-1 impairs CD47 binding in B16F10 cells. CD47-Fc inhibited the migration of Melan-a cells but not that of B16F10 cells. However, a monoclonal antibody that reacts with SHPS-1 on both Melan-a and B16F10 cells inhibited the migration of both cell types similarly. CD47 binding induced proteasome-mediated degradation of SHPS-1 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-independent manner. Furthermore, overexpression of SHPS-1 reduced the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and this effect was reversed by CD47 binding. These results suggest that CD47 binds to and thereby down-regulates SHPS-1 on adjacent cells, resulting in inhibition of cell motility.

Various adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of mammalian cells, including members of the integrin receptor and cadherin families and of the immunoglobulin superfamily, have been characterized. These proteins are fundamental to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, and their dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration.

The cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, which bind and activate the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine-phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (1Kharitonenkov A.

The extracellular region of this protein comprises three Ig-like domains, of which the most amino-terminal Ig V-like domain associates with the ligand CD47 (9Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J.

Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Google Scholar). CD47 and SHPS-1 appear to constitute a cell-cell communication system (the CD47-SHPS-1 system) that contributes to a variety of physiological processes, including phagocytosis of red blood cells by macrophages (13Oldenborg P.A.

SHPS-1 negatively or positively regulates intracellular signaling initiated either by tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors for growth factors or by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins (18Cant C.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39833-39839Google Scholar), we recently showed that this protein plays an important role both in integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and in cell migration. In addition, studies with dominant negative or loss-of-function mutant proteins have established SHP-2 as a signaling component essential for cell adhesion and migration as well as cytoskeletal organization (22Yu D.H.

Expression of SHPS-1 has been shown to be down-regulated in subsets of human leukemic myeloid cells (10Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Bühring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Google Scholar), human breast cancer tissue (27Oshima K. Machida K. Ichigotani Y. Nimura Y. Shirafuji N. Hamaguchi M. Matsuda S.

Furthermore, forced expression of SHPS-1 suppressed the transformed phenotype of glioblastoma cells (29Wu C.J. Chen Z. Ullrich A. Greene M.I. O'Rourke D.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3999-4010Google Scholar) as well as inhibited both anchorage-independent growth of v-Src-transformed cells (28Machida K. Matsuda S. Yamaki K. Senga T. Thant A.A. Kurata H.

Ichigotani Y. Nimura Y. Shirafuji N. Hamaguchi M. Matsuda S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3929-3933Google Scholar). Together, these observations have implicated SHPS-1 in cellular transformation. It has remained unclear, however, whether (and, if so, how) functional alteration of the CD47-SHPS-1 system contributes to carcinogenesis. To investigate the possible role of CD47-SHPS-1 interaction in malignant cellular transformation, we have now characterized and compared SHPS-1 proteins expressed in the mouse nontumorigenic melanocyte Melan-a (30Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Google Scholar) and melanoma B16F10 (31Fidler I. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242: 148-149Google Scholar) cell lines. Our results show that SHPS-1 expressed on the surface of B16F10 cells is impaired in the ability to bind a soluble ligand (CD47-Fc fusion protein) as a result of aberrant N-glycosylation. Whereas CD47-Fc substantially inhibited the motility of Melan-a cells, it had no such effect on that of B16F10 cells, suggesting that resistance to this inhibitory mechanism might underlie the highly metastatic potential of B16 melanoma. Expression Vectors, Antibodies, and Reagents—The cDNA encoding a mutant SHPS-1 (SHPS-1-4F), in which all four tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region (Tyr408, Tyr432, Tyr449, and Tyr473) are replaced by phenylalanine, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the full-length mouse SHPS-1 cDNA (6Yamao T.

The wild-type and mutant SHPS-1 cDNAs were inserted separately into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pTracerCMV vector (Invitrogen). The full-length mouse CD47 cDNA was excised from pIAP328 (32Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Google Scholar) and subcloned into pTracerCMV.

Hanks (Vanderbilt University). The pcDNA3 vector encoding Myc-tagged mouse SHP-2 was provided by H. Ohnishi (Gunma University). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SHP-2 (5Fujioka Y. Matozaki T.

Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T. Hosooka T. Akira S. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6721-6731Google Scholar) were described previously. A rat mAb to CD47 (MIAP301), normal rat IgG, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mAb PY20 to phosphotyrosine were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit polyclonal antibodies to SHPS-1 and to FAK were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; a mouse mAb to tubulin was from Sigma; goat antibodies to rat IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to human IgG, and the Fc fragment of human IgG were from Cappel; Cy2-conjugated goat antibodies to rat IgG were from Amersham Biosciences; and goat antibodies to the Fc fragment of human IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The mAb 9E10 to the Myc tag and mAb 12CA5 to the HA tag were purified from the culture supernatants of mouse hybridoma cells. Tunicamycin, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and chloroquine were purchased from Sigma. MG132 was from Calbiochem. Cells and Transfection—Melan-a and B16F10 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and containing or not containing 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (200 ng/ml) (Sigma), respectively. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing H-Ras (CHO-Ras cells) (33Katakura Y. Seto P. Miura T. Ohashi H. Teruya K. Shirahata S. Cytotechnology. 1999; 31: 103-109Google Scholar) were provided by S. Shirahata (Kyushu University). CHO cells stably expressing either wild-type mouse SHPS-1 (CHO-SHPS-1-WT cells) or the SHPS-1-4F mutant (CHO-SHPS-1-4F cells) as well as CHO-Ras cells stably expressing wild-type mouse CD47 (CHO-Ras-CD47 cells) were generated as described previously (34Takada T. Matozaki T. Takeda H. Fukunaga K. Noguchi T. Fujioka Y. Okazaki I. Tsuda M. Yamao T. Ochi F. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9234-9242Google Scholar) with the use of Zeocin (500 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) as a selection reagent. The resulting CHO-derived lines and parental CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of CHO cells (∼4 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) was performed with the use of a LipofectAMINE Transfection kit (Invitrogen) or a CellPhect Transfection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of a Soluble SHPS-1 Ligand—To prepare a CD47-Fc fusion protein, we first obtained by PCR a cDNA that encodes the Fc portion of human IgG1, as described previously (35Liu Y.C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Google Scholar). The PCR product was then digested with SpeI and NotI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pEFneo vector (Invitrogen), yielding pEFneoFc76. A cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of mouse CD47 (amino acids 1–161) was amplified by PCR with pIAP328 as the template, the sense primer 5′-TAATGAATTCGAGATGTGGCCCTTGGCGGC-3′, and the antisense primer 5′-TAGCACTAGTCTTTTCATTTGGAGAAAACCACGAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pEFneoFc76. The resulting construct was digested with EcoRI and NotI, and the released fragment was then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pTracerCMV, yielding pTracerCMV-mCD47-Fc. CHO-Ras cells were transfected with this latter plasmid and subjected to selection with Zeocin as described above. Several cell lines that produced the CD47-Fc fusion protein were identified by immunoblot analysis of culture supernatants with antibodies to human IgG, and were cultured in αMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The CD47-Fc protein was then purified from the culture supernatants by column chromatography on HiTrap Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of SHPS-1 and the binding of CD47-Fc to cells were examined by flow cytometry. In brief, cells were detached from culture dishes by treatment with 0.01% EDTA and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells (0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106 in 0.1 ml of PBS) were then incubated for 30 min on ice with either a mAb to SHPS-1 (10 μg/ml), normal rat IgG (10 μg/ml), CD47-Fc (20 μg/ml), or the Fc fragment of human IgG (20 μg/ml), after which they were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice with appropriate secondary antibodies (10 μg/ml). After washing twice with PBS, the stained cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were processed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assessed with a Boyden chamber assay. In brief, polyvinylpyrrolidine-free polycarbonate filters (pore size, 8 μm; Neuroprobe) coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) were placed over the lower wells of a Boyden multiwell chemotactic chamber that had been filled with serum-free MEM. Cells (1.5 × 105 in 0.2 ml of serum-free MEM) were added to each of the upper wells. The chamber was placed in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and incubated for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Cells that had migrated through the filter were fixed in methanol, washed with PBS, and exposed to Giemsa stain (Nakalai Tesque) for 15 s. The number of migrated cells was counted in at least six fields with a microscope fitted with a grid eyepiece and at a total magnification of ×200. Immunoprecipitation, Lectin Binding, and Immunoblot Analysis— Cells in one 60-mm dish were lysed on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of beads; Amersham Biosciences). The supernatants were also incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 with agarose beads conjugated to Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (20 μl of beads; EY Laboratories). Both types of beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and the associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Deglycosylation of SHPS-1 in Vitro—N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed from SHPS-1 by N-glycosidase F digestion. Prior to digestion cell lysates were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then incubated with N-glycosidase F (40 units/ml; Roche Applied Science) for 12 h at 37 °C. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between independent means was assessed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Differential N-Glycosylation of SHPS-1 in Mouse Nontumorigenic Melanocytes and Malignant Melanoma Cells—Immunoblot analysis revealed that, among various cell types examined, Melan-a cells, an immortal line of pigmented melanocytes, and mouse macrophages expressed the largest amounts of SHPS-1 (data not shown). The Melan-a line was derived from normal epidermal melanoblasts and is nontumorigenic (30Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Google Scholar). Furthermore, Melan-a cells are syngeneic with the B16 melanoma line and its sublines, thus providing a control for studies of the cellular and molecular basis of melanoma malignancy (30Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Google Scholar). Melan-a cells and highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells (31Fidler I. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242: 148-149Google Scholar) were found to express similar amounts of SHPS-1. However, the electrophoretic mobility of this protein in the latter cells was reduced compared with that apparent in the former cells (Fig. 1A). This difference in electrophoretic mobility was abolished by prior exposure of the cells to tunicamycin, which prevents the attachment of N-glycans to cellular proteins (Fig. 1A, left panel). Treatment with the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin, which blocks the processing of N-linked high mannose-type oligosaccharides, also abolished this difference (Fig. 1A, right panel). SHPS-1 derived from the two cell lines, when digested with recombinant N-glycosidase F, exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that SHPS-1 is differentially N-glycosylated in Melan-a and B16F10 cell lines. Electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions revealed that SHPS-1 expressed in both cell lines migrated as two major bands (Fig. 1C). The faster migrating forms exhibited higher affinity for G. nivalis agglutinin lectin, which specifically recognizes terminal mannose residues (36Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 728-734Google Scholar), than did the slower migrating forms (Fig. 1C). Given that terminal mannose residues are usually exposed by folding intermediates of type I glycoproteins in the early steps of N-glycan processing, these faster migrating forms may correspond to immature SHPS-1. The reduced ability of the slower migrating forms of SHPS-1 to bind to G. nivalis agglutinin lectin indicated that they had undergone further N-glycan processing and represent the mature protein that is transported to the cell surface. A substantial difference in electrophoretic mobility of SHPS-1 between the two cell types was apparent selectively for the slower migrating forms. Furthermore, the lower mobility form of SHPS-1 in B16F10 cells bound to G. nivalis agglutinin lectin with much lower affinity than did that in Melan-a cells. These results suggested that SHPS-1 on the surface of the two cell types possesses distinct N-glycan structures. Impaired Binding of a Soluble SHPS-1 Ligand to B16F10 Melanoma Cells—Differences in the N-glycan structure of SHPS-1 might be expected to affect binding affinity for the ligand CD47. We therefore next examined whether the binding of a soluble version of this ligand, a recombinant CD47-Fc fusion protein (the extracellular domain of mouse CD47 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG), differed between B16F10 and Melan-a cells. Flow cytometry with a mAb that reacts with the extracellular portion of mouse SHPS-1 revealed no marked difference in the surface expression of SHPS-1 between the two cell types (Fig. 2A). Although CD47-Fc bound significantly to Melan-a cells, however, this SHPS-1 ligand exhibited virtually no binding to the surface of B16F10 cells (Fig. 2B). SHPS-1 derived from Melan-a cells, but not that from B16F10 cells, bound CD47-Fc in vitro (Fig. 3A). In contrast, SHPS-1 from the two cell lines after treatment with 1-deoxymannojirimycin bound similar amounts of CD47-Fc (Fig. 3B). SHPS-1 from both cell lines exposed to tunicamycin also bound CD47-Fc to similar extents (Fig. 3C). Sequencing of the products generated by reverse transcription and PCR analysis of SHPS-1 mRNA from the two cell lines revealed no differences in the coding sequence for the amino-terminal Ig V-like domain of SHPS-1 (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the impaired binding of CD47-Fc by B16F10 cells results, at least in part, from aberrant N-glycosylation of SHPS-1. Ligation of SHPS-1 Inhibits Cell Migration—To investigate the possible relation between the impairment in CD47 binding to SHPS-1 on B16F10 cells and the malignant phenotype of these cells, we examined the biological consequences of CD47-SHPS-1 interaction. Given the role of SHPS-1 in cytoskeletal reorganization (20Inagaki K. Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T. Hosooka T. Akira S. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6721-6731Google Scholar, 21Yamao T. Noguchi T. Takeuchi O. Nishiyama U. Morita H. Hagiwara T. Akahori H. Kato T. Inagaki K. Okazawa H. Hayashi Y. Matozaki T. Takeda K. Akira S. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39833-39839Google Scholar) and the fact that B16F10 cells are highly motile whereas Melan-a cells are not (30Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the effect of CD47 binding to SHPS-1 on cell migration. Quantitative analysis with a Boyden chamber assay revealed that the number of Melan-a cells that migrated through a membrane coated with fibronectin was reduced by ∼20% in the presence of CD47-Fc (Fig. 4A). Cross-linking of CD47-Fc by antibodies to human IgG increased the inhibitory effect of this ligand on the motility of Melan-a cells by an additional 10%. In contrast, CD47-Fc had no marked effect on the migration of B16F10 cells in the absence or presence of cross-linking antibodies. These results suggest that the binding of CD47 to surface SHPS-1 reduces the motility of cells expressing the latter protein. Given that the mAb to SHPS-1 recognized equally well the antigen expressed on the surface of both cell lines (Fig. 2A), it, unlike CD47-Fc, might be expected to act as a functional ligand in B16F10 cells. Indeed, treatment with this mAb reduced the migration of Melan-a cells by ∼22% and that of B16F10 cells by ∼25% (Fig. 4B). Cross-linking of the mAb increased its inhibitory effect on the motility of both cell types by an additional 5%. CD47-Fc exists as a dimer under nonreducing conditions (data not shown), presumably as a result of the formation of a disulfide bond between the Fc portions of the two molecules and consistent with previous observations (35Liu Y.C. Kawagishi M. Mikayama T. Inagaki Y. Takeuchi T. Ohashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8957-8961Google Scholar, 37Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-879Google Scholar). Thus, CD47-Fc, like the mAb to SHPS-1, might engage surface SHPS-1, and this engagement appears to be responsible for the inhibition of cell migration. Binding of CD47 to Cells Down-regulates SHPS-1 Expression—SHPS-1 promotes cell migration by recruiting SHP-2 to the cell membrane and thereby activating its phosphatase activity (20Inagaki K. Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T. Hosooka T. Akira S. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6721-6731Google Scholar), suggesting that CD47 binding to cells might inhibit cell motility by abrogating this function of SHPS-1. We observed that the expression level of SHPS-1 in Melan-a cells incubated with CD47-Fc for 6 h was substantially lower than that apparent in cells incubated with the control Fc fragment for a similar period (Fig. 5A, upper panel). In contrast, the abundance of SHPS-1 in B16F10 cells incubated with CD47-Fc was comparable with that observed for control cells (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Exposure to CD47-Fc did not substantially affect the expression of tubulin in both cell lines, arguing against a toxic effect of the soluble ligand (Fig. 5A). Given that Melan-a cells express both SHPS-1 and CD47 (data not shown), it was possible that the inhibitory effect of CD47-Fc on SHPS-1 expression in these cells resulted from disruption of the interaction between CD47 and SHPS-1 present on the same cells or on adjacent cells, rather than directly from the engagement of surface SHPS-1. To exclude this possibility, we generated cells that express wild-type mouse CD47 (CHO-Ras-CD47 cells). Flow cytometry revealed that these cells, but not the parental CHO-Ras cells, expressed substantial amounts of CD47 on the cell surface (data not shown). The abundance of SHPS-1 in Melan-a cells cocultured with CHO-Ras-CD47 cells for 5 h was markedly reduced compared with that apparent in cells cocultured with CHO-Ras cells (Fig. 5B, upper left panel). Again, this effect was not likely due to toxicity given that expression of tyrosinase-related protein-1, a melanocyte-specific protein, was also unaffected (data not shown). A mAb that reacts with the extracellular region of mouse CD47 blocked the down-regulation of SHPS-1 expression in Melan-a cells by CHO-Ras-CD47 cells (Fig. 5B, upper right panel), indicating that the down-regulation was mediated by CD47-SHPS-1 interaction. In contrast to these observations with Melan-a cells, exposure to CHO-Ras-CD47 cells had no substantial effect on the amount of SHPS-1 in B16F10 cells (Fig. 5B, lower panel). These results are thus consistent with the notion that engagement of surface SHPS-1 by CD47-Fc or by CD47 on the surface of adjacent cells, rather than disruption of the CD47-SHPS-1 interaction, results in down-regulation of SHPS-1 expression. CD47 Binding Induces Proteasome-dependent, Tyrosine Phosphorylation-independent Degradation of SHPS-1—To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 is required for its CD47-induced down-regulation, we generated CHO cell lines that express either wild-type SHPS-1 (CHO-SHPS-1-WT cells) or an SHPS-1 mutant in which all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are replaced by phenylalanine (CHO-SHPS-1-4F cells). This mutant protein did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in the"
https://openalex.org/W2132045158,"Visinin-like protein-3, which is one of the neuronal calcium sensors, has been shown to be mainly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, but cellular function of this protein has not yet been elucidated. We examined the tissue distribution of murine visinin-like protein-3 transcripts using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Visinin-like protein-3 mRNA was found to be expressed in peripheral tissues. Particularly, the expression of the transcript in the thymus was significantly higher than in other peripheral tissues. In addition, B6RVTC1 thymoma cells robustly expressed visinin-like protein-3 mRNA. To identify a target protein of visinin-like protein-3, we performed a pull-down experiment using glutathione S-transferase-tagged visinin-like protein-3 and two-dimensional electrophoresis. We demonstrated that microsomal cytochrome b5 was a Ca2+-dependent binding partner of visinin-like protein-3. In a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, it was observed that hippocalcin, as well as visinin-like protein-3, could interact with cytochrome b5. Furthermore, we confirmed that the sequence Val114-Tyr127 at the C-terminal tail of cytochrome b5 is the minimal structural requirement for binding to visinin-like protein-3. In addition, the loop His19-His25 at the N terminus of visinin-like protein-3 is essential for binding to cytochrome b5. Microsomal cytochrome b5 was also shown to be a potential activator of cytochrome P450. The present findings raise the possibility that visinin-like protein-3 may link Ca2+ signaling to the machinery of microsomal monooxygenase complex composed of cytochrome b5, cytochrome P450, and some reductases.

This report provides the first evidence of an interaction between visinin-like protein-3 and microsomal cytochrome b5. Calcium ions play an extremely important and essential role in inter- and intracellular signaling pathways. It is a prominent feature of ions that they regulate diverse cellular processes in many biological systems, including the central nervous system and the immune system. Calcium-binding proteins are thought to mediate the various activities of calcium ions. Visinin-like protein-3 (VILIP-3) 1The abbreviations used are: VILIP-3 and V3, visinin-like protein-3; NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; MMO, microsomal monooxygenase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPCA, hippocalcin; EYFP, enhanced yellow-green variant of the Aequorea Victoria green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GS4B, glutathione-Sepharose 4B; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; 2-DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; IPG, immobilized pH gradients; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. belongs to the NCS (neuronal calcium sensor) protein family, which includes more than 40 intracellular calcium-sensing proteins expressed primarily in retinal photoreceptors or neurons and neuroendocrine cells (1Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The NCS protein family has some common properties as Ca2+ sensors and switches. For instance, they show conformational changes after Ca2+ binding. They also have two pairs of calcium-binding consensus sequences referred to as EF-hand (EF1, EF2, EF3, and EF4). They also possess a consensus myristoylation sequence at the N-terminal end, the myristoylation of which may be responsible for membrane targeting of NCS proteins in a calcium-dependent manner by a mechanism known as the “calcium-myristoyl switch” (2Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11569-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The NCS protein family exhibits more than 45% sequence homology and can be grouped into different subfamilies according to the amino acid similarity among various species (1Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). VILIP-3 belongs to a VILIPs (visinin-like proteins) subfamily, which includes visinin-like protein-1, visinin-like protein-2, hippocalcin, and neurocalcin δ in human species (5Spilker C. Gundelfinger E.D. Braunewell K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as in mice. All members of the VILIP subfamily share the major features of NCS proteins described above. There has been some confusion as to the terminology used for the NCS protein family, as well as that used for VILIPs, because these proteins have been identified in different species and as a result have been renamed several times. To date, there are four synonyms of VILIP-3, including hHLP2 and BDR-1 from humans, NVP-3 from rats and mice, and Rem-1 from chicks. Additionally, the official reference to VILIP-3 in GenBank™ is hippocalcin-like 1. VILIP-3 expression was predominantly shown in cerebellar Purkinje cells of humans (6Bernstein H.G. Baumann B. Danos P. Diekmann S. Bogerts B. Gundelfinger E.D. Braunewell K.H. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and the rat brain (7Spilker C. Richter K. Smalla K.H. Manahan-Vaughan D. Gundelfinger E.D. Braunewell K.H. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as determined by immunohistochemical studies and Western blot analysis. By using in situ hybridization, high expression of the VILIP-3 transcript was observed in the cerebellum (Purkinje and granule cells) of the rat brain (8Paterlini M. Revilla V. Grant A.L. Wisden W. Neuroscience. 2000; 99: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unlike other VILIPs in this subfamily, the expression of VILIP-3 mRNA and protein has been confirmed in the peripheral tissues and in cells other than brain cells, although the expression levels were very low. Rat NVP-3 mRNA was detected in the lung, the spleen, and the skeletal muscle (9Kajimoto Y. Shirai Y. Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chicken Rem-1 mRNA was detected in the eye, the gut, and hematopoietic cells (10Kraut N. Frampton J. Graf T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1027-1036PubMed Google Scholar). Rat VILIP-3 protein was detected in the kidney, the spleen, and the testis by Western blot analysis (7Spilker C. Richter K. Smalla K.H. Manahan-Vaughan D. Gundelfinger E.D. Braunewell K.H. Neuroscience. 2000; 96: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of VILIP-3 remains unclear. This is the first report that murine VILIP-3 is expressed in the immune system as well as in the neural system. In an attempt to elucidate the cellular function of murine VILIP-3, we attempted to identify proteins with which it interacts and found that VILIP-3 interacted with microsomal cytochrome b5 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identified structures required for the interaction between these proteins.

Following the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (final 0.5 mm) to the culture medium, and the induced cells were grown for an additional 3–4 h at 25 °C. The expressed proteins were purified from bacterial sonicates using GS4B (Amersham Biosciences AB), and the proteins were eluted with free glutathione. The concentrations of proteins in the eluates were assessed by SDS-PAGE, and ∼1 μg of purified proteins was used for the coimmunoprecipitation assay.Fig. 6Identification of the minimal structural requirements for cytochrome b5 interaction with VILIP-3. A, the ranges of deletion (the lines at the top) or addition (the lines at the bottom) are shown with the C-terminal sequence of cytochrome b5. The schematic representations of the constructs are summarized in Fig. 2A. B, co-immunoprecipitation assay using V3-F- and M-b5-truncated mutants. 293T cells were transfected with each of the expression vectors. All transfectants were lysed in the presence of calcium. The interacting proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-c-Myc antibody. C, in vitro binding assay using V3-F and affinity-purified GST-tagged cytochrome b5 C-terminal truncated mutants. After the incubation of V3-F bound to anti-FLAG-agarose beads with GST-cytochrome b5 mutant proteins, the immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-GST antibody was used for the detection of GST-cytochrome b5 mutants. D, in vitro binding assay using V3-F and affinity-purified GST-tagged cytochrome b5 C-terminal polypeptides. The procedure used here was the same as that used for C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNA Source, Total RNA Extraction, and Reverse Transcription—The total RNAs were extracted from the mouse tissues and cell lines using Sepazol reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using a First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR avian myeloblastis virus (Roche Applied Science), and 1 μg of total RNA was used as a template. The accompanying random primer pdN6 was used for the reactions. The procedures used for the reactions followed the manufacturer's recommendations. Relative Quantification of Mouse VILIP-3 mRNA—The expression of VILIP-3 mRNA in tissues and cells was analyzed by two-step real-time RT-PCR using the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). β-Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as reference genes for the tissue examination and the cell line examination, respectively. The following primers were used for mouse VILIP-3 (forward primer, ACACACGGAATTCACCGACCAT; reverse primer, ACACACGGAATTCACCGACCAT), β-actin (forward primer, ACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA; reverse primer, CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward primer, CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC; reverse primer, CGGAACCGCTCATTGCC). For quantification, an external calibration curve was used. VILIP-3, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR products amplified by each primer pair were cloned separately in pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Dilutions of each plasmid containing from 104 to 108 double-stranded DNA molecules were used as standard templates for the production of external calibration curves. The conditions for RT-PCR were optimized by a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science) with regard to the MgCl2 concentrations, annealing temperatures, elongation time, and fluorescence acquisition temperatures. PCR amplifications were repeated in triplicate. The PCR efficiencies (E) were calculated according to the following equation: E = 10-1/slope. Each mean slope of each external calibration curve was used as a representative slope value. The CP (crossing point) for each transcript was determined by the “Fit Point Method” performed in the LightCycler software 3.3 (Roche Applied Science). The average of each of the triplicate CP values was used as a representative CP value. Relative quantification ratios of each tissue type and cell line were calculated according to the following equation: ratio = (Etarget)ΔCPtarget(control-sample)/(Eref)ΔCPref(control-sample). Etarget indicates the PCR efficiency when using the VILIP-3 primer, and the standard template of VILIP-3. Eref refers to the PCR efficiency when reference gene (β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) primer pairs and standard templates were used. ΔCPtarget (control - sample) and ΔCPref (control - sample) refer to the CP deviation of each tissue type or cell line versus a control tissue (the brain) or a control cell line (BV2) for the VILIP-3 transcripts and the reference gene transcripts, respectively (13Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Experiment—TOP10 E. coli (Invitrogen) transformed by GST-V3 expression vector or PGEX-KG were grown in 2 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 575 = 0.3–0.5. Following the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (final 0.5 mm) to the culture medium, and the induced cells were grown for an additional 3–4 h at 37 °C, pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini EDTA free (Roche Applied Science); the cells were then subjected to freeze-thaw cycles (3×) using liquid nitrogen. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min and were stored at -80 °C until needed for further use. The concentration of bait protein (GST or GST-V3) among the lysates was assessed by SDS-PAGE. For the analysis of affinity precipitations, cell lysates were prepared using a B6RVTC1 thymoma cell line. 1 × 108 cells of B6RVTC1 were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (75 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini EDTA free (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. Transformed E. coli lysates containing ∼10 μg of bait proteins were added to the B6RVTC1 lysates. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Then, a 5-μl bed volume of GS4B beads equilibrated by applying lysis buffer with or without calcium was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the beads were washed extensively in the appropriate lysis buffer, dried for a few minutes using a Speed-Vac, and stored at -30 °C until use. 2-DE and Amino Acid Sequence—The Multiphor™ II isoelectric focusing systems, IPG strips (3–10 liters, 11 cm), IPG buffer (pH 3, 10 liters), ExcelGel SDS (gradient 8–18%), ExcelGel SDS buffer strips, and the Plus One Silver Staining Kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences AB. Prior to isoelectric focusing, IPG strips were rehydrated with sample buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 3, 10 liters), 18 mm dithiothreitol) for 12 h. After IPG strip rehydration, proteins bound to GS4B, prepared as described above, were eluted with sample buffer, and loaded onto IPG strips. 2-DE were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To visualize proteins resolved by 2-DE, silver staining of 2-DE gels was performed. Gels containing area of interest were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue; then, a spot of interest was selected and digested with trypsin for 16 h at 35 °C. The peptide fragments generated in this manner were separated using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The fragments were analyzed by a protein sequencer, and confirmed sequences were identified by homology searches of a CD database. Transfection—LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of 293T cells. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 70–80% confluent 293T cells in one well of a 6-well plate were transfected using 1 μg of 3×FLAG-tagged protein expression vectors and 1 μg of c-myc epitope or EYFP-tagged protein expression vectors. For the in vitro binding assay using GST-tagged cytochrome b5 mutants, 70–80% confluent 293T cells in one well of a 6-well plate were transfected by 2 μg of V3-F expression vector. Co-immunoprecipitation, Electrophoresis, and Western Blotting— Transfected cells in one well of a 6-well plate were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% CHAPS, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 or EGTA) containing the protease inhibitor mixture Complete Mini EDTA free (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed and eluted with 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma) solution. The eluted samples were loaded on 4–12% NuPage bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions. The resolved proteins were then blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in 5% skim milk, and probed with each primary antibody, followed by incubation with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. ECL or ECL+ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences AB) were used for detection. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-c-Myc (Clontech) for the detection of M-b5 and M-b5 derivatives, anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences AB) for the detection of GST-b5 and GST-b5 derivatives, and anti-EYFP (anti-Living-color AV peptide antibody) (Clontech) for the detection of V3-Y, HPCA-Y, and V3-Y mutants. Expression Pattern of VILIP-3 mRNA in Mouse Tissues and Cell Lines—The tissue distributions of VILIP-3 in several species have been reported in recent years, as noted above in the introduction. However, there has not yet been a report of VILIP-3 expression in mice. Here, we examined the tissue distribution of murine VILIP-3 using real-time RT-PCR. VILIP-3 mRNA was highly expressed in the brain and the eye. In the peripheral tissues, ubiquitous expression of VILIP-3 mRNA was observed, although the expression levels were low. In addition, the expression level of the VILIP-3 transcript was relatively high in the thymus (relative expression ratio: 0.39) compared with that of the other peripheral tissues (Fig. 1A). In contrast to VILIP-3 expression, the expression of hippocalcin mRNA was high in the brain, but was not detected in any of the same series of peripheral tissues (data not shown). In a similar manner, we examined the expression of VILIP-3 mRNA in several cell lines, including immunocyte lines, NIH3T3, and microglia cell line BV2. The expression levels of VILIP-3 transcripts in monocytic cell lines PU5 and M1, macrophage cell line P388D1, T cell line 2B4-11, thymocyte cell line EL-4, NIH3T3, and BV2 were relatively high compared with the levels in lymphocytic cell lines CTLL-2, SP2/0, 70Z/3, and A20. Moreover, the VILIP-3 expression in B6RVTC1 cells originating from thymoma cells was more than 3-fold higher than that of other cell lines (Fig. 1B). Search for a Target Protein of VILIP-3—To identify a Ca2+-dependent binding partner of VILIP-3, we performed a GST pull-down experiment by using GST-VILIP-3 fusion protein (Fig. 2) and B6RVTC1 cell lysates. Fig. 3 shows the 2-DE gel protein profiles. The distinct spot (a), which appeared only in the presence of calcium, was detected in silver-stained 2-DE gels (Fig. 3A). The molecular weight and isoelectric point of the spot were ∼16 kDa and 5.2, respectively. Spot (a), detected on the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel (Fig. 4A), was selected and subjected to an analysis of internal amino acid sequences using in-gel digestion and peptide fingerprinting methods. Two of the significant peptide fragments were submitted to amino acid sequence analysis, and the sequences were identified with N-terminal sequences involved in a highly conserved heme-binding domain of microsomal cytochrome b5 of many species (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we confirmed that spot (a) was endogenous murine microsomal cytochrome b5. To provide independent evidence for the interaction between VILIP-3 and microsomal cytochrome b5 detected above, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with V3-F (C-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged VILIP-3) expression vector and M-b5 (myc-tagged cytochrome b5 of the wild-type) expression vector. The immunoprecipitated complexes bound to anti-FLAG antibody were analyzed for the presence of M-b5 by Western blotting. Fig. 5A shows that M-b5 bound specifically to V3-F and that the interaction arose only in the presence of calcium. This interaction was also observed in a co-immunoprecipitation assay using 293T cells transfected with V3-Y (EYFP-tagged VILIP-3 of the wild-type) expression vector and F-b5 (N-terminal 3×FLAG-tagged cytochrome b5) expression vector. When the constructs were co-expressed, V3-Y was detected by Western blot analysis for immunoprecipitated complex bound to anti-FLAG antibody in the presence of calcium but not in the absence of calcium (Fig. 5B). These data show that VILIP-3 interacts specifically with microsomal cytochrome b5 in a calcium-dependent manner.Fig. 4Identification of spots on 2-DE gels, obtained by the pull-down assay in the presence of calcium. A, the panel indicates Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained 2-DE gels obtained from duplicate samples subjected to the same conditions as those described in Fig. 3A. An interesting spot (a) was also detected on the gel. The gel pieces from the spot (a) were digested using trypsin and were subjected to fingerprinting peptide mapping. N-terminal amino acid analysis identified the spot as murine microsomal cytochrome b5. B, the amino acid sequence of cytochrome b5 is shown. Single-underlined sequences indicate an identified polypeptide in the N-terminal amino acid analysis. A dotted sequence indicates a Pro-containing hinge region linking the heme-binding globular domain and the C-terminal hydrophobic domain. The double-underlined region was found within the hydrophobic core of the ER membrane. Bold italics indicate the VILIP-3 binding region.

Using a cki1Δ eki1Δ mutant defective in choline kinase and ethanolamine kinase, we examined the consequences of a block in the Kennedy pathway on the regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway. The cki1Δ eki1Δ mutant exhibited increases in the synthesis of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine via the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway. The increase in phospholipid synthesis correlated with increased activity levels of the CDP-diacylglycerol pathway enzymes phosphatidylserine synthase, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and phospholipid methyltransferase. However, other enzyme activities, including phosphatidylinositol synthase and phosphatidate phosphatase, were not affected in the cki1Δ eki1Δ mutant. For phosphatidylserine synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the committed step in the pathway, activity was regulated by increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. Decay analysis of CHO1 mRNA indicated that a dramatic increase in transcript stability was a major component responsible for the elevated level of phosphatidylserine synthase. These results revealed a novel mechanism that controls phospholipid synthesis in yeast.

The contribution of the CDP-DAG and Kennedy pathways for PC synthesis in wild type S. cerevisiae is dependent on the exogenous supply of choline (35McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

In this work we showed that the activities of the CDP-DAG pathway enzymes were elevated in the cki1Δ eki1Δ mutant to compensate for the block in the Kennedy pathway. For PS synthase, the elevation in enzyme activity was due to increased mRNA and protein levels. One component responsible for this regulation was a dramatic increase in mRNA stability.

Cultures were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in complete synthetic medium (55Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose. The appropriate amino acid of complete synthetic medium was omitted for selection purposes. Cells in liquid media were grown to the exponential phase (1–2 × 107 cells/ml), and cell numbers were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. Viable cells were determined by scoring the number of colonies on agar plates. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (F– φ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR, recA1 endA1 hdR17(rk– mk+) phoA supE44 liters–thi-1 gyrA96 relA1) (56Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to cultures of DH5α carrying plasmids. Yeast and bacterial media were supplemented with 2% and 1.5% agar, respectively, for growth on plates. DNA Manipulations and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid and genomic DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligations were performed according to standard protocols (56Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformations of yeast (57Ito H. Yasuki F.

Pre-hybridization, hybridization with the probes, and washes to remove nonspecific binding were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images of radiolabeled species were acquired by phosphorimaging analysis. Analysis of CHO1 mRNA decay was analyzed following the arrest of transcription as described by Gonzalez and Martin (63Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

Anti-PS Synthase Antibodies and Immunoblotting—The peptide sequence MVESDEDFAPQEFPH (residues 1–15 at the N-terminal end of the deduced protein sequence of CHO1) was synthesized and used to raise antibodies in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures (64Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at Bio-Synthesis, Inc. SDS-PAGE (65Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (200922) Google Scholar) using 12% slab gels and transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (66Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. The membrane was probed with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-PS synthase antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. The PS synthase protein was detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit, and the protein signals were acquired by Fluoroimaging.

Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid synthesis was followed by labeling cells for 30 min, whereas the steady state composition of phospholipids was determined by labeling cells for six generations. Phospholipids were extracted from labeled cells by the method of Bligh and Dyer (67Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by two-dimensional TLC. The solvent systems used in the first and second dimensions were chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/H2O (90: 50:4:6) and chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (64:8:10:2), respectively. The identity of the labeled phospholipids on the chromatography plates was confirmed by comparison with standard phospholipids after exposure to iodine vapor. Radiolabeled phospholipids were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis. The relative quantities of 32P-labeled phospholipids were analyzed using ImageQuant software, whereas the amount of each 14C-labeled phospholipid was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Preparation of the Cell Extract and the Total Membrane Fraction— The cell extract and total membrane fraction were prepared as described previously (68Oshiro J. Han G.-S. Iwanyshyn W.M. Conover K.

https://openalex.org/W2117757541,"Translocation of tRNAs across mitochondrial membranes is a receptor-mediated active transport process requiring ATP. A large tRNA import complex from the inner membrane of Leishmania mitochondria catalyzes translocation into phospholipid vesicles. In this reconstituted system, the import substrate tRNATyr(GUA) specifically stimulated hydrolysis of ATP within the vesicles, with the subsequent generation of a membrane potential by pumping out of protons, as shown by the protonophore-sensitive uptake of the potential-sensitive dye rhodamine 123. Generation of membrane potential was dependent on ATP hydrolysis, and inhibited by oligomycin, recalling the proton-translocation mechanism of the respiratory F1-F0-ATPase. For translocation of tRNA, ATP could be replaced by low pH of the medium, but proton-dependent import was resistant to oligomycin. Moreover, ATP hydrolysis, generation of membrane potential and tRNA uptake were inhibited by carboxyatractyloside, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-ADP translocase, implying an ATP requirement within the vesicles. These observations imply a gating mechanism in which tRNA, on binding to its receptor, triggers the energetic activation of the complex, leading to the opening of import channels.

In many species across the phylogenetic scale, the mitochondrial genome is incomplete with respect to the number of tRNA genes required for translation of the organellar mRNAs (1Schneider A.

In such cases, mitochondrial translation is sustained by the import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs from the cytoplasm. The mechanism of translocation of these highly negatively charged macromolecules across the hydrophobic and electrostatic barriers of two mitochondrial membranes (of which the inner membrane is negatively charged in respiring mitochondria due to selective proton expulsion from the matrix) is a matter of considerable interest but poorly understood. Particularly, the bioenergetic inputs required to overcome these barriers have not been precisely defined. Using in vitro systems, it was shown that tRNA import in yeast, Leishmania and Trypanosoma mitochondria is ATP-dependent (7Tarrasov I. Entelis N.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ATP could have a direct role in inducing conformational changes leading to opening of import channels. Alternatively, the mitochondrial F1-F0-ATPase, or some other ATPase dedicated to import, could generate a proton gradient that actually drives import. A role of protons was indicated by the inhibitory effect of protonophores (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which dissipate proton gradients, but whether protons are sufficient to induce import remains an open question. Finally, it is unclear whether proton gradient generation and tRNA translocation are separate or coupled processes and whether tRNA itself plays an active role in proton translocation. We have recently reported the isolation of a multiprotein complex (the RNA import complex or RIC) 1The abbreviations used are: RIC, RNA import complex; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEI, polyethyleneimine; TLC, thin layer chromatography; STE, sucrose-Tris-EDTA; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; CCCP, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone. 1The abbreviations used are: RIC, RNA import complex; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEI, polyethyleneimine; TLC, thin layer chromatography; STE, sucrose-Tris-EDTA; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; CCCP, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone. that is sufficient to induce import of tRNAs into artificial phospholipid vesicles (12Bhattacharyya S.N.

In the present study, we have used the RIC-reconstituted liposome system to study the bioenergetic transactions leading to import. Isolation of Mitochondria and Purificaton of RIC—Mitochondia were prepared from Leishmania tropica strain UR6 and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (8Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mitoplasts were prepared by digitonin treatment as described previously (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RIC was purified from mitochondrial inner membranes as described (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondrial inner membranes were extracted with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in presence of 0.4 m KCl, and the extract was subjected to affinity chromatography using as ligand, the D arm of tRNATyr, which contains an import signal (14Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified fraction was used for ATPase activity assays or for proteoliposome reconstitution. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Empty liposomes were prepared (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by suspending phosphatidyl choline (250 μg) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgAc2, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.25% deoxycholate and dialyzing the suspension against 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgAc2, 20 mm KCl for 18 h at 4 °C. Aggregated material was removed by centrifugation at 2300 × g and the supernatant, containing mainly unilamellar vesicles, was used. For reconstitution, liposomes (25 μg) and RIC (100 ng) were incubated in the same buffer without deoxycholate for 1 h before import or ATPase assays. Import Substrates—32P-Labeled tRNATyr(GUA) or tRNAGln(CUG) was prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription as described previously (15Adhya S. Ghosh T. Das A. Bera S.K. Mahapatra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21396-21402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Import Assays—Proteoliposomes (equivalent to 100 ng of RIC) were incubated with 100 fmol of substrate RNA in 20 μl of import buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 4 mm ATP) at 37 °C for 15 min, then RNases A and T1 were added at final concentrations of 2.5 μg/ml and 50 units/ml, respectively, and RNase digestion continued at 37 °C for 15 min. The proteoliposomes were then washed with 3 ml of liposome washing buffer (5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA) and the vesicles recovered by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. RNA was isolated from the liposomes as described previously (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Mahapatra S. Ghosh S. Bera S.K. Ghosh T. Das A. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—RIC (10 ng) or proteoliposomes reconstituted with 10 ng of RIC (25 μg of phopholipid) was incubated in a 5-μl reaction with 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2000 cpm/pmol) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgAc2, and 2 mm DTT, in the presence or absence of low specific activity (5000 cpm/pmol) tRNA (5 nm) as indicated. Inhibitors were preincubated with RIC or proteoliposomes on ice for 15 min prior to addition of the assay mix. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 1 μl of each reaction was mixed with 1 μl of 1% SDS, deoxycholate, or Triton X-100 and spotted on prewashed polyethyleneimine (PEI) cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Sigma), essentially as described previously (17Böhme E. Schultz G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The plates were developed by sequential runs in 0.1 m acetic acid and 1 m LiCl and autoradiographed. Radioactive spots were quantified by liquid scintillation counting or densitometry. Apparent Km values were estimated from rate curves as the concentration of ATP or tRNATyr for half-maximal activity (pmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min). To determine the site of ATP hydrolysis, proteoliposomes were washed with isotonic sucrose-Tris-EDTA (STE; Ref. 8Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and separated from free, i.e. external ATP by centrifugal ultrafiltration with a Microcon 30 ultrafilter (Amicon) at 16,000 × g, and resuspended in 10 μl of STE for TLC. Rhodamine 123 Uptake Assay—RIC-proteoliposomes (10 μg of lipid and 3 ng of RIC) were incubated with 0.05% rhodamine 123 in 10 μl of import buffer with 4 mm ATP for 15 min at 37 °C. Wherever indicated, liposomes were preincubated with inhibitors at 4 °C for 15 min. The proteoliposome suspension was mixed with an equal volume of STE containing 20% glycerol and observed under a Leica DMIRB inverted confocal microscope with laser excitation at 488 nm and emission at 540–668 nm. Images at ×1000 magnification were analyzed and quantified by the Leica SP2 confocal software. The mean fluorescence intensity per particle was calculated as the product fav × nf, where fav = average intensity of fluorescence in stained particles, and nf = fraction of particles staining above background. A tRNA-stimulated ATPase Activity in RIC—To determine whether the ATP-hydrolytic activity required for import is an integral part of, or distinct from, RIC, the purified complex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and radiolabeled Pi separated by thin layer chromatography. At high concentrations of RIC, a nonspecific ATPase activity was observed (data not shown). However, at low RIC concentrations, ATP hydrolysis was stimulated ∼16-fold by the import substrate tRNATyr (Fig. 1A). In contrast, tRNAGln(CUG), which is not imported in vivo or in vitro, had only a 4-fold effect (Fig. 1A); total Escherichia coli tRNA had no effect (data not shown). The preference of ATPase stimulatory activity for an importable tRNA indicates the relevance of this ATPase to import. From rate curves (Fig. 1C), the apparent KmtRNA(Tyr) for ATP hydrolysis was 0.98 nm, which is close to the value of 1.16 nm for RIC-mediated import (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, KmATP for the ATPase was 1.32 mm, compared with 1.35 mm for import (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine further the relationship between the RIC ATPase and import, the complex was incorporated into liposomes. Incubation of the proteoliposomes with ATP resulted in tRNATyr-stimulated ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1B), indicating retention of the activity in a membrane-bound form of the enzyme. However, the degree of stimulation of membrane-bound ATPase by tRNATyr was 2-fold compared with 16-fold for the soluble complex. This could be due to partial denaturation, with concomitant exposure of the ATPase site and loss of allosteric regulation, on insertion of the complex into the membrane. Import both in vitro (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in transfected cells (14Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has been shown to be sensitive to oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial F1-F0-ATPase. Oligomycin apparently exerts its effect by reducing the permeability of the F0 portion of the enzyme to protons (18Pringle M.J. Kenneally M.K. Joshi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7632-7637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of RIC was resistant to oligomycin, both in the free (Fig. 1D) and membrane-bound (Fig. 1E) forms. Thus, the oligomycin-sensitive step in import must be after the initial ATP hydrolysis step. ATP Hydrolysis Inside the Liposome—tRNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis by membrane-bound RIC could occur on either side of the liposome membrane. The site of hydrolysis was determined in two ways. First, we had previously observed that import in intact mitochondria (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or mitoplasts 2S. N. Bhattacharyya and S. Adhya, unpublished data. is sensitive to carboxyatractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) on the inner membrane, suggesting the requirement of transport of ATP into the matrix. In the RIC-liposome system, tRNA uptake was similarly sensitive to carboxyatractyloside (Fig. 3C). In the same system, ATP hydrolysis was also inhibited by the drug, but the ATPase activity of the free RIC was unaffected (Fig. 1, F and G). These results are consistent with the presence of ANT, or an ANT-like carrier, in the complex and further indicate that upon insertion of RIC into the membrane the ATPase active site is exposed to the inner compartment. In a second experiment, we directly checked for the presence of labeled ATP and Pi within the vesicles as follows. RIC-liposomes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and separated from free ATP by ultrafiltration. When the liposomes were directly run on TLC plates, most of the radioactivity was concentrated near the origin, with little or no free Pi near the solvent front (Fig. 1H, lane 2). However, Pi was released upon treatment of the liposomes with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1H, lane 1). In a control experiment, free RIC was similarly incubated with ATP and ultrafiltered; neither ATP nor Pi was detected in the retentate (Fig. 1H), excluding the possibility of RIC itself binding or protecting significant amounts of these molecules. This experiment confirms the uptake and hydrolysis of ATP within the proteoliposome. RIC- and tRNA-dependent Generation of Membrane Potential—The lipophilic cationic dye rhodamine 123 is taken up into respiring mitochondria of living cells in a membrane potential-dependent manner (19Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). We have previously observed uptake of rhodamine 123 into isolated Leishmania mitochondria in presence of ATP (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The availability of the RIC-liposome system allowed the development of a microscopic assay of membrane potential generation by rhodamine 123 uptake. Control or RIC-reconstituted liposomes were incubated with tRNA and ATP and uptake of rhodamine 123 monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. About 80% of the vesicles became labeled in the complete system (Fig. 2). Uptake was dependent on the presence of RIC, ATP, and tRNATyr. ATP could not be substituted by the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMPPCP, showing a requirement for ATP hydrolysis. tRNATyr could not be replaced by the non-importable tRNAGln(CUG). Moreover, uptake was inhibited by the protonophore uncoupler m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (CCCP), which dissipates trans-membrane proton gradients; this implies that the membrane potential is generated by RIC-mediated pumping of protons. Uptake was also completely sensitive to oligomycin, a proton channel blocker. Inhibition of ATP transport by carboxyatractyloside abolished uptake of rhodamine 123, implying the requirement of ATP hydrolysis within the vesicles. These results indicate the generation of a membrane potential (negative inside) by a proton pump activity of RIC. Proton-driven Import of tRNA—ATP-dependent import of tRNA in mitochondria (11Mukherjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31249-31255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in transfected cells (14Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has been shown to be sensitive to protonophores and K+/H+ ionophores that dissipate either or both of the components (electrical or chemical) of the electrochemical gradient set up by proton translocation in respiring mitochondria. In RIC-reconstituted liposomes, ATP-dependent uptake of tRNA was also sensitive to CCCP, valinomycin, and nigericin (Fig. 3, A and B). This indirectly suggests that it is the proton gradient generated by ATP hydrolysis, rather than ATP hydrolysis itself, that provides the driving force for import but does not exclude an additional role for ATP. Therefore, we checked whether ATP can be replaced by protons in the RIC-reconstituted system. Uptake assays were performed in buffers of different pH, the internal pH of the liposomes being 8. At an external pH of 8, there was no uptake in absence of ATP (Fig. 3D), but as the external pH was progressively lowered, tRNA uptake increased until, at an external pH of 6, it reached the value obtained with ATP. Proton-dependent uptake was similarly sensitive to valinomycin and nigericin (Fig. 3F). The K+ ionophore valinomycin, in presence of high external K+, dissipates the electrical component (the membrane potential, Δψ) of the protonmotive force, whereas nigericin, which exchanges H+ for K+, disrupts the chemical component (ΔpH) without affecting Δψ. Thus, these experiments indicate the requirement of both components for RIC-mediated import. An interesting difference between ATP-dependent and proton-dependent import was observed with respect to their responses to oligomycin. Whereas ATP-dependent import was sensitive to oligomycin (Fig. 3B), proton-dependent import was resistant (Fig. 3E). This indicates that, in the energy-transduction pathway, the oligomycin-sensitive step occurs between ATP hydrolysis and proton-driven translocation, i.e. at the step of proton extrusion with concomitant generation of a membrane potential (see above). The binding of substrate tRNA to its receptor on the RIC has multiple effects on import-related processes. It allosterically influences the binding of other tRNAs: a Type I tRNA stimulates binding of a Type II tRNA, while a Type II tRNA inhibits the binding of a Type I tRNA (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Goswami S. Chatterjee S. Bhattacharyya S.N. Basu S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5552-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It may induce the opening of the import channel (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, tRNA specifically stimulates an ATPase activity (Fig. 1) and induces a membrane potential (Fig. 2). Our current results are consistent with a multistep pathway of energy transduction within the complex leading, ultimately, to tRNA translocation; 1) substrate tRNA binds to its receptor; 2) ATP is transported into the mitochondrion via a translocase, which is similar or identical to the carboxyatractyloside-sensitive adenine nucleotide transporter; 3) tRNA-receptor binding leads to the activation of an RIC-associated ATPase which catalyzes ATP hydrolysis within the mitochondrion; 4) ATP hydrolysis is accompanied by pumping of protons through an oligomycin-sensitive channel from inside to outside the membrane, resulting in the generation of a membrane potential; 5) establishment of the proton gradient leads to opening of the import channel, possibly by voltage gating; this would explain the requirement for the membrane potential, Δψ; 6) the tRNA is transported through the import pore. Excess external protons (ΔpH) are required at this step. The protons may act to neutralize the negative charges on the RNA phosphate groups or line the pore to allow “electrophoretic” translocation of the RNA. The RNA-stimulated ATPase (which we designate as R-ATPase) appears to be functionally related to, but distinct from, the mitochondrial respiratory F-ATPase and the vacuolar V-ATPase (for a comparison of the latter two enzymes, see Ref. 20Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all three cases ATP hydrolysis is coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. Moreover, proton movement occurs away from the compartment in which ATP hydrolysis is occurring, and both F- and R-ATPases, in their membrane-bound form, pump protons in an oligomycin-sensitive manner. There are also structural similarities; spherical particles resembling the knobs of the F1 sector of F-ATPase have been observed with purified RIC preparations (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, our recent peptide sequencing studies 3S. N. Bhattacharyya, S. Chatterjee, S. Goswami, and S. Adhya, unpublished data. reveal the occurrence of an RIC subunit with homology to the α-subunit of F-ATPase, which is also present in V-ATPase (20Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the F-, V-, and R-ATPases may belong to a superfamily of multiprotein complexes dedicated to different intracellular functions. One interesting aspect of the RIC is the ease with which it induces tRNA translocation across membranes; simple addition to, or preincubation with membrane vesicles, whether liposomes (12Bhattacharyya S.N. Chatterjee S. Goswami S. Tripathi G. Dey S.N. Adhya S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5217-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or mitoplasts or intact mitochondria (unpublished data), is sufficient, and exhaustive reconstitution by dialysis, as is common with respiratory complexes (21Darley-Usmar V.M. Capaldi R.A. Takamiya S. Millett F. Wilson M.T. Malatesta F. Sarti P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 113-152Google Scholar), is unnecessary. This suggests a facile insertion of the complex into membranes. Moreover, membrane insertion of the complex may be non-random. This is indicated by the fact that in the reconstituted liposome, ATP hydrolysis occurs internally, and the R-ATPase activity is totally sensitive to carboxyatractyloside (Fig. 1), whereas the soluble ATPase is resistant, implying that most or all of the ATPase active sites are internal to the membrane; random insertion would be expected to yield about 50% carboxyatractyloside-resistant ATPase activity. The mechanism of facile, non-random insertion is unknown; one possibility is insertion via a lipid anchor of the type found in Leishmania and Trypanosoma surface glycoproteins (22Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is curious that the mitochondrial inner membrane contains a mechanism for generating a membrane potential that is independent of respiratory chain-mediated electron transport; indeed, we have observed that with intact mitochondria or mitoplasts, respiratory substrates such as succinate, citrate, etc. are unable to replace ATP as an energy source for import. 4S. N. Bhattacharyya, S. Mukherjee, and S. Adhya, unpublished data. Thus the question arises as to whether the tRNA-dependent proton gradient generated by RIC is dedicated to import or whether it can be utilized under certain conditions to catalyze other inner membrane transport processes. The present study reveals the presence of several entities within the RIC that appear to be related to known mitochondrial components involved in ATP synthesis and transport: an oligomycin-sensitive ATPase, proton channels, and an ATP carrier. It will be important to identify the corresponding proteins to establish the relationship between tRNA import and oxidative phosphorylation.

Re-activation, however, was not simply a reversal of inhibition; while the torque appears unaffected as compared with the situation without tentoxin, F1 under re-activating conditions was less susceptible to inhibitory ADP binding but displayed a large number of short pauses, indicating infringed energy conversion.

The enzyme is found ubiquitously in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts and consists of five different subunits with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδ∈. Its α3β3γ subcomplex is the minimal assembly capable of continuous hydrolysis of ATP. The α and β subunits, arranged in an alternating manner like the elements of an orange, form a hexagon with the γ subunit in its center (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The degree of both inhibition and re-activation of the enzyme varies; whereas spinach CF1 showed about 80% maximal inhibition and reactivation to about 3-fold its activity in the absence of tentoxin, reduced sensitivity for inhibition and less pronounced re-activation were reported for chimeric complexes constructed from CF1 and Rhodospirillum rubrum F1-ATPase subunits (16Tucker W.C. Du Z. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2179-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Tucker W.C. Du Z. Hein R. Gromet-Elhanan Z. Richter M.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7542-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and for CF1 treated with synthetic tentoxin analogues (18Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Munier L. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3343-3350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).It seems a rather unique property that an alleged inhibitor can exert two such strikingly opposite effects on its target enzyme, and a wealth of effort has been dedicated to the question whether re-activation is a simple reversal of inhibition or other factors are involved. Answering these questions has been hampered by the lack of an experimental system for mutagenesis, overexpression, and assembly of chloroplast F1. Such methods are well established for an α3β3γ subcomplex of F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1), however, which additionally is routinely used in single molecule observations of rotation (7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 19Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structure of tentoxin-bound CF1, we recently introduced the single point mutation βSer66 → Ala into the thermophilic enzyme. This mutant, referred to as TF1 βS66A here, displayed similar activity and kinetics as the wild type enzyme. But whereas the wild type enzyme shows very low tentoxin sensitivity at room temperature, sensitivity of the mutant was strongly enhanced. The observed maximal degree of inhibition, 60–70%, was comparable with values reported for CF1, and recovery of activity was also observed (20Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).In the present report, we have used this engineered tentoxin-sensitive F1-ATPase to examine rotation of single enzyme molecules. For this purpose we adopted the polystyrene-bead detection method of rotation (21Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), which allows substantially extended observation times as compared with the actin filament technique and has previously successfully been used to examine redox regulation of single F1-ATPase molecules (22Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that tentoxin inhibits by virtually completely blocking rotation. Re-activation restores rotational movement but with altered characteristics as compared with the situation without tentoxin. The angular speed during any given stretch of continuous rotation was unaffected, indicating that the efficiency of conversion from chemical to mechanical energy for each hydrolyzed ATP molecule was not influenced. However, the occurrence of a large number of short pauses suggests that the probability for this energy conversion process was still reduced in the re-activated state. Furthermore, binding of two or more tentoxin molecules seems to abolish the inhibitory effect of ADP binding to the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparation—A α3β3γ subcomplex of F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 carrying an affinity tag of 10 histidine residues at the N terminus of the β subunits and the mutation βSer66 → Ala (referred to as TF1 βS66A) was isolated from Escherichia coli strain JM103ΔuncB-D as described previously (20Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: TF1 βS66A, partly purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Quiagen) affinity column, was loaded onto a Mono Q 5/5 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm KCl and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 250 mm potassium sulfate. Fractions containing TF1 βS66A were pooled and passed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm KCl.Bulk Phase ATP Hydrolysis Activity—ATP hydrolysis was measured with an ATP regenerating system coupled to oxidation of NADH, monitoring the decrease of absorption at 340 nm (23Kato Y. Sasayama T. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples were preincubated for 2 h with tentoxin at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1, and ATP hydrolysis was recorded in the presence of the same concentrations of tentoxin.Rotation Assay—TF1 βS66A was biotinylated at a single cysteine residue in the γ subunit using biotin-(PEAC)5-maleimide (Dojindo) as described previously (7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 22Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The biotinylated enzyme was preincubated for 2h in 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl (Buffer A) containing 50 μm or 1 mm tentoxin (diluted from 100-fold concentrated stock in ethanol). All buffers for the subsequent steps of sample preparation and microscopic observation contained the required concentration tentoxin or 1% ethanol as control. 15 μl of this mixture (20–50 nm TF1 βS66A) was infused into a flow cell, constructed from microscope cover slips as described (7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1940) Google Scholar), and incubated for 2 min to allow for immobilization of the enzyme on the glass surface. The flow cell was washed with 100 μl of Buffer A containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Buffer B), a suspension of streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (Bangs Laboratories, diameter 500 nm, ∼200 pm) in Buffer B was infused and incubated for 20 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of reaction buffer (Buffer B supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Roche Applied Science)) was infused and microscopic observation was started. Rotation of beads was observed with an IX70 microscope (Olympus). Images were recorded with a charge-coupled device (Dage-MTI) and stored in a computer. Image analysis was done using the CREST IMAGE software provided by R. Yasuda (24Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). For each data set 100 molecules were recorded for a 5-min period and analyzed; in all cases two beads were bound to one F1-ATPase molecule. 20–30 additional molecules per data set, either detached from the slide glass during the observation period, were clearly obstructed by contact of the beads with the glass surface or were bound to more than two beads. Still, inclusion of these molecules into the analysis did not significantly change the results. For a detailed description of the method, refer to Ref. 21Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar.To monitor the effect of different tentoxin concentrations on the same F1-ATPase molecule, we screened a flow cell containing the reaction buffer described above without tentoxin for 60 min and observed each rotating molecule for 5 min. Then buffer containing 50 μm tentoxin was infused, and the same molecules were recorded again for 5 min, 90–150 min after tentoxin addition. Subsequently, this procedure was repeated using reaction buffer with 1 mm tentoxin. To prevent the sample from drying out, fresh buffer was infused in 30-min intervals without changing the tentoxin concentration.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTime Course of Rotation in the Absence and Presence of Tentoxin—The tentoxin-sensitive thermophilic F1-ATPase TF1 βS66A showed maximal inhibition of bulk phase ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of 50 μm tentoxin. Higher inhibitor concentrations, up to the solubility maximum of 1 mm tentoxin, re-activated the enzyme (Fig. 1; see also Ref. 20Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study we examine tentoxin inhibition and reactivation of F1-ATPase on the single molecule level. In Fig. 2, time courses of the rotation of TF1 βS66A are shown that have been recorded employing the polystyrene bead detection method (21Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). As already found with bulk phase ATP hydrolysis measurements (20Groth G. Hisabori T. Lill H. Bald D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20117-20119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), introduction of the mutation βS66A per se did also not influence the rotational movement, since no significant differences were observed between TF1 βS66A and the wild-type enzyme. Rotation in the absence of tentoxin was not continuous but interrupted by pauses of varying length in the tens of seconds time scale (Fig. 2A; Ref. 25Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm tentoxin this pattern changed significantly. As depicted in Fig. 2C, the inhibitor caused a decline of the number of long pauses and substantially decreased the average slope of the traces. In the presence of 50 μm tentoxin we found a mixture of molecules with the rotation/pause pattern characteristic for the absence of tentoxin and molecules showing a strongly reduced average rotational rate (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Rotation of single F1-ATPase molecules in the absence and presence of tentoxin. Typical time courses of the rotation observed for particles in the absence of tentoxin (A), compared with different particles in the presence of 50 μm (B) and 1 mm tentoxin (C), are shown. A total of 100 particles, with two beads attached each, were recorded under each condition for a 5-min period.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ensure compatibility of single molecule observations with measurements carried out on ensembles of enzymes, we compared bulk phase ATP hydrolysis activity with the averaged rotational speed derived from single molecule assays. We calculated the average number of revolutions within the 5-min observation period for 100 particles: 225 ± 35 without tentoxin and 115 ± 15 at 1 mm tentoxin. This ratio of 100:51 is comparable with the corresponding values for hydrolysis activity in bulk phase assay, which was determined as 100:55.Extension of Observation Time Reveals Complete Stop of Rotation of F1—Earlier experiments on more sensitive F1 species indicated that tentoxin inhibition may approach a complete cease of ATP hydrolysis (18Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Munier L. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3343-3350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which should be accompanied by a complete halt of rotation. With the thermophilic mutant employed here, the onset of reactivation obscured this effect in bulk phase measurements. We therefore attempted to resolve the inhibitory and re-activating effects by buffer exchange experiments in the single molecule assay. Applying a strongly extended time frame, the same particle was first observed in the absence of tentoxin (phase 1) and subsequently in the presence of 50 μm (phase 2) and 1 mm tentoxin (phase 3). The majority of observed complexes came to a full stop in phase 2, lasting the whole observation period of 5 min (Fig. 3). This demonstrates that inhibition of F1-ATPase by tentoxin implies the anticipated complete arrest of the rotational movement. Apparently, the inhibitor molecule does not detach and rapidly re-attach to the enzyme molecule as this should lead to alternating periods of rotation and pauses. Consistent with this observation, a very low koff rate for tentoxin has been indicated by bulk phase experiments; after preincubation with 50 μm tentoxin and subsequent 50-fold dilution of aliquots in buffer either without tentoxin or containing 50 μm tentoxin, we could not detect significant differences in hydrolysis activity between the two samples for 20 min (data not shown, see also Ref. 13Santolini J. Haraux F. Sigalat C. Moal G. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the single molecule experiments shown in Fig. 3, upon further increase of the tentoxin concentration (phase 3), rotation resumed, but now in the mode already observed in Fig. 2C, i.e. at slower average speed as compared with the situation without any tentoxin present.Fig. 3Effect of tentoxin infusion on rotation. Individual F1-ATPase molecules were recorded for a 5-min period in the absence of tentoxin (phase 1). After infusion of 50 μm tentoxin and an incubation period of ∼2 h, the same particles were observed again (phase 2). Finally tentoxin addition and incubation were repeated using 1 mm tentoxin (phase 3). Trace A represents a typical result (total 14). As a control, buffer without tentoxin was infused (trace B, total 11). For details refer to “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, we identified three different modes of rotational operation: uninhibited F1 showed the highest averaged rotational speed, interrupted by a few, relative long pausing periods (phase 1, Fig. 2A, and fraction of traces in Fig. 2B). At maximal inhibition, the majority of particles completely arrests rotation (phase 2). Under conditions of reactivation, rotation resumes at lower average speed and with much lesser pausing periods (phase 3, Fig. 2C, and fraction of traces in Fig. 2B).In buffer exchange experiments, the large number of enzymes that either detached from or made nonspecific contact to the surface severely complicated quantitative examination. For these reasons we focused on data as depicted in Fig. 2 for further analysis.Re-activation Partially Restores Rotation—To address the question of how a virtually complete stop of rotation can be overruled by binding of additional inhibitor molecules to F1-ATPase, we examined a small number of revolutions displayed by single enzyme molecules at higher time resolution (Fig. 4). As in earlier experiments, in the absence of the inhibitor quasi-continuous rotation is observed (Refs. 7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 22Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, and 25Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar; Fig. 4A). In the presence of 1 mm tentoxin, the higher time resolution unraveled a strikingly different picture; short periods of rotation were interrupted by well defined stops (Fig. 4B). During rotation, there was no difference in angular speed detectable in the presence or absence of tentoxin. During stops, only Brownian motion was detectable, and resting positions were clearly located at discrete 120, 240, or 360° angular positions. The smaller apparent slope observed at lower time resolution (Fig. 2, B and C) can thus be explained by the increasing number of short pauses. Although any full revolution of F1 always involves stops of the γ subunit at the three β subunits, separated by 120° angles, at saturating ATP concentrations these three distinct stops are not resolved by this observation technique. Stop positions separated by 120° steps have been resolved, however, under conditions of ATP shortage and have thus been characterized as ATP waiting positions (24Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 26Borsch M. Diez M. Zimmermann B. Reuter R. Graber P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The speed of any particular 120° rotational step of the reactivated enzyme, a measure for the torque of the movement, was not significantly different from that of the quasi-continuous rotation of the uninhibited enzyme (cf. Fig. 4). It can thus be concluded that in the reactivated state, conversion of chemical energy provided by an ATP molecule into the mechanical energy of rotation remains as efficient as in the absence of tentoxin. Instead, the large number of short periods of inactivity suggests that the bound inhibitor molecules interfere with the process of energy delivery necessary to drive rotation, which implies binding of ATP to an empty nucleotide binding site and subsequent conformational change. We regard it as unlikely that switching from stop to rotation is due to rapid detachment and re-attachment of tentoxin to its low-affinity binding site, as we could measure reactivation in bulk phase experiments for at least 10 min after preincubation with tentoxin but without tentoxin in the ATP hydrolysis reaction mixture (data not shown). This finding also rules out that effects observed at higher tentoxin concentrations are due to competition of tentoxin molecules for just one binding site.Fig. 4Angular position of pauses. Time course traces of the rotary movement (as shown in Fig. 2) were enlarged to analyze 1–2 revolutions displayed by individual TF1 βS66A molecules within several seconds in the absence of tentoxin (A) or in the presence of 1 mm tentoxin (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tentoxin Redistributes Two Different Pause Populations— Comparable to reported values (25Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), in the absence of tentoxin the enzyme rested about 1.5% of its time in short pauses (1–4 s), tentatively attributed to the ATP waiting state (see above). This number increased to 18% in the presence of 1 mm tentoxin. As mentioned before and shown in Fig. 2, we observed an opposite effect on the long pauses (>20 s); here the resting time decreased from 40% (without tentoxin) to 16% (1 mm tentoxin).These long pauses are caused by the so-called ADP inhibited state of the enzyme (25Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This state is caused by ADP, formed by hydrolysis of ATP, which cannot detach from the enzyme, but becomes entrapped in a nucleotide-binding site (27Milgrom Y.M. Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Guerrero K.J. Xue Z.X. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16280-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Matsui T.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The decline of pauses corresponding to the ADP inhibited state in the presence of tentoxin strongly suggests that tentoxin is relieving ADP inhibition. Similar results have previously been reported for F1-ATPase in the presence lauryl-dodecyl aminoxide (25Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which also activates by relieving ADP inhibition (29Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we found that the stimulatory effect of 0.4% lauryl-dodecyl aminoxide or 100 mm potassium sulfate, another reagent known to relieve ADP inhibition (33Bald D. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Kruip J. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Moyle J. Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was strongly reduced in the presence of >50 μm tentoxin (data not shown).Tentoxin thus redistributes two different pause populations, and in this respect, re-activation is not a simple reversal of inhibition. Experiments to clarify whether the long and short pauses correspond to the same reaction intermediate or if different steps are involved are under way in our laboratory.Feasability of Single-molecule Detection Methods for Investigation of Enzyme Regulation—Our results, demonstrating that rotation ceases upon inhibition by tentoxin and resumes with new characteristics upon re-activation, underscore the importance of investigating the interactions of single enzyme molecules. Previously, we examined the redox regulation of engineered F1-ATPase and found under oxidized, inhibited conditions a high number of very long (>2 min) pauses, interrupted by periods of normal rotation, attributed to two states of the oxidized enzyme (22Bald D. Noji H. Yoshida M. Hirono-Hara Y. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39505-39507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, observations of enzyme/inhibitor interactions on the single-molecule level show that activity of an enzyme molecule can be completely blocked and subsequently recover, but with new characteristics, sheding light on so far poorly understood observations obtained from ensembles.

The members of the Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) protein family are involved in membrane dynamics and vesicular trafficking (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Arf1 is a small Ras-like guanine nucleotide-binding protein and adopts a similar fold as all other proteins of the Ras superfamily. However, Arf shows two structural elements that are missing in Ras: an extra β-strand (β2E) and an N-terminal helix (2Armor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C. Solari R. Fensome A. Thomas G.M.H. Cockroft S. Bax B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The N-terminal helix is amphipathic and myristoylated and is involved in the GTP-dependent interaction of Arf1 with membrane lipids (4Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In Arf and the corresponding Arl (Arf-like) proteins, the switch I region is located between helix α1 and strand β2, an interswitch region encompasses strands β2 and β3, and the switch II region contains the loop starting at strand β3 and the helix α2 (6Pasqualato S. Renault L. Cherfils J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Similar to Ras and other small G proteins, Arf1 switches between the GTP-bound “on” state, where it transmits signals to its effectors in the signaling pathway, and the GDP-bound “off” state. A characteristic feature of the nucleoside triphosphate form is the coordination of the γ-phosphate group of GTP with the Mg2+ ion and the amide group of Thr48 from switch I in Arf1 (7Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, the hydroxyl group of Thr48 is coordinated to the metal ion. This bond pattern seems to be essential for stabilizing the correct conformation of the effector loop for effector recognition. The molecular details of the GDP-GTP switching mechanism are largely conserved among all small G proteins as well as the general features of the activation-deactivation cycle. GDP is replaced by GTP, which is present in higher concentration in the cytoplasm, by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; DTE, dithioerythritol. The specific GEFs for Arf1, which can be subdivided into four different subfamilies containing the Gea/Gnom/GBF family, the Sec7/BIG family, the ARNO/cytohesin/GRP family, and the EFA6 family (8Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), share a common domain (Sec7) of about 200 residues, which contains the catalytic activity. The Sec7 domain is also active on a truncated form of Arf1 that lacks the first N-terminal helix of 17 residues ([Δ17]Arf1). It demonstrates that the Sec7 domain of ARNO (ARNO-Sec7) interacts with the core domain of Arf1 and not with the myristate or the N-terminal amphipathic helix (9Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, a glutamic finger hypothesis in the catalysis of GDP-GTP exchange by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARNO-Sec7 has been formulated (10Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Indeed, a specific glutamate residue, Glu156, located in the hydrophilic loop of ARNO-Sec7 helps to destabilize the GDP bound to Arf1 by displacing the Mg2+ and by repulsing the GDP β-phosphate. The conservative mutation E156D as well as the charge reversal mutation E156K reduce the exchange activity of ARNO-Sec7 on Arf1 by several orders of magnitude. In addition, ARNO-Sec7(E156K) forms a complex with the Mg2+-free form of [Δ17]Arf1·GDP without inducing the release of GDP. The published crystal structure of a complex between nucleotide-free [Δ17]Arf1 and the Sec7 domain of Gea2 supports the hypothesis of a glutamic acid finger (7Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A shift in the position of the switch 1 region in Arf1 exposes its active site to Glu156 of the Sec7 domain. This results in steric and electrostatic repulsion of the β-phosphate and the Mg2+ ion on Arf1, promoting nucleotide dissociation (7Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The molecular pathway of Arf that leads to GDP dissociation most probably involves several steps: docking, conformational change at the switch/Sec7 interface, and Mg/GDP release. These steps can be inferred from biochemical studies (e.g. brefeldin A (11Renault L. Christova P. Guibert B. Pasqualato S. Cherfils J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3605-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), membrane lipids (9Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)) but have not been trapped by crystallography. Phosphorus NMR was shown to be an alternative to characterize different steps of GTP-induced conformations in effector recognition (15Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11250-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) of small G proteins. At a millimolar concentration of protein and nucleotide used, one can detect weak ternary complexes between a small G protein, nucleotide, and exchange factor. These complexes represent critical intermediates in the nucleotide exchange pathways but can hardly be isolated, since they tend to disappear to the advantage of more stable binary complexes during purification. Thus, if one considers a simple scheme for the exchange reaction: Arf·GDP + Sec7 ⇄ ArfGDP-Sec7 ⇄ Arf-Sec7 + GDP, phosphorus NMR is an excellent method to be able to distinguish in principle the phosphorus α and β signals at each step and notably when the nucleotide encounters the catalytic machinery of the exchange factor, here the Glu finger, before being expelled. We set out to study the interaction of ARNO-Sec7 with [Δ17]Arf1 by phosphorus NMR using the wild type ARNO-Sec7 protein as well as the mutated forms E156D, E156K, and E156A. In all cases, the data suggest that stable ternary complexes of Arf1·GDP·Sec7 exist in solution in both the Mg2+-free and the Mg2+-bound form, depending on the ion concentration. Protein Expression and Purification—[Δ17]Arf1, a truncated form of Arf1, lacking the first 17 N-terminal residues, and ARNO-Sec7 (residues 50–252 of ARNO) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (5Antonny B. Béraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). After purification, [Δ17]Arf1 is complexed at 60–70% to GDP and at 30–40% to GTP as determined by tryptophan fluorescence. To shift the equilibrium toward the GDP-bound form or the GTP-bound form, the protein was incubated with an excess of GDP or GTP, respectively, in the presence of 2 mm EDTA during 15 min at 298 K with stirring. Four mm of MgCl2 was added, and the sample was loaded on a desalting column, NAP-5, and eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol in order to eliminate the free nucleotide. Preparation of the NMR Samples—31P NMR spectra of [Δ17]Arf1 complexed with guanine nucleotide were recorded in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 8.0 (buffer A). 800 μl of the sample was placed in 8-mm NMR tubes (Shigemi). The protein concentration typically varied between 0.8 and 1.9 mm. To provide a lock signal, the samples contained 10% D2O. In the study of complexes between [Δ17]Arf1 and ARNO-Sec7 protein, usually 1.8 mm [Δ17]Arf1 and different concentrations of ARNO-Sec7 solutions were added (i.e. 1.9 mm (wt), 1.28 mm (E156D), 1.3 mm (E156K), and 0.74 mm (E156A). The ARNO-Sec7 proteins added were in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.5. NMR Spectroscopy—31P NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer working at a phosphorus resonance frequency of 202 MHz. The 31P NMR spectra were indirectly referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate according to Ref. 13Maurer T. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; B113: 177-178Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar. A Ξ-value of 0.4048073561 was used, which corresponds to 85% external phosphoric acid contained in a spherical bulb. Unless noted otherwise, phosphorus spectra were recorded at a temperature of 278 K with a total spectral width of 40 ppm. For one-dimensional 31P NMR spectra, 1024–12,288 free induction decays were accumulated after excitation with a 65° (90°) pulse using a repetition time of 3–6 s. A total of 32,768 time domain data points were recorded and transformed to 32,768 real data points, corresponding to a digital resolution of 0.25 Hz/point. All data were processed on a Silicon graphics O2 work station using the software package UXNMR (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) for data processing. Phosphorus NMR spectra used for peak integration and fitting were filtered by an exponential window function causing no significant line broadening. Data Analysis—Quantitative analysis of the NMR spectra was carried out with a fitting and peak integration method, using the program Origin 6.0 from Microcal Software (Northampton, MA). First, all spectra were equally processed and scaled up or down depending on the number of scans, and a base line was determined by fitting the peak free areas with a constant. From the nonlinear fit of the more simple spectra with Lorentzian lines, the chemical shifts of the Arf1·GDP and Arf1·GTP phosphate groups were determined as accurately as possible under different free Mg2+ ion concentrations (see Table I). These values were then used as constants in the analysis of the more complicated spectra (complexes with ARNO-Sec7), where a severe overlap of lines occurred. When fitting these kinds of spectra with a multi-Lorentzian model, we tried to reproduce the measured spectrum as closely as possible and making sure at the same time that consistent line widths were used for the single components. As an example, with a growing fraction of [Δ17]Arf1·GDP bound to ARNO-Sec7, the line width increases because of a higher total correlation time of the larger complex. This approach led to satisfying results in most cases. The biggest errors resulting from this method were caused by the slight deviation of the measured signals from a strict Lorentzian line shape (in the case of separated signals, a simple integration was carried out as well in order to verify the results and to estimate the error) and especially by the bad signal to noise ratio, a problem that was not avoidable even with data acquisition times of several hours.Table I31P NMR chemical shifts of different Arf1·nucleotide complexes and Arf1 in complex with wild type and mutant ARNO-Sec7 nucleotide exchange factorsProteinNucleotideChemical shifts δαβγppmArf1Mg2+·GDP-9.66-3.66Arf1GDP-10.66-4.72Arf1Mg2+·GTP-9.58-15.23-4.91Arf1·ARNO(wt)Mg2+·GDP-9.66 (0.00)-3.16 (+0.03)Arf1·ARNO(E156D)Mg2+·GDP-9.60 (+0.06)-3.16 (+0.01)Arf1·ARNO(E156A)Mg2+·GDP-9.72 (-0.06)-3.64 (+0.02)Arf1·ARNO(E156K)Mg2+·GDP-9.71 (-0.05)-3.64 (+0.02)Arf1·ARNO(wt)GDP-10.60 (-0.04)-4.54 (0.00)Arf1·ARNO(E156D)GDP-10.60 (-0.04)-4.58 (-0.04)Arf1·ARNO(E156A)GDP-10.93 (-0.27)-4.90 (-0.46)Arf1·ARNO(E156K)GDP-10.88 (-0.22)-5.04 (-0.50) Open table in a new tab 31P NMR Spectra of the Arf1·Nucleotide Complexes—Fig. 1, a and b, shows the phosphorus NMR spectra of [Δ17]Arf1·GTP· Mg2+ and [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+, respectively. The two spectra were recorded in the presence of Mg2+ in millimolar concentrations (i.e. under conditions where the nucleotide should be completely coordinated with the metal ion). The [Δ17]Arf1·GDP spectrum (Fig. 1b) contains two strong lines at –9.66 and –3.66 ppm corresponding to the α- and β-phosphate group of bound GDP (Table I). The spectrum of Arf1·GTP·Mg2+ (Fig. 1a) shows the expected three phosphorus lines of bound GTP at –9.58, –15.23, and –4.91 ppm. For both [Δ17]Arf1·GTP and [Δ17]Arf1·GDP, additional peaks were observed. By their size and position, these peaks could be assigned easily to free phosphate and contaminating [Δ17]Arf·GDP or [Δ17]Arf1·GTP. Usually proteins with a single high affinity site for guanine nucleotides show only one resonance line for each phosphorus atom of a phosphate group if they occur in only one conformational state (Table I). Because only one set of resonance lines is observable for [Δ17]Arf1·GTP and [Δ17]Arf1·GDP, we concluded that Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ and Arf1·GTP·Mg2+ exist predominantly in a single (NMR-distinguishable) conformational state, in contrast to other small G proteins such as Ran or Ras. This is true for the whole temperature range from 277 to 303 K studied, where no indication for a second conformational state could be obtained from NMR spectroscopy. Sec7 domains are believed to expel the bound GDP from Arf1 in part by destabilizing the bound Mg2+. Therefore, it was important to record the phosphorus NMR spectrum of isolated [Δ17]Arf1·GDP in the absence of Mg2+. Fig. 1c shows the phosphorus NMR spectrum of [Δ17]Arf1·GDP after complexation of Mg2+ with 2 mm EDTA (leaving ∼1 μm free Mg2+ in solution). Two new resonances appear at –10.56 and –4.54 ppm corresponding to the α- and β-phosphate group of bound GDP in Mg2+-free [Δ17]Arf1·GDP (Fig. 1c). The removal of Mg2+ is not perfect, since the resonance lines assigned previously to [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ are weakened but still visible. Note that the signal of the β-phosphate resonance of [Δ17]Arf1·GTP· Mg2+ (which is present as a contaminating species here) is not influenced much by the addition of EDTA, suggesting that the magnesium ion is not removed from the complex as to be expected from the higher affinity of Mg2+ for Arf1·GTP than for Arf1·GDP. 31P NMR Spectra of Wild Type ARNO-Sec7 Complexed with Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ or Arf1·GDP—Fig. 2 shows the 31P-NMR spectra of wild type ARNO-Sec7 titrated with increasing concentrations of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+. As was to be expected, ARNO-Sec7(wt) was not detected by 31P NMR, and the 31P signals of the α- and β-phosphate grew in proportion to the increasing fraction of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ added. No larger shifts of the resonance lines of bound GDP are observed in the presence of ARNO-Sec7 (Table I), which would allow the unequivocal assignment of the resonances of the putative Arf1·GDP·Mg2+-ARNO-Sec7 complex. With the molecular mass of 22,413 Da of ARNO-Sec7, the T2 relaxation rate of bound GDP should increase in the rigid body approximation by a factor of 2.1, which represents a rather small difference in line width for distinguishing between free Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ and Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ complexed with ARNO-Sec7. The total line width at half height of the α-phosphate and the β-phosphate lines increased from 60 to 86 Hz, respectively, when the Arf1 to ARNO-Sec7 concentration was 0.84 (Fig. 2d). This means that there is an interaction between the two proteins under our conditions. The detailed analysis of the spectra reveals that at least the β-phosphate line is not homogeneous but consists of a broader, slightly downfield shifted component and a component with virtually the same line width as free Arf1·GDP·Mg2+. The analysis of the α-phosphate line is difficult because it is superposed by the α-phosphate line of Arf1·GTP·Mg2+. When fitting the β-phosphate resonance with this assumption, one obtains a transverse relaxation time of 1.27 ms for complex of Arf1·GDP· Mg2+ with ARNO-Sec7 and of 5.25 ms for free Arf1·GDP·Mg2+. This means that in the presence of ARNO-Sec7 exchange broadening occurs (in the absence of ARNO-Sec7, T2 is about 4 times larger; see above). At a ratio of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ to ARNO-Sec7 of 0.84 the relative population of the free Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ to the complexed one would be 0.43 (i.e. the association constant would be on the order of 0.1 mm). At a ratio of 0.84 and 1.7 of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ to ARNO-Sec7, the signal of the β-phosphate resonance of a small amount of free GDP (partly complexed with Mg2+) becomes visible at –5.78 ppm. In addition, the concentration of free inorganic phosphate increases in the sample. This is only seen in the case of the wild-type ARNO-Sec7 and with none of the mutants. A number of explanations seem to be reasonable to account for the free Pi. 1) A contaminating phosphatase is present in the sample (Arf or Sec7 domain), which would hydrolyze GDP as soon as it dissociates from Arf1 upon the action of the nucleotide exchange factor. This would in fact imply the increase of GMP as a separate phosphorus line in our NMR spectra that cannot be seen. 2) Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ exists partly as Arf1·GDP·Pi Mg2+ in solution, and only the catalytically active Sec7-wt domain can expel the Mg2+, the Pi, and the GDP. Again, even here we would expect a separate additional phosphorus signal for protein-bound Pi, which could be severely exchange-broadened beyond detection. A quantitative analysis of the data leads to the conclusion that GDP and Pi are released from Arf1 by ARNO-Sec7, since the increase of its signal is not completely explained by the free Pi and GDP contained in the Arf1 samples added. Fig. 3a shows a spectrum of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ in complex with ARNO-Sec7. After complexing of Mg2+ ions by the addition of EDTA, the signals originating from Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ complexed with ARNO-Sec7 disappear and are replaced by new signals at –10.60 and –4.54 ppm at positions close to those of magnesium-free Arf1·GDP (Fig. 4a). The resonance positions do not deviate significantly from those observed for Arf1·GDP in the absence of the exchange factor (Table I). However, the resonance lines are significantly broadened, which is indicative for an interaction of Arf1·GDP with ARNO-Sec7. A simulation of the data leads to a relaxation time of 2.61 ms for the β-phosphate resonance (i.e. the relaxation time decreases by a factor of 1.7 in the presence of ARNO-Sec7).Fig. 4The complex of ARNO-Sec7 mutants with Arf1·GDP in the absence of magnesium ions.

Thus, the molar ratio of Arf1 to ARNO-Sec7 was held constant at 1.0/1.2. Note that in spectrum d, the Arf1 solution used contained free GDP (∼0.5 mm) before the addition of the exchange factor. α-GDP and β-GDP, resonances of the α- and β-phosphate groups of GDP; α-GDPArf1 and β-GDPArf1, resonances of the α- and β-phosphate groups of GDP bound to Arf1; α-GDPComp and β-GDPComp, resonances of the α- and β-phosphate groups of GDP bound to Arf1-ARNO-Sec7; α-Mg·GTPArf1, β-Mg·GTPArf1, and γ-Mg·GTPArf1, resonances of the α-, β-, and γ-phosphate groups of Mg·GTP bound to Arf1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 31P NMR Spectra of Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ Complexed with Mutants of ARNO-Sec7—A similar behavior is observed for ARNO-Sec7(E156D), which still contains a negatively charged side chain at the position of the glutamate finger but shortened by one methylene unit (Fig. 3b). Again, the NMR signals are indicative for a superposition of resonance lines of free [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ and [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+-ARNO-Sec7(E156D). The resonances of bound Mg2+·GDP do not shift much but become broadened and clearly inhomogeneous. A broader component of the ARNO-Sec7 complex is especially well visible for the β-phosphate resonance, which shows a clear downfield shifted shoulder at –3.16 ppm. As discussed above, the main difference between wild type ARNO-Sec7 and the E156D mutant is actually at the level of free GDP and Pi, which suggests that the mutant does not dissociate GDP from Arf1. Replacing the glutamate in ARNO-Sec7 by the uncharged amino acid alanine leads to more dramatic changes in the spectrum; a pair of new lines is created at positions similar but not identical to those of magnesium-free Arf1·GDP, which indicates that in the complex with ARNO-Sec7(E156A), part of the bound Mg2+ ions are released (Fig. 3c). The addition of ARNO-Sec7(E156A) does not result in an inhomogeneity of β-phosphate of line [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+, which was identified as the complex of [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ with ARNO-Sec7 in the case of the wild type protein. However, the lines corresponding to the [Δ17]Arf1·GDP can only arise from its complex with the ARNO-Sec-7 mutant, since they can only be observed in the presence of this mutant and are significantly shifted and broadened (T2 of the α-phosphate and β-phosphate resonances increases to 2.71 ms for both). Qualitatively, the line broadening effect can be seen when comparing the virtually unperturbed lines of [Δ17]Arf1·GTP·Mg2+ with the lines of bound GDP in the presence of ARNO-Sec7. As a consequence of the E156A mutation, we can hypothesize that residue 156 can expel the Mg2+ through its first CH2 group of the side chain. An interesting mutation at position 156 can be created by substituting the negatively charged glutamate by a positively charged lysine. As in the case of the alanine mutant, a complex with magnesium-free Arf1·GDP can be detected. In addition, strong signals of free GDP (partly complexed with Mg2+) at –5.67 and –10.35 ppm are visible in the spectrum. However, these signals originate from free GDP already present in the [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ sample before adding the exchange factor. As seen in the Ala case, additional signals appear compared with wild type ARNO-Sec7, which can be assigned to the magnesium-free complex of [Δ17]Arf1·GDP·ARNO-Sec7(E156K) (Fig. 3d). The positively charged side chain lysine seems to weaken the Mg2+ ion bound to the Arf protein by electrostatic interaction leading to magnesium-free complex. Since the interaction with ARNO-Sec7 influences the Mg2+ binding to [Δ17]Arf1·GDP, a set of measurements was performed in the presence of 2 mm EDTA that should establish a concentration of free magnesium of ∼1 μm (Fig. 4). As to be expected at low magnesium concentration, the equilibrium between Arf1·GDP and Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ is shifted to the magnesium-free complex of Arf1·GDP. The resonances of α- and β-phosphate groups of bound, magnesium-free GDP are observable at –10.60 and –4.54 ppm. The complexes with wild type and ARNO-Sec7 mutants are characterized by small shift changes (Table I) and a clear line broadening. Note that the used concentrations of EDTA are not sufficient to remove significant amounts of magnesium from Arf1·GTP·Mg2+, since its signals are not perturbed. In the spectrum of Arf1·GDP in the presence of ARNO-Sec7(E156K), strong signals of free GDP are visible at –5.67 and –10.35 ppm. However, this free GDP was already present as impurity in the Arf1 solution used in this case (see above). High free magnesium shifts the equilibrium between Arf1·GDP and Arf1·GDP·Mg2+ also in the presence of wild type ARNO-Sec7 and the ARNO mutants E156D and E156A completely to the magnesium-bound population (data not shown). An exception is the mutant E156K, where even the presence of 9 mm free magnesium is not sufficient to shift the equilibrium of the Arf1-ARNO complex completely to the magnesium-containing state. 31P NMR Spectra of Arf1·GTP·Mg2+ in the Presence of ARNO-Sec7—Arf1·Mg2+·GTP exhibits the resonances of the bound GTP at –9.58, –15.23, and –4.91 ppm (Fig. 1). In the presence of wild type ARNO-Sec7, no shift changes or line broadenings are observable, indicating that under the concentrations used, the population of the complex with ARNO-Sec7 is very low. Consistently, no GTP is released and observable as free GTP in the spectra. Further evidence is provided by a detailed examination of the corresponding 1H NMR spectra, which can be deconvoluted into the single component 1H NMR spectra of Arf1·GTP·Mg2+ and ARNO-Sec7(wt) (data not shown) without showing a sign of the formation of the ternary complex. The Arf1-Nucleotide Complexes—31P NMR spectroscopy of the protein-bound nucleotides can give information about the environment of the reporter nuclei in the phosphate moieties of GDP and GTP and can thus be used for the detection of conformational changes and conformational equilibria involving the phosphate environment. As shown earlier by 31P NMR spectroscopy, Ras·GDP·Mg2+ exists in two conformational states in solution whose relative population can be changed by mutations in the effector loop (Thr35) or in the phosphate binding pocket (Gly12) (19Rohrer M. Prisner T.F. Brügmann O. Käss H. Spoerner M. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that such a conformational equilibrium also exists in the Arf1·GDP·Mg2+. However, the resonance shifts corresponding to the two states in Ras are rather small (0.05 ppm for"
https://openalex.org/W2141485714,"The four Sendai virus C-proteins (C′, C, Y1, and Y2) represent an N-terminal nested set of non-structural proteins whose expression modulates both the readout of the viral genome and the host cell response. In particular, they modulate the innate immune response by perturbing the signaling of type 1 interferons. The initiation codons for the four C-proteins have been mapped in vitro, and it has been proposed that the Y proteins are initiated by ribosomal shunting. A number of mutations were reported that significantly enhanced Y expression, and this was attributed to increased shunt-mediated initiation. However, we demonstrate that this arises due to enhanced proteolytic processing of C′, an event that requires its very N terminus. Curiously, although Y expression in vitro is mediated almost exclusively by initiation, Y proteins in vivo can arise both by translation initiation and processing of the C′ protein. To our knowledge this is the first example of two apparently independent pathways leading to the expression of the same polypeptide chain. This dual pathway explains several features of Y expression."
