https://openalex.org/W1968455698,"The higher order folding process of the catalytic RNA derived from the self-splicing intron of Tetrahymena thermophila was monitored with the use of Fe(II)-EDTA-induced free radical chemistry. The overall tertiary structure of the RNA molecule forms cooperatively with the uptake of at least three magnesium ions. Local folding transitions display different metal ion dependencies, suggesting that the RNA tertiary structure assembles through a specific folding intermediate before the catalytic core is formed. Enzymatic activity, assayed with an RNA substrate that is complementary to the catalytic RNA active site, coincides with the cooperative structural transition. The higher order RNA foldings produced by Mg(II), Ca(II), and Sr(II) are similar; however, only the Mg(II)-stabilized RNA is catalytically active. Thus, these results directly demonstrate that divalent metal ions participate in general folding of the ribozyme tertiary structure, and further indicate a more specific involvement of Mg(II) in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1524139871,"Human low density lipoprotein was oxidized (Ox-LDL) by exposure to 5 microM Cu2+ and its fate in vivo was compared to acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL). Ox-LDL, when injected into rats, is rapidly removed from the blood circulation by the liver, similarly as Ac-LDL. A separation of rat liver cells into parenchymal, endothelial, and Kupffer cells at 10 min after injection of Ox-LDL or Ac-LDL indicated that the Kupffer cell uptake of Ox-LDL is 6.8-fold higher than for Ac-LDL, leading to Kupffer cells as the main liver site for Ox-LDL uptake. In vitro studies with isolated liver cells indicated that saturable high affinity sites for Ox-LDL were present on both endothelial and Kupffer cells, whereby the capacity of Kupffer cells to degrade Ox-LDL is 6-fold higher than for endothelial cells. Competition studies showed that unlabeled Ox-LDL competed as efficiently (90%) as unlabeled Ac-LDL with the cell association and degradation of 125I-labeled Ac-LDL by endothelial and Kupffer cells. However, unlabeled Ac-LDL competed only partially (20-30%) with the cell association and degradation of 125I-labeled Ox-LDL by Kupffer cells, while unlabeled Ox-LDL or polyinosinic acid competed for 70-80%. It is concluded that the liver contains, in addition to the scavenger (Ac-LDL) receptor which interacts efficiently with both Ac-LDL and Ox-LDL and which is concentrated on endothelial cells, an additional specific Ox-LDL receptor which is highly concentrated on Kupffer cells. In vivo the specific Ox-LDL recognition site on Kupffer cells will form the major protection system against the occurrence of the atherogenic Ox-LDL particles in the blood."
https://openalex.org/W2112426955,"Pseudomonas oleovorans accumulates poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) after growth on medium chain length hydrocarbons. Large amounts of this polyester are synthesized when cells are grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. When nitrogen is resupplied in the medium, the accumulated PHA is degraded. In this paper, we describe mutants which are defective in the synthesis or in the degradation of PHA. These mutants were used to select DNA fragments which encode PHA polymerases and a PHA depolymerase. A 25-kilobase (kb) DNA fragment was isolated from P. oleovorans that complements a Pseudomonas putida mutant unable to accumulate PHA. Subcloning resulted in the assignment of a 6.4-kb EcoRI fragment as the pha locus, containing genetic information for PHA synthesis. Mutants in the PHA degradation pathway were also complemented by this fragment, indicating that genes encoding PHA biosynthetic and degradative enzymes are clustered. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the 6.4-kb fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames encoding PHA polymerases based on homology to the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) polymerase from Alcaligenes eutrophus. A third open reading frame complemented the PHA degradation mutation and is likely to encode a PHA depolymerase. The presence of two PHA polymerases is due to a 2098-base pair DNA duplication. The PHA polymerases are 53% identical and show 35-40% identity to the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) polymerase. No clear difference in specificity was found for the PHA polymerases. However, with the pha locus cloned on a multicopy vector, a polymer was accumulated that contains a significantly higher amount of substrate-derived monomers. An increase in the rate of polyester synthesis versus oxidation of the monomers in the beta-oxidation explains these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1514947270,"Membrane anchoring of tissue factor (TF), the cell receptor for coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa), exemplifies an effective mechanism to localize proteolysis at the cell surface. A recombinant TF mutant (TF1-219), deleted of membrane spanning and intracellular domains, was used to evaluate the role of phospholipid interactions for assembly of substrate with the catalytic TF.VIIa complex. TF1-219 was secreted by cells rather than expressed as a cell membrane protein. Unlike free VIIa, TF1-219 as well as the TF1-219.VIIa complex demonstrated no stable association with phospholipid. In the absence of lipid, kinetic evaluation of substrate factor X cleavage by free VIIa, TF.VIIa, and TF1-219.VIIa suggests that the catalytic function of VIIa rather than substrate recognition is enhanced by complex formation. Furthermore, compared with free factor X, factor X on phospholipid was preferentially cleaved as a substrate by TF1-219.VIIa. TF-dependent initiation of the coagulation protease cascades thus involves an enhancement of the activation of factor X on the cell surface by a crucial role of the TF transmembrane domain to membrane anchor the reaction, by the TF extracellular domain to provide protein-protein interactions with VIIa to enhance the activity of the catalytic domain of VIIa, and the preferential presentation of factor X as a substrate when associated with phospholipid surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2005356879,"An in vitro assay for the interaction of SecB, a molecular chaperone from Escherichia coli, with polypeptide ligands was established based on the ability of SecB to block the refolding of denatured maltose-binding protein. Competition experiments show that SecB binds selectively to nonnative proteins with high affinity and without specificity for a particular sequence of amino acids. It is proposed that selectivity in binding is due to a kinetic partitioning of polypeptides between folding and association with SecB."
https://openalex.org/W2086929901,"Encephalitogenic T cells specific for myelin basic protein share common V beta 8 peptide sequences in their T cell receptor (TCR) that can induce autoregulatory T cells and antibodies that prevent clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It is not known, however, if TCR peptides can treat established disease. To test its therapeutic value, TCR-V beta 8-39-59 peptide was injected into rats with clinical signs of EAE. This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery. Similarly, human TCR peptides may be effective in enhancing natural regulation of autoreactive T cells that share common V genes."
https://openalex.org/W2094860959,"Fractionation of transcription extracts has led to the identification of multiple transcription factors specific for each form of nuclear RNA polymerase. Accurate transcription in vitro of the yeast U6 RNA gene by RNA polymerase C requires at least two factors. One of them was physically and functionally indistinguishable from transcription factor IID (TFIID or BTF1), a pivotal component of polymerase B transcription complexes, which binds to the TATA element. Purified yeast TFIID (yIID) or bacterial extracts that contained recombinant yIID were equally competent to direct specific transcription of the U6 gene by RNA polymerase C. The results suggest the formation of a hybrid transcription machinery, which may imply an evolutionary relation between class B and class C transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1496422977,"The pairing of the half-cysteine residues of human prostatic acid phosphatase was established by proteolytic digestion and analysis of the resulting peptide mixtures by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). An independently derived, full length cDNA clone was used as the basis for the interpretation of the FAB-MS data. The sequence of the native protein is that predicted from the present cDNA sequence, except for the carboxyl-terminal end and some possible post-translational deamidations. Isolated human prostatic acid phosphatase was found to have multiple carboxyl-terminal ends, terminating in Thr, Glu, and Asp, corresponding to residues 349-351 of the 354-residue protein that is predicted from the cDNA sequence after removal of a leader peptide. The protein contains no free sulfhydryl groups. The identical monomer chains of the dimeric native enzyme are found to contain three disulfide bonds, specifically Cys-129 to Cys-340, Cys-183 to Cys-281, and Cys-315 to Cys-319. In view of the conserved positions of cysteines in the homologous human and rat liver lysosomal acid phosphatases, an identical disulfide bonding pattern may be predicted for those proteins. The location of a potential antigenic site was established by selective labeling of proximate tyrosine residues predicted to be on the surface. A conserved RHGXRXP sequence is present in the prostatic, lysosomal, Escherichia coli, and yeast acid phosphatases and is predicted to be of mechanistic significance. In addition, residue Arg-54 is shown to be an active site residue by reaction of the enzyme with phenylglyoxal. Interestingly, this residue is present in a sequence RXRY (R,H) that is also present in lysosomal phosphatase and in recently described protein tyrosine phosphatases."
https://openalex.org/W1645918562,"The regulation by glucose and insulin of the muscle-specific facilitative glucose transport system GLUT-4 was investigated in L6 muscle cells in culture. Hexose transport activity, mRNA expression, and the subcellular localization of the GLUT-4 protein were analyzed. As observed previously (Walker, P. S., Ramlal, T., Sarabia, V., Koivisto, U.-M., Bilan, P. J., Pessin, J. E., and Klip, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1516-1523), 24 h of glucose starvation and 24 h of insulin treatment each increase glucose transport activity severalfold. Here we report a differential regulation of the GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 transport systems under these conditions. (a) The level of GLUT-4 mRNA was not affected by glucose starvation and was diminished by prolonged (24 h) administration of insulin; in contrast, the level of GLUT-1 mRNA was elevated under both conditions. (b) Glucose starvation and prolonged insulin administration increased the amount of both GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 proteins in the plasma membrane. (c) In intracellular membranes, glucose starvation elevated, and prolonged insulin administration reduced, the GLUT-4 protein content. In contrast, the GLUT-1 protein content in these membranes decreased with glucose starvation and increased with insulin treatment. Glucose transport was rapidly curbed upon refeeding glucose to glucose-starved cells, with half-maximal reversal after 30 min and maximal reversal after 4 h. This was followed by a marked decrease in the levels of GLUT-1 mRNA without major changes in GLUT-4 mRNA. Neither 2-deoxy-D-glucose nor 3-O-methyl-D-glucose could substitute for D-glucose in these effects. It is proposed that glucose and insulin differentially regulate the two glucose transport systems in L6 muscle cells and that the rapid down-regulation of hexose transport activity by glucose is regulated by post-translational mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1564741789,"Abstract We investigated the possibility that insulin could stimulate translation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA in a murine fibroblast cell line that expresses large numbers of human insulin receptors (HIR 3.5 cells). Within 3 h after exposure to 70 nM insulin, ODC enzyme activity increased approximately 50-fold and mRNA accumulation 3-fold in the HIR 3.5 cells but not in normal fibroblasts. Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide completely inhibited insulin-stimulated ODC expression; actinomycin D partially inhibited this effect. To determine the influence of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of ODC mRNA on insulin-regulated ODC expression, plasmids were constructed which contained sequences from the 5'UTR of a rat ODC mRNA interposed between the ferritin promoter and the coding region of the human growth hormone gene. These constructions were then expressed transiently in HIR 3.5 cells. Insulin stimulated a 2-4-fold change in growth hormone accumulation in the medium of cells transiently expressing plasmids containing the entire 5'UTR of ODC mRNA or just the 5'-most 115 bases, a G/C-rich conserved sequence predicted to form a stem-loop structure and shown previously to be responsible for constitutive inhibition of translation. There was a direct correlation between the extent of insulin stimulation and the predicted secondary structure of the added 5'UTR sequences. To determine whether this effect might be due to insulin activation of initiation factors responsible for melting mRNA secondary structure, we examined the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation states of two such factors, eucaryotic initiation factors eIF-4B and eIF-4E. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of both initiation factors; this stimulation was evident at 15 min and maximal by 60 min. These results suggest a potential general mechanism by which insulin could preferentially stimulate translation of mRNAs whose 5'UTRs exhibit significant secondary structure by activating initiation factors involved in melting such secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W1589962811,The sequence of ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.7.1) mRNA from maize has been determined. Complementary DNAs were isolated from a cDNA library of light-induced leaf poly(A)+ RNA constructed in an expression vector. An open reading frame beginning at an ATG codon at nucleotide 328 of the longest cDNA (5617-bases long) encoded 1616 amino acid residues. The amino terminus of the purified mature enzyme coincided with the cysteine residue at position 98 of the predicted sequence. This enzyme is homologous with the large subunit of Escherichia coli NADPH-dependent glutamate synthase having about 42% identical residues between the two proteins. The enzyme also contains a short region similar to a potential FMN-binding region of yeast flavocytochrome b2. The cDNA hybridizes to an RNA band about 5.5 kilobases whose steady-state level is markedly increased upon illumination of etiolated maize seedlings. Analysis of genomic DNA indicates the presence of a single-copy gene for ferredoxin glutamate synthase in maize.

https://openalex.org/W1507367690,"Human neutrophils have been labeled in 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine with 3H in both the alkyl chain and the choline moiety. Upon stimulation of these labeled cells with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, C5a, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, phospholipase D is activated to produce 1-O-[3H]alkylphosphatidic acid ([3H]alkyl-PA) and [3H]choline. The [3H]alkyl-PA is then dephosphorylated by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PPH) to produce 1-O-[3H]alkyldiglyceride ([3H]alkyl-DG). Sphingosine, a sphingoid base known to inhibit protein kinase C (PKC), causes a dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]alkyl-DG formation. This inhibition is accompanied by increased accumulation of [3H]alkyl-PA without alterations in [3H]choline formation. Studies using various other sphingoid bases demonstrate that a long hydrocarbon chain and an amino group are required for the inhibition of DG formation. These results suggest that sphingoid bases inhibit PPH activity without altering phospholipase D activation and that they exhibit a similar structure-activity relationship for both PPH and PKC. K252a, a PKC inhibitor which acts by competing for ATP binding sites, does not inhibit the formation of [3H]alkyl-DG, [3H]alkyl-PA, or [3H]choline at a concentration (3 microM) that completely blocks phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced protein phosphorylation. Moreover, in neutrophil homogenates, sphingosine but not octylamine, inhibits PPH activity in a dose-dependent manner. Thus sphingosine inhibits PPH activity by a PKC-independent mechanism, raising the possibility that sphingoid bases may play a role in regulating PPH-mediated lipid metabolism in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577781729,"We report the complete primary structures, as deduced from cloned cDNAs, of two catalytic (alpha and alpha') and one beta subunit of chicken casein kinase II. The alpha and alpha' subunits are closely related to each other but differ in their carboxyl termini; moreover, minor differences are distributed throughout the entire lengths of the two proteins, indicating that they are derived from separate genes. Comparison of the chicken protein sequences with those of their mammalian homologs reveals a high degree of evolutionary conservation of all three subunits. Northern analyses were carried out to study the expression of casein kinase II subunits during chicken embryonic development as well as in adult tissues. A single transcript migrating at 1 kilobase was detected when using a beta-specific probe, but multiple transcripts ranging in size from 1.45 to 2.8 kilobase were revealed by alpha- and alpha'-specific probes. Expression of mRNA for all three subunits was high in early embryos but decreased substantially during embryonic development. A comparative analysis of casein kinase II expression in different adult tissues revealed two major findings. First, relative levels of expression of the two catalytic subunits displayed a pronounced tissue specificity, consistent with the possibility that alpha and alpha' subunits may carry out specialized functions. Second, no correlation was observed between levels of transcripts for the catalytic subunits and those of mRNA for the beta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1504519185,"Mitochondrial NADP(H)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP1) was purified from yeast cells grown with acetate as a carbon source. IDP1 was shown to be a dimer with a subunit molecular weight of approximately 45,000. Immunochemical levels of IDP1 were found to vary in inverse proportion with those of mitochondrial NAD(H)-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase in cells grown with glucose or with acetate as a carbon source. A 20-residue amino-terminal sequence was obtained for IDP1, and degenerate oligonucleotides were used to synthesize a 50-base pair polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to the coding region for a portion of the amino terminus. The 50-base pair DNA fragment was used as a hybridization probe to identify plasmids containing the IDP1 gene in a yeast genomic DNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence of the IDP1 coding region was determined and translated into a 412-residue amino acid sequence for the mature protein which is preceded by a putative 16-residue mitochondrial targeting presequence. A haploid yeast strain containing a chromosomal disruption of the IDP1 locus was constructed and found to be capable of growth with glucose but not with other carbon sources, suggesting that IDP1 provides a critical function and may be the primary source of NADPH in yeast mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1552976844,"Complementary DNAs encoding a preproinsulin-like growth factor (prepro-IGF) have been cloned from a primitive vertebrate species, the Atlantic hagfish, by using a DNA amplification strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction. A composite sequence containing a 414-nucleotide open reading frame encoding 138 amino acids and 164 nucleotides in the 3'-untranslated region was obtained. The deduced partial sequence of hagfish prepro-IGF reveals that it is organized like the mammalian prepro-IGFs with an unusually large (greater than 39-amino acid) signal peptide (initiator methionine residue is missing), 29-amino acid B, 15-amino acid C, 21-amino acid A, 10-amino acid D, and 26-amino acid E domains. All the invariant residues necessary to form the correct tertiary fold of an insulin-like molecule have been conserved in hagfish IGF. Sequence comparisons revealed that the A and B domains of hagfish IGF are equally similar to those of human IGF-I (35 out of 50 amino acids) or IGF-II (37 out of 53 amino acids). In contrast, the similarity between hagfish and mammalian pro-IGFs in the C, D, and E domains is relatively low. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from hagfish brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and islet organ, however, indicated that hagfish IGF, like mammalian IGF-I, is expressed predominantly in the liver as a 4.2-kilobase transcript. DNA blot analysis revealed that hagfish IGF is a single copy gene. The predicted sequence of hagfish prepro-IGF thus demonstrates that the divergence of the IGF and insulin genes occurred prior to the separation of the Agnatha and that the organization and tertiary structure of IGF have been well maintained throughout 550 million years of vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1839608683,"The mechanisms underlying neuronal adaptation to ethanol are poorly understood but appear to involve alterations in cellular membrane structure and/or function. Using a two-dimensional gel analysis, we have recently identified Hsc70 as an ethanol-responsive gene (Miles, M.F. (1989) Neurology 39, (Suppl. 1), 425). Hsc70 is a constitutive member of the 70-kDa stress protein family which plays an important role in protein trafficking and coated vesicle processing. Thus, modulation of Hsc70 by ethanol could produce widespread changes in cellular membrane functioning. Here, we report a detailed study on the regulation of Hsc70 by ethanol in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that ethanol concentrations observed in actively drinking alcoholics caused an induction of Hsc70 mRNA and protein. Increases in Hsc70 mRNA were seen as early as 4 h after exposure to ethanol. In comparison with ethanol, propanol and butanol caused proportionally greater increases in Hsc70 mRNA. This is consistent with known anesthetic and intoxicating potencies of these aliphatic alcohols and suggested that lipophilicity, rather than an osmotic effect, was critical for ethanol induction of Hsc70. Induction of Hsc70 mRNA by ethanol resulted, at least in part, from increased Hsc70 gene transcription as determined by nuclear runoff studies. Stable transfection analysis revealed an ethanol-responsive cis-acting element in the proximal 2500 base pairs of the Hsc70 promoter. Regulation of Hsc70 by 50-200 mM ethanol appeared to be a specific change in expression of an ethanol-responsive gene rather than a typical stress protein response since no induction of the highly inducible stress protein, Hsp70, was seen at these ethanol concentrations. These results suggest that ethanol-induced changes in Hsc70 transcription may be important for neuronal adaptation to ethanol and the development of tolerance and dependence in alcoholics."
https://openalex.org/W1563156486,"The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II can be phosphorylated by a p34cdc2/CDC28-containing CTD kinase. Phosphorylated serine (or threonine) is located at positions 2 and 5 in the repetitive heptapeptide consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. We show here that phosphorylation of the mouse CTD retards its electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in a way similar to that observed for the II0 form of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated in vivo. At the maximum level of phosphorylation by CTD kinase in vitro, there are 15-20 phosphates evenly distributed among the 52 heptapeptide repeats that comprise the mouse CTD. Gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that phosphorylation induces a dramatic conformational change in the CTD with the phosphorylated form adopting a far more extended structure than the unphosphorylated CTD."
https://openalex.org/W1583494683,"The complete primary structure of a galactose-specific lectin contained in the venom of the rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox, was determined. The lectin is composed of two covalently linked, identical subunits, each consisting of 135 amino acid residues. Under physiological conditions the lectin proved to be highly aggregated. The venom lectin contained 9 half-cystines, 8 of which formed four intrasubunit disulfide bridges (Cys3-Cys14, Cys31-Cys131, Cys38-Cys133, and Cys106-Cys123), while Cys86 was involved in an intersubunit disulfide bridge. Because of the high content of disulfide bridges, the intact lectin was extremely resistant to tryptic digestion. The determined amino acid sequence was found to be homologous with those of the so-called carbohydrate recognition domains of Ca2(+)-dependent-type lectins in animal. Among them, 8 amino acid residues (Cys31, Gly69, Trp92, Pro97, Cys106, Asp120, Cys123, and Cys131) were completely conserved. Leu40, Trp67, and Trp81 were also well conserved. The rattlesnake venom lectin showed high hemagglutinating activity. These results, together with the occurrence of similar lectins in crotalid venoms, suggest that these lectins have evolved in order to make the venom a more effective weapon to capture prey animals."
https://openalex.org/W1534272867,"Abstract Alloxan exhibits the most potent diabetogenicity and has been used for induction of experimental diabetes mellitus. Understanding the mechanisms of action of the typical diabetogenic agent is important for elucidating the causes of diabetes. Okamoto (Okamoto, H. (1985) BioEssays 2, 15-21) proposed a model in which DNA fragmentation plays an important role for the development of diabetes. This DNA fragmentation is supposed to result from the accumulation of superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, direct evidence for this accumulation is lacking. Using rat pancreatic islets, we demonstrated that alloxan stimulated H2O2 generation, which induced DNA strand breaks. These findings support Okamoto's proposal that alloxan induces diabetes through the following biochemical events: alloxan----H2O2 generation----DNA strand breaks----diabetes mellitus. Perhaps this report constitutes the first demonstration of alloxan-stimulated H2O2 generation which could conceivably act as an intermediate for alloxan-induced DNA strand breaks."
https://openalex.org/W1575215033,"The present study was undertaken to determine if the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor may be phosphorylated, and to gain insight into its regulation. For this, the ATP pool of rat pancreatic acini was prelabeled with 32P, and the cells were stimulated with various secretagogues. CCK receptors from treated cells were enriched by sequential fractionation to produce plasmalemma, and subsequent solubilization and lectin-affinity chromatography. This protocol detected a phosphorylated Mr = 85,000-95,000 plasma membrane glycoprotein with features similar to the CCK receptor. Phosphorylation of this protein occurred rapidly (less than 2 min) and in a concentration-dependent manner in response to CCK, and was inhibited by the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Further evidence that this represented the CCK receptor included comigration of phosphorylated and CCK radioligand affinity-labeled proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, both in native forms and after endoglycosidase F deglycosylation, and the specific adsorption of the phosphoprotein to a CCK analogue affinity resin. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly on serine residues of the receptor protein. Phosphorylation of this protein was also enhanced in response to other secretagogues which, like CCK, stimulate a cascade leading to protein kinase C activation, and in response to direct activation of this enzyme by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Thus, the pancreatic CCK receptor is phosphorylated in a regulated manner, in response to both homologous and heterologous secretagogues, and to protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1512258266,"Coagulation factor X is a multidomain proenzyme of a serine protease. Calcium ions bind to the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues and to a site in the NH2-terminal of two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. To study structure-function relationships in the NH2-terminal part of factor X and to determine the structure of isolated domains, we have developed methods that allow the subsequent isolation of the first or both EGF-like domains with or without an attached Gla domain from controlled proteolytic digests of the protein. The Ca2(+)-induced changes of the intrinsic protein fluorescence were measured to elucidate whether the isolated fragments retain their native conformation. Changes in the fluorescence caused by Ca2+ binding were found to result from perturbations of the environment of the Trp residue in position 41. Calcium ion binding to the Gla-containing region linked to the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain was identical with that to intact factor X, indicating a native orientation of the ligand binding groups in the fragment. In contrast, the isolated Gla peptide had a lower affinity for Ca2+, suggesting that the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain serves as a scaffold for the folding of the Gla region. Similarly, the presence of the Gla region was found to increase the affinity of the Gla-independent site in the first EGF-like domain for Ca2+. The metal ion-induced resistance against chymotryptic cleavage COOH-terminal of Tyr-44 in intact factor X is similar in the isolated fragment that contains the Gla region linked to one EGF-like domain, indicating a native conformation of the fragment in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, the Gla-independent metal ion binding site binds Ca2+ but does not appear to bind Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1559305442,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the first committed precursor for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. ALA formation in Escherichia coli occurs in a tRNA-dependent three-step conversion from glutamate. Glu-tRNA reductase is the key enzyme in this pathway. E. coli K12 contains two Glu-tRNA reductase activities which differ in their molecular weights. Here we describe the purification of one of these enzymes. Four different chromatographic separations yielded a nearly homogeneous protein. Its apparent molecular mass under denaturing (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and nondenaturing conditions (rate zonal sedimentation and gel filtration) is 85,000 +/- 5,000 Da. This indicates a monomeric structure for the active enzyme. Gel filtration and glycerol gradient centrifugation indicate that the other activity has a molecular mass of 45,000 +/- 5,000 Da. In the presence of NADPH both enzyme activities converted E. coli Glu-tRNA(2Glu) to glutamate 1-semialdehyde. Addition of GTP or hemin did not affect the reductase activity. Both enzymes display sequence-specific recognition of tRNA; E. coli Glu-tRNA(2Glu) is a good substrate while the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Bacillus subtilis, and Synechocystis Glu-tRNA(Glu) species are poorly recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1550443678,"To investigate the relationship between the secondary structure of the third alpha-helix (amino acids 109-126) of bovine growth hormone (bGH) and the biological activity of the molecule, proline or glycine residues have been used as substitutes for native amino acids at positions 114, 118, 121, and 126, respectively. Mutations at the positions 114, 118, and 121 resulted in a dramatic decrease in bGH secretion by transiently transfected mouse L cells whereas the substitution of glycine for glutamate at position 126 (bGH-E126G) did not affect secretion. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that those nonsecretory bGH mutations possessed a different intracellular location as compared with wild-type bGH or the mutated secretory forms of bGH. Similar results were seen in the distribution of these mutated bGH molecules in transfected rat GH-3 cells. Transgenic mice that express wild-type bGH or bGH-E126G grew to approximately 1.6 times the mass of nontransgenic littermates. Transgenic mice that express two nonsecretory forms of mutated bGHs were found to lack the enhanced mouse growth phenotype in spite of elevated levels of serum bGH. These results suggest that the secondary structure in the third alpha-helix of bGH may be important for efficient intracellular targeting in vitro and in growth promotion in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1573493292,"We created pCOL-KT, a plasmid construct in which the promoter/enhancer of human Pro alpha 1(I) gene is linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene. The Pro alpha 1(I) promoter/enhancer in pCOL-KT was methylated in vitro and tested for transcriptional activity by transient expression analysis. Methylation of the construct with bacterial methylases reduced transcriptional activity about 25-fold. Site-specific methylation of eight potential canonical sites of eukaryotic methylation within the promoter greatly reduced transcriptional activity. Chromatin conformation of the transfected pCOL-KT DNA was analyzed by nuclease sensitivity. Although both methylated and unmethylated transfected DNA had increased susceptibility to DNase I compared with the endogenous gene, the methylated transfected DNA showed increased resistance to nuclease when compared with unmethylated transfected DNA, indicating that the methylation of the DNA alters the chromatin conformation. We also tested the ability of a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line that does not express type I collagen to support transcription from an exogenously added Pro alpha 1(I) promoter/enhancer. The transformed cell line is able to support transcription from the Pro alpha 1(I) promoter/enhancer. Treatment of the transformed cell line with 5-azacytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, resulted in transcriptional activation of the Pro alpha 1(I) gene. These findings, along with the extreme methylation sensitivity of the Pro alpha 1(I) promoter and enhancer, suggest that DNA methylation may be an important mechanism of transcriptional inactivation of interstitial collagen genes."
https://openalex.org/W1594600462,"The gene encoding aspartate aminotransferase of a thermophilic Bacillus species, YM-2, has been cloned and expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. The primary structure of the enzyme was deduced from nucleotide sequences of the gene and confirmed mostly by amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides. The gene consists of 1,176 base pairs encoding a protein of 392 amino acid residues; the molecular mass of the enzyme subunit is estimated to be 42,661 daltons. The active site lysyl residue that binds the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate, was identified as Lys-239. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of aspartate aminotransferases from other organisms revealed very low overall similarities (13-14%) except for the sequence of the extremely thermostable enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus (34%). Several amino acid residues conserved in all the compared sequences include those that have been reported to participate in binding of the coenzyme in three-dimensional structures of the vertebrate and E. coli enzymes. However, the strictly conserved arginyl residue that is essential for binding of the distal carboxyl group of substrates is not found in the corresponding region of the sequences of the thermostable enzymes from the Bacillus species and S. solfataricus. The Bacillus aspartate aminotransferase has been purified from the E. coli clone cell extracts on a large scale and crystallized in the buffered ammonium sulfate solution by the hanging drop method. The crystals are monoclinic with unit cell dimensions a = 121.2 A, b = 110.5 A, c = 81.8 A, and beta = 97.6 degrees, belonging to space group C2, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystals of the enzyme-alpha-methylaspartate complex are isomorphous with those without the substrate analog."
https://openalex.org/W1645596657,"Some yeast strains possess a sequence-specific endonuclease, Endo.SceI, which is a heterodimeric enzyme localized in mitochondria. The larger subunit (75 kDa) of Endo.SceI, encoded by a nuclear gene (ENS1), is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondria. In this study, we determined the partial amino acid sequence of the smaller subunit (50 kDa) of Endo.SceI. The determined sequence matched well the partial sequence deduced from a mitochondrial open reading frame (RF3). The RF3 locus is known to exhibit polymorphism since this reading frame in some yeast strains is supposed to encode a maturase-like protein, whereas in other strains, the frame is interrupted by GC clusters, which thus break the frame. Southern blot analysis of various yeast strains showed that the continuity of RF3 is correlated with the presence of Endo.SceI activity. These data indicate that the continuous RF3 sequence is a functional gene (ENS2) coding for the smaller subunit of Endo.SceI. The results of cytoduction, by which the continuous RF3 sequence was transferred into a yeast strain lacking mitochondrial DNA, confirmed this conclusion. This study suggests the involvement of Endo.SceI in genetic recombination of mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1506049709,"C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase inflammatory protein in man which binds to phosphocholine, chromatin, histones, and the 70-kDa protein of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle in a calcium-dependent, phosphocholine-inhibitable manner. CRP also binds to other proteins including fibronectin. The determinants involved in CRP binding to these diverse proteins have not been identified. The binding of CRP to histones was examined as these proteins are available in large quantity at high purity and subject to protease digestion with well characterized products. Histone H1 was digested with thrombin and trypsin to produce three distinct fragments, N-terminal, central globular, and C-terminal. CRP was shown only to bind to the C-terminal fragment. Binding to histone H2A was also examined. CRP binding was not diminished by cleavage of the C-terminal fragment but was greatly decreased when the central globular region of H2A was tested. Peptides were prepared to be identical to the N- and C-terminal fragments of H2A. The N-terminal (15 amino acid) fragment of H2A blocked CRP-induced precipitation of phosphocholine-coupled bovine serum albumin and histone H2A, whereas the C-terminal fragment showed no inhibition. Thus we have defined the first reported CRP binding determinant on a protein."
https://openalex.org/W1641320596,"An autoantibody reactive with a conserved sequence of 28 S rRNA (anti-28 S) was identified in serum from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-28 S protected a unique 59-nucleotide fragment synthesized in vitro against RNase T1 digestion. RNA sequence analysis revealed that it corresponded to residues 1944-2002 in human 28 S rRNA and 1767-1825 in mouse 28 S rRNA. These sequences are identical and highly conserved throughout all known eukaryotic 28 S rRNAs. In addition, this fragment is homologous to residues 1052-1110 of Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA that lies within the GTP hydrolysis center of the 50 S ribosomal subunit. Anti-28 S and its Fab fragments strongly inhibited poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, but had no effect on ribosomal peptidyltransferase activity. This effect resulted from inhibition of the binding of elongation factors EF-1 alpha and EF-2 to ribosomes and of the associated GTP hydrolysis. The inhibitory effect was almost completely suppressed by preincubation of anti-28 S with 28 S rRNA or in vitro synthesized RNA fragments containing the immunoreactive region. These results show that the immunoreactive conserved region of 28 S rRNA participates in the interaction of ribosomes with the two elongation factors in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1503346460,"The involvement of potassium ions in the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange process was studied in rat brain synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) vesicles. Addition of equimolar [K+] to the intravesicular and the extravesicular medium led to a stimulation of the Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ influx; this stimulation was noticeable already at 0.5 mM and reached its maximum at 2 mM K+. The magnitude of the K+ stimulation was between 1.3-2.5-fold in different SPM preparations. K+ ions also stimulated the Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ efflux. K+ stimulation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange is of considerable specificity, since it is not mimicked by either Li+ or H+. The following lines of evidence suggest that K+ modulation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange involves the catalytic moiety of the transporter itself and not an unrelated K+ channel which modulates the membrane potential. 1) K+ stimulation of the transport process was conserved following reconstitution of the transporter into phospholipid-rich liposomes, an experimental condition which presumably separates the native membrane proteins among different vesicular structures. 2) K+ stimulation of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ influx persists also when the build up of negative inside membrane potential is prevented by addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone which renders the membrane highly permeable to protons both in the native and the reconstituted preparation. 3) K+ stimulation of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ influx is obtained also when tetraethylammonium chloride, 2,3-diaminopyridine and Cs+ are added to the Ca2+ uptake medium. Reconstituted SPM vesicles take up 86Rb+ in response to activation of Na+ gradient-dependent Ca2+ influx. The ratio of Ca2+ taken up by SPM vesicles in a Na+ gradient-dependent manner to the corresponding amounts of Rb+ taken up varies between 8-5 in different SPM preparations. If the stoichiometry of the process is 1 Rb+/1 Ca2+, then Rb+ cotransport is mediated by 10-20% of the transporters present in the preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1504302948,"Affected individuals from two apparently distinct, mild osteogenesis imperfecta families were heterozygous for a G to T transition in the COL1A2 gene that resulted in cysteine for glycine substitutions at position 646 in the alpha 2(I) chain of type I collagen. A child with a moderately severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta was heterozygous for a G to T transition that resulted in a substitution of cysteine for glycine at position 259 in the COL1A2 gene. Type I collagen molecules containing an alpha 2(I) chain with cysteine at position 259 denaturated at a lower temperature than molecules containing an alpha 2(I) chain with cysteine at position 646. In contrast to cysteine for glycine substitutions in the alpha 1(I) chain, the severity of the osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype is not directly proportional to the distance of the mutation from the amino-terminal end of the triple helix. These findings could be explained if the type I collagen triple helix contains discontinuous domains that differ in their contributions to maintaining helix stability."
https://openalex.org/W1748714271,"Blood coagulation factor IX is composed of discrete domains with an NH2-terminal vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing region, followed by two domains that are homologous with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor and a COOH-terminal serine protease part. Calcium ions bind to the Gla-containing region and to the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain. To be able to determine the structure and function of the Gla- and EGF-like domains, we have devised a method for cleaving factor IX under controlled conditions and isolating the intact domains in high yield, either separately or linked together. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding properties of these fragments were examined by monitoring the metal ion-induced changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence. A fragment, consisting of the Gla region linked to the two EGF-like domains, bound Ca2+ in a manner that was indistinguishable from that of the intact molecule, indicating a native conformation. The Ca2+ affinity of the isolated Gla region was lower, suggesting that the EGF-like domains function as a scaffold for the folding of the Gla region. The Gla-independent high affinity metal ion binding site in the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain was shown to bind Ca2+ but not Mg2+. A comparison with similar studies of factor X (Persson, E., Bjork, I., and Stenflo, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2444-2452) suggests that the Ca2(+)-induced fluorescence quenching is due to an altered environment primarily around the tryptophan residue in position 42."

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 472-478). A cDNA and a gene for LZ-8 were isolated and characterized. The mixed oligonucleotide probes for LZ-8 cDNA were designed from the results of protein sequencing (Tanaka, S., Ko, K., Kino, K., Tsuchiya, K., Yamashita, A., Murasugi, A., Sakuma, S., and Tsunoo, H.

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA confirms the amino acid sequence of LZ-8 that was previously determined by protein sequencing. The clones containing the LZ-8 gene (lz-8) were obtained from the mycelial genomic DNA library using the cDNA probe. Two CCAAT-like sequences and one TATA box were found at the upstream region of the postulated transcription initiation site of lz-8. A small intron (61 nucleotides long) divided lz-8 into two exons at the 5'-untranslated region. The other characteristic sequences were also found around the postulated transcription initiation site and around the poly(A) additional site."
https://openalex.org/W1591993297,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an antiproliferative factor for growing human melanoma A375-C6 cells. To define the molecular basis for the action of IL-1, we set out to identify early genes induced by the cytokine in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. cDNA libraries were constructed from A375-C6 cells that were exposed or unexposed to IL-1 plus cycloheximide. Subtractive hybridization was used to prepare a library that was enriched for IL-1-induced clones. Two of these clones were shown by Northern analysis to represent IL-1-inducible genes. Nucleotide sequencing identified these genes as gro/melanoma growth stimulatory activity, which encodes a cell secretory product, and c-jun, which encodes a transcription factor. IL-1 caused persistent steady state elevation of gro mRNA but only transient induction of c-jun. Northern analysis using gene probes for the transcription factors c-fos and Egr-1 revealed that IL-1 induced c-fos but not Egr-1 expression in these cells. This indicates that differential early gene expression characterizes the growth-inhibitory action of IL-1. In contrast, serum, which is mitogenic for these cells, induces c-jun, c-fos, and Egr-1, but not gro expression. These data imply that in A375-C6 cells, both growth-inhibitory and stimulatory signals can channel their action through c-fos and c-jun genes. As gro induction was specifically associated with the antimitogenic action of IL-1, we studied the effect of the cytokine on gro gene expression in other types of cells. IL-1 was mitogenic for human glioblastoma and monkey kidney epithelial cells and induced gro whereas other mitogens did not. Thus, IL-1 can induce gro gene expression in diverse cell types, whether it acts to stimulate or inhibit proliferation. Like other cytokines gro may play diverse cell-specific roles in growth control."
https://openalex.org/W1569498596,"The effect of low sodium and high potassium intake on rat adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata-reticularis (ZFR) were studied during a 7-day period, by analyzing mRNA and protein levels of various enzymes involved in aldosterone synthesis. In ZG significant increases in cytochrome P-450scc, P-450c21, P-450(11 beta), adrenodoxin mRNA and protein levels were observed after 2 days with either diet, and at day 7 these levels were further increased. The largest mRNA induction was observed at day 7 in sodium-depleted rats for P-450(11 beta), with a 4-fold increase, followed by 2.7- and 2.0-fold increases for P-450scc and P-450c21, respectively. A pattern similar to those of P-450scc and P-450(11 beta) was observed for adrenodoxin with a 2.1-fold increase after 7 days of Na+ restriction. In K(+)-loaded rats mRNA levels for P-450scc, P-450(11 beta), P-450c21, and adrenodoxin were also increased by 2.2-, 2.1-, 1.5-, and 1.9-fold respectively. Protein levels of these enzymes were also measured in ZG and showed increases similar to those of their respective mRNAs for both treatments. On the other hand, mRNA levels of P-450scc, P-450(11 beta), P-450c21, and adrenodoxin in ZFR were found significantly lower than in ZG, although they were slightly increased for both treated groups of rats as compared with controls. In addition, ZFR protein levels of corresponding enzymes did not fluctuate significantly under both ionic regimens. In conclusion, both low sodium and high potassium intakes act primarily on ZG. Their action on plasma aldosterone seems to be mediated by increasing both mRNA and protein and levels of steroidogenic enzymes, especially at the early step (cytochrome P-450scc) and even more at the late steps (cytochrome P-450(11 beta]. In addition, a close relationship appears to exist between the two mitochondrial P-450s and their electron donor adrenodoxin, since their mRNA and protein levels were similarly enhanced for both diets used."
https://openalex.org/W1498072294,"Abstract We report the cloning of a neutral isoelectric form of the human peptidyl prolyl isomerase, cyclophilin, its expression in Escherichia coli, and its purification and comparison to bovine thymus cyclophilin. The cloned protein exhibited a pI of approximately 7.8 and formed a simple 1:1 complex with cyclosporin A. This cloned form had a pI similar to that observed for the neutral isoform (pI approximately 7.4) of human splenocyte cyclophilin. The bovine thymus proteins exhibited anomalous behavior on CM-cellulose chromatography but were resolved into alkaline (pI approximately 9.3) isoforms and a new neutral (pI approximately 7.8) isoform by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis and ultimately into at least four discrete isoforms by capillary electrophoresis. For cyclosporin A binding we observe a Kd of approximately 160 nM for an electrophoretically heterogeneous preparation of the natural bovine protein and approximately 360 nM for the more homogeneous preparation of the cloned human neutral isoform. Stopped-flow measurements of the activation energies for peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity indicate the recombinant human protein has an activation enthalpy of 3.67 kcal/mol and an activation entropy of -47.3 cal/K-mol for cis----trans isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1556254322,"Bestatin induces the accumulation of di- and tripeptide intermediates in cellular protein breakdown. In liver, a single set of bestatin-sensitive cytosolic peptidases are involved in the degradation to amino acids of the major classes of cellular proteins. Accumulation of bestatin-induced peptides, in isolated hepatocytes, is proportional to the rate of protein degradation (Botbol, V., and Scornik, O. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13504-13509). Injection of 1 mg of bestatin into mice results in detectable amounts of hepatic intermediates in 15 min. We propose to use the accumulation of these peptides as a relative measurement of liver protein degradation. There is at present no other way to determine transient changes in protein breakdown in the tissues of intact animals. As an example of the applications of this procedure, we present the effects of a single meal on hepatic protein metabolism. Protein synthesis was estimated by the incorporation into liver protein of a massive dose of radioactive leucine (Scornik, O. A. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 3876-3883) and degradation of long-lived or short-lived proteins by the accumulation of bestatin-induced peptides, labeled in carboxy-C of their Leu or Arg moieties, 1 day or 1 h beforehand. A single meal resulted in an 18% increase in liver protein in 8 h, a 45% increase in the rate of hepatic protein synthesis, and a 3-fold decrease in the rate of breakdown of long-lived proteins. Short-lived proteins were not affected. To establish the efficiency with which bestatin-induced peptides accumulate in the livers of fasting mice, we compared them with the disappearance, in 1 day, of protein-bound 14C-guanidino-Arg residues, labeled by previous injection of 14C-bicarbonate (Swick, R. W., and Ip, M. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6836-6841). From this comparison, we estimated that bestatin-induced Leu-labeled intermediates, accumulating in 15 min, represented 39% of the hepatic proteins degraded in that interval. For Arg-labeled intermediates the value was 55%. Correcting for these efficiencies, we estimate that in 4 h a meal decreased the rate of degradation of long-lived Arg-labeled proteins from 2.02 to 0.73%/h. For Leu-labeled proteins the estimated rates were 1.76 and 0.66%/h, respectively. Although a transient slowdown of liver protein degradation after a single meal had been suggested before, this is the first time that acute changes such as this can be determined directly in intact animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1564829539,"Factor Xa is the enzymatically active constituent of the prothrombinase complex, which catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. We have isolated fragments, from tryptic digests of factor X, that consists of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) region linked to one or two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Calcium ion binding measurements indicated that these fragments have a native conformation. The factor X-GlaEGF fragments inhibit factor Xa-induced blood clotting in a manner suggesting that they compete with factor Xa for phospholipid binding sites. The same conclusion was reached when thrombin generation was studied in a system of purified components (factor Xa, factor Va, prothrombin, phospholipid, and Ca2+). There was no evidence for a strong interaction between the EGF-like domains of factor Xa and factor Va in either system. However, experiments in the purified system without phospholipid indicated a direct, albeit weak, interaction between the Gla region of factor Xa and factor Va and between the COOH-terminal EGF-like domain of factor Xa and factor Va. Using domain-specific Fab fragments, we have confirmed that the conformation of the serine protease region alters dramatically upon activation of factor X. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the conformation of the Gla region is affected by the activation, whereas the EGF-like domains appear to be unaltered. The association constant for factor X binding to endothelial cells was two orders of magnitude lower than that for binding of factor IX to these cells. Binding of the Gla and GlaEGF fragments suggested Gla-mediated binding to phospholipid rather than binding to a specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1531686808,"8-Azidoadenine and 8-azidoadenosine, two photoactivatable derivatives of adenine and adenosine, are competitive inhibitors of diphtheria toxin of similar potency with respect to their parent compounds. On irradiation, the two tritium-labeled photoactivatable azidoadenines bind covalently and specifically to an enzymic fragment of diphtheria toxin that is known to bind to NAD. This photolabeling is protected by the enzyme substrate NAD. The radiolabeled protein was fragmented, and the radioactive fragments were sequenced. Tyr-65 is labeled specifically by both photoreagents, and its labeling was reduced strongly when NAD was present during irradiation. Labeling is also reduced strongly by adenine, adenosine, and nicotinamide. These results suggest that Tyr-65 is at the NAD binding site of diphtheria toxin and that the competitive inhibitors adenine, adenosine, and nicotinamide bind to the same portion of the catalytic center of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1552348824,"The LexA repressor from Escherichia coli regulates the transcription of about 20 different genes upon binding to single or multiple operators. In this work we study the interaction of LexA with the control region of the caa gene (coding for the bacterial toxin colicin A) that contains two operators (O1 and O2) which overlap by at least 2 base pairs relevant for sequence specific DNA recognition. This arrangement raises the question of how the LexA molecules which bind to the central overlapping part of the two operators avoid steric clashes and further, of whether the interaction of LexA with the two operators is cooperative or not. To address these questions we have constructed two mutant operators (O1+O2- and O1-O2+) for which the two most strongly conserved base pairs in each of the external operator half-sites have been mutated. Using methylation interference with the complex formation of LexA with the wild-type and these two mutant operators we could show: 1) that the two mutant operators behave symmetrically in that the methylation of one crucial guanine base in both operator half-sites interferes strongly with complex formation, 2) but that in the wild-type operator (containing four functional operator half-sites) only the two external half-operators give rise to interference if this crucial guanine base is methylated, whereas methylation of the two equivalent guanine bases within the two central (overlapping) operator half-sites does not lead to interference with the formation of a complex where both operators are occupied simultaneously. These data suggest that the centrally bound LexA molecules adopt a somewhat different binding mode than those bound to the external half-operators in order to avoid steric clashes and/or to optimize protein-protein contacts which are likely to be at the origin of the binding cooperativity that we could demonstrate by quantitative DNase I footprinting and gel retardation experiments. While the methylation interference experiments revealed a non-equivalence for the binding of externally and centrally bound LexA molecules, both methylation protection and hydroxyl radical footprinting were unable to reveal this difference, suggesting that the difference between the two binding modes should be fairly subtle."
https://openalex.org/W2153644601,"The binding of factor IX to cultured bovine endothelial cells was characterized using isolated domains of bovine factor IX. An NH2-terminal fragment that consists of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) region linked to the two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains bound to the endothelial cells with the same affinity as intact factor IX, indicating that the serine protease part of factor IX is not involved in binding. This fragment also inhibited the factor IXa beta'-induced clotting of plasma at a concentration that would suggest a competition for phospholipid binding sites. However, after proteolytic removal of the Gla region from the fragment, the two EGF-like domains inhibited clotting almost as effectively, suggesting a direct interaction between this part of the molecule and the cofactor, factor VIIIa. Using affinity-purified Fab fragments against the Gla region, the EGF-like domains, and the serine protease part, it was observed that the serine protease part of the molecule undergoes a large conformational change upon activation, whereas the Gla region and the EGF-like domains appear to be unaffected. All three classes of Fab fragments were equally efficient as inhibitors of the factor IXa beta'-induced clotting reaction. Part of factor Va and factor VIIIa have significant sequence homology to a lectin. We therefore investigated the effect on in vitro clotting of the recently identified unique disaccharide Xyl alpha 1-3Glc, that is O-linked to a serine residue in the NH2-terminal EGF-like domain of human factor IX (Hase, S., Nishimura, H., Kawabata, S.-I., Iwanaga, S., and Ikenaka, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1858-1861). However, no effect on blood clotting was observed in the assay system used. Our results are compatible with a model in which the serine protease part provides the specificity of the binding of factor IXa to factor VIIIa-phospholipid, but that the EGF-like domain(s) also contributes to the interaction of the enzyme with its cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1580259467,"To study the promoter of the chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) gene and the relevance of several progestin-responsive elements therein, chimeric genes were constructed which contained the 5'-flanking region of the cPR gene linked to promoterless globin or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase sequences. Cell-specific initiation of transcription was observed in transiently transfected chicken embryo fibroblasts when using 876 base pairs of the cPR gene upstream region. Transcription from these reporter genes could be induced by progestins in the presence of cPR form A but not of form B. In keeping with these data, three in vitro progesterone receptor (PR)-binding sites were identified in the cPR promoter region by DNase I protection assays. However, in vivo, nuclear run-on transcription demonstrated that neither primary stimulation with progestins, nor treatment of secondarily estrogen-stimulated chicks with progestins, glucocorticoids, or androgens resulted in any significant change of cPR gene transcription in the oviduct, thus suggesting a cell- and/or development-specific role for these progestin-responsive elements. Although estrogen is known to increase PR levels in the chick oviduct, this effect does not involve stimulation of PR gene transcription, as demonstrated here by nuclear run-on experiments, the analysis of DNase I hypersensitive sites, and transient cotransfection studies. Since acute withdrawal from estrogen-stimulation markedly decreased the level of cPR mRNAs in chick oviduct when analyzed by Northern blotting, we conclude that estrogen-dependent stimulation of PR levels in the oviduct is a post-transcriptional process."

The enzyme was purified from the cytosol of Dictyostelium discoideum using GTP-agarose chromatography as the critical step. It has an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa. Monoclonal antibodies identified several forms of the enzyme with pI values between 8.1 and 9.0. Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) were low for the nucleotide substrates IMP (Km = 30 microM) and GTP (Km = 35 microM) as compared with the value for aspartic acid (Km = 440 microM). These values are in good agreement with constants reported from other organisms. Immunological studies indicated that the protein is predominantly localized in the cytosol and only partially associated with particulate fractions. The enzyme is present throughout the developmental cycle of D. discoideum. Using monoclonal antibodies, the gene was cloned from a lambda gt11 expression library. The complete sequence represents the first reported primary structure of an eucaryotic adenylosuccinate synthetase. Southern blots hybridized with a cDNA probe demonstrate that adenylosuccinate synthetase is encoded by a single gene and contains at least one intron. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 43% identity to adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli. Homologous regions include short sequence motifs, such as the glycine-rich loop which is typical for GTP-binding proteins."

Limulus trypsin inhibitor (LTI) was separated from coagulogen by ion-exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex. LTI is an inhibitor of trypsin (Ki = 3.3 nM) on both high and low molecular weight substrates. It also inhibits chymotrypsin but has little or no effect on thrombin, thermolysin, pepsin, or papain, nor does LTI inhibit the proteolytic cascade produced in endotoxin-stimulated Limulus amoebocyte lysate coagulation. Electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on denaturing polyacrylamide gel yields a doublet migrating with an estimated Mr of 20,000. Under reducing conditions, a single broad band migrates with an estimated Mr of 15,000. The native structure is a monomer of moderate asymmetry with a molecular weight of 16,300 and a so20,w = 1.5(5), as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. The amino acid composition of LTI yields a calculated molecular weight of 15,680 and a calculated partial specific volume of 0.71(7) ml/g. LTI does not contain methionine, tryptophan, or detectable levels of reducing carbohydrate. The NH2-terminal sequence (V-S-P-P-F-I-K-Q-T-K-F-S-T-X-F-L-G-X-S-S) consists primarily of hydrophobic amino acid residues. Comparison of the amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequence of LTI with those of other known protease inhibitors reveals no significant similarity to other trypsin inhibitors. The novel physical characteristics suggest that LTI represents a new type of protease inhibitor."

We purified alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase and kynurenine aminotransferase from rat kidney supernatant fraction to electrophoretic homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sephacel, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Kynurenine aminotransferase activity was precipitated by pH treatment. The remaining aminoadipate aminotransferase activity was concentrated and injected into rabbits to raise antibodies that were used to prepare an affinity column. A mixture of aminoadipate aminotransferase and kynurenine aminotransferase activities obtained after hydroxylapatite chromatography was subjected to affinity chromatography. Aminoadipate aminotransferase and kynurenine aminotransferase activities resolved as separate peaks, providing evidence that the two activities are associated with two different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1578075236,"Abstract Internuclear distances obtained from nuclear Overhauser effects were used in combination with a distance geometry algorithm to determine the conformation of Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP bound to the Escherichia coli truncated methionyl-tRNA synthetase (delta MTS) both in the absence and presence of cognate and noncognate amino acids. Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, was used to prevent hydrolysis of the nucleotide in the presence of either cognate or noncognate amino acids. Kinetic analysis showed that Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP was a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP in the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction with a Ki = 1.2 mM. The pattern of internuclear Overhauser effects on Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP bound to delta MTS was qualitatively consistent only with an anti glycosidic torsional angle, suggesting that the adenosine portion of the nucleotide is uniquely oriented in the binary enzyme-nucleotide complex. Nearly identical patterns of nuclear Overhauser effects were also observed in ternary complexes containing either cognate L-methionine or noncognate L-homocysteine amino acids. Distance geometry calculations permitted the range and conformational space of the allowed adenine-ribose glycosidic torsional angles in each of the complexes to be better defined and compared. Average adenine-ribose glycosidic torsional angles for enzyme-bound Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP of -106 +/- 9 degrees, -99 +/- 11 degrees, and -97 +/- 11 degrees were determined for the delta MTS.Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP, delta MTS.Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP.L-methionine, and delta MTS.Mg(alpha,beta-methylene)ATP.L-homocysteine complexes, respectively. Comparison of the three enzyme-bound conformations showed that a single nucleotide structure having an adenine-ribose glycosidic torsional angle of -98 degrees with a 3'-endo to O4'-exo ribose sugar pucker was, within error, consistent with the experimental internuclear distances obtained in all three complexes. The nearly identical anti glycosidic torsional angles observed in all three complexes demonstrates that the conformation of the adenosine moiety of the enzyme-bound nucleotide is not sensitive to the presence or the nature of the amino acid bound at the aminoacyladenylate site. Therefore, conformational changes known to occur in the methionyl-tRNA synthetase upon ligand binding appear not to alter the bound conformation of the nucleotide. Information on the conformation and arrangement of substrates bound at the aminoacyladenylate site of delta MTS is necessary for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in amino acid activation and discrimination."

The purified protein cross-reacts with antibodies raised against the product of a LacZ/NAM2 gene fusion and antibodies raised against the purified Escherichia coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase. The mass as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is about 100 kDa, consistent with the size predicted by the gene sequence (102 kDa). The N-terminal sequence of the protein has been determined and shows that the first nine amino acids predicted by the gene sequence have been removed, probably during transport into the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1493151943,"Endonuclease I is a multipurpose enzyme implicated in the breakdown of host DNA, packaging of phage DNA, and recombination during the lytic cycle of bacteriophage T7. We investigate here some aspects of the substrate requirements for its activity in resolving branched intermediates similar to Holliday junctions (Holliday, R. (1964) Genet. Res. 5, 282-304) that arise in recombination. The enzyme is able to resolve branched substrates containing very short duplex arms: 4 base pairs suffice. It cleaves 5' to the branch, with a distinct preference for the non-crossover strands in Holliday-like model junctions. Ligands that interact strongly with the branch site can inhibit the enzyme, with KI values in the 10-50 microM range."
https://openalex.org/W1542408678,"The substrate specificity of rat liver microsomal glutathione transferase toward glutathione has been examined in a systematic manner. Out of a glycyl-modified and eight gamma-glutamyl-modified glutathione analogues, it was found that four (glutaryl-L-Cys-Gly, alpha-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly, alpha-D-Glu-L-Cys-Gly, and gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-beta-Ala) function as substrates. The kinetic parameters for three of these substrates (the alpha-D-Glu-L-Cys-Gly analogue gave very low activity) were compared with those of GSH with both unactivated and the N-ethylmaleimide-activated microsomal glutathione transferase. The alpha-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly analogue is similar to GSH in that it has a higher kcat (6.9 versus 0.6 s-1) value with the activated enzyme compared with the unactivated enzyme but displays a high Km (6 versus 11 mM) with both forms. Glutaryl-L-Cys-Gly, in contrast, exhibited a similar kcat (8.9 versus 6.7 s-1) with the N-ethylmaleimide-treated enzyme but retains a higher Km value (50 versus 15 mM). Thus, the alpha-amino group of the glutamyl residue in GSH is important for the activity of the activated microsomal glutathione transferase. These observations were quantitated by analyzing the changes in the Gibbs free energy of binding calculated from the changes in kcat/Km values, comparing the analogues to GSH and each other. It is estimated that the binding energy of the alpha-amino group of the glutamyl residue in GSH contributes 9.7 kJ/mol to catalysis by the activated enzyme, whereas the corresponding value for the unactivated enzyme is 3.2 kJ/mol. The importance of the acidic functions in glutathione is also evident as shown by the lack of activity with 4-aminobutyric acid-L-Cys-Gly and the low kcat/Km values with gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-beta-Ala (0.03 and 0.01 mM-1s-1 for unactivated and activated enzyme, respectively). Utilization of binding energy from a correctly positioned carboxyl group in the glycine residue (10 and 17 kJ/mol for unactivated and activated enzyme, respectively) therefore also appears to be required for optimal activity and activation. A conformational change in the microsomal glutathione transferase upon treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or trypsin, which allows utilization of binding energy from the alpha-amino group of GSH as well as the glycine carboxyl in catalysis, is suggested to account for at least part of the activation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1543542542,"The site of photocross-linking between Cys-697 (SH2), prelabeled with 4'-[14C]maleimidylbenzophenone, and the 50-kDa segment of myosin S1 on irradiation in the absence of nucleotide has been determined by isolation of the 20-50-kDa adduct and subsequent tryptic proteolysis. Isolation and partial sequencing of the radioactively labeled peptide indicate that the site of cross-linking is Arg-239. This result indicates that, in the absence of nucleotide, Arg-239 resides at about 1.0 nm from SH2 and, on the basis of the recent work of Sutoh and Hiratsuka (Sutoh, K. and Hiratsuka T. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2964-2969) places Arg-239 at no more than 1.45 nm from either Lys-184 or Lys-189 of the nucleotide-binding glycine-rich loop prior to the binding of nucleotide."
