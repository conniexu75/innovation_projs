https://openalex.org/W2097102631,"Expansion and intensification of cultivation are among the predominant global changes of this century. Intensification of agriculture by use of high-yielding crop varieties, fertilization, irrigation, and pesticides has contributed substantially to the tremendous increases in food production over the past 50 years. Land conversion and intensification, however, also alter the biotic interactions and patterns of resource availability in ecosystems and can have serious local, regional, and global environmental consequences. The use of ecologically based management strategies can increase the sustainability of agricultural production while reducing off-site consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1970060454,"Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is one of the seven mammalian sirtuins, which are homologs of the yeast Sir2 gene. SIRT3 is the only sirtuin with a reported association with the human life span. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) plays important roles in adaptive thermogenesis, gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. PGC-1alpha induces several key reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detoxifying enzymes, but the molecular mechanism underlying this is not well understood.Here we show that PGC-1alpha strongly stimulated mouse Sirt3 gene expression in muscle cells and hepatocytes. Knockdown of PGC-1alpha led to decreased Sirt3 gene expression. PGC-1alpha activated the mouse SIRT3 promoter, which was mediated by an estrogen-related receptor (ERR) binding element (ERRE) (-407/-399) mapped to the promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that ERRalpha bound to the identified ERRE and PGC-1alpha co-localized with ERRalpha in the mSirt3 promoter. Knockdown of ERRalpha reduced the induction of Sirt3 by PGC-1alpha in C(2)C(12) myotubes. Furthermore, Sirt3 was essential for PGC-1alpha-dependent induction of ROS-detoxifying enzymes and several components of the respiratory chain, including glutathione peroxidase-1, superoxide dismutase 2, ATP synthase 5c, and cytochrome c. Overexpression of SIRT3 or PGC-1alpha in C(2)C(12) myotubes decreased basal ROS level. In contrast, knockdown of mSIRT3 increased basal ROS level and blocked the inhibitory effect of PGC-1alpha on cellular ROS production. Finally, SIRT3 stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis, and SIRT3 knockdown decreased the stimulatory effect of PGC-1alpha on mitochondrial biogenesis in C(2)C(12) myotubes.Our results indicate that Sirt3 functions as a downstream target gene of PGC-1alpha and mediates the PGC-1alpha effects on cellular ROS production and mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, SIRT3 integrates cellular energy metabolism and ROS generation. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of SIRT3 regulation and its physiological functions may provide a novel target for treating ROS-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2019888542,"Tumor-derived microvesicles (TMV) or exosomes are present in body fluids of patients with cancer and might be involved in tumor progression. The frequency and suppressor functions of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg are higher in patients with cancer than normal controls. The hypothesis is tested that TMV contribute to induction/expansion/and activation of human Treg.TMV isolated from supernatants of tumor cells but not normal cells induced the generation and enhanced expansion of human Treg. TMV also mediated conversion of CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells into CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg. Upon co-incubation with TMV, Treg showed an increased FasL, IL-10, TGF-beta1, CTLA-4, granzyme B and perforin expression (p<0.05) and mediated stronger suppression of responder cell (RC) proliferation (p<0.01). Purified Treg were resistant to TMV-mediated apoptosis relative to other T cells. TMV also increased phospho-SMAD2/3 and phospho-STAT3 expression in Treg. Neutralizing Abs specific for TGF-beta1 and/or IL-10 significantly inhibited TMV ability to expand Treg.This study suggests that TMV have immunoregulatory properties. They induce Treg, promote Treg expansion, up-regulate Treg suppressor function and enhance Treg resistance to apoptosis. Interactions of TMV with Treg represent a newly-defined mechanism that might be involved in regulating peripheral tolerance by tumors and in supporting immune evasion of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2050644354,"CD44 is a major cell surface receptor for the large polydisperse glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). Binding of the long and flexible HA chains is thought to be stabilized by the multivalent nature of the sugar molecule. In addition, high and low molecular weight forms of HA provoke distinct proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects upon binding to CD44 and can deliver either proliferative or antiproliferative signals in appropriate cell types. Despite the importance of such interactions, however, neither the stoichiometry of multivalent HA binding at the cell surface nor the molecular basis for functional distinction between different HA size categories is understood. Here we report on the design of a supported lipid bilayer system that permits quantitative analysis of multivalent binding through presentation of CD44 in a stable, natively oriented manner and at controlled density. Using this system in combination with biophysical techniques, we show that the amount of HA binding to bilayers that are densely coated with CD44 increases as a function of HA size, with half-maximal saturation at ∼30 kDa. Moreover, reversible binding was confined to the smaller HA species (molecular weight of ≤10 kDa), whereas the interaction was essentially irreversible with larger polymers. The amount of bound HA decreased with decreasing receptor surface density, but the stability of binding was not affected. From a physico-chemical perspective, the binding properties of HA share many similarities with the typical behavior of a flexible polymer as it adsorbs onto a homogeneously attractive surface. These findings provide new insight into the multivalent nature of CD44-HA interactions and suggest a molecular basis for the distinct biological properties of different size fractions of hyaluronan.

It is a type I membrane glycoprotein that consists of a small cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a highly glycosylated membrane-proximal region, and an N-terminal HA binding domain (HABD) (Fig. 1A). The HABD, which spans a sequence of about 150 amino acids, forms an α/β structure stabilized by three disulfide bonds that encompasses the Link module, a domain conserved among members of the hyaladherin superfamily (1Teriete P.

The most common form of CD44, the so-called hematopoietic or standard form (CD44H/CD44s), has an apparent molecular weight of 80–95 kDa, which exceeds the total amino acid mass by 2–3-fold due to posttranslational N- and O-linked glycosylation. The membrane-proximal region is, additionally, subject to alternative splicing, which results in the expression of variant exons in various isoforms of CD44 (3Haynes B.F. Liao H.X. Patton K.L.

CD44 is found on many cell types, including leukocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial and epithelial cells and has been implicated in various processes, such as lymphocyte recruitment, T cell signaling, cell matrix adhesion, apoptosis, limb development, and tumor metastasis. The role of HA binding in these processes has been the subject of intensive studies (4Puré E. Cuff C.A. Trends Mol.

The propensity of CD44 to bind HA varies strongly across cell types and state of maturation, and such modulation of binding is thought to be functionally important. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of receptor-mediated HA binding to CD44. One type of mechanism relates to changes in affinity between individual receptors and HA, exerted by modifications to CD44 glycosylation (1Teriete P. Banerji S. Noble M. Blundell C.D. Wright A.J. Pickford A.R. Lowe E. Mahoney D.J. Tammi M.I. Kahmann J.D. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Jackson D.G. Mol.

Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A second type of mechanism derives from the fact that hyaluronan molecules, by virtue of their repetitive structure (GlcNAcβ1–4GlcUA)n contain within them multiple (up to a few thousand) CD44 binding sites. Individual HA chains can thus interact simultaneously with many receptors on the cell surface. Moreover, changes in the density and arrangement of CD44 at the cell surface, including local enrichment or clustering, can affect the overall strength or avidity of such a multivalent interaction. A third mechanism proposes that changes in the conformational state of HA through the formation of protein macromolecular complexes (10Day A.J. de la Motte C.A. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14de la Motte C.A. Hascall V.C. Drazba J. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Strong S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or differences in HA chain length can influence both HA binding and its functional consequences. For example, low molecular weight HA produced during matrix turnover is known to have proinflammatory properties, whereas high molecular weight HA present in intact matrix induces immunosuppression, reflecting differences in the capacity of each size fraction either to activate Toll-like receptors or to bind CD44 and stimulate FoxP3+ CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), respectively (15Bollyky P.L. Falk B.A. Long S.A. Preisinger A. Braun K.R. Wu R.P. Evanko S.P. Buckner J.H. Wight T.N. Nepom G.T. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2232-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Bollyky P.L.

Wight T.N. Nepom G.T. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, preparations of HA defined operationally as “low molecular weight” (20–500 kDa) have been reported to promote cell cycle progression via a CD44/Rac/ERK pathway in smooth muscle cells, whereas higher molecular weight fractions (>500 kDa) were shown to be inhibitory (18Kothapalli D. Flowers J. Xu T. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31823-31829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this HA size threshold phenomenon remains completely obscure. Moreover, the definition of “low molecular weight HA” lacks consistency in these studies, in some cases referring to oligomers that correspond to a single binding site for CD44 (16Bollyky P.L.

Signal. 2009; 21: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The affinity of CD44 for high molecular weight HA has been found to be rather weak, with a KD in the range of 10 to 100 μm (13Banerji S. Wright A.J. Noble M. Mahoney D.J. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Jackson D.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 21Banerji S. Hide B.R. James J.R. Noble M.E. Jackson D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10724-10735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that much of the regulatory potential lies in the spatial arrangement of receptors on the cell surface. Apart from artificial manipulation of CD44 to assess the effects of dimerization (7Lesley J. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. Hyman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26967-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), there are currently no methods available to investigate the influence of receptor density in a controlled manner. Conventional in vitro binding assays are sensitive to interactions between individual ligand/receptor pairs but ignore the spatial confinement and arrangement of HA receptors in two dimensions that pertain within the cell membrane. Although cellular assays have provided valuable insights into overall patterns of regulation, the complexity of the living cell makes it difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of the different types of interactions outlined above. For example, CD44 isoforms with different affinities may co-exist on the same cell surface, and the average and local surface densities of these receptor populations are rarely known. As a consequence, it has been difficult to address the simple yet pertinent question of how many receptors are required to bind HA stably to the cell surface. Here, we present a novel approach that overcomes many of the shortcomings of existing cell-based analyses and allows investigation of the multivalent interaction between CD44 and HA in a highly controlled manner. The method is based on the immobilization of CD44 on a planar solid support that is covered with a lipid bilayer. We employed several complementary and surface-sensitive biophysical techniques to quantify binding of HA and to characterize the stability and morphology of the HA films that are formed. Our results provide new insights into the multivalent nature of stable CD44-HA interactions and the role of HA as a flexible polymer in the regulation of binding. Furthermore, they have far reaching implications, allowing novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying biological function. A Hepes buffer solution of 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in ultrapure water was used to prepare lipid vesicles and in all experiments reported. CaCl2 (2 mm) was added throughout all measurements related to model system 1 (see “Results”). NiCl2 (5 mm) was included in the incubation step leading to the formation of supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) containing bis-NTA-functionalized lipids. Lyophilized HA with well defined molecular weights of 10 ± 2 kDa (PrimeHA-12), 30 ± 1.5 kDa (SelectHA-50), 262 ± 13 kDa (SelectHA-250), 450 ± 23 kDa (SelectHA-500), 1156 ± 58 kDa (SelectHA-1000), and 2400 ± 120 kDa (SelectHA-2500) was purchased from Hyalose (Oklahoma City, OK). HA8 and HA34 oligomers were prepared as reported before (23Mahoney D.J. Aplin R.T. Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For reconstitution, HA was dissolved in ultrapure water at a stock concentration of 1 mg/ml and gently shaken overnight. The stock solution was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Before use, HA was diluted in the Hepes buffer to the desired concentration. The (HABD)2-Fc construct was prepared in a modified version of the expression vector pCDM7Ig, which encodes the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions of human IgG1. The modification consisted of a linker inserted into the BamHI site such that a 10-histidine tract followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQG) was placed in frame with the Fc coding sequence. The HABD region consisting of the first 170 residues of human CD44 (including the N-terminal signal peptide) was amplified using Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) DNA polymerase from full-length human CD44 cDNA using the forward and reverse primers huCD44-12 (5′-CGCGaagcttCGCTCCGGACACCATGGACAAG-3′) and huCD44-465 (5′-CGagatctGGGTAGATGTCTTCAGGATTCG-3′) that contain HindIII and BglII restriction sites (shown in lowercase type), respectively. Appropriately digested PCR products were ligated into the modified pCDM7Ig vector that had been digested at the HindIII site and at a new BamHI site created at the 5′-end of the linker. Candidate recombinant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the integrity of the clones. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected and cultured in CHO-S-SFM II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) for 3 days before supernatant was collected and passed over protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), followed by elution of the Fc fusion with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, and the addition of one-twentieth volume 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, to eluted fractions. To produce His10-tagged monomers of HABD (His-HABD), DTT and EDTA were added (to final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.05 mm, respectively) to samples of (HABD)2-Fc prior to the addition of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 1 unit per 5 μg of protein and digested for 2 h at 20 °C before the removal of uncleaved fusion protein and digested Fc by passing the digest over protein A-Sepharose and removal of AcTEV protease by passing the sample over Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Invitrogen). Finally, the digested monomeric HABD was subjected to gel filtration using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 pg chromatography column (GE Healthcare). Stock solutions of about 1 mg/ml HABD constructs were stored at −20 °C. Before use, (HABD)2-Fc and His-HABD were diluted in Hepes buffer with and without added calcium, respectively, to the desired concentrations. A chimeric protein (AnxA5-Z) was constructed by fusing annexin A5 with a Z domain of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, using standard molecular biology methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ZZ domain from the plasmid pEZZ-18 (GE Healthcare), which codes for a protein binding the Fc fragment of IgGs (25Löwenadler B. Jansson B. Paleus S. Holmgren E. Nilsson B. Moks T. Palm G. Josephson S. Philipson L. Uhlén M. Gene. 1987; 58: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR, with primers to introduce NheI and BamHI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ZZ-coding sequence; the product was then cloned into the pGEF-A5 vector, which encodes full-length rat AnxA5 (26Richter R.P. Him J.L. Tessier B. Tessier C. Brisson A.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3372-3385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to produce plasmid pGEF-A5ZZ. The insert encoding AnxA5-ZZ was then removed from pGEF-A5ZZ and cloned into the pET11b vector (GE Healthcare) at the XbaI and BamHI sites to produce plasmid pET11b-A5ZZ. A Z domain from this vector was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NheI/BamHI sites of pET11b-A5 to produce the desired plasmid, pET11b-A5Z. Recombinant AnxA5 and AnxA5-Z were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified on a Superdex-75 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion column, followed by MonoQ HR5/5 (GE Healthcare) anion exchange chromatography, as described previously for AnxA5 (26Richter R.P. Him J.L. Tessier B. Tessier C. Brisson A.R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3372-3385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of about 1 mg/ml AnxA5 constructs were stored at 4 °C and diluted in calcium-containing Hepes buffer prior to use. Purified BRIC 235 monoclonal antibody (BRIC 235 mAb) was purchased from the International Blood Group Laboratory (Bristol, UK). Silica-coated QCM-D sensors (QSX303 and QSX335, Q-Sense AB, Västra Frölunda, Sweden) and silicon wafers with a native oxide layer of about 2-nm thickness (University Wafers, South Boston, MA) were immersed in an aqueous solution of 3% (w/v) SDS for 30 min, rinsed abundantly with ultrapure water, blow-dried in N2, and treated with UV/ozone (Bioforce Nanoscience, Ames, IA) for 25 min and stored in air. Glass coverslips (24 × 24 mm2) were immersed into Piranha solution (H2O2/H2SO4 = 1:3) for 1 h, extensively rinsed with ultrapure water, blow-dried with N2, and stored in sealed Petri dishes under nitrogen. Cleaned substrates were exposed to UV/ozone (25 min) prior to use. Lyophilized 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bis-NTA-functionalized octadec-9-enyl-octadecyl-amine (OEOA-bis-NTA) was kindly provided by Jacob Piehler (Osnabrück University, Germany) and prepared as described earlier (27Lata S. Gavutis M. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 6-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The divalent presentation of Ni2+-loaded NTA improves the binding stability of histidine-tagged proteins, with dissociation constants in the lower nanomolar range (28Lata S. Reichel A. Brock R. Tampé R. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10205-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Mixtures of DOPC/DOPS (3:1 molar ratio), DOPC/OEOA-bis-NTA (9:1), and pure DOPC were dissolved in chloroform, dried, resuspended in Hepes buffer, and homogenized as described earlier (29Richter R. Mukhopadhyay A. Brisson A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3035-3047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were obtained by sonication (30Eisele N.B. Frey S. Piehler J. Görlich D. Richter R.P. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or extrusion (50 nm final pore size) (31Richter R.P. Hock K.K. Burkhartsmeyer J. Boehm H. Bingen P. Wang G. Steinmetz N.F. Evans D.J. Spatz J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 127: 5306-5307Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SUV suspensions were stored at 4 °C under nitrogen and diluted to desired concentrations before use. QCM-D measures changes in resonance frequency, Δf, and dissipation, ΔD, of a sensor crystal upon interaction of (soft) matter with its surface. The QCM-D response is sensitive to the mass (including coupled water) and the mechanical properties of the surface-bound layer. Adsorption and interfacial processes were monitored in situ with subsecond time resolution. Measurements were performed with a Q-Sense E4 system (Q-Sense AB), in flow mode (30Eisele N.B. Frey S. Piehler J. Görlich D. Richter R.P. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and at a working temperature of 23 °C. Changes in dissipation and normalized frequency, Δf = Δfn/n, of the seventh overtone (n = 7; i.e. ∼35 MHz) are presented. For sufficiently rigid biomolecular layers at high surface coverage, the film thickness can be estimated, to within an error of typically <20%, by the acoustic thickness, d = Δm/ρH2O = −C/ρH2O × Δf (32Wolny P.M. Spatz J.P. Richter R.P. Langmuir. 2010; 26: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), where Δm, ρH2O = 1.0 g·cm−3, and C = 18.06 ng·cm−2·Hz−1 are, respectively, the adsorbed mass (including coupled water), the density of the bulk solution, and the mass sensitivity constant for a sensor crystal with a fundamental resonance frequency of 4.95 MHz. For very soft films, such as HA, this equation is not valid, and colloidal probe reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM) was used for the thickness estimation instead. Ellipsometry measures changes in the ellipsometric angles, Δ and Ψ, of polarized light upon reflection at a planar surface. We employed ellipsometry in situ, using silicon wafers as substrates that were installed in an open glass cuvette with continuously stirred sample solution, to quantify adsorbed biomolecular masses in a time-resolved manner. Measurements were conducted with a spectroscopic rotating compensator ellipsometer (M2000V, J. A. Woollam Co., Lincoln, NE), as described earlier (30Eisele N.B. Frey S. Piehler J. Görlich D.

The custom built cuvette was cleaned in 3% SDS (30 min), rinsed with ultrapure water, and blow-dried with N2, passivated by immersion in an aqueous solution of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (15 min), rinsed again with ultrapure water, and blow-dried with N2. Bound masses were determined by numerical fitting of the ellipsometric data to a multilayer model, as described elsewhere (30Eisele N.B. Frey S. Piehler J. Görlich D. Richter R.P.

To validate our quantitative approach, we compared the experimentally determined adsorbed amounts for known films (see Fig. 5, A and B) with data from the literature. The amount of lipids in our SLBs (380 ± 10 ng/cm2; Fig. 5A) agreed within 10% error with previously reported data (34Benes M. Billy D. Benda A. Speijer H. Hof M. Hermens W.T. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 10129-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amount of membrane-bound AnxA5-Z (220 ng/cm2, or 5.0 pmol/cm2; see Fig. 5B) was also similar to expectations for a dense protein monolayer. A two-dimensional crystalline layer of AnxA5 with p6 symmetry, for example, has a surface density of 5.5 pmol/cm2 (35Richter R.P. Brisson A. Langmuir. 2004; 20: 4609-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Selected measurements (supplemental Fig. S1) were performed with a combined setup that simultaneously provides QCM-D and ellipsometric data on the same surface. To this end, a purpose-designed flow module (Q-Sense AB) was used. The technical implementation and the numerical fitting of the data are described elsewhere. 3I. Carton, A. R. Brisson, and R. P. Richter, submitted for publication. Colloidal probe RICM was used to estimate the thickness of surface-bound HA films. This microinterferometric technique measures the height at which a colloidal probe hovers above a transparent planar substrate (37Schilling J. Sengupta K. Goennenwein S. Bausch A.R. Sackmann E. Phys. Rev. E. 2004; 69021901Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The model systems were assembled on glass coverslips, using a custom-built liquid cell. Polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany) of ∼25-μm diameter were coated with a passivating polyethylene glycol layer of about 10 nm in thickness and used as colloidal probes. RICM images at three different wavelengths were acquired simultaneously to ensure unambiguous determination of distances up to 1 μm (31Richter R.P. Hock K.K. Burkhartsmeyer J. Boehm H. Bingen P. Wang G. Steinmetz N.F. Evans D.J. Spatz J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 127: 5306-5307Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Distances were determined with a simple model (parallel plate approximation with incident light parallel to the surface normal) (38Kühner M. Sackmann E. Langmuir. 1996; 12: 4866-4876Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). See the supplemental material for details of the measurements and data analysis. Two different approaches were devised to immobilize the HABD of CD44 on SLBs (Fig. 1, B and C). In model system 1, two HA binding domains of CD44 were fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain ((HABD)2-Fc). A bifunctional fusion protein, made of annexin A5 (AnxA5; a protein that binds to negatively charged lipids) and the Z-fragment of Protein A that binds the Fc domain, was used to immobilize the HABD dimer to SLBs containing the phospholipid DOPS. For model system 2, the (HABD)2-Fc construct was cleaved within the TEV protease site, located at the N-terminal side of the Fc hinge region, releasing His-HABD. HABD monomers were then directly immobilized on SLBs containing lipids with an Ni2+-loaded bis-NTA-functionalized headgroup. Thus, these two strategies provided both monomeric and dimeric CD44 HABD constructs for study. SLBs were chosen as a support because they are inert to nonspecific binding of most proteins and preserve the lateral mobility that characterizes membrane-bound proteins. All steps in the assembly of the model systems were monitored by QCM-D (see FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and Table 1).FIGURE 3A, construction of model system 2, followed by QCM-D. SLBs were formed by spreading of 50 μg/ml SUVs, made of DOPC and bis-NTA-functionalized lipids (9:1), to a silica surface. The final absolute frequency shift, |Δf| = 29 Hz, was slightly higher than in Fig. 2A, most likely due to the presence of the bulkier bis-NTA headgroups (33Bingen P. Wang G. Steinmetz N.F. Rodahl M. Richter R.P. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 8880-8890Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). His-HABD, incubated at 10 μg/ml, formed a stable monolayer, and binding of 10 μg/ml HA250 was readily detected. B, HA250 (10 μg/ml) did not adsorb to SLBs containing NTA functionality, and the bound monolayer of his-HABD could be fully eluted by 200 mm imidazole. Changes in Δf and ΔD at about 130 min do not reflect any changes on the surface but resulted from a change in the viscosity and/or density of the surrounding solution due to the presence of imidazole. C, His-HABD (10 μg/ml) did not bind to SLBs that were made of pure DOPC and thus lacked NTA functionality.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Final QCM-D responses for each individual step of the formation of the model systemsBiomolecular filmModel system 1Model system 2ΔfΔDΔfΔDHz×10−6Hz×10−6SLB−25 ± 10.25 ± 0.1−29 ± 10.4 ± 0.2AnxA5-Z−27 ± 11.0 ± 0.2CD44-HABD−37 ± 22.5 ± 0.1−26 ± 21.0 ± 0.2HA250−7.5 ± 11.7 ± 0.2−7 ± 11.2 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Exposure of SUVs made of a mixture of DOPC and DOPS revealed the characteristic response for SLB formation (Fig. 2A) (39Richter R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2034654482,"At least five bHLH genes regulate cell fate determination and differentiation of sensory neurons, hair cells and supporting cells in the mammalian inner ear. Cross-regulation of Atoh1 and Neurog1 results in hair cell changes in Neurog1 null mice although the nature and mechanism of the cross-regulation has not yet been determined. Neurod1, regulated by both Neurog1 and Atoh1, could be the mediator of this cross-regulation.We used Tg(Pax2-Cre) to conditionally delete Neurod1 in the inner ear. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the absence of Neurod1 results in formation of hair cells within the inner ear sensory ganglia. Three cell types, neural crest derived Schwann cells and mesenchyme derived fibroblasts (neither expresses Neurod1) and inner ear derived neurons (which express Neurod1) constitute inner ear ganglia. The most parsimonious explanation is that Neurod1 suppresses the alternative fate of sensory neurons to develop as hair cells. In the absence of Neurod1, Atoh1 is expressed and differentiates cells within the ganglion into hair cells. We followed up on this effect in ganglia by demonstrating that Neurod1 also regulates differentiation of subtypes of hair cells in the organ of Corti. We show that in Neurod1 conditional null mice there is a premature expression of several genes in the apex of the developing cochlea and outer hair cells are transformed into inner hair cells.Our data suggest that the long noted cross-regulation of Atoh1 expression by Neurog1 might actually be mediated in large part by Neurod1. We suggest that Neurod1 is regulated by both Neurog1 and Atoh1 and provides a negative feedback for either gene. Through this and other feedback, Neurod1 suppresses alternate fates of neurons to differentiate as hair cells and regulates hair cell subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2113094198,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its main effector Protein Kinase A (PKA) are critical for several aspects of neuronal function including synaptic plasticity. Specificity of synaptic plasticity requires that cAMP activates PKA in a highly localized manner despite the speed with which cAMP diffuses. Two mechanisms have been proposed to produce localized elevations in cAMP, known as microdomains: impeded diffusion, and high phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. This paper investigates the mechanism of localized cAMP signaling using a computational model of the biochemical network in the HEK293 cell, which is a subset of pathways involved in PKA-dependent synaptic plasticity. This biochemical network includes cAMP production, PKA activation, and cAMP degradation by PDE activity. The model is implemented in NeuroRD: novel, computationally efficient, stochastic reaction-diffusion software, and is constrained by intracellular cAMP dynamics that were determined experimentally by real-time imaging using an Epac-based FRET sensor (H30). The model reproduces the high concentration cAMP microdomain in the submembrane region, distinct from the lower concentration of cAMP in the cytosol. Simulations further demonstrate that generation of the cAMP microdomain requires a pool of PDE4D anchored in the cytosol and also requires PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PDE4D which increases its activity. The microdomain does not require impeded diffusion of cAMP, confirming that barriers are not required for microdomains. The simulations reported here further demonstrate the utility of the new stochastic reaction-diffusion algorithm for exploring signaling pathways in spatially complex structures such as neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1991246477,"Background Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motif containing co-chaperones of the chaperone Hsp90 are considered control modules that govern activity and specificity of this central folding platform. Steroid receptors are paradigm clients of Hsp90. The influence of some TPR proteins on selected receptors has been described, but a comprehensive analysis of the effects of TPR proteins on all steroid receptors has not been accomplished yet. Methodology and Principal Findings We compared the influence of the TPR proteins FK506 binding proteins 51 and 52, protein phosphatase-5, C-terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein, cyclophillin 40, hepatitis-virus-B X-associated protein-2, and tetratricopeptide repeat protein-2 on all six steroid hormone receptors in a homogeneous mammalian cell system. To be able to assess each cofactor's effect on the transcriptional activity of on each steroid receptor we employed transient transfection in a reporter gene assay. In addition, we evaluated the interactions of the TPR proteins with the receptors and components of the Hsp90 chaperone heterocomplex by coimmunoprecipitation. In the functional assays, corticosteroid and progesterone receptors displayed the most sensitive and distinct reaction to the TPR proteins. Androgen receptor's activity was moderately impaired by most cofactors, whereas the Estrogen receptors' activity was impaired by most cofactors only to a minor degree. Second, interaction studies revealed that the strongly receptor-interacting co-chaperones were all among the inhibitory proteins. Intriguingly, the TPR-proteins also differentially co-precipitated the heterochaperone complex components Hsp90, Hsp70, and p23, pointing to differences in their modes of action. Conclusion and Significance The results of this comprehensive study provide important insight into chaperoning of diverse client proteins via the combinatorial action of (co)-chaperones. The differential effects of the TPR proteins on steroid receptors bear on all physiological processes related to steroid hormone activity."
https://openalex.org/W1982584351,"West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted during mosquito bloodfeeding. Consequently, the first vertebrate cells to contact WNV are cells in the skin, followed by those in the draining lymph node. Macrophages and dendritic cells are critical early responders in host defense against WNV infection, not just because of their role in orchestrating the immune response, but also because of their importance as sites of early peripheral viral replication. Antigen-presenting cell (APC) signals have a profound effect on host antiviral responses and disease severity. During transmission, WNV is intimately associated with mosquito saliva. Due to the ability of mosquito saliva to affect inflammation and immune responses, and the importance of understanding early events in WNV infection, we investigated whether mosquito saliva alters APC signaling during arbovirus infection, and if alterations in cell recruitment occur when WNV infection is initiated with mosquito saliva. Accordingly, experiments were performed with cultured dendritic cells and macrophages, flow cytometry was used to characterize infiltrating cell types in the skin and lymph nodes during early infection, and real-time RT-PCR was employed to evaluate virus and cytokine levels. Our in vitro results suggest that mosquito saliva significantly decreases the expression of interferon-β and inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages (by as much as 50 and 70%, respectively), whilst transiently enhancing interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression. In vivo results indicate that the predominate effect of mosquito feeding is to significantly reduce the recruitment of T cells, leading the inoculation site of mice exposed to WNV alone to have up to 2.8 fold more t cells as mice infected in the presence of mosquito saliva. These shifts in cell population are associated with significantly elevated IL-10 and WNV (up to 4.0 and 10 fold, respectively) in the skin and draining lymph nodes. These results suggest that mosquito saliva dysregulates APC antiviral signaling, and reveal a possible mechanism for the observed enhancement of WNV disease mediated by mosquito saliva via a reduction of T lymphocyte and antiviral activity at the inoculation site, an elevated abundance of susceptible cell types, and a concomitant increase in immunoregulatory activity of IL-10."
https://openalex.org/W2061987997,"Most cells produce ATP in the mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation. However, macrophages, which are major players in the innate immune system, use aerobic glycolysis to produce ATP.

However, it is unclear how HIF-1 activity is maintained in macrophages during normoxia.

HIF-1 was activated by an unanticipated function of MT1-MMP, which led to the stimulation of ATP production via glycolysis. The cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP bound to FIH-1 (factor inhibiting HIF-1), which led to the inhibition of the latter by its recently identified inhibitor, Mint3/APBA3.

https://openalex.org/W2170038412,"Background We recently reported that colon tumor cells stimulate macrophages to release IL-1β, which in turn inactivates GSK3β and enhances Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells, generating a self-amplifying loop that promotes the growth of tumor cells. Principal Findings Here we describe that macrophages protect HCT116 and Hke-3 colon cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Inactivation of IL-1β by neutralizing IL-1β antibody, or silencing of IL-1β in macrophages inhibited their ability to counter TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, IL-1β was sufficient to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL-induced collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) and activation of caspases were prevented by macrophages or by recombinant IL-1β. Pharmacological inhibition of IL-1β release from macrophages by vitamin D3, a potent chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer, restored the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis of tumor cells cultured with macrophages. Macrophages and IL-1β failed to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells expressing dnIκB, dnAKT or dnTCF4, confirming that they oppose TRAIL-induced cell death through induction of Wnt signaling in tumor cells. We showed that macrophages and IL-1β stabilized Snail in tumor cells in an NF-κB/Wnt dependent manner and that Snail deficient tumor cells were not protected from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by macrophages or by IL-1β, demonstrating a crucial role of Snail in the resistance of tumor cells to TRAIL. Significance We have identified a positive feedback loop between tumor cells and macrophages that propagates the growth and promotes the survival of colon cancer cells: tumor cells stimulate macrophages to secrete IL-1β, which in turn, promotes Wnt signaling and stabilizes Snail in tumor cells, conferring resistance to TRAIL. Vitamin D3 halts this amplifying loop by interfering with the release of IL-1β from macrophages. Accordingly, vitamin D3 sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL could be augmented by this readily available chemopreventive agent."
https://openalex.org/W2021029508,"5 S rRNA is an essential component of ribosomes. In eukaryotic cells, it is distinguished by particularly complex intracellular traffic, including nuclear export and re-import. The finding that in mammalian cells 5 S rRNA can eventually escape its usual circuit toward nascent ribosomes to get imported into mitochondria has made the scheme more complex, and it has raised questions about both the mechanism of 5 S rRNA mitochondrial targeting and its function inside the organelle. Previously, we showed that import of 5 S rRNA into mitochondria requires unknown cytosolic proteins. Here, one of them was identified as mitochondrial thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, rhodanese.

This ∼120-nucleotide-long RNA molecule is distinguished by complex structural organization (for review see Ref. 2Smirnov A.V. Entelis N.S. Krasheninnikov I.A. Martin R. Tarassov I.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 73: 1418-1437PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by its crucial role in translation (3Smith M.W. Meskauskas A. Wang P. Sergiev P.V. Dinman J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). But one of the most striking features of eukaryotic 5 S rRNA is the unusual scheme of their intracellular transport. Synthesized outside the nucleolus by RNA polymerase III, they take a special export/re-import pathway to reach and complement nascent large ribosomal subunits (4Guddat U. Bakken A.H. Pieler T. Cell. 1990; 60: 619-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 5Rudt F. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although this pathway was described in detail only in Xenopus oocytes, the data exist that quite a similar scheme of intracellular movements may be found in mammalian somatic cells; thus, it appears to be common for all vertebrates (6Ogata K.

Surprisingly, an interesting bypass from this circuit was reported in mammals: a portion of cytoplasmic 5 S rRNA pool was found to be redirected into the mitochondrial matrix (8Yoshionari S. Koike T.

Although basic requirements for the 5 S rRNA import resemble those for internalization of mitochondrial precursor proteins (dependence on ATP hydrolysis, electrochemical potential across the inner membrane, and functional pre-protein import apparatus), the former mechanism stands apart because of the different nature of the imported molecule and the necessity of some unknown cytosolic protein factors (10Entelis N.S.

Tarassov I. Mager-Heckel A.M. Letzelter M. Martin R.P. Krasheninnikov I.A. Entelis N. RNA. 2008; 14: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), two distinct structural elements of 5 S rRNA were identified as signals of its mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1A). We suggested that these import determinants correspond to binding sites with protein factors responsible for the mitochondrial targeting of 5 S rRNA. It was also hypothesized that 5 S rRNA, once exported from the nucleus, becomes a target of competition between two pathways. The first pathway functions through binding to the ribosomal protein L5, which carries the RNA into the nucleolus where both of them become incorporated into nascent ribosomal particles (5Rudt F. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second pathway is ensured by import factors that address 5 S rRNA into mitochondria (11Smirnov A. Tarassov I. Mager-Heckel A.M. Letzelter M. Martin R.P. Krasheninnikov I.A. Entelis N. RNA. 2008; 14: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how the intracellular distribution of 5 S rRNA is regulated requires characterization of the protein factors directing its mitochondrial import. In this work, we identify one of these factors as mitochondrial thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1), a member of a vast protein superfamily with very diversified functions (12Cipollone R. Ascenzi P. Visca P. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We found that rhodanese binds to 5 S rRNA cotranslationally to form a tight complex where the protein is preserved in its enzymatically inactive conformation. Upon this interaction, 5 S rRNA shows certain functional traits characteristic of Hsp40-type cochaperones involved in mitochondrial precursor targeting. Because only one particular conformation of 5 S rRNA was found to possess such an activity, an elegant 5 S rRNA import mechanism based on a series of reciprocal chaperone events can be proposed. Identification of rhodanese as a 5 S rRNA import factor provided us with a tool to demonstrate, for the first time, the functional significance of the 5 S rRNA import for translational activity of mammalian mitochondria. HepG2 cells grown on the standard DMEM (13Dulbecco R. Freeman G. Virology. 1959; 8: 396-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) were resuspended in a small volume of the NPMD buffer (20 mm sodium/phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) and disrupted by sonication on ice. The resulting lysate was cleared twice at 16,000 × g for 10 min. 0.1% polyethyleneimine (pH 6, adjusted with HCl) was added to the supernatant to remove nucleic acids, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was subjected to the differential (0–25, 25–50, 50–65, and 65–80%) ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellets were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, dialyzed overnight against the NPMD buffer, and filtered through 0.45-μm bacterial filters. The 25–50% (50AS) and the 65–80% (80AS) fractions were further subjected to gel filtration on HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 high resolution. The column was pre-equilibrated with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl). Fractions active in in vitro 5 S rRNA import assays were then loaded on the HiTrap Mono Q column (elution with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.2 mm PMSF, and the linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 3 m). Resulting active fractions were analyzed by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (10 mm sodium/phosphate buffer, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, elution with the linear NaCl gradient from 50 to 1500 mm).

For this, mitochondria were incubated in the Import Mix (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m phosphoenol pyruvate, pH 7.5) with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 5 S rRNA in the presence of HepG2 cytosolic protein fractions and/or purified rhodanese at 37 °C for 10 min. Nonimported RNAs were digested with RNase A; mitochondrial RNAs were isolated and imported RNAs detected by denaturing PAGE followed by Typhoon-Trio (GE Healthcare) scanning and quantification. 1–5% of 5 S rRNA taken into the assay (“input”) were run in parallel for calculation of import efficiency. In all experiments, negative controls without mitochondria or proteins were performed. In some experiments, cytosolic protein preparation was preincubated with anti-rhodanese or anti-ALDH2 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 30 min. 5–10 μg of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 20 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 1 h, washed several times with the same solution, and blocked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C. Hereafter, the membrane was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the Import Mix containing 1 nm [γ-32P]ATP-labeled human 5 S rRNA. The membrane was then washed with the Import Mix without 5 S rRNA and autoradiographed using the PhosphorImager system (Fuji). The corresponding bands on the SDS gel were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/Mascot. Silencing of rhodanese genes was ensured by two consecutive transfections of HepG2 cells spaced by 3 days with a mixture of three cognate siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. For control, cells were transfected with siRNA against luciferase mRNA, as described previously (15Kolesnikova O.A. Entelis N.S. Jacquin-Becker C. Goltzene F. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M.

Both transfected and mock-transfected cells were analyzed for rhodanese expression 3 and 13 days after the second transfection by Western blotting with rhodanese-directed polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mitochondria were isolated and purified as described previously (14Gaines G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and treated with RNase A and digitonin to remove nonspecifically attached RNAs. Total and mitochondrial RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. For respiration tests, 103 of wild-type or siRNA-transfected cells were grown in parallel in DMEM or in DMEM where glucose was replaced by galactose (4 g/liter). Cells were periodically detached from the wells and counted in a standard hemocytometer chamber, and the number of living cells was controlled with trypan blue. Analysis of products of mitochondrial translation in human cells was performed as described previously (15Kolesnikova O.A. Entelis N.S. Jacquin-Becker C. Goltzene F. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M.

For this, 0.5 × 106 semi-confluent cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in DMEM containing 0.5% dialyzed calf serum without methionine with 0.2 g/liter emetine, and 200 mCi/liter [35S]methionine was then added (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 30 min. Finally, 0.1 mm nonlabeled methionine was added to the medium and incubated for 10 min. Cells were then disrupted, and the translation products were analyzed by 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Bovine liver rhodanese (Sigma) was stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, pH 7, at −80 °C. Urea-denatured rhodanese was prepared as described previously (16Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this, the solution of the native enzyme (5 g/liter) was diluted with 3 volumes of 8 m urea, 150 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol in 1× TBE buffer and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The residual enzymatic activity was not higher than 4%. The aggregation assay was performed as described previously (16Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this, 6 μl of urea-denatured rhodanese were rapidly diluted in 100 μl of 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, 150 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7 (pre-equilibrated at 25 °C for 5 min), containing as additives various 5 S rRNA versions or other nucleic acids, and thoroughly mixed for exactly 15 s. Immediately, the kinetics of absorbance at 320 nm (reflecting growth of turbidity caused by large aggregates) was chased. The reactivation of urea-denatured rhodanese was carried out as described previously (17Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For this, denatured rhodanese was diluted with 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Na2S2O3, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to a concentration of 3.6 mg/liter and incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken for enzymatic activity measurements. The activity of the equivalent amount of the native enzyme was taken as 100%. Measurement of enzymatic activity (catalysis of sulfur transfer from thiosulfate to cyanide, followed by formation of the complex between Fe3+ and thiocyanate produced in the reaction to develop the coloration): 3–10 μl of rhodanese-containing solution were mixed with 100 μl of freshly prepared buffer, composed of 40 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Na2S2O3, 50 mm KCN, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 18% formaldehyde. Coloration was developed by mixing with 150 μl of freshly prepared reagent, containing 66.7 g/liter Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 8.67% HNO3, and measured at 460 nm in 1-cm cuvettes. Thermo-inactivation of rhodanese was followed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8, with final rhodanese concentration at 10 mg/liter. UV absorbance spectra measurements were carried out with the NanoDrop-1000 (LabTech). For this, 0.25 μm rhodanese solutions in the buffer, containing 0.21 m sorbitol, 7 mm HEPES-KOH, 7 mm KCl, 0.875 mm MgCl2, 0.35 mm ATP, 1.75 mm dithiothreitol, 0.175 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pH 7.5, + 0.05× phosphate buffer (Sigma) + 0.15× TBE buffer, were used. The denatured enzyme was diluted in the buffer to make the final concentrations of all components equal for all samples (the final concentration of urea being 1.25 m). All spectra were read against identical protein-free controls, in 20 s after beginning of aggregation (early stage) and in 15 min (aggregation completed). Mitochondrial import assay of 35S-labeled rhodanese synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was performed as described previously (18Fernandez-Silva P. Martinez-Azorin F. Micol V. Attardi G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 1–10 nm purified 32P-labeled RNA was denatured at 100 °C in the presence of either 1 mm EDTA or 5 mm MgCl2 and then slowly cooled down to 25 °C. It was then incubated with rhodanese in the Import Mix for 10–15 min. Resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8% PAAG, 2The abbreviation used is: PAAGpolyacrylamide gel. 0.5× TBE, 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE buffer at 10 V/cm at 4 °C followed by Typhoon-Trio (GE Healthcare) scanning and quantification. The standard Scatchard plot construction and analysis were described previously (19Henis Y.I. Levitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the resulting curves are concave (indicating the presence of several binding sites, a consequence of the complex mixture of rhodanese forms produced after urea dilution (17Panda M.

Cotranslational binding of 5 S rRNA to rhodanese was studied as described previously (21Lin E. Lin S.W. Lin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2510-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Human rhodanese cDNA was kindly provided by F. Broly. Synthesis of [35S]Met-labeled human rhodanese was carried out in TnT T7 Quick for PCR DNA (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μm human 5 S rRNA labeled with ChromaTide Alexa Fluor 488-5-UTP (Invitrogen) was added to the translation mixture at the very beginning of synthesis (for cotranslational binding) or in 70 min after launching translation (post-translational binding). Translation products were analyzed by SDS gel and by native gradient 4–10% PAAG, 0.5× TBE, 0–30% glycerol electrophoresis (10 V/cm, 4 °C). Both RNA and protein signals were measured with Typhoon-Trio scanner. T7 transcripts were purified on denaturing gel to homogeneity. 0.1–0.2 μg of the RNA was incubated at 100 °C for 1 min in 10 μl of either 1 mm MgCl2 (to obtain 5 S rRNAMg) or 1 mm EDTA (to obtain 5 S rRNAEDTA). Then the RNA was renatured by slow cooling down to 25 °C, mixed with 2 μl of 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 30% glycerol, and loaded on native 8% PAAG in 1× TBE buffer. Samples were run at 10 V/cm until the bromphenol blue was out. Positions of RNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Human 5 S rRNA was preassembled from three oligoribonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) in a way that the extremity of the β-domain carried a Cy-3 moiety; the extremity of the γ-domain was labeled with fluorescein (Fig. 5B) and that of the α-domain bore the [32P]phosphate. Both fluorophores were attached to CC-dinucleotides; this environment was optimal for their mobility (22Radman-Livaja M. Biswas T. Mierke D. Landy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3913-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Annealing was performed in two steps as follows: (i) oligonucleotides “2” and “3” (see Fig. 5, B and C) (0.4 μm each) were heated together to 85 °C in 40 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, or 1 mm EDTA and then left to cool down slowly to 50 °C; (ii) the resulting mixture was added to 1 μm oligonucleotide “1” (see Fig. 5, B and C), heated to 60 °C, and left to cool down slowly overnight. Forms obtained either in the presence (5 S rRNAMg) or in the absence (5 S rRNAEDTA) of Mg2+ were run in parallel in 8% PAAG, 0.5× TBE, 200 V at 4 °C, and then their fluorescent (fluorescein, excitation at 488 nm/emission at 520 nm; cyanin-3, excitation at 532 nm/emission at 580 nm) and radioactive (32P) signals were measured with the use of a Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences) in wet gel and quantified with ImageQuantTM. 5 S rRNA preassembled from the same oligonucleotides but without any fluorescence acceptor on the β-domain was used as control. The FRET efficiency (E) was calculated by fluorescein quenching, with the use of linearization of the standard Equation 1, Ida[d][da]=Id(1−rE)(Eq. 1) where Ida and Id are fluorescein fluorescence intensities in 5 S rRNAs with both donor and acceptor, and with donor alone, respectively; [da] and [d] are radioactive signals of 5 S rRNAs with both donor and acceptor, and with donor alone, respectively, r indicates efficiency of labeling with the donor fluorophore (r = 1, in our case). The distance between fluorophores (R) was calculated from Equation 2, R=R0(1E1)16(Eq. 2) where R0 indicates the Förster critical distance (for the pair fluorescein/cyanin-3 under these conditions it is usually ∼56 Å; see for example Ref. 23Norman D.G. Grainger R.J. Uhrín D. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6317-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To search for proteins involved in the 5 S rRNA mitochondrial import, the total HepG2 cell protein extract was subjected to multistep fractioning (Fig. 1B). On every step, resulting fractions were tested for their capacity to direct import of radioactively labeled 5 S rRNA into isolated HepG2 mitochondria. None of the separate fractions was found to be import-competent. In contrast, 5 S rRNA readily accumulated in mitochondria when a particular combination of two distinct fractions was used (Fig. 1C), suggesting requirement of at least two soluble proteins for 5 S rRNA import into the organelles. Because RNA import factors are assumed to recognize and to associate with their cargo, we checked the presence of 5 S rRNA-binding proteins in one of the final active fractions (14H/50AS) by Northwestern analysis (Fig. 1D). Two major proteins of ∼34 and ∼55 kDa were revealed. Among candidates identified in this fraction by MALDI-TOF/MS (Table 1), a 33.4-kDa enzyme, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanese), was the best scored. The other protein able to interact with 5 S rRNA is probably another mitochondrial enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase or its cytosolic precursor.TABLE 1Protein components of the fraction 14H/50AS identified by MALDI-TOF/MS as putatively capable of 5 S rRNA bindingProteinMassLocalizationProbability-based Mowse scorekDaAldehyde dehydrogenase55Mitochondrial inner membrane86Precursor of aldehyde dehydrogenase57Cytosol (moves to mitochondria)84Annexin V36Cytosol, nucleus60Precursor of aldo-keto reductase 237Cytosol (moves to mitochondria)150Regucalcin34Nucleus, cytosol76Rhodanese33Mitochondrial matrix, cytosol185Glutathione S-transferase26Cytosol81 Open table in a new tab Rhodanese appeared to be of great interest because it is known to be synthesized on free cytosolic ribosomes and then imported into mitochondria (24Miller D.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21226-21230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rhodanese homology superfamily embraces proteins involved in diverse processes, including cyanide detoxication, Fe/S cluster formations, and other redox reactions as well as intracellular transport and regulatory pathways (12Cipollone R. Ascenzi P. Visca P. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, rhodanese seemed to be a valuable candidate for the role of 5 S rRNA mitochondrial import factor. To check this possibility, we performed a series of in vitro import assays, where purified bovine liver rhodanese (89.6% identical to the human one), combined with the 80AS fraction, was shown to be as active in directing 5 S rRNA into human mitochondria as the whole fraction 14H/50AS (Fig. 1E). The 5 S rRNA import efficiency increased in a saturable manner upon growth of rhodanese concentration, and vice versa, preincubation of the cytosolic protein extract with anti-rhodanese antibodies led to a significant decrease or even total loss of its ability to direct the import (Fig. 1, F and G). In the same experiment, antibodies specific to another putative 5 S rRNA-binding protein, aldehyde dehydrogenase, had no effect on the 5 S rRNA mitochondrial import (Fig. 1G). These data strongly suggest that rhodanese was indeed the 5 S rRNA import factor present in the 14H/50AS fraction. To validate rhodanese as putative 5 S rRNA import factor in vivo, we studied dependence between the expression level of the protein and the amount of 5 S rRNA inside mitochondria in living human cells. For this, expression of rhodanese genes was inhibited by transient transfection of HepG2 cells with specific siRNAs, and the effect of this inhibition on the 5 S rRNA import was studied (Fig. 2, A and B). Strong correlation between the intracellular level of rhodanese and the mitochondrial 5 S rRNA level was observed. The decrease of rhodanese expression led to a 4-fold drop of 5 S rRNA import (the minor amounts of remaining mitochondrial 5 S rRNA may reflect its longer turnover time than that of rhodanese). On the contrary, restoration of expression 13 days after transfection was marked by equally proportional growth of the 5 S rRNA level inside mitochondria. Neither transcription of mitochondrial DNA nor the overall cellular 5 S rRNA level was affected, indicating that the effect of the short term withdrawal of rhodanese on the 5 S rRNA import was specific. This result indicates that rhodanese is indeed essential for the 5 S rRNA import in vivo. Intriguingly, those changes in the mitochondrial level of 5 S rRNA were found to be associated with proportional decrease/restoration of the general mitochondrial translational activity (Fig. 2C). Cells transfected with rhodanese mRNA-directed siRNAs also demonstrated significantly slower growth on the galactose-containing medium, indicating insufficient mitochondrial respiration activity (Fig. 2D). Because the function of rhodanese inside mitochondria does not seem to be associated with translation or formation of respiratory complexes (12Cipollone R. Ascenzi P. Visca P. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), deletion of its putative orthologue (YOR251c) in yeast does not produce a respiration phenotype on galactose medium (26Giaever G.

https://openalex.org/W1991895163,"Background The morphology of human pollical distal phalanges (PDP) closely reflects the adaptation of human hands for refined precision grip with pad-to-pad contact. The presence of these precision grip-related traits in the PDP of fossil hominins has been related to human-like hand proportions (i.e. short hands with a long thumb) enabling the thumb and finger pads to contact. Although this has been traditionally linked to the appearance of stone tool-making, the alternative hypothesis of an earlier origin—related to the freeing of the hands thanks to the advent of terrestrial bipedalism—is also possible given the human-like intrinsic hand proportion found in australopiths. Methodology/Principal Findings We perform morphofunctional and morphometric (bivariate and multivariate) analyses of most available hominin pollical distal phalanges, including Orrorin, Australopithecus, Paranthropous and fossil Homo, in order to investigate their morphological affinities. Our results indicate that the thumb morphology of the early biped Orrorin is more human-like than that of australopiths, in spite of its ancient chronology (ca. 6 Ma). Moreover, Orrorin already displays typical human-like features related to precision grasping. Conclusions These results reinforce previous hypotheses relating the origin of refined manipulation of natural objects–not stone tool-making–with the relaxation of locomotor selection pressures on the forelimbs. This suggests that human hand length proportions are largely plesiomorphic, in the sense that they more closely resemble the relatively short-handed Miocene apes than the elongated hand pattern of extant hominoids. With the advent of terrestrial bipedalism, these hand proportions may have been co-opted by early hominins for enhanced manipulative capabilities that, in turn, would have been later co-opted for stone tool-making in the genus Homo, more encephalized than the previous australopiths. This hypothesis remains may be further tested by the finding of more complete hands of unequivocally biped early hominins."
https://openalex.org/W1978495222,"Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone regulated by collaborating proteins called cochaperones. This machinery is involved in the conformational activation of client proteins like signaling kinases, transcription factors, or ribonucleoproteins (RNP) such as telomerase. TPR (TetratricoPeptide Repeat)-containing protein associated with Hsp90 (Tah1) and protein interacting with Hsp90 (Pih1) have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as two Hsp90 cochaperones involved in chromatin remodeling complexes and small nucleolar RNP maturation. Tah1 possesses a minimal TPR domain and binds specifically to the Hsp90 C terminus, whereas Pih1 displays no homology to other protein motifs and has been involved in core RNP protein interaction. While Pih1 alone was unstable and was degraded from its N terminus, we showed that Pih1 and Tah1 form a stable heterodimeric complex that regulates Hsp90 ATPase activity. We used different biophysical approaches such as analytical ultracentrifugation, microcalorimetry, and noncovalent mass spectrometry to characterize the Pih1-Tah1 complex and its interaction with Hsp90. We showed that the Pih1-Tah1 heterodimer binds to Hsp90 with a similar affinity and the same stoichiometry as Tah1 alone. However, the Pih1-Tah1 complex antagonizes Tah1 activity on Hsp90 and inhibits the chaperone ATPase activity. We further identified the region within Pih1 responsible for interaction with Tah1 and inhibition of Hsp90, allowing us to suggest an interaction model for the Pih1-Tah1/Hsp90 complex. These results, together with previous reports, suggest a role for the Pih1-Tah1 cochaperone complex in the recruitment of client proteins such as core RNP proteins to Hsp90."

The aerobically purified enzyme was anaerobically activated in the presence of 2 mm DTT. The linalool dehydratase catalyzed in vitro two reactions in both directions depending on the thermodynamic driving forces: a water secession from the tertiary alcohol linalool to the corresponding acyclic monoterpene myrcene and an isomerization of the primary allylalcohol geraniol in its stereoisomer linalool.

These unsaturated hydrocarbons are classified as highly volatile organic compounds. Plants as major producers emit more than 100 million tons/year to the atmosphere (6Zimmerman P.R. Chatfield R.B. Fishman J. Crutzen P.J. Hanst P.L. Geophys. Res. Lett. 1978; 5: 679-682Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar) where they are photooxidized and contribute to aerosol formation (7Kamens R. Jang M.

Schurr U. Wahner A. Nature. 2009; 461: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). An example of physiological function is as defense against herbivores: plants often induce the synthesis of monoterpenes as repellents upon insect damage (9Pare P.W. Tumlinson J.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 30-31Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The mineralization of monoterpenes by aerobic microorganisms has been studied in detail with Pseudomonas species (10Trudgill P.W. Gunsalus I.C. Terpinoid Metabolism by Pseudomonas. The Bacteria: A Treatise on Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1986: 483-528Google Scholar, 11Förster-Fromme K. Jendrossek D. FEMS Microbiol. 2008; 286: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The aerobic metabolism depends on oxygenases that catalyze hydroxylation reactions with molecular oxygen as co-substrate (12Hartmans S. Weber F.J. Somhorst D.P. de Bont J.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 2555-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the absence of oxygen, alternative biochemical pathways have been identified for hydrocarbon-mineralizing bacteria. Alkanes, e.g. n-hexane, and aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl substituents, e.g. toluene, are anaerobically activated by glycine radical enzymes, and the radical intermediates add to fumarate, yielding methylalkylsuccinate and benzylsuccinate, respectively (13Evans P.J.

The anaerobic mineralization of monoterpenes to carbon dioxide is frequently present in denitrifying bacteria (18Harder J. Heyen U. Probian C. Foss S. Biodegradation. 2000; 11: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cultivation approaches established the enrichment of monoterpene-mineralizing microorganisms (19Harder J. Probian C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3804-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the isolation of strains of Alcaligenes defragrans (20Foss S. Heyden U. Harder J. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 21: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Thauera terpenica (21Foss S. Harder J. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 21: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A. defragrans was recently placed in the newly defined genus Castellaniella, as C. defragrans (22Kämpfer P. Denger K. Cook A.M. Lee S.T. Jäckel U. Denner E.B. Busse H.J. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2006; 56: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Initial studies on potential metabolites of the degradation pathway identified isoterpinolene as metabolite that was apparently not further metabolized (23Heyen U. Harder J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 169: 67-71Crossref Google Scholar) and geranic acid as ionic intermediate present in nitrate-respiring cells that were grown on acyclic or cyclic monoterpenes, e.g. myrcene or limonene (24Heyen U. Harder J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A simple pathway hypothesis is a hydration of myrcene, leading to geraniol and further to geranic acid (Fig. 1). We initiated biotransformation studies with soluble extracts of C. defragrans. In this article we report on the detection of novel enzyme activities and the isolation and characterization of an anaerobic linalool dehydratase-isomerase, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the reversible dehydration and isomerization of linalool (3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol) (Fig. 1). R-Limonene (95%), myrcene (90%), linalool (99%), and geraniol (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals used were of the highest available purity and were purchased from Aldrich, Boehringer, Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), Merck, Sigma, and Bio-Rad Laboratories. Gases (CO2 grade 4.8, N2 grade 5.0, and O2 grade 2.0) were supplied by Air Liquide (Düsseldorf, Germany). Chromatography media and instruments were from GE Healthcare. C. defragrans strain 65Phen was maintained as described (20Foss S. Heyden U. Harder J. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 21: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For biomass production, the strain was cultivated on 30 mm limonene and 100 mm nitrate (24Heyen U. Harder J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 1-liter preculture was inoculated in a 10-liter vessel of carbonate-buffered mineral salt medium at pH 7.0. Filter-sterilized limonene and vitamins (25Aeckersberg F. Bak F. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 5-14Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were added after cooling, and the culture was incubated for 6–7 days with a CO2/N2 (10/90 (v/v)) gas stream of 24 ml h−1 at 28 °C. The stirrer frequency was initially 150 rpm and was increased during exponential growth phase of C. defragrans up to 250 rpm to ensure optimal substrate availability. Cell harvest began after the addition of reducing agents, 50 μm Fe(II)Cl2 and 2 mm DTT. Cells in the late exponential growth phase (A600 ≈ 3) were transferred by gas pressure to centrifuge tubes and then collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 9000 × g at 4 °C. For the preparation of the soluble proteins, 40 g of wet or frozen cells were suspended in 60 ml of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm DTT and disintegrated in two passages through a French pressure cell press (Amincon, Rochester, NY) at 10.3 MPa. The soluble fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation for 90 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cell debris, unbroken cells, and membrane proteins. Salt or urea containing linalool dehydratase fractions were dialyzed three times against a 1000-fold volume of 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, for 20 min at 4 °C and under magnetic stirring. Purified and dialyzed linalool dehydratase fractions were stored under an anoxic gas phase at 4 °C. Geraniol isomerization and linalool dehydration were assayed routinely in a two-phase system. Vials (17 × 38 mm; Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany) were prewarmed at 35 °C. Anoxic protein solution was transferred into the vials, and DTT was added to 2 mm. The tests were sealed with a butyl septum, and the headspace was flushed with CO2/N2 (10/90 (v/v)). The reaction was started by adding a distinct linalool or geraniol concentration to investigate the reaction to myrcene. 10–100 mm organic substrate was dissolved in 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (HMN). 2The abbreviations used are: HMN2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonaneDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide. The organic phase was added in a 1:1 ratio to the aqueous protein solution. Kinetic parameters were determined in a one-phase system with 10% (v/v) DMSO. The reaction was started by adding monoterpene (0.1–10 mm) that was dissolved in anoxic 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, with 10% DMSO. In a third assay system, a pure myrcene phase (1/2 (v/v) myrcene/Tris-HCl buffer) was applied for measuring linalool and subsequently geraniol formation. The tubes were immediately transferred into a 35 °C shaking incubator. For kinetic analyses and the myrcene turnover, aqueous samples were taken at different time points and directly injected into the GC. In the two-phase system, 1 μl of the organic HMN carrier phase was injected to determine the substrate and product concentration. 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane dimethyl sulfoxide. To estimate the effect of temperature on linalool dehydratase activity, the two-phase assay was performed at temperatures between 4 °C and 45 °C. The pH optimum was tested by varying the buffer systems with pH values near the specific pKa values at 35 °C. The two-phase assay was also used to determine the influence of different effectors on enzyme activities. The concentrations of the monoterpenes were analyzed by GC (Auto System XL; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with an Optima®-5 (0.25-μm film thickness, 50 m × 0.32-mm inner diameter; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) column and flame ionization detector. The following temperature program was applied: injection port temperature, 250 °C; column start temperature, 85 °C for 1 min, increasing to 120 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, 120 °C for 0.1 min, increasing to 290 °C at a rate of 45 °C min−1, 290 °C for 1 min; detection temperature, 350 °C. The split ratio was set to 1:25. The purification was performed with an Äkta system (GE Healthcare). All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C with filtered (0.2 μm) and degassed buffers. 100 ml of soluble extract obtained from cells grown on limonene was applied to a Source 30Q column (5 × 30 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (AIE-Q1). The enzyme eluted at 200 mm NaCl in the aforementioned buffer during a stepwise gradient performed with 3.5 ml min−1. Fractions containing linalool dehydratase were pooled, and saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to a final concentration of 15% (v/v). The protein solution was applied to a Butyl-Sepharose FF column (4.7 ml) preequilibrated with 15% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After a first elution with 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the target enzyme was eluted with 6 m urea. The urea fraction, typically 20 ml, was mixed with saturated ammonium sulfate solution to a final concentration of 40% (v/v). After centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g and 20 °C, the supernatant was withdrawn, and the pellet was solved in 2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The concentrated solution was passed through a SuperdexTM 200-pg column (120 ml) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The active fractions from the gel filtration were applied to a second anion exchange chromatography with a different column material (ResourceQ, 1 ml) that was preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The enzyme eluted at 120 mm NaCl in a step gradient performed with 2 ml min−1 (AIE-Q2). The apparent relative molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a SuperdexTM 200-pg column (120 ml) in 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, The standard proteins were: catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa). The molecular mass of the monomeric enzyme was determined using a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The protein ladder (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) covered a range molecular masses from 10 to 170 kDa. Standards and purified linalool dehydratase fractions were dissolved in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, in the range between 10 and 100 μg ml−1. UV absorption spectra were obtained by using a DU 600 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). The protein content was measured by Coomassie Blue R-250 protein assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) and by using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified linalool dehydratase was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a PVDF membrane (Sequi-Blot; Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the method of Towbin et al. (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed for 1 min with distilled water and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (0.025% (v/v) in 40% (v/v) methanol) for 30 s before destaining with a water/methanol/acetic acid mixture (50/45/5, v/v/v). The PVDF membrane was washed with distilled water and dried for 6 h. The protein was excised from the membrane, and Edman degradation of the N-terminal amino acid residues was performed by Toplab GmbH (Martinsried, Germany). The gene and the protein sequence were deposited at GenBank under accession no. FR669447. Standard molecular biology methods were applied. In short, the ldi gene was amplified with the primers ldi_NdeI_fw (TGCGACATATGATGCGGTTCACATTG) and ldi_BglII_rw (CGCGAGATCTTTATTTCCCTGCGA) from genomic C. defragrans DNA and ligated into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen). The NdeI-BglII-flanked gene was transferred into pET-42a(+) (Novagen, Merck KGaA), and the gene was expressed in E. coli BL21 StarTM (DE3) (Invitrogen). The construct correctness was confirmed by sequencing. Cultures were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Soluble extracts were assayed in the anaerobic two-phase system. Soluble extracts of C. defragrans catalyzed the transformation of geraniol in two directions (Fig. 1). A NAD+-reducing activity showed the presence of a geraniol dehydrogenase. 3J. Harder, unpublished results. In the absence of an electron acceptor, the dialyzed soluble extract initially formed linalool, and then, after a certain linalool concentration was reached, myrcene appeared. Both compounds, linalool and myrcene, were detected and identified by GC and GC-MS (data not shown). In separate experiments, the dialyzed soluble extract transformed linalool to myrcene. Biomass yields in a pH-controlled fermenter were lower on myrcene than on limonene. Hence, we grew C. defragrans on limonene. The crude extracts showed comparable specific linalool dehydratase activities. In contrast, the enzyme activity was not detected in cells grown on acetate. Addition of limonene (10 mm) to the culture growing on acetate resulted in induction of the enzyme activity after 10 h (data not shown). The purification of the linalool dehydratase initially yielded a preparation with several proteins (data not shown). The purification procedure was significantly improved by including a Butyl-Sepharose column. The protein eluted from this column with 6 m urea. In a five-step protocol, the enzyme activity was purified to a single protein band (Fig. 2). The linalool dehydratase protein yield was 0.02% of the initial protein, accompanied by a 1846-fold increase in the specific activity (Table 1). Gel filtration chromatography on a SuperdexTM 200-pg column gave a single peak of active protein after a retention volume of 62 ml. Based on a calibration with standard proteins, linalool dehydratase exhibited a native molecular mass of 160 kDa. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed a single band with a molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 2). These observations suggested that the native form of linalool dehydratase from C. defragrans 65Phen is likely a homotetramer (α4). UV-visible absorbance spectra revealed the absence of chromophors between 300 and 850 nm, suggesting that there was no prosthetic group present.TABLE 1Purification of linalool dehydratase from C. defragrans 65PhenPurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityRelative specific activityProtein yieldmgnanokatalsnanokatals/mg%Soluble extract2490.312.90.0051100Anion exchange (AIE-Q1)401.625.50.0631316.13Hydrophobic interaction33.319.20.5751151.34Ammonium sulfate precipitation15.333.92.2134430.61Size exclusion6.919.32.7835570.28Anion exchange (AIE-Q2)0.65.39.22818460.02 Open table in a new tab The purified protein catalyzed the dehydration of linalool to myrcene in the absence of molecular oxygen but required 2 mm DTT. Geraniol was isomerized initially to linalool, and subsequently myrcene appeared (Fig. 3A). Both activities occurred concurrently in all purification steps; e.g. Fig. 4 shows the final anion exchange purification. The purification of the geraniol isomerase activity was 1740-fold similar to the 1846-fold purification of the linalool dehydratase activity.FIGURE 4Enzyme purification by anion exchange chromatography (AIE-Q2). Linalool dehydratase and geraniol isomerase activities eluted together at 120 mm sodium chloride. The most active fraction contained a single protein on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The enzyme activity measurements were performed in a two-phase system with HMN as organic phase. Like other monoterpenes, myrcene is 100-fold less soluble in water than monoterpenoids, e.g. geraniol or linalool: myrcene has a solubility of 43 μm and a octanol/water partition coefficient of logP = 4.5 (29Schmid C. Steinbrecher R. Ziegler H. Trees. 1992; 6: 32-36Google Scholar). The organic phase served also as reservoir for the monoterpenoids. This dilution influences the actual concentrations of geraniol and linalool in aqueous solution. In equilibrium with the organic phase, calculation revealed micromolar concentrations for geraniol and linalool in the aqueous phase. Observed rates under these conditions were low, 14.5 picokatals mg−1 for linalool dehydratase and 8.8 picokatals mg−1 for geraniol isomerase. The enzyme activities were not inhibited by 10% (v/v) DMSO. Thus, we performed the kinetic characterization in a single-phase system with 10% (v/v) DMSO in water. The linalool dehydratase and the geraniol isomerase activities exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Vmax values of 140 and 410 nanokatals mg−1 protein, respectively (Fig. 5). The Km values for linalool and geraniol were 750 μm and 500 μm, respectively. Quantification of the reverse reactions, the hydration of myrcene to linalool and the isomerization of linalool to geraniol, were attempted with a myrcene-saturated aqueous phase that was maintained by a pure myrcene phase. The formation of linalool proceeded initially with a maximum specific activity of 133 picokatals mg−1 (Fig. 3B). After an accumulation of 0.2 mm linalool, geraniol was formed at a similar rate. This experiment revealed the reversibility of the enzyme activity. In systems without a pure myrcene phase, we never detected the formation of geraniol from linalool, neither in the two-phase system with an organic carrier nor in a DMSO-containing aqueous system. Myrcene was the only product detected in these experiments. We tested other acyclic monoterpenes as substrate for the enzyme. Neither the monoterpenes α- and β-ocimene nor the monoterpenoids citronellol and nerol were transformed. A 3-methylene group is absent in the ocimenes that have a 3-methyl-1,3-diene structure. Of the cis-3-methyl-2-en-1-ol motif present in geraniol, citronellol lacks the double bond at the C2-carbon atom, and nerol is the trans-isomer to geraniol. This suggests a highly specific binding site for the substrates. The purified linalool dehydratase required only DTT as a reducing agent and an oxygen free microenvironment (<1% (v/v)) for the dehydration of linalool. The activity was not detectable in the presence of 1 mm Ti(III)citrate. Other inhibitors were molecular oxygen (Table 2) and high salt concentrations. NaCl, KCl, or MgCl2 at a concentration of 220 mm inhibited the enzyme activity completely. The metal-chelating agent EDTA (5 mm) did not affect the enzyme activity, suggesting that either the protein does not require metal ions for activity or the chelating molecule was not able to remove the metal ions under the assay conditions. Potassium nitrite or nitrate (20 mm) did not influence the enzyme activity. Coenzyme A was ineffective as a cofactor. However, phosphate as buffer or pyridoxal phosphate as well as S-adenosylmethionine modulated the enzyme activity. The enzyme is inhibited by urea: 20% activity remained at 3 m urea, and no activity was detected in 6 m urea.TABLE 2Effectors on enzyme activityAssayLinalool dehydrataseGeraniol isomerase%%Complete assay100100−2 mm DTT1010+1 mm Ti(III)citrate00+0.1% (v/v) O2100100+0.5% (v/v) O2110110+1% (v/v) O29090+20% (v/v) O255+99.9% (v/v) O200+1 mm pyridoxal phosphate65100+40 mm S-adenosylmethionine20200 Open table in a new tab The linalool dehydratase activity had an optimal temperature at 35 °C. The enzyme activity had a pH maximum at low alkaline conditions (supplemental Fig. S1), but there was a sharp decrease in linalool dehydratase activity beyond pH 9.0. The optimal pH was 9.0 with Tris-HCl buffer. The temperature dependence of the reaction showed a linear Arrhenius plot in the range from 22 °C to 35 °C (supplemental Fig. S2), with an activation energy of EA = 68.6 kJ/mol. The N-terminal protein sequence was determined, and the corresponding open reading frame was found within a fosmid sequence obtained from C. defragrans 65Phen. 4A. W̄ulfing, F. Germer, A. Meyerdierks, and J. Harder, unpublished results. The gene coded for a preprotein with 397 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide sequence (MRFTLKTTAIVSAAALLAGFGPPPRAA) for transport into the periplasmatic space (supplemental Fig. S3). The alanine pair residues represent the cleavage motif. The experimentally determined N terminus of the purified protein started with the second alanine of the predicted cleavage motif (AELPPGRLATTE). Analyses with SignalP 3.0 (30Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5586) Google Scholar) based on studies of signal-sequence cleavage sites (31von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) suggested a Sec-dependent membrane translocation mechanism for the preprotein into the periplasmatic space. Thus, the purified protein represents a mature protein. According to in silico mass calculation the precursor exhibits a molecular mass of 43 kDa. Comparisons of the protein and of the gene sequences with nucleotide, microbial genome and environmental metagenomic datasets did not reveal significant relationships to known proteins and genes. TblastN (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) identified the closest relative as a hypothetical partial mRNA protein from the eukaryotic ascomycota Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 with an E value of 2E-08. The biotransformation potential of Aspergillus species on myrcene has been elucidated previously (33Farooq A.R. Rahman A. Choudhary A.I. Curr. Org. Chem. 2004; 8: 353-367Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although linalool was not detected as a transformation product. TblastP identified a hypothetical protein from another eukaryotic ascomycota, Nectria hematococca mpVI, as closest related protein, with an E value of 2E-12. A ClustalW alignment of the linalool dehydratase-isomerase showed no relevant scores with characterized alkene hydratases, namely a γ-carotene 1,2-hydratase (CruF) from Deinococcus radiodurans R1 (34Sun Z. Shen S. Wang C. Wang H. Hu Y. Jiao J. Ma T. Tian B. Hua Y. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2775-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a hydroxyneurosporene synthase from Rhodospirillum rubrum ATCC 11170, and a γ-carotene 1,2-hydroxylase from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. This was a further indication of the novel character of this enzyme and its catalytic activity. The identified open reading frame was used to construct the expression vector pET-42a(+)-LDI. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced 3-ml cultures showed a linalool dehydratase activity of 380 nanokatals and a geraniol isomerase activity of 310 nanokatals in a 6-h assay. Control cultures with the vector lacking the ldi gene had no enzyme activity. Soluble extracts of the induced cells had a specific linalool dehydratase activity of 435 picokatals mg−1 protein and a geraniol isomerase activity of 116 picokatals mg−1 protein in the two-phase assay. Myrcene is an acyclic C10-hydrocarbon and represents a large fraction (74%) of monoterpenes extracted from the essential oils of the hop plant Humulus lupulus (35Thompson M.L. Marriott R. Dowle A. Grogan G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 85: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transformation of this unsaturated hydrocarbon at the enzymatic level has never investigated under anaerobic conditions. Here, we describe a new initial reaction in the anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons: the hydration of myrcene. First, a water molecule is added to the methylene double bond. Mechanistically, it may be equivalent to a chemical water addition catalyzed by acids, leading to linalool, a tertiary allylalcohol (3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-ol). A subsequent isomerization yielded the primary allylalcohol geraniol (3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-1-ol). These two reactions are catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme, the linalool dehydratase-isomerase. The thermodynamic equilibrium favors the formation of myrcene from geraniol. Linalool is thermodynamically more stable than geraniol: according to experimental observations in a two-phase system with Thauera linaloolentis (36Foss S. Harder J. FEMS Microbiol. 1997; 149: 71-75Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), linalool is 5.9-kJ mol−1 more stable than geraniol. Our observations confirmed this equilibrium with the enzyme from C. defragrans: the linalool dehydratase-isomerase catalyzes the formation of linalool from geraniol and subsequently of myrcene from linalool. In this thermodynamically favorable direction, the formation of myrcene from geraniol may be seen as detoxification process for the monoterpene alcohol. The monoterpene alcohols have a higher cell toxicity than the monoterpenes. The observation of the reverse reactions, myrcene to linalool and linalool to geraniol, revealed that the Gibbs free energy change of the hydration is rather small. The steady-state equilibrium with 0.2 mm linalool in the presence of a myrcene phase (Fig. 3B) corresponds, considering a maximum water solubility of linalool of 10.1 mm (37Fichan I. Larroche C. Gros J.B. J. Chem. Eng. Data. 1999; 44: 56-62Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar), to a difference in free energy of −10.1 kJ mol−1 at 35 °C. Thus, the enzymatic reaction can provide a thermodynamically limited pool of geraniol for further metabolic reactions. The in vivo monoterpene mineralization rate of 325 picokatals (milligrams of total protein)−1 (24Heyen U. Harder J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is higher than the in vitro formation rate of geranic acid (0.9 picokatals (milligrams of soluble protein)−1 (24Heyen U. Harder J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) and the “reverse” enzyme activity in soluble extracts (Table 1). The in vitro activity of the enzyme is too low to sustain the in vivo monoterpene turnover. This may suggest that the enzyme may contribute primarily to the monoterpene resistance. However, future studies on the genetic level, including the development of a genetic system for C. defragrans, are clearly required to reveal the importance of this enzyme in the monoterpene mineralization pathway(s). The linalool dehydratase-isomerase seems to be a cofactor-free enzyme. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme revealed only an absorption maximum at 280 nm, indicating the presence of aromatic amino acid residues (data not shown). The purification with an elution with 6 m urea suggests an unfolding and a spontaneous folding during the dialysis. This, together with the lack of inhibition by EDTA, argues for the lack of a nonpermanently bound cofactor. The expression in active form in E. coli can be interpreted as the absence of a complex posttranslational enzyme activation by metal cofactor integration. The only requirement for the enzyme activity of the purified protein was a mild reducing agent, DTT, and the absence of oxygen or a strong reducing agent, e.g. Ti(III)citrate. The amino acid sequence analysis attested a Sec-dependent translocation of linalool dehydratase-isomerase. The process involves a cytosolic preprotein which, typical for these translocated proteins, has a short signal sequence with a two alanine motif at the end, representing the cleavage site (31von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The preprotein is transported across the cytoplasmatic membrane in an unfolded state. During this process, the signal peptide is cleaved. A periplasmatic location for a hydrocarbon activation enzyme was already detected in the denitrifying Azoarcus strain EbN1 (38Kniemeyer O. Heider J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21381-21386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A periplasmatic dehydrogenase oxidizes ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol. Future experiments with protein labeling or specific antibodies may describe the translocation in more detail. In summary, this work depicts the enzyme for the initial metabolism of myrcene, an acyclical monoterpene, under anaerobic conditions. It is a novel type of dehydratase-isomerase that acts on myrcene, linalool, and geraniol. We recommend the disposition of a new protein family with the EC number 4.2.1.X.

https://openalex.org/W2054982474,"Background The A/H1N1/2009 influenza pandemic made evident the need for faster and higher-yield methods for the production of influenza vaccines. Platforms based on virus culture in mammalian or insect cells are currently under investigation. Alternatively, expression of fragments of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in prokaryotic systems can potentially be the most efficacious strategy for the manufacture of large quantities of influenza vaccine in a short period of time. Despite experimental evidence on the immunogenic potential of HA protein constructs expressed in bacteria, it is still generally accepted that glycosylation should be a requirement for vaccine efficacy. Methodology/Principal Findings We expressed the globular HA receptor binding domain, referred to here as HA63–286-RBD, of the influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus in Escherichia coli using a simple, robust and scalable process. The recombinant protein was refolded and purified from the insoluble fraction of the cellular lysate as a single species. Recombinant HA63–286-RBD appears to be properly folded, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and bio-recognition assays. It binds specifically to serum antibodies from influenza A/H1N1/2009 patients and was found to be immunogenic, to be capable of triggering the production of neutralizing antibodies, and to have protective activity in the ferret model. Conclusions/Significance Projections based on our production/purification data indicate that this strategy could yield up to half a billion doses of vaccine per month in a medium-scale pharmaceutical production facility equipped for bacterial culture. Also, our findings demonstrate that glycosylation is not a mandatory requirement for influenza vaccine efficacy."

I-Smads inhibit TGF-β family signaling principally through physical interaction with type I receptors (activin receptor-like kinases), so as to compete with receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) for activation. However, how I-Smads interact with type I receptors is not well understood. In the present study, we found that Smad7 has two modes of interaction with type I receptors. One is through a three-finger-like structure in the MH2 domain, consisting of residues 331–361, 379–387, and the L3 loop. The other is through a basic groove in the MH2 domain (Mochizuki, T., Miyazaki, H., Hara, T., Furuya, T., Imamura, T., Watabe, T., and Miyazono, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 31568–31574). We also found that Smad6 principally utilizes a basic groove in the MH2 domain for interaction with type I receptors.

Cytokines of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, including TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinALKactivin receptor-like kinaseI-Smadinhibitory SmadR-Smadreceptor-regulated Smad. are multifunctional proteins that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, adhesion, and the production of extracellular matrix, from embryogenesis to adult tissue homeostasis. Misregulation of TGF-β family signaling leads to various developmental disorders and diseases, including fibrosis, autoimmune diseases, and multiple types of cancer. TGF-β family signaling is transduced through type I and type II receptors, both of which have serine/threonine kinase domains in their intracellular regions. Upon binding of ligands, two type II receptors and two type I receptors form heterotetrameric receptor complexes, in which constitutively active type II receptor kinases activate type I receptor kinases. The activated type I receptors then phosphorylate a subset of Smad proteins termed receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) at the C-terminal serine residues. Phosphorylated R-Smads then associate with Co-Smad (Smad4) to form activated Smad complexes, translocate into the nucleus, and regulate the transcription of various target genes in cooperation with transcription factors as well as co-activators/co-repressors (1Derynck R.

In mammals, seven type I receptors (termed activin receptor-like kinases 1 through 7; ALK-1–7) have been identified. They can be further divided structurally into three subfamilies: the ALK-3/6 subfamily, ALK-1/2 subfamily, and ALK4/5/7 subfamily (3Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). The ALK-3/6 subfamily and ALK-1/2 subfamily of type I receptors transmit BMP-type signaling through phosphorylation of Smad1, 5, and 8 (6Miyazono K. Kamiya Y. Morikawa M. J. Biochem. 2010; 147: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ALK-4/5/7 subfamily transmits TGF-β/activin-type signaling through phosphorylation of Smad2 and 3.

The L45 loop of type I receptors and the L3 loop of R-Smads are determinants of the specificity of interaction between type I receptors and R-Smads.

Heldin C.-H. Smad Signal Transduction. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006: 379-395Google Scholar). We recently examined the specificity of I-Smads for each type I receptor (23Hanyu A.

Smad6 efficiently inhibits signaling from the ALK-3/6 subgroup but only minimally inhibits that from the other subgroups of type I receptors, a finding attributed to the differential affinity of Smad6 for each type of type I receptor (24Goto K. Kamiya Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smad7 stably interacts with all subfamilies of activated type I receptors and ubiquitously inhibits TGF-β family signaling (23Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Smad7 interacts with type I receptors of TGF-β and BMP in different fashions (23Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Mochizuki T. Miyazaki H. Hara T. Furuya T. Imamura T. Watabe T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31568-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The MH2 domains of I-Smads are responsible for inhibition of type I receptors. The N domain of Smad7 physically interacts with the Smad7 MH2 domain and enhances its inhibition of ALK-5, but not inhibition of ALK-6 (23Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that mutations of basic residues in the L3 loop (Lys-401 and Arg-409) of the Smad7 MH2 domain attenuate its association with both ALK-5 and ALK-6, whereas mutations in the α-helix1 (Lys-312 and Lys316) attenuate its association with ALK-5, but not with ALK-6 (26Mochizuki T.

These findings indicate that the mode of interaction with I-Smads and sensitivity to I-Smads vary among the subgroups of type I receptors. However, the molecular basis of the interaction between I-Smads and ALKs has not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, utilizing the differential effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on ALK-2, we identified the important regions of Smad7 for interaction with type I receptors. The mode of interaction between type I receptors and I-Smads differed from that between R-Smads and type I receptors. We also found that Smad7 has two surfaces for interaction with type I receptors, whereas Smad6 has one. Usage of these two surfaces of Smad7 may affect its function as a negative regulator. C2C12, COS7, 293T, and HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cell Culture Technologies) and antibiotics (50 units/ml streptomycin and 50 units/ml penicillin G; Invitrogen). COS7, 293T, and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. For HepG2 cells, nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) were also supplemented.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Equal expression of each mutant was confirmed by immunoblotting. A structural model of Smad7 was constructed based on the three-dimensional structure of Smad2 (Protein Data Bank code 1DEV) using Biopackage (Molsoft). Smad7 efficiently inhibits BMP signaling from both ALK-2 and ALK-3. In contrast, Smad6 efficiently inhibits BMP signaling from ALK-3 but only weakly inhibits that from ALK-2 (24Goto K. Kamiya Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). By utilizing these differential effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on ALK-2 signaling, we investigated the molecular basis of the Smad7-ALK-2 interaction. We first examined which parts of I-Smads are responsible for the differential inhibition of signaling from ALK-2, with the use of truncated mutants of Smad6 and Smad7. Smad6 and Smad7 were divided into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (1–330 and 315–496 for Smad6, 1–259 and 247–427 for Smad7, denoted Smad6N, Smad6C, Smad7N, and Smad7C), and their inhibitory effects on signaling from ALK-2 and ALK-3 were determined using luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1). The isolated N domains of I-Smads (Smad6N and Smad7N) failed to repress signaling from both ALK-2 and ALK-3. Smad7C inhibited ALK-2 signaling as effectively as wild-type Smad7, whereas Smad6C had less inhibitory effect on ALK-2 signaling, similar to the full-length Smad6. Consistent with these results, Smad7C interacted with ALK-2 more stably than Smad6C, whereas the N domains of both I-Smads failed to interact with ALK-2 and ALK-3 (supplemental Fig. S1A). The MH2 domains of I-Smads were thus found to be responsible for the differential inhibitory effects on signaling from ALK-2. In contrast, it is known that the N domain of Smad7 is required for inhibition by Smad7 of signaling from ALK-5 (23Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The L3 loops in the vicinity of the C terminus of R-Smads are crucial for the specific interaction of R-Smads with type I receptors (9Lo S.R. Chen Y.-G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the L3 loop are invariant among TGF-β/activin-specific R-Smads (Smad2 and 3) and among BMP-specific R-Smads (Smad1, 5, and 8), respectively (Fig. 2A). Swapping of the L3 loops of Smad1 and 2 results in switching of specificity of their C-terminal phosphorylation by type I receptors (9Lo S.R. Chen Y.-G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the L3 loops of I-Smads are responsible for the specificity of interaction with type I receptors. We constructed mutants of Smad6 and 7 in which the regions spanning the L3 loop to the C terminus had been swapped (Fig. 2, A and B, left) and determined their inhibitory effects on ALK-2 and -3 signaling. We found that swapping of the region did not affect inhibition of ALK-2 and ALK-3 signaling (Fig. 2B, right). Binding experiments between I-Smad mutants with ALK-2 and ALK-3 also gave consistent results (supplemental Fig. S1B). We therefore concluded that the L3 loops of I-Smads do not determine the specificity of interaction with type I receptors. Next, to investigate whether the L3 loops of I-Smads are required for their inhibition of BMP signaling, we constructed chimeras of Smad6 or Smad7 with Smad4 because Smad4 is unable to interact with type I receptors. S6-S4L3 and S7-S4L3 are mutants based on Smad6 and 7, respectively, in which the regions spanning the L3 loop to the C terminus are replaced by the corresponding region of Smad4 (residues 505–552 for Smad4). S6-S4L3s and S7-S4L3s are short versions of S6-S4L3 and S7-S4L3, in which helix-5 (H5) and the C terminus of Smad4 (residues 505–531) are truncated (Fig. 2C, left). S6-S4L3, S7-S4L3, S6-S4L3s, and S7-S4L3s all lacked interaction with ALK-2/3 (supplemental Fig. S1B) and failed to suppress signaling from these type I receptors (Fig. 2C, right). Replacement of the L3 loop of S7-S4L3s by that of Smad7 resulted in recovery of inhibition (Fig. 2D) as well as interaction with ALK-2 and ALK-3 (supplemental Fig. S1B). These findings indicate that the L3 loops of I-Smads are required for their inhibitory effects on ALK-2 and ALK-3 through physical interaction. The L3 loops of I-Smads are thus required for but not determinative of the differential effects of Smad6 and Smad7 on ALK-2 signaling, suggesting that other region(s) in I-Smads play crucial roles in determining the specificity of interaction with BMP type I receptors. To identify which region(s) of Smad7 are determinants of the inhibitory effect on ALK-2 signaling, we constructed several Smad6/Smad7 chimeras and examined their inhibitory effects on BMP signaling from ALK-2 and -3 (Fig. 3). The chimeric protein Smad6/7 has the N domain from Smad6 (1–330) and the MH2 domain from Smad7 (260–427). The regions in the MH2 domain derived from Smad7 were then gradually replaced by the corresponding regions of Smad6 (Fig. 3A, left). Smad6/7, S6(356/289)S7, and S6(384/314)S7 strongly inhibited signaling from both ALK-2 and ALK-3. On the other hand, S6(441/371)S7 and S6(466/399)S7 efficiently inhibited signaling from ALK-3 but only weakly inhibited that from ALK-2 (Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that residues 314–370 of Smad7 play an important role in efficient inhibition of ALK-2 signaling. We next constructed a Smad6 mutant that contained residues 314–370 of Smad7 in place of the corresponding region of Smad6 (denoted S6-S7(314–370), Fig. 3B, left). S6-S7(314–370), however, failed to inhibit ALK-2 signaling (Fig. 3B, right). The inhibitory effects on ALK-2 thus also require region(s) downstream of residue 371 of Smad7. We next attempted to specify the regions crucial for inhibition of ALK-2 signaling. First, we constructed four more Smad6/Smad7 chimeras that were intermediates between S6(384/314)S7 and S6(441/371)S7 (supplemental Fig. S2, left). The inhibitory effects on ALK-2 signaling became less potent with gradual substitution of residues 331–361 of Smad7 with corresponding residues of Smad6 (supplemental Fig. S2, right). Thus, the structure of the entire region comprising residues 331–361 of Smad7 appears to be important for the inhibition of ALK-2. We also gradually replaced Smad7 sequences of S6(384/314)S7 with corresponding regions of Smad6 from the C terminus (Fig. 3C, left). Replacement of residues 379–387 of Smad7 with the corresponding region of Smad6 altered the inhibitory effect on BMP signaling from Smad7-type to Smad6-type (Fig. 3C, right). These findings indicate that residues 379–387 of Smad7 are involved in the inhibition of ALK-2. We further examined physical interaction of all of the chimeric mutants used in Fig. 3, A–C, with ALK-2 and ALK-3, which was well consistent with their inhibitory effects (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Finally, we constructed a Smad6 mutant that contained residues 331–361 and 379–387 of Smad7 (denoted S6-mt) and confirmed that these regions were sufficient for inhibition of signaling from ALK-2, as determined by luciferase reporter assay, physical interaction with ALK-2, and R-Smad phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A–C). We next constructed a Smad7 mutant, in which residues involved in the interaction with ALK-2 were replaced by corresponding Smad6 residues (denoted S7-mt) (Fig. 5A, left). Contrary to our expectation, S7-mt inhibited ALK-2 signaling as well as wild-type Smad7 and interacted with ALK-2 (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that there are other site(s) involved in recognition of BMP type I receptors by Smad7. It has been reported that a basic groove composed of four basic residues (Lys-312, Lys-316, Lys-401, and Arg-409) in the MH2 domain of Smad7 plays critical roles in the interaction of Smad7 with ALK-5 (26Mochizuki T. Miyazaki H. Hara T. Furuya T. Imamura T. Watabe T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31568-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the basic groove is also involved in the interaction with ALK-2 and ALK-3. Although mutating one of the four basic residues, Lys-316, of wild-type Smad7 to a glutamic acid did not affect its inhibitory activity, the same mutation in S7-mt (denoted S7-K316E/mt) resulted in attenuation of the inhibitory activity and the interaction with ALK-2/3 (Fig. 5, A and B). These findings indicate that Smad7 interacts with BMP type I receptors through the basic groove, independent of the region identified above. In contrast, introduction of the corresponding mutation into Smad6 (K387E) resulted in loss of inhibition by Smad6 of signaling by ALK-3 (Fig. 5A) and interaction with ALK-3 (Fig. 5B). We next examined inhibitory effects of the same set of Smad7 mutants on signaling from ALK-4 and ALK-5 (Fig. 5C) and their interaction with these receptors (Fig. 5D). We obtained essentially the same results for ALK-4. However, we obtained inconsistent results for ALK-5. S7-K316E failed to interact with ALK-5, indicating that Smad7 interacts with ALK-5 principally thorough the basic groove as previously reported (26Mochizuki T. Miyazaki H. Hara T. Furuya T. Imamura T. Watabe T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31568-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, S7-K316E still retained an inhibitory effect on signaling from ALK-5, which may be due to regulation of ALK-5 signaling by Smad7 at other levels (30Zhang S. Fei T. Zhang L. Zhang R. Chen F. Ning Y. Han Y. Feng X.-H. Meng A. Chen Y.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4488-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We also examined effects of Smad6 and its mutant Smad6-K387E on signaling from ALK-4 and ALK-5 and their interaction with these receptors. Smad6 interacted with ALK-4 and ALK-5 through the basic groove (Fig. 5D) but inhibited signaling only marginally (ALK-4) or moderately (ALK-5) (Fig. 5C). The underlying mechanism for these inert interactions remains to be elucidated. As described above, we have shown that multiple regions including the L3 loop and residues 331–361 and 379–387 of Smad7 are responsible for interaction with ALKs. We aligned the amino acid sequences of Smad6 and Smad7 containing these regions (Fig. 6A). The amino acid sequences in residues 331–361 of Smad7 are conserved in Smad6 to the same extent as in other regions (53.3%). Residues 379–387 of Smad7 are not conserved in Smad6. We next mapped the regions required for efficient interaction with ALKs on a structural model of the Smad7 MH2 domain, which was constructed by homology modeling based on the MH2 domain of Smad2 (Protein Data Bank Code 1DEV) (Fig. 6B). The L3 loop, residues 379–387, and certain amino acids among residues 331–361 are present on a common surface of the three-dimensional structure of Smad7, comprising a three-finger-like structure, whereas the basic groove is located on a different side of the molecule. These findings suggest that, when Smad7 interacts with BMP type I receptors, two distinct modes of interaction exist, one through the three-finger-like structure and the other through the basic groove. We next compared the relative affinity of the two binding surfaces on Smad7 for ALK-2. As shown in Fig. 6C, increasing amount of S7-K316E and S7-mt competed with each other in binding to ALK-2, indicating that the two molecular surfaces have similar binding affinities for ALK-2. Smurf1 ubiquitin ligase induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TGF-β family type I receptors in cooperation with I-Smads (18Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T.

Cell. 2003; 14: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the cooperativity of Smad7 and its mutants (S7-K316E and S7-mt) with Smurf1. However, we found that S7-K316E and S7-mt equally enhanced Smurf1-dependent ALK-2 ubiquitylation (data not shown). Ligands of the TGF-β family signal through type I receptor-mediated activation of R-Smads. Interaction between type I receptors and R-Smads is coordinated by robust molecular recognition. I-Smads are members of the Smad protein family which act as antagonists of Smad signaling principally through physical interaction with type I receptors to interrupt activation of R-Smads (13Imamura T.

However, the mode of interaction between I-Smads and type I receptors has remained unclear. In the present study, we found that Smad7 inhibits TGF-β family type I receptors through two distinct modes of interaction. Recognition of R-Smads by activated type I receptors appears to involve two matching components (Fig. 7A) (11Wu G. Chen Y.-G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The interaction between the L3 loop of R-Smads and the L45 loop of the type I receptor determines substrate specificity (7Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y.-G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The interaction between the basic groove and the phosphorylated GS loop appears to ensure recognition of R-Smads by activated receptors (11Wu G. Chen Y.-G. Ozdamar B. Gyuricza C.A. Chong P.A. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Shi Y. Science. 2000; 287: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The basic groove comprises two residues in the L3 loop and two residues in α-helix1 (26Mochizuki T. Miyazaki H. Hara T. Furuya T. Imamura T. Watabe T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31568-31574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the interaction of I-Smads with type I receptors, the L3 loops were found to be required for but not determinative of the specificity of interaction with these receptors. Smad6 and Smad7 also have a basic groove consisting of the L3 loop and the α-helix1. Mutation of a basic residue within the α-helix1 of Smad6, but not Smad7, decreased the magnitude of inhibition of ALK-3 signaling and association with ALK-3. These findings indicate that Smad6 principally utilizes the basic groove in its functional interaction with ALK-3. In ALK-3, the region along the nucleotide-binding loop and the αC helix, which is located near the L45 loop but apart from the GS loop, is a determinant of interaction with Smad6 (24Goto K. Kamiya Y. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20603-20611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B). The mode of interaction of Smad6 with ALK-3 thus differs from that of R-Smads with type I receptors. Smad7 utilizes two alternative surfaces for interaction with type I receptors (Fig. 7, C and D). One is the basic groove (Fig. 7C) and the other the three-finger-like structure (Fig. 7D), both of which include the L3 loop as an essential constituent. The three-finger-like structure includes residues 331–361 and 379–387 in addition to the L3 loop. Residues 379–387 of Smad7 form a loop-like structure on the side opposite the L3 loop on an identical surface (Fig. 6B). On sequence alignment of Smad6 and Smad7, no amino acid residue in the 379–387 region of Smad7 coincided with that of Smad6. Moreover, the amino acid sequences of this region of Smad6 are divergent, and only 38% amino acids are conserved even between human and mouse (supplemental Fig. S3); this explains why this region is not utilized in Smad6 for interaction with type I receptors. In the case of residues 331–361, inhibition of ALK-2 signaling became less potent as the length of the amino acid sequence of Smad7 substituted with that of Smad6 increased. Within residues 331–361, there is a protruding loop-like structure on the same surface as residues 379–387 and the L3 loop. Smad7 thus possibly grabs type I receptors via this three finger-like loop structure. For inhibition of ALK-5 signaling, Smad7 may have an alternative mode of regulation of ALK-5 signaling, which does not require its interaction with ALK-5 (12Nakao A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Smad Signal Transduction. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006: 379-395Google Scholar, 30Zhang S. Fei T. Zhang L. Zhang R. Chen F. Ning Y. Han Y. Feng X.-H. Meng A. Chen Y.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4488-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). S7-K316E failed to interact with ALK-5, but still inhibited signaling from ALK-5. Remarkably, the three-finger-like structure of Smad7 is also indispensable for this mode of ALK-5 inhibition because S7-K316E/mt lost its inhibitory effect on ALK-5. At present, it is unclear why Smad7 utilizes two alternative surfaces in its interaction with type I receptors. The interaction of Smad7 with type I receptors through the three-finger-like structure appears to be involved in Smad7-specific modulation of type I receptor function, which remains to be elucidated. It is also unclear how utilization of two surfaces of Smad7 in interaction with type I receptors is controlled. One possibility is that some posttranslational modifications of Smad7 or type I receptors affect the mode of interaction between them. In Drosophila, one I-Smad (Daughters against Decapentaplegic, Dad) and three type I receptors (Thickveins, Tkv; Saxophone, Sax; and Baboon, Babo) have been identified. Tkv and Sax are orthologues of ALK-3/6 and ALK-1/2, respectively, and transduce BMP-type signaling, whereas Babo is an orthologue of ALK-4/5/7 and transduces activin-type signaling (31Raftery L.A. Korochkina S. Cao J. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Smad Signal Transduction. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006: 55-73Google Scholar). Dad strongly interacts with Tkv and Sax but not with Babo (25Kamiya Y. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The prototypic function of I-Smads thus appears to inhibit BMP type I receptors. In mammals, novel types of I-Smads, i.e. Smad6 and Smad7, have emerged via gene duplication events. Although Dad does not recruit dSmurf to type I receptors (32Liang Y.-Y. Lin X. Liang M. Brunicardi F.C. ten Dijke P. Chen Z. Choi K.-W. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26307-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), mammalian I-Smads have acquired the ability to cooperate with Smurf family ubiquitin ligases (20Komuro A.

Smad6 exhibits differential inhibitory effects on two subfamilies of BMP type I receptors. On the other hand, Smad7 has acquired the ability to inhibit ALK-4/5/7 in addition to ALK1/2 and ALK3/6, together with utilization of a distinct binding surface in its interaction with type I receptors. Control of TGF-β family type I receptor function by I-Smads via various mechanisms through multiple surfaces results in the generation of spatiotemporally fine tuned signaling activity.

Furthermore, blocking p72 acetylation caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, revealing an essential role for p72 acetylation.

IntroductionOne prominent post-translational modification is the acetylation of lysine residues. In particular, histones are reversibly modified by acetylation, and this normally stimulates gene transcription. However, acetylation also occurs on a plethora of non-histone proteins and modulates their activity in various ways, for instance by affecting DNA binding, transactivation, protein stability, or intracellular localization (1Lee K.K.

Moreover, chromosomal translocations involving the p300 gene have been observed in hematologic malignancies and mutations in several solid tumors, suggesting an important role for p300 in human carcinogenesis (5Janknecht R.

Among the known interactants of p300 are the homologous RNA helicases p68 (also called DEAD-box protein 5, DDX5) 2The abbreviations used are: DDXDEAD-box proteinERαestrogen receptor αHDAChistone deacetylasePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseTORUTPA oncogene responsive unit. and p72 (DDX17) that synergize with p300 to activate gene transcription (7Rossow K.L.

Several transcription factors, including estrogen receptor α (ERα), androgen receptor, Smad3, MyoD, and the tumor suppressor p53, not only bind to p300 but also to p68/p72 (9Endoh H. Maruyama K.

Accordingly, p68/p72 and p300 are co-recruited into and jointly modulate the activity of various multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional control (15Janknecht R. Am. J. Transl. Res. 2010; 2: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar).Knocking out p68 or p72 causes embryonic or neonatal lethality, indicating that p68 as well as p72 are crucial during development (16Fukuda T. Yamagata K.

Additionally, these two RNA helicases are overexpressed in colorectal tumors and thought to promote tumorigenesis by stimulating β-catenin, whose aberrant activation is responsible for neoplastic transformation in the vast majority of colon tumors (17Causevic M.

In addition, both p68 and p72 are overexpressed in breast tumors (20Wortham N.C. Ahamed E. Nicol S.M. Thomas R.S. Periyasamy M. Jiang J. Ochocka A.M. Shousha S. Huson L. Bray S.E. Coombes R.C. Ali S.

Thus, p68 and p72 play important roles in the physiology of normal and diseased cells, warranting investigation into how these two homologous RNA helicases are regulated. Here, we examined whether p68 and p72 are acetylated by p300 and whether this is a means to modulate their function.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have identified multiple lysine residues in the N termini of p68 and p72 RNA helicase that are acetylated by p300 in vitro and in vivo. This post-translational modification of p68/p72 has profound effects on their function and is the first demonstration that RNA helicases can be regulated by acetylation.Post-translational Modifications in p68/p72The helicase domain residing in the center of p68 and p72 is highly conserved between these two proteins and also among the greater family of RNA helicases (55Lamm G.M. Nicol S.M. Fuller-Pace F.V. Lamond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Amino acids flanking the helicase domain are much less conserved evolutionary and thought to selectively modulate the activity of RNA helicases (56Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 57Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One way of functionally regulating a protein is through post-translational modifications. Indeed, we mapped six and three acetylation sites in p68 and p72, respectively, that are all located N-terminal of the helicase domain. Similarly, attachment of SUMO, a small molecule sharing high structural homology with ubiquitin, has been reported to occur on Lys-53 in p68 and on Lys-50 in p72 (21Mooney S.M. Grande J.P. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 52Jacobs A.M. Nicol S.M. Hislop R.G. Jaffray E.G. Hay R.T. Fuller-Pace F.V. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5866-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), further suggesting that the N terminus of p68 and p72 is critical for the modulation of their activity.Blocking acetylation in p68 led to the suppression of its interaction with HDAC1 and HDAC2, but had no effect on the binding to HDAC3, p300 or ERα, whereas acetylation of p72 enhanced its interaction with HDAC1 and HDAC3. This reveals one mechanism of how acetylation may regulate the activity of p68/p72 by selectively modulating the binding to partner proteins. Because two out of five interactions tested in this report were influenced by acetylation of p68 or p72, it is highly likely that acetylation will affect the ability of p68 and p72 to form complexes with many more of the known and to-be-discovered interaction partners and thus constitutes a seminal post-translational modification of p68/p72. Like acetylation, sumoylation promoted the interaction of p68 and p72 with HDAC1, but not with HDAC2 or HDAC3 (21Mooney S.M. Grande J.P. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 52Jacobs A.M. Nicol S.M. Hislop R.G. Jaffray E.G. Hay R.T. Fuller-Pace F.V. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5866-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), indicating that acetylation and sumoylation differentially affect p68/p72 function. Indeed, in contrast to acetylation (see Fig. 6B), sumoylation represses the ability of p72 to coactivate ERα (21Mooney S.M. Grande J.P. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Histone acetylation is generally associated with transcribed regions of the chromatin, suggesting that recruitment of HDACs leads to the repression of gene transcription. Following this argument, the enhanced recruitment of HDAC1 and HDAC2 upon acetylation of p68 and of HDAC1 and HDAC3 upon acetylation of p72 should lead to repression of transcription, but our data indicate that acetylation of p68 and p72 stimulates ERα-dependent transcription. This may argue that enhanced HDAC recruitment is not the prevailing acetylation-induced incident with regard to the coactivation potential of p68/p72. For instance, enhanced HDAC recruitment could be more than counterbalanced by increased coactivator binding upon acetylation of p68/p72. However, recent studies indicated that HDACs may actually activate selected transcriptional complexes (58Nusinzon I. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 59Zupkovitz G. Tischler J. Posch M. Sadzak I. Ramsauer K. Egger G. Grausenburger R. Schweifer N. Chiocca S. Decker T. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7913-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). If so in case of the ERα/p68/p72 complexes, this would provide a mechanism of how acetylation stimulates the coactivation potential of p68 and p72 through enhanced HDAC recruitment.Tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 has been reported to be elevated in cancer cells (60Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of Tyr-593 on p68 is induced by platelet-derived growth factor in colon cancer cells and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (19Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Cell. 2006; 127: 139-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Additionally, p68 that is phosphorylated on Tyr-593 and Tyr-595 protects glioblastoma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis (61Yang L. Lin C. Sun S.Y. Zhao S. Liu Z.R. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6082-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation C-terminal of the p68 helicase domain as well as N-terminal acetylation and sumoylation may jointly govern the activity of p68, and it remains to be determined whether these different post-translational modifications are interdependent.Enhanced Coactivation Potential and Cell Survival Mediated by p68/p72 AcetylationBoth p68 and p72 physically interact with ERα and thereby stimulate estrogen-dependent transcription (9Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unknown how the interaction between p68/p72 and ERα is regulated. Our data indicate that acetylation of p68/p72 does not lead to obvious changes in association with ERα, but enhances their ability to coactivate ERα-mediated transcription. Thus, acetylation of p68/p72 may impact on the pleiotropic effects of estrogen during embryonal development and in adult tissues.In addition, acetylation of p72 raised its ability to stimulate p53-dependent MDM2 transcription, but p68 acetylation had no significant impact in this regard, marking a clear difference between these two homologous proteins. The tumor suppressor p53 activates the MDM2 promoter, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop, because MDM2 is a ubiquitin ligase causing the destruction of p53 (62Bond G.L. Hu W. Levine A.J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2005; 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 63Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 64Vazquez A. Bond E.E. Levine A.J. Bond G.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Accordingly, p72 acetylation is predicted to strengthen this negative feedback loop leading to less intracellular p53. Therefore, one mechanism of how acetylation of p72 contributes to tumorigenesis may be by reducing levels of the p53 tumor suppressor.Mutation of Lys-42 alone or more pronouncedly of all three acetylation sites in p72 resulted in cell death and cell cycle blockage in 293T cells, whereas acetylation of p68 had no significant effect. Thus, p72 acetylation is seminal for cell survival and proliferation, an unsuspected result showing, to our knowledge for the first time, an essential function for post-translational modification of an RNA helicase. At present, we do not know why p72 acetylation is required for cell survival, but this is independent of p53, because apoptosis was observed with the K29/30/42R mutant in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are p53-negative, as well as in 293T cells, in which endogenous p53 is incapacitated by the presence of the adenoviral E1A and E1B proteins and SV40 large T antigen. Interestingly, p300-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys-373 was reported to promote cell death, whereas acetylation of the androgen receptor led to less apoptosis (65Fu M. Rao M. Wang C. Sakamaki T. Wang J. Di Vizio D. Zhang X. Albanese C. Balk S. Chang C. Fan S. Rosen E. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. Muratoglu S. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8563-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 66Knights C.D. Catania J. Di Giovanni S. Muratoglu S. Perez R. Swartzbeck A. Quong A.A. Zhang X. Beerman T. Pestell R.G. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This indicates that p300-mediated acetylation of transcription factors has opposite effects on cell survival depending on which protein becomes acetylated.Whereas mutation of Lys-42 in p72 was sufficient to induce massive apoptosis and stop cell proliferation in 293T cells, it did not do so in MDA-MB-231 cells. However, blocking acetylation of Lys-29, Lys-30, and Lys-42 together resulted also in cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells, and even in 293T cells it was slightly more detrimental than mutating Lys-42 alone. Thus, there are cell type-specific differences in which sites have to be acetylated to prevent p72 from inducing apoptosis. In the same vein, we did not observe increased apoptosis with any of the p72 acetylation site mutants in HeLa cells (this being the reason why we chose this cell line to determine half-lives of p68 and p72 by pulse-chase experiments), implicating that acetylation of the ubiquitously expressed p72 RNA helicase is not always essential for cell survival.At present, it remains unknown why acetylation of p68 compared with p72 has different consequences with regard to MDM2 transcription and cell survival. Although p68 and p72 share 92% similarity within their helicase domains, their N- and C-terminal domains are much less conserved (15Janknecht R. Am. J. Transl. Res. 2010; 2: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that p68 and p72 are recruited into different protein complexes by virtue of these divergent domains, and therefore acetylation of these paralogous RNA helicases may be futile in one case (e.g. p68), but crucial in the other case (e.g. p72) to affect biological consequences. Future studies should comprehensively explore the different spectrum of interactants for p68/p72 and determine how their acetylation modulates the activity of p68/p72-containing protein complexes.Role of p68/p72 Acetylation in TumorsRaf, Ras, and HER2/Neu stimulate the enzymatic activity of p300, most likely by inducing its MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation (33Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed that p68 acetylation was enhanced upon overexpression of these oncoproteins, mutations of which are found in the majority of all human tumors. Thus, p68/p72 acetylation levels are predicted to be enhanced in and therefore potentially contribute to the genesis of many different tumors.Estrogen plays a causal role in the development of ∼70% of all breast tumors and drugs targeting estrogen metabolism or ERα are a mainstay in breast cancer therapy (67Yager J.D. Davidson N.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 68Normanno N. Di Maio M. De Maio E. De Luca A. de Matteis A. Giordano A. Perrone F. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 721-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). ERα-positive breast tumors often display hyperactivation of MAP kinases, in part due to the non-genomic actions of estrogen (69Santen R.J. Song R.X. McPherson R. Kumar R. Adam L. Jeng M.H. Yue W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 80: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 70Castoria G. Migliaccio A. D'Amato L. Di Stasio R. Ciociola A. Lombardi M. Bilancio A. Di Domenico M. de Falco A. Auricchio F. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, MAP kinase-mediated stimulation of p300 enzymatic activity is expected to enhance p68/p72 acetylation in ERα-positive breast tumors, which will lead to increased activation of ERα, providing one mechanism how post-translational modification of p68/p72 fosters breast carcinogenesis. In addition, enhanced acetylation of p68 and p72, which significantly increases their stability, may (partially) account for the fact that p68 and p72 are overexpressed in human breast tumors (20Wortham N.C. Ahamed E. Nicol S.M. Thomas R.S. Periyasamy M. Jiang J. Ochocka A.M. Shousha S. Huson L. Bray S.E. Coombes R.C. Ali S. Fuller-Pace F.V. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Mooney S.M. Grande J.P. Salisbury J.L. Janknecht R. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed that overexpression of Raf1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells up-regulated both p68 and p72 at the protein level (see supplemental Fig. S1).Approximately 30% of all breast tumors display HER2/Neu overexpression, and targeting this receptor with monoclonal antibodies is now an established practice in the treatment of breast tumors (71Hynes N.E. Lane H.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar, 72Hall P.S. Cameron D.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2009; 45: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because HER2/Neu stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of p300 (33Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), acetylation of p68/p72 should also be enhanced in HER2/Neu-positive breast tumors. However, these breast tumors are normally ERα-negative, precluding that acetylation of p68/p72 affects HER2/Neu-positive breast tumors by stimulating ERα. But enhanced acetylation of p72 could still increase MDM2 transcription, thereby leading to MDM2-mediated destruction of the tumor suppressor p53 and thus promoting tumorigenesis. And indeed, reduced p53 levels are observed in many of the most malignant, HER2/Neu-positive breast tumors (73Lacroix M. Toillon R.A. Leclercq G. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 293-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).Recently, it was shown that p68 is a cofactor of androgen receptor and overexpressed in prostate tumors (12Clark E.L. Coulson A. Dalgliesh C. Rajan P. Nicol S.M. Fleming S. Heer R. Gaughan L. Leung H.Y. Elliott D.J. Fuller-Pace F.V. Robson C.N. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7938-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, HER2/Neu overexpression is also common in prostate cancer and increases with the progression of the disease (74Signoretti S. Montironi R. Manola J. Altimari A. Tam C. Bubley G. Balk S.

Hara K. Urology. 2006; 68: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Again, HER2/Neu-stimulated p300 acetyltransferase activity may raise the coactivation potential of p68 and thereby its tumor promoting activity by stimulating the androgen receptor, the key villain in prostate cancer.Both p68 and p72 are overexpressed in colorectal tumors and their expression levels correlate with the progression of the disease (17Causevic M.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7572-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Knocking down p68 and p72 together in colon cancer cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation and tumor formation, indicating that they are causally involved in colon carcinogenesis. Moreover, p68 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in colon cancer cells, which is particularly important during metastasis. All of these processes are most likely related to the p68/p72-mediated activation of β-catenin, the linchpin of colon carcinogenesis (18Shin S. Rossow K.L. Grande J.P. Janknecht R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7572-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R.

Our data suggest that one mechanism of how K-Ras, B-Raf, and HER2/Neu drive colon carcinogenesis is through stimulating p300 enzymatic activity and the resultant acetylation of p68/p72. This is predicted to increase p68 and p72 protein stability and thus account, at least in part, for the observed overexpression of p68 and p72 in colorectal tumors. And overexpression of p68 or p72 alone is sufficient to aberrantly activate β-catenin (18Shin S. Rossow K.L. Grande J.P. Janknecht R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7572-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to colon cancer formation.CONCLUSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated for the first time that two members of the RNA helicase superfamily are regulated by acetylation of lysine residues. Acetylation stimulates the coactivation potential of p68 and p72, modulates their interaction with partner proteins, enhances their protein stability and prevents p72-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, all of which potentially promotes tumorigenesis. Because oncogenic HER2/Neu, Ras, or Raf as well as estrogen can enhance p300-mediated acetylation of p68 and p72, this provides a novel pathway of how these oncoproteins and estrogen may exert their deleterious effects in tumor cells. IntroductionOne prominent post-translational modification is the acetylation of lysine residues. In particular, histones are reversibly modified by acetylation, and this normally stimulates gene transcription. However, acetylation also occurs on a plethora of non-histone proteins and modulates their activity in various ways, for instance by affecting DNA binding, transactivation, protein stability, or intracellular localization (1Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 2Yang X.J. Seto E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar).The acetyltransferase p300 is capable of modifying all four core histones and is essential for development (3Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, chromosomal translocations involving the p300 gene have been observed in hematologic malignancies and mutations in several solid tumors, suggesting an important role for p300 in human carcinogenesis (5Janknecht R. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar, 6Iyer N.G. Ozdag H. Caldas C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Among the known interactants of p300 are the homologous RNA helicases p68 (also called DEAD-box protein 5, DDX5) 2The abbreviations used are: DDXDEAD-box proteinERαestrogen receptor αHDAChistone deacetylasePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymeraseTORUTPA oncogene responsive unit. and p72 (DDX17) that synergize with p300 to activate gene transcription (7Rossow K.L.

Several transcription factors, including estrogen receptor α (ERα), androgen receptor, Smad3, MyoD, and the tumor suppressor p53, not only bind to p300 but also to p68/p72 (9Endoh H. Maruyama K.

Accordingly, p68/p72 and p300 are co-recruited into and jointly modulate the activity of various multiprotein complexes involved in transcriptional control (15Janknecht R. Am. J. Transl. Res. 2010; 2: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar).Knocking out p68 or p72 causes embryonic or neonatal lethality, indicating that p68 as well as p72 are crucial during development (16Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K. Mihara M. Naitou M. Endoh H. Nakamura T. Akimoto C. Yamamoto Y. Katagiri T. Foulds C. Takezawa S. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. O'Malley B.W. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Additionally, these two RNA helicases are overexpressed in colorectal tumors and thought to promote tumorigenesis by stimulating β-catenin, whose aberrant activation is responsible for neoplastic transformation in the vast majority of colon tumors (17Causevic M.

Similarly, p68 is overexpressed in and may contribute to the formation of prostate tumors by coactivating the androgen receptor (12Clark E.L. Coulson A. Dalgliesh C. Rajan P. Nicol S.M. Fleming S.

Thus, p68 and p72 play important roles in the physiology of normal and diseased cells, warranting investigation into how these two homologous RNA helicases are regulated.

This cellular process involves loss of regulation by adipogenic transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). Necdin, a melanoma antigen family protein, promotes neuronal and myogenic differentiation while inhibiting adipogenesis. The present study demonstrates that necdin is selectively expressed in HSCs among different liver cell types and induced during their activation in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of necdin with adenovirally expressed shRNA, reverses activated HSCs to quiescent cells in a manner dependent on PPARγ and suppressed canonical Wnt signaling. Promoter analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate that Wnt10b, a canonical Wnt induced in activated HSCs, is a direct target of necdin. Necdin silencing abrogates three epigenetic signatures implicated in repression of PPARγ: increased MeCP2 (methyl CpG binding protein 2) and HP-1α co-repressor recruitments to Pparγ promoter and enhanced H3K27 dimethylation at the exon 5 locus, again in a manner dependent on suppressed canonical Wnt. These epigenetic effects are reproduced by antagonism of canonical Wnt signaling with Dikkopf-1. Our results demonstrate a novel necdin-Wnt pathway, which serves to mediate antiadipogenic HSC trans-differentiation via epigenetic repression of PPARγ.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSChepatic stellate cellPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γMOImultiplicity of infectionBDLbile duct ligationCOUP-TFIIchicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II. are desmin-positive mesenchymal cells located in the subendothelial (perisinusoidal) space of hepatic sinusoids. They store vitamin A, function as hepatic pericytes, communicate with hepatocytes via a gap junction and the release of soluble factors, and produce the components of the normal matrix milieu of the perisinusoidal space. HSCs also actively participate in matrix remodeling and wound healing through their production of matrix metalloproteinases and extracellular matrix proteins and are considered as one of the principal cell types responsible for the genesis of liver fibrosis (1Friedman S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). The most unique feature of the manner in which HSCs participate in liver fibrogenesis is their myofibroblastic trans-differentiation (activation) characterized by depletion of vitamin A storage, cell proliferation, induction of matrix genes, and acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype via induction of α-smooth muscle actin. Although major classes of mediators are identified for HSC trans-differentiation, including soluble factors (cytokines, hormones, and lipid mediators), reactive oxygen species, and altered extracellular matrix milieu (1Friedman S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), the fundamental understanding of cell lineage and cell fate regulation of HSCs is elusive. In this regard, Asahina et al. (2Asahina K. Tsai S.Y. Li P. Ishii M. Maxson Jr., R.E. Sucov H.M. Tsukamoto H. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 998-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) has demonstrated recently the mesenchymal origin of fetal HSCs and “submesothelial cell” as a potential precursor for HSCs. Intriguingly, HSCs express markers for cell types derived from multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells such as neural cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes (3Geerts A. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), suggesting the HSC lineage may indeed be located somewhere within these mesenchymal lineages. hepatic stellate cell peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ multiplicity of infection bile duct ligation chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II. In 1999, we proposed that HSC-myofibroblastic trans-differentiation may be similar to adipocyte-preadipocyte de-differentiation (8Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S. Yee Jr., H.F. Motomura K. Anania F.A. Willson T.M. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35715-35722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Arguments for this notion included: 1) quiescent HSC store substantial amounts of triglycerides besides vitamin A-like adipocytes (4Yamada M. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Dixon J.L. Kjeldbye H.M. Goodman D.S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); 2) both quiescent HSC and adipocytes express type IV collagen, whereas activated HSC and preadipocytes express interstitial collagens; 3) cytokines (TNF-α and leptin) or growth factors (EGF/TGFα and TGFβ), which are known to inhibit adipocyte differentiation, also activate HSCs (5Tsukamoto H. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and 4) adipocyte-specific genes such as leptin are expressed by HSCs (6Potter J.J. Womack L. Mezey E. Anania F.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Indeed, the expression of PPARγ, a master regulator for adipocyte differentiation (7Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), is reduced in activated HSCs (8Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S. Yee Jr., H.F. Motomura K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35715-35722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and the ligands for this nuclear receptor inhibit HSC activation in vitro (9Galli A. Crabb D.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of PPARγ or SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1), another adipogenic transcription factor, or treatment with the adipocyte differentiation mixture, reverses activated HSCs to quiescent cells with the restored capacity to store vitamin A (9Galli A.

In further support of our notion, activated HSCs show induced expression of canonical Wnt proteins such as Wnt10b and Wnt3a (11Cheng J.H. She H. Han Y.P. Wang J. Xiong S. Asahina K. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 294: G39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which are known to suppress adipocyte differentiation via inhibition of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ (12Ross S.E.

Forced expression of the Wnt co-receptor antagonist Dikkopf-1 (Dkk-1) reduces increased nuclear β-catenin, restores expression of PPARγ, and converts culture-activated HSCs to quiescent lipid-storing cells (11Cheng J.H.

Necdin is a maternally imprinted gene, which encodes a 325-amino acid protein expressed in neurons, skeletal and smooth muscle cells, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and skin fibroblasts (14Taniguchi N.

Necdin belongs to the melanoma antigen family of proteins, which has a conserved central region termed the melanoma antigen homology domain. Necdin knock-out mice exhibit a phenotype similar to the neurobehavioral disorder Prader Willi syndrome, suggesting necdin deficiency impairs neuronal development (20Ren J. Lee S. Pagliardini S. Gérard M. Stewart C.L. Greer J.J. Wevrick R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, necdin enhances post-mitotic differentiation of neurons (21Kuwajima T. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Necdin also promotes differentiation of skeletal (17Kuwajima T. Taniura H. Nishimura I.

Cypess A.M. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Patti M.E. Kahn C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Some of these cell fate regulations are mediated at least in part via the interaction of necdin with Wnt1 promoter through homeodomain proteins such as Msx2 and Dlx2 (17Kuwajima T. Taniura H. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40484-40493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Kuwajima T. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on the tissue expression pattern and antiadipogenic action of necdin, and its cell fate regulation based on canonical Wnt signaling, we hypothesized that necdin is expressed in HSCs to regulate their trans-differentiation. Indeed, our study demonstrates that necdin is expressed selectively in HSCs among different liver cell types and induced in HSC trans-differentiation. Its causal role in trans-differentiation is supported by morphologic and biochemical reversal of culture-activated HSCs to quiescent cells by necdin silencing, and this effect is shown dependent on PPARγ and inhibition of canonical Wnt expression. Furthermore, the necdin-Wnt pathway causes epigenetic repression of PPARγ, which underlies HSC trans-differentiation. HSCs were isolated from normal male Wistar rats as described previously (22Tsukamoto H. Horne W. Kamimura S. Niemelä O. Parkkila S. Ylä-Herttuala S. Brittenham G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) by the Non-Parenchymal Liver Cell Core of the Southern California Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases and Cirrhosis. HSCs also were isolated from rats with liver fibrosis resulting from 10-day cholestasis due to ligation of the common bile duct or with hepatotoxic liver fibrosis induced by provision of phenobarbital in drinking water (500 mg/liter) plus subcutaneous injection of CCl4 (0.1 ml/100 g of body weight) given as a 2-fold dilution with mineral oil twice a week for 3 weeks. The use of animals for this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California and Department of Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. HSCs isolated from normal rats were cultured on plastic with low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics for 1 day or 7 days for analysis of quiescent or activated HSCs. HSCs were isolated from the liver fibrosis models, cultured on plastic in the medium containing 2% FBS, and analyzed immediately after overnight culture. Cell morphology was assessed by phase contrast microscopy, intracellular vitamin A content by UV-excited autofluorescence, and intracellular lipid content by oil red O staining. For promoter analysis via transient transfection, the spontaneously immortalized cell line (BSC) established from experimental cholestatic liver fibrosis (23Sung C.K. She H. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: G722-G729Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or the Huh7 hepatoma cell line, which does not express necdin, was used. Kupffer cells were isolated by an essentially identical procedure except for the use of the cells at the arabinogalactan gradient interface of 1.043/1.058 and 1.058/1.075 and subsequent adherence method as described previously (24Xiong S. She H. Takeuchi H. Han B. Engelhardt J.F. Barton C.H. Zandi E. Giulivi C. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17646-17654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated by the standard method of in situ collagenase digestion of the liver and low speed centrifugation (50 × g for 1 min). Sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated by magnetic cell sorting using SE-1 antibody as described previously (25Tokairin T. Nishikawa Y. Doi Y. Watanabe H. Yoshioka T. Su M. Omori Y. Enomoto K. J Hepatol. 2002; 36: 725-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purity of the cells isolated exceeded 95% for all cell types. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and amplified by 40 cycles using primers listed below and the SYBR Green PCR Master mix reagent (Applied Biosystems). Each Ct value was first normalized to 36B4 Ct value and compared between the treatment and control samples. Primer sequences used were as follows: PPARγ, 5′-CTGAAGCTCCAAGAATACCAAA; and 5′-AGAGTTGGGTTTTTTCAGAATAATAAGG; LXRα, 5′-GGCCCTGCATGCCTATGT and 5′-CATTAGCATCCGTGGGAACA; α1(I) collagen, 5′-TCGATTCACCTACAGCACGC and 5′-GACTGTCTTGCCCCAAGTTCC; C/EBPβ, 5′-AAGAAGTCGGTGGATAAGAACAG and 5′-GTTGCGCTGTTTGGCTTTATCTC; ACC, 5′-CCCAACAGAATAAAGCTACTCTGG and 5′-TCCTTTTGTGCAACTAGGAACGT; fatty acid synthase, 5′-CCTGGACAGCATTCCAAACCT and 5′-AGCACATCTCGAAGGCTACACA; 36B4, 5′-TTCCCACTGGCTGAAAAGGT and 5′-CGCAGCCGCAAATGC. HSCs were cultured in a 10-cm dish for 7 days followed by infection with Ad.LacZ.shRNA or Ad.Necdin.shRNA described below at 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for an additional 3 days. The cells were then washed with PBS once, and nuclear and cytosolic proteins were isolated as described previously (26Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An equal amount of the nuclear or cytosolic extract (20 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Necdin or β-catenin were detected by incubating with rabbit polyclonal anti-necdin antibody (Abcam) or rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 0.2–2 μg/10 ml in TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) with 5% nonfat milk followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/10 ml. Proteins were detected by a chemiluminescent method using the Pierce ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus expressing necdin shRNA was constructed using BLOCK-iT Adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To select the best shRNA against the rat necdin gene, we first designed four shRNA oligonucleotides by using the Invitrogen shRNA designer. Of these, one starting at +916 (5′-GGCCAGAGTCTTTAAGAAGGA-3′) was shown to be most effective. An additional sequence of CACC was added at the 5′ end, and AAAA was added to the 5′ end of the complementary sequence. These two DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to generate dsDNA, which was subsequently cloned into the pENTR/U6 vector using the BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi Entry vector kit. The U6 RNAi cassette in the pENTR/U6 necdin shRNA vector was transferred to the adenoviral expression plasmid by LR recombination reaction using the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix and pAd/BLOCK-iT-DEST Gateway Vector kit. Isolated adenoviral expression clones were then digested with PacI to expose the inverted terminal repeats and transfected into 293A cells using Targefect F-2 (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) for production of a crude adenoviral stock. Large-scale amplification of adenoviral vector was performed in 293A cells as described previously (26Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol.

An adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase shRNA (Ad.LacZ.shRNA) was constructed as a control shRNA vector. Necdin-silencing efficiency was tested in day 6 culture-activated rat HSCs with an MOI of 50, 100, and 200. Adenovirus expressing GFP (26Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K.

To determine whether necdin silencing affects Wnt10b promoter activity, the rat HSC cell line BSC was transiently transfected with the Wnt10b promoter (−705/+33)-luciferase construct (a gift from Dr. Dwight J. Klemm, University of Michigan) by using Targefect F-2 (Advanced Targeting Systems) followed 6 h later by infection with Ad.LacZ.shRNA or Ad.Necdin.shRNA at 100 MOI for 3 days. The cell lysate was collected for determination of both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and the results were normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed at the most proximal GN box at −108/−96 within the Wnt10b proximal promoter using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA), and these mutants were tested for necdin-induced promoter activity in Huh7 cells, which do not express necdin. For assessing necdin recruitment to Wnt10b promoter, carrier ChIP was performed using Raj cells as the source of carrier chromatin. For this analysis, Raji cells (1.4 × 107) were added to cultured HSCs (0.2 × 106 cells) with or without necdin silencing or Wnt3 treatment and were fixed briefly with 1% formaldehyde on the rotating platform for 5–10 min at room temperature followed by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Scraped HSCs and Raji cells in the media were spun down and washed with cold PBS with protease inhibitors. After lysis of the cells with SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitors, the lysate was sonicated and snap-frozen in aliquots. For chromatin IP, diluted samples were first precleared with protein G-agarose and then incubated with antibody against necdin, MeCP2, HP-1α, or H3K27me2 (Abcam) at 1 μg/μl at 4 °C for overnight followed by precipitation with protein G-agarose. After elution of immunoprecipitated complex, cross-linking was reversed with 5 n NaCl, and proteins were digested with protease K. Extracted chromatin was subjected to real-time PCR using the primers flanking a segment within Pparγ promoter or Pparγ exon 5 as described recently (29Mann J. Chu D.C. Maxwell A. Oakley F. Zhu N.L. Tsukamoto H. Mann D.A. Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 705-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), or five overlapping segments of the proximal Wnt10b promoter (−143/+42, −268/−119, −402/−248, −597/−383, −703/−574). Ct values of the samples with non-immune IgG were subtracted and compared with their respective input Ct values. We first examined the expression of necdin in four liver cell types isolated from the rat, HSCs, Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, which collectively constitute 90∼95% of cells in the liver. Real-time PCR analysis revealed necdin mRNA was expressed at the highest level in HSCs among these cell types. The levels in Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and hepatocytes were 3∼12% of that detected in HSCs (Fig. 1A). This selective expression is confirmed by immunoblot analysis, which detected a strong ∼38 kD band in HSCs but a very faint band in Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined the expression of necdin in culture-activated HSCs. When primary HSCs are cultured on plastic, the cells undergo spontaneous activation on days 3 and 7 after plating as characterized by induction of the bona fide HSC activation markers, α1(I) procollagen and down-regulation of Pparγ, the gene that confers HSC quiescence (Fig. 2A) (26Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27She H. Xiong S. Hazra S. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The necdin mRNA level is induced as rat primary HSCs become activated on days 3 and 7. Necdin protein level also is conspicuously up-regulated in day 7 culture-activated HSCs as compared with day 1 quiescent HSCs (Fig. 2B). This pattern of expression is merely identical to that in preadipocytic fibroblasts (3T3L1 cells treated with the vehicle DMSO) versus 3T3L1 cells that fully differentiated to adipocytes by the adipocyte differentiation mixture containing (isobutylmethyl xanthine, dexamethasone, insulin) (Fig. 2B). We then examined whether necdin induction also can be demonstrated in activated HSCs isolated from experimental models of liver fibrosis. For this analysis, HSCs were isolated from rats with cholestatic liver fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) or those with hepatotoxic liver fibrosis resulting from repetitive injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), as well as their controls: rats with sham-operation and those injected with oil, the vehicle for CCl4. Real-time PCR analysis of RNA extracted from these cells showed a 2.5-fold increase in necdin mRNA in HSCs from BDL or CCl4 rats as compared with the respective controls (Fig. 2C). Concomitantly, the α1(I) procollagen mRNA level was increased and PPARγ mRNA decreased much like what we observed in culture-activated HSCs (Fig. 2C). The necdin protein level was also increased in BDL and CCl4 HSCs (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that HSC activation in vitro or in vivo is associated with induction of necdin. To test the role of necdin in HSC trans-differentiation, necdin expression was silenced with shRNA expressed by adenovirus (Ad.Necdin.shRNA). Adenovirus expressing shRNA against LacZ (Ad.LacZ.shRNA) was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 3A, infection of culture-activated HSCs with Ad.Necdin.shRNA at an MOI of 100 or 200 for 3 days, clearly reduced nuclear and cytosolic levels of necdin. This silencing resulted in a drastic morphologic reversal of HSCs to quiescent cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel), increased intracellular vitamin A content as assessed by UV-excited autofluorescence (middle panel), and increased lipid content stained by oil red O (lower panel). The reversal also was confirmed by reduced expression of α1(I) procollagen (Fig. 3C). We next determined the effects of necdin silencing on the expression of neuronal, myogenic, and adipogenic marker genes to gain insights into the mechanisms of the cell phenotype reversal. Necdin silencing did not regulate either neuronal or myogenic genes (Fig. 3D) but consistently up-regulated adipogenic transcription factors (Pparγ, C/ebpα, and Lxrα) and their target genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase) (Fig. 3E, left graph). As these genes are all down-regulated in day 7 culture-activated HSCs as compared with day 1 quiescent cells (Fig. 3E, right graph), the observed induction with necdin silencing should be interpreted as restoration of normal expression of the genes in quiescent HSCs. As our previous study showed the pivotal importance of PPARγ in the maintenance of HSC quiescence (8Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S. Yee Jr., H.F. Motomura K. Anania F.A. Willson T.M.

To test this notion, culture-activated HSCs were co-infected with Ad.Necdin.shRNA and adenovirus that expresses a dominant-negative mutant of PPARγ (Ad.dnPPARγ) or GFP (Ad.GFP) as a control. This dnPPARγ carries the mutations at leucine and glutamic acid residues in the conserved AF-2 region, inhibiting co-activator recruitment and ligand-dependent release of co-repressors while promoting basal recruitment of co-repressors (28Gurnell M.

Coexpression of this mutant indeed prevented the morphologic reversal achieved by necdin silencing: note the activated cell morphology by phase contrast microscopy and diminished vitamin A storage by UV-excited autofluorescence (Fig. 3F, bottom panel).

https://openalex.org/W2033802427,"The D1 protein (PsbA) of photosystem II (PSII) from Thermosynechococcus elongatus is encoded by a psbA gene family that is typical of cyanobacteria. Although the transcription of these three genes has been studied previously (Kós, P. B., Deák, Z., Cheregi, O., and Vass, I. (2008) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1777, 74-83), the protein quantification had not been possible due to the high sequence identity between the three PsbA copies. The successful establishment of a method to quantify the PsbA proteins on the basis of reverse phase-LC-electrospray mass ionization-MS/MS (RP-LC-ESI-MS/MS) enables an accurate comparison of transcript and protein level for the first time ever. Upon high light incubation, about 70% PsbA3 could be detected, which closely corresponds to the transcript level. It was impossible to detect any PsbA2 under all tested conditions. The construction of knock-out mutants enabled for the first time a detailed characterization of both whole cells and also isolated PSII complexes. PSII complexes of the ΔpsbA1/psbA2 mutant contained only copy PsbA3, whereas only PsbA1 could be detected in PSII complexes from the ΔpsbA3 mutant. In whole cells as well as in isolated complexes, a shift of the free energy between the redox pairs in the PsbA3 complexes in comparison with PsbA1 could be detected by thermoluminescence and delayed fluorescence measurements. This change is assigned to a shift of the redox potential of pheophytin toward more positive values. Coincidentally, no differences in the Q(A)-Q(B) electron transfer could be observed in flash-induced fluorescence decay or prompt fluorescence measurements. In conclusion, PsbA3 complexes yield a better protection against photoinhibition due to a higher probability of the harmless dissipation of excess energy."
https://openalex.org/W1997232229,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator that elicits various cellular functions under physiological and pathological conditions. We have recently identified two enzymes involved in PAF production: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-1 (LPCAT1) and LPCAT2. We found that LPCAT2 is highly expressed in inflammatory cells and is activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment through Toll-like receptor 4. However, the molecular mechanism for the activation remains elusive. In this study, Phos-tag SDS-PAGE revealed the LPS-induced phosphorylation of LPCAT2. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analyses identified Ser(34) of LPCAT2 as the phosphorylation site to enhance the catalytic activities. The experiments using inhibitors and siRNA against MAPK cascades demonstrated that LPCAT2 phosphorylation through LPS-TLR4 signaling may directly depend on MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP kinase 2 or MK2). These findings develop a further understanding of both PAF production and phospholipid remodeling triggered by inflammatory stimuli. Specific inhibition of the PAF biosynthetic activity by phosphorylated LPCAT2 will provide a novel target for the regulation of inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2009700747,"Denitrification is an important ecosystem service that removes nitrogen (N) from N-polluted watersheds, buffering soil, stream, and river water quality from excess N by returning N to the atmosphere before it reaches lakes or oceans and leads to eutrophication. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) assay is widely used for measuring denitrification potential. Because DEA is a function of enzyme levels in soils, most ecologists studying denitrification have assumed that DEA is less sensitive to ambient levels of nitrate (NO(3)(-)) and soil carbon and thus, less variable over time than field measurements. In addition, plant diversity has been shown to have strong effects on microbial communities and belowground processes and could potentially alter the functional capacity of denitrifiers. Here, we examined three questions: (1) Does DEA vary through the growing season? (2) If so, can we predict DEA variability with environmental variables? (3) Does plant functional diversity affect DEA variability?The study site is a restored wetland in North Carolina, US with native wetland herbs planted in monocultures or mixes of four or eight species. We found that denitrification potentials for soils collected in July 2006 were significantly greater than for soils collected in May and late August 2006 (p<0.0001). Similarly, microbial biomass standardized DEA rates were significantly greater in July than May and August (p<0.0001). Of the soil variables measured--soil moisture, organic matter, total inorganic nitrogen, and microbial biomass--none consistently explained the pattern observed in DEA through time. There was no significant relationship between DEA and plant species richness or functional diversity. However, the seasonal variance in microbial biomass standardized DEA rates was significantly inversely related to plant species functional diversity (p<0.01).These findings suggest that higher plant functional diversity may support a more constant level of DEA through time, buffering the ecosystem from changes in season and soil conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2032142575,"When replete with zinc and copper, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutant SOD proteins can protect motor neurons in culture from trophic factor deprivation as efficiently as wild-type SOD. However, the removal of zinc from either mutant or wild-type SOD results in apoptosis of motor neurons through a copper- and peroxynitrite-dependent mechanism. It has also been shown that motor neurons isolated from transgenic mice expressing mutant SODs survive well in culture but undergo apoptosis when exposed to nitric oxide via a Fas-dependent mechanism. We combined these two parallel approaches for understanding SOD toxicity in ALS and found that zinc-deficient SOD-induced motor neuron death required Fas activation, whereas the nitric oxide-dependent death of G93A SOD-expressing motor neurons required copper and involved peroxynitrite formation. Surprisingly, motor neuron death doubled when Cu,Zn-SOD protein was either delivered intracellularly to G93A SOD-expressing motor neurons or co-delivered with zinc-deficient SOD to nontransgenic motor neurons. These results could be rationalized by biophysical data showing that heterodimer formation of Cu,Zn-SOD with zinc-deficient SOD prevented the monomerization and subsequent aggregation of zinc-deficient SOD under thiol-reducing conditions. ALS mutant SOD was also stabilized by mutating cysteine 111 to serine, which greatly increased the toxicity of zinc-deficient SOD. Thus, stabilization of ALS mutant SOD by two different approaches augmented its toxicity to motor neurons. Taken together, these results are consistent with copper-containing zinc-deficient SOD being the elusive ""partially unfolded intermediate"" responsible for the toxic gain of function conferred by ALS mutant SOD."

However, the mechanisms whereby fragments of CD44 enter the nucleus have not been elucidated. Here we show that CD44 interacts with two import receptors of the importin β superfamily, importin β itself and transportin. Inhibition of importin β-dependent transport failed to block CD44 accumulation in the nucleus. By contrast, inhibition of the transportin-dependent pathway abrogated CD44 import. Mutagenesis of the intracellular domain of CD44 revealed that the 20 membrane-proximal residues contain sequences required for transportin-mediated nuclear transport.

https://openalex.org/W2088678946,"Background The rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shared epitope (SE), a major risk factor for severe disease, is a five amino acid motif in the third allelic hypervariable region of the HLA-DRβ chain. The molecular mechanisms by which the SE affects susceptibility to – and severity of - RA are unknown. We have recently demonstrated that the SE acts as a ligand that interacts with cell surface calreticulin (CRT) and activates innate immune signaling. In order to better understand the molecular basis of SE-RA association, here we have undertaken to map the SE binding site on CRT. Principal Findings Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments with domain deletion mutants suggested that the SE binding site is located in the P-domain of CRT. The role of this domain as a SE-binding region was further confirmed by a sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azido-benzamido) hexanoamido] ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-SBED) photoactive cross-linking method. In silico analysis of docking interactions between a conformationally intact SE ligand and the CRT P-domain predicted the region within amino acid residues 217–224 as a potential SE binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated involvement of residues Glu217 and Glu223 - and to a lesser extent residue Asp220 - in cell-free SPR-based binding and signal transduction assays. Significance We have characterized here the molecular basis of a novel ligand-receptor interaction between the SE and CRT. The interaction represents a structurally and functionally well-defined example of cross talk between the adaptive and innate immune systems that could advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2024267421,"TCR stimulation leads to an increase in cellular adhesion among other outcomes. The adhesion and degranulation promoting adapter protein (ADAP) is known to be rapidly phosphorylated after T cell stimulation and relays the TCR signal to adhesion molecules of the integrin family. While three tyrosine phosphorylation sites have been characterized biochemically, the binding capabilities and associated functions of several other potential phosphotyrosine motifs remain unclear. Here, we utilize in vitro phosphorylation and mass spectrometry to map novel phosphotyrosine sites in the C-terminal part of human ADAP (486–783). Individual tyrosines were then mutated to phenylalanine and their relevance for cellular adhesion and migration was tested experimentally. Functionally important tyrosine residues include two sites within the folded hSH3 domains of ADAP and two at the C-terminus. Furthermore, using a peptide pulldown approach in combination with stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC) we identified SLP-76, PLCγ, PIK3R1, Nck, CRK, Gads, and RasGAP as phospho-dependent binding partners of a central YDDV motif of ADAP. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between ADAP and Nck was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis, immunoprecipitation and binary pulldown experiments, indicating that ADAP directly links integrins to modulators of the cytoskeleton independent of SLP-76."
https://openalex.org/W2132599819,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-known model organism used to investigate fundamental questions in biology. Motility assays of this small roundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior. Commonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and characterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates. However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools relying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users; here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined. Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C. elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility assays."

Although several components of the peptide-loading complex are required for optimal assembly and transport of MHC class I molecules to the surface, TAP and tapasin are essential for an optimized peptide loading to empty MHC class I molecules and their successive presentation to cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (39Garbi N.

Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) identified NF-κB as a basal transcription factor and a shared IRF1/2-binding site mediating IFN-γ inducibility of tapasin expression in murine cells. Recently, a cytokine-independent up-regulation of APM components by the CD40L-mediated transactivation of TAP1, TAP2, tapasin, LMP2, and LMP10 genes via NF-κB was observed, resulting in a de novo IRF1 synthesis accompanied by activating IRF1 in a STAT1-independent manner (56Moschonas A. Kouraki M. Knox P.G. Thymiakou E. Kardassis D. Eliopoulos A.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6208-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Despite the transcriptional and posttranscriptional down-regulation of APM components in tumor cells, detailed information about the molecular mechanisms or factors involved in this process is limited or controversially discussed (11Cabrera C.M.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4634-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, there exists little information about transcription factors modulating the MHC class I APM component expression. Although promyelocytic leukemia protein has been suggested as a general regulator of APM component expression, its role in controlling this pathway is controversially discussed (59Bruno S. Ghiotto F. Fais F. Fagioli M. Luzi L. Pelicci P.G. Grossi C.E. Ciccone E. Blood. 2003; 101: 3514-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 60Zheng P. Guo Y. Niu Q. Levy D.E. Dyck J.A. Lu S. Sheiman L.A. Liu Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, the antagonistic transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (PR domain-containing 1 (PRDM1)) has recently been shown to repress the IFN-γ-dependent transcription of ERAP1, tapasin, MECL1, and LMP7, resulting in a failure to up-regulate MHC class I surface antigens in human cell lines (61Doody G.M. Stephenson S. McManamy C. Tooze R.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7614-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors involved in the HER-2/neu-mediated down-regulation of MHC class I APM components using an in vitro model of oncogenic transformation. We here show for the first time an important role for E2F1 in the transcriptional regulation of tapasin in untransformed and HER-2/neu-transformed fibroblasts.DISCUSSIONA detailed analysis of the APM components in HER-2/neu− versus HER-2/neu+ cells revealed a strong coordinated down-regulation of the expression of several APM components, with the exception of β2-m and HC (63Herrmann F. Lehr H.A. Drexler I. Sutter G. Hengstler J. Wollscheid U. Seliger B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 67Choudhury A. Charo J. Parapuram S.K. Hunt R.C. Hunt D.M. Seliger B. Kiessling R. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 108: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the impaired APM component expression in the HER-2/neu+ cells have not yet been identified.By investigating the TAP1, LMP2, TAP2, and tapasin promoter activity, a transcriptional down-regulation of the respective APM promoters was found in HER-2/neu-overexpressing fibroblasts when compared with non-transformed cells varying from 38% (TAP2) to 84% (LMP2). These data were further confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses of HER-2/neu− versus HER-2/neu+ fibroblasts. Based on these results, we postulated that the mRNA levels of APM components could be modulated by (i) an instability of transcription initiation due to the absence of the enhancing transcription factor CBP/p300, which might be limited in oncogene-transformed cells (8Setiadi A.F. David M.D. Seipp R.P. Hartikainen J.A. Gopaul R. Jefferies W.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 7886-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), or the presence of negatively acting suppressors; (ii) a chromatin-mediated physical barrier in HER-2/neu+ cells, thereby reducing the access of the RNA pol II complex to the tapasin promoter; or (iii) the absence of transcription elongation factors, which might control the constitutive transcription level in a gene- or locus-specific manner (70Ares Jr., M. Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 163-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 71Brès V. Yoh S.M. Jones K.A. Curr. Opin.

FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 2893-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).To address these questions, the role of TFBS controlling the TAP1/LMP2, TAP2, and tapasin promoter activity was determined using TFBS KO mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis (62Herrmann F. Trowsdale J. Huber C. Seliger B. Immunogenetics. 2003; 55: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations of the E2F and p300 TFBS caused a reconstitution of the tapasin promoter activity in HER-2/neu+ cells, suggesting the involvement of E2F1 and p300 in the transcriptional down-regulation of tapasin in oncogenic transformants. In contrast, E2F is not crucial for the HER-2/neu-mediated down-regulation of TAP1 transcription, whereas the E2F-binding site at position −85 plays an important role for TAP2 transcription. These data were further validated by investigating the access of RNA pol II complexes to the APM promoters using ChIP. The decreased binding of RNA pol II to the APM promoters in HER-2/neu+ cells mirrored the decreased transcription level of tapasin, TAP1, LMP2, and TAP2 in these cells. These results are in accordance with a recent report by Jefferies and co-workers (8Setiadi A.F. David M.D. Seipp R.P. Hartikainen J.A. Gopaul R. Jefferies W.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 7886-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) demonstrating an association of a weak TAP1 promoter activity with reduced recruitment of CBP to the TAP1 promoter in TAP1-deficient cells.To clarify the role of the histone-acetylating protein p300, a slightly reduced attachment of p300 to tapasin and LMP2 but not to the TAP2 promoter in HER-2/neu+ cells when compared with untransformed cells was found, suggesting a correlation between RNA pol II and p300 access to these promoters. Because the binding of E2F1–3 to promoters is associated with the acquisition of the histone H3 and H4 acetylation (73Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar, 74Taubert S. Gorrini C. Frank S.R. Parisi T. Fuchs M. Chan H.M. Livingston D.M. Amati B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4546-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), E2F1 ChIP assays were performed to clarify the role of E2F1 in APM component transcription.Indeed, E2F1 was able to bind to the WT tapasin, TAP1, and TAP2 promoters. The amplicons obtained match perfectly the amplicon pattern from ChIP analyses of RNA pol II and p300, suggesting a coordinated transcription initiation complex engulfing RNA pol II, p300, and E2F1. Recently, the specificity of E2F activation and repression has been investigated for the Cdc2 and Cdc6 genes, demonstrating both positive and negative effects on the transcription for both proximal and distal E2F-binding sites depending on the E2F transcription factor (75Freedman J.A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4615-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).In an attempt to explore the function of E2F1 regarding the regulation of tapasin expression, E2F1 was either inhibited by E2F1-specific siRNA or overexpressed. Although E2F1 silencing was directly accompanied by an increased tapasin transcription and translation in HER-2/neu− cells, the transient E2F1 overexpression resulted in a reduced tapasin transcription. Moreover, differently sized DNA-binding proteins in crude nuclear extracts of WT and oncogene-transformed cells were found at the proximal E2F(−146)-binding site of the tapasin promoter in EMSA, which were completely abolished by unlabeled competitor. However, two or more proteins with distinct molecular weights might bind to this region, which might be explained by the broad homologies in the DNA binding capacity of the different members of E2F transcription factor family (78Dimova D.K.

A signal with an estimated size of 38 kDa was detected, which was more pronounced in crude nuclear extracts of HER-2/neu− cells.Using different experimental approaches, we here demonstrate for the first time a selective transcriptional control of tapasin expression in both untransformed and HER-2/neu-transformed cells. In this model system, E2F1 and p300 are in particular involved in the control of tapasin transcription, but the role of these transcription factors and their recruitment to promoters involved in modulation of the immunogenicity of tumor cells await further investigations (86Nevins J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2000187843,"Elucidating the regulatory mechanism for tissue-specific gene expression is key to understanding the differentiation process. The chondromodulin-I gene (ChM-I) is a cartilage-specific gene, the expression of which is regulated by the transcription factor, Sp3. The binding of Sp3 to the core-promoter region is regulated by the methylation status of the Sp3-binding motif as we reported previously. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms of the down-regulation of ChM-I expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and normal mesenchymal tissues other than cartilage. The core-promoter region of cells in bone and peripheral nerve tissues was hypermethylated, whereas the methylation status in cells of other tissues including MSCs did not differ from that in cells of cartilage, suggesting the presence of inhibitory mechanisms other than DNA methylation. We found that a transcriptional repressor, YY1, negatively regulated the expression of ChM-I by recruiting histone deacetylase and thus inducing the deacetylation of associated histones. As for a positive regulator, we found that a transcriptional co-activator, p300, bound to the core-promoter region with Sp3, inducing the acetylation of histone. Inhibition of YY1 in combination with forced expression of p300 and Sp3 restored the expression of ChM-I in cells with a hypomethylated promoter region, but not in cells with hypermethylation. These results suggested that the expression of tissue-specific genes is regulated in two steps; reversible down-regulation by transcriptional repressor complex and tight down-regulation via DNA methylation."

IntroductionThe retinoblastoma family of growth suppressor proteins, designated pocket proteins, includes the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene and the functionally and structurally related proteins p107 and p130 (reviewed in Ref. 1Graña X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Pocket proteins suppress the G0/G1 cell cycle transition and passage through the restriction point by repressing E2F-dependent transcription via a direct interaction of the hypophosphorylated pocket protein with members of the E2F family of transcription factors. Mitogen-dependent activation of D-type cyclin-CDK 2The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinasepRBretinoblastoma proteinstsmall t antigen. complexes cooperates with cyclin E-CDK2 complexes to hyperphosphorylate pocket proteins starting in mid-to late G1 disrupting the pocket protein-E2F interaction and relieving repression of many genes whose products are required for cell cycle progression. Pocket proteins remain hyperphosphorylated through the S and G2 phases and part of mitosis as they become targets of cyclin-CDK complexes that operate at these cell cycle stages (reviewed in Refs. 2Sotillo E. Graña X. Enders G. Cell Cycle Deregulation in Cancer. Springer Publishing, New York2010: 3-22Crossref Google Scholar, 3Graña X. Cancer Biol.

Cell. 2006; 127: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).As cyclin-CDK complexes are inactivated during mitotic exit, the three pocket proteins become simultaneously hypophosphorylated. PP1 has been implicated in dephosphorylation of pRB from mitosis to a point in G1, where pRB becomes hyperphosphorylated by G1 cyclin-CDKs (reviewed in Refs. 3Graña X. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2008; 7: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and 5Tamrakar S. Rubin E. Ludlow J.W. Front Biosci. 2000; 5: D121-D137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a second phosphatase plays a role in reversing the action of CDKs throughout the cell cycle and in quiescent cells (6Garriga J. Jayaraman A.L. Limón A. Jayadeva G. Sotillo E. Truongcao M. Patsialou A. Wadzinski B.E. Graña X. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes is pharmacologically inhibited, pocket proteins become rapidly dephosphorylated, and the severity of the hypophosphorylation depends on the subsets of CDKs that become inactivated. For instance, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, causes rapid down-regulation of short lived cyclins such as D-type cyclins, resulting in potent dephosphorylation of p107, but only partial dephosphorylation of p130 and pRB, as CDK2 remains active for several hours. In contrast, treatment with the potent CDK inhibitor flavopiridol leads to rapid and complete dephosphorylation of pocket proteins as all CDKs become inactive (6Garriga J. Jayaraman A.L. Limón A. Jayadeva G. Sotillo E. Truongcao M. Patsialou A. Wadzinski B.E. Graña X. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).PP2A, a second Ser/Thr phosphatase, has been implicated in dephosphorylation of pocket proteins throughout the cell cycle by using selective pharmacological inhibitors of PP2A in cells and in vitro, as well as by expressing in cells the Simian virus 40 (SV40) small t antigen (st), which binds and specifically inhibits PP2A (6Garriga J.

In addition, the catalytic subunit of PP2A was found to associate with both p130 and p107 through the cell cycle and in quiescent cells. Others have implicated PP2A in dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in response to a variety of signals including oxidative stress (7Cicchillitti L. Fasanaro P. Biglioli P. Capogrossi M.C.

PLoS One. 2008; 3e3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Although cells express a multitude of distinct protein kinases, many of them monomeric, that specialize in targeting selected substrates, the number of cellular proteins with catalytic phosphatase activity is small. Because many of the processes involving kinases also implicate phosphatases, it has been assumed that phosphatases play a passive role with limited specificity in the regulation of protein function. However, recent work has shown that PP2A, despite its ubiquitous nature, exhibits highly regulated substrate selectivity that is determined by association with multiple regulatory subunits (reviewed in Ref. 13Virshup D.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). PP2A is a trimeric enzyme that consists of a catalytic subunit (PP2A/C), a scaffold subunit (PP2A/A), and a regulatory subunit (PP2A/B). Two genes for each PP2A/C and PP2A/A encode highly similar isoforms of these subunits. However, there are four families of B subunits (B, B′, B″, and striatins), each with several members encoded by genes with multiple splice variants that mediate substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Moreover, additional proteins can replace B subunits (14Goudreault M. D'Ambrosio L.M. Kean M.J. Mullin M.J. Larsen B.G. Sanchez A. Chaudhry S. Chen G.I. Sicheri F. Nesvizhskii A.I. Aebersold R. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 157-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in excess of 200 biochemically distinct PP2A holoenzymes can assemble with presumed distinct specificities (reviewed in Ref. 13Virshup D.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 537-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).Although we had previously implicated PP2A in modulating the phosphorylation state of pocket proteins as part of a dynamic equilibrium with CDKs throughout the cell cycle, the specific holoenzyme targeting pocket proteins in this scenario is unknown. We have used in vitro and cell-based assays to identify B55α as a regulatory subunit that assembles a PP2A trimeric complex that targets p107 and p130. A purified B55α trimeric holoenzyme specifically dephosphorylates p107 in vitro. Modulation of B55α expression in cells induces prominent changes in the phosphorylation of p107 and, to a lesser extent, p130, indicating that the levels of this subunit determine the overall phosphorylation state of these pocket proteins. Our data also show that different PP2A holoenzymes target particular pocket proteins as pRB appears to associate preferentially with PR70 rather than B55α. Importantly, a relatively small increase in B55α expression is sufficient to activate p107 but fails to induce growth arrest as the other pocket proteins remain mostly hyperphosphorylated. This suggests that multiple distinct PP2A holoenzymes target pocket proteins to coordinately induce their activation.RESULTSWe have previously proposed that PP2A plays a direct role in restricting the phosphorylation of pocket proteins through the cell cycle (6Garriga J. Jayaraman A.L. Limón A. Jayadeva G. Sotillo E. Truongcao M. Patsialou A. Wadzinski B.E. Graña X. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although we have detected endogenous interactions between p130 and p107 with the catalytic subunit of PP2A and implicated an SV40 st-sensitive holoenzyme in counteracting CDK-mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins, the nature of the PP2A/B subunit(s) is not known. To determine whether affinity-purified pocket proteins form complexes with subunits of the PP2A holoenzyme, we first determined whether recombinant GST-tagged pocket proteins pull down PP2A/A and PP2A/C from lysates of human cells. Comparable amounts of full-length GST-p130, GST-p107, GST-pRB, or an excess amount of GST loaded on glutathione beads were incubated with whole cell lysates of exponentially growing U-2 OS cells and extensively washed. Complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and specific biding of endogenous PP2A/A and PP2A/C was determined by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Fig. 1A shows that GST-p107 pulls significantly more PP2A/A and PP2A/C than p130 or pRB. This effect was independent of the batch of GST fusion preparation (data not shown). We next determined whether this binding was dose-dependent using increasing amounts of GST-p107 or an excess of control GST loaded onto glutathione beads (supplemental Fig. 1A). Of note, concentrations of GST-p107 that were not detectable by Coomassie Blue staining were sufficient for robust binding to PP2A/A and PP2A/C subunits, but we did not observe any binding of PP2A subunits to GST beads even when the amount of GST loaded was more that 2 orders of magnitude higher than the amount of GST-p107. We also determined whether this interaction could occur in lysates of human T98G cells that had been serum-starved and restimulated with serum for different periods of time. Supplemental Fig. 1B shows that bacterially expressed GST-p107 that is unphosphorylated can effectively form complexes with PP2A subunits present in the lysates of quiescent cells, as well as cells enriched at different points of the cell cycle. This finding is in agreement with our previous observation that endogenous PP2A/C interacts with p107/p130 through the cell cycle (6Garriga J. Jayaraman A.L. Limón A. Jayadeva G. Sotillo E. Truongcao M. Patsialou A. Wadzinski B.E. Graña X. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).As the binding of GST-p107 with both PP2A/A and PP2A/C suggested that p107 was capturing PP2A holoenzymes, we set out to determine whether p107 had a preference for holoenzymes with particular B subunits. We arbitrarily selected B55α, B56γ, and PR48, which are members of the B, B′, and B″ families, respectively. The subunits of trimeric complexes that differed in their B subunit were coexpressed in insect cells. Affinity purification was performed with nickel columns, which bound His-tagged PP2A/A. The eluted complexes were further purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Trimeric complexes were normalized by the amount of PP2A/C as we observed an excess of free His-tagged PP2A in some preparations (Fig. 1B). GST pulldown assays were performed, and complex formation was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Fig. 1B shows that trimeric complexes containing the B55α subunit were preferentially pulled down by GST-p107. The amount of both PP2A/C and PP2A/A was much higher that the amount pulled down by complexes containing either PR48 or B56γ2. Additionally, the relative amount of B subunit pulled down from each complex as compared with the inputs was dramatically different. Considering the inputs, GST-p107 captured close to 10% of the B55α trimeric complex. However, under the same conditions, the amount of PR48 trimeric complex captured was much lower, and B56γ2 was undetectable. Thus, the selectivity of p107 for the B subunit correlates with the amounts of PP2A/A and PP2A/C pulled down, suggesting that the B subunit is the determinant mediating PP2A binding to p107 and that B55α is the preferred B subunit. To determine whether this in vitro selectivity could be recapitulated in cells, we transfected U-2 OS cells with the tagged constructs indicated in Fig. 1C and performed immunoprecipitations from whole cell lysates followed by Western blot analysis. As expected, anti-FLAG antibodies immunoprecipitated p107. HA-B55α was co-precipitated only when FLAG-p107 was coexpressed. Similarly, anti-p107 antibodies immunoprecipitated HA-p107, but HA-B55α was co-immunoprecipitated only when co-expressed with HA-p107. Endogenous PP2A/C was co-precipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies in amounts correlating with FLAG-p107 expression. Anti-p107 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated PP2A in the absence of HA-p107 overexpression because endogenous p107 co-immunoprecipitates with PP2A. We also determined whether endogenous p107-B55α complexes could be detected in U-2 OS cells. Anti-p107 antibodies efficiently co-immunoprecipitated PP2A/A and PP2A/C, whereas B55α was co-precipitated to a lower extent. B55α antibodies, which could not preclear B55α from the lysates, immunoprecipitated low levels of p107 that were above background detection (Fig. 1D). These data indicate low abundance of endogenous complexes, which may be due to the instability of the enzyme-substrate interaction. Therefore, B55α mediates an interaction between p107 and PP2A both in vitro and in cells.Next we determined whether other pocket proteins also interact with B55α under similar conditions. Fig. 2A shows that FLAG-p130 and FLAG-p107, but not FLAG-pRB, interact comparably with HA-B55α when pocket proteins are expressed with the same tag and at similar levels. A similar specificity was also noticed in in vitro pulldown assays using lysates of U-2 OS cells transfected with the HA-tagged B subunits indicated in Fig. 2B. GST-p107 preferentially associated with B55α and to a lesser extent with PR48, GST-p130 interacted with both B55α and PR48 at comparable levels, whereas GST-pRB associated with PR48 but not B55α. Altogether this suggests that pocket proteins are selectively targeted by distinct PP2A holoenzymes with B subunits belonging to at least two different families.FIGURE 2Members of distinct B subunit family target particular pocket proteins.

Therefore, we utilized a series of p107 mutants to determine the domains in p107 that mediate the interaction with the PP2A holoenzyme. Deletion mutants that eliminate well defined domains on p107 were generated via PCR and are depicted in Fig. 3A. GST pulldown assays using these mutants revealed that the spacer region of p107 is essential for binding to PP2A/A and PP2A/C, as well the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, which is known to interact with the spacer region of p107/p130 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, E2F-4 could still form a complex in the absence of the spacer. In multiple experiments, we also observed that although the C terminus was not sufficient to form a complex with PP2A subunits, it enhanced the binding when connected to the spacer, and the absence of the C terminus in the context of an otherwise full-length protein reduced binding (Fig. 3B). This is even more obvious when the pulldown assays were performed using purified trimeric complexes. Fig. 3C shows that the spacer of p107 but not the C terminus domain interacts with B55α, but when the C terminus is fused to the spacer, the interaction of this deletion mutant is comparable with that of the full-length protein. As expected, no interactions were detected with B56γ2.FIGURE 3The spacer region of p107 mediates the interaction with the PP2A-B55α complex, and the C terminus enhances the interaction. A, conserved p107 domains and summarized relative binding activity with PP2A (domain designations are defined under “Experimental Procedures”).

Complexes were analyzed by Western blot. C, purified PP2A-B55α but not PP2A-B56γ2 holoenzymes interact with the spacer of p107.

However, these deletion forms of B55α poorly interacted with PP2A/C (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2) and PP2A/A (not shown). It has been recently reported that β-catenin, a substrate of B55α, also interacts with both domains (23Zhang W. Yang J. Liu Y. Chen X. Yu T. Jia J. Liu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22649-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results suggest that B55α substrates may make multiple contacts with the β-propeller structure. We also generated a series of point mutants targeting amino acids in the acidic top face of the β-propeller that have been previously found to be important for dephosphorylation of Tau by B55α (24Xu Y. Chen Y. Zhang P. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 873-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that only residue Asp-197 was essential for binding to p107 in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays from lysates of transfected cells with the indicated constructs. This residue was also clearly key for binding of B55α to PP2A/A and PP2A/C. Therefore, Asp-197 is critical for both formation of an holoenzyme and p107 recruitment. It also appeared that substitution of residue Lys-48 reduced binding to p107 despite efficient binding to PP2A/A and PP2A/C (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4B55α domains and residues required for binding to p107.

As we have shown that expression of SV40 st in exponentially growing U-2 OS cells delays dephosphorylation of pocket proteins when CDK activity is compromised (6Garriga J. Jayaraman A.L. Limón A. Jayadeva G. Sotillo E. Truongcao M. Patsialou A. Wadzinski B.E. Graña X. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it would be expected that st would prevent formation of trimeric PP2A complexes with p107. Therefore, U-2 OS cells were transfected with vectors encoding HA-tagged B55α, B56α, and PR70 subunits and subsequently transduced with recombinant adenoviruses expressing st or control β-galactosidase (Fig. 5A). Expression of st decreased the expression of B55α noticeably but not the expression of the other B subunits. GST-p107 specifically interacted with B55α and PR70 but not with B56α. Importantly, expression of st completely prevented the interaction of PP2A/A and PP2A/C with GST-p107 but not with the B subunits B55α and PR70. A similar experiment using cells transfected with HA-tagged B55α, B56γ1, and PR70 exhibited comparable results (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we did not detect an interaction between B56β and GST-p107 (data not shown). We next determined whether expression of st efficiently disrupted trimeric complexes by measuring dissociation of the PP2A/C subunit from HA-tagged B subunits in α-HA immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, st expression disrupted the interaction between PP2A/C and B55α or PR70 but not B56γ1 (Fig. 5C). Therefore, B55α and PR70 interact with p107 independently of the other subunits of the PP2A holoenzyme. Thus, disruption of B55α and/or PR70 PP2A holoenzymes by st could explain the effects of st in preventing dephosphorylation of pocket proteins when the activity of CDKs is compromised (6Garriga J.

Alternatively, p107 may be a modulator of PP2A function. To determine whether p107 is a specific substrate of the PP2A-B55α holoenzyme, p107 was phosphorylated in vitro with purified cyclin A-CDK2 complexes and [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently incubated with purified PP2A-B55α complexes in vitro. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Fig. 6A shows dose-dependent dephosphorylation of CDK phosphorylated p107. To determine whether the observed dephosphorylation is specific, we sought to compare the activity of PP2A-B55α and PP2A-B56γ2 toward phosphorylated p107. To this end, we first determined the amount of holoenzyme required to obtain similar dephosphorylation of histone H1, a substrate that can be dephosphorylated by both holoenzymes (data not shown). Fig. 6B shows that at comparable levels, PP2A-B55α, but not B56γ2, dephosphorylates p107. In contrast, both holoenzymes dephosphorylate histone H1. These results show that the B subunit of the holoenzyme is critical for recognition of p107 as a substrate in vitro.FIGURE 6Recombinant purified B55α trimeric PP2A complexes dephosphorylate phosphorylated p107 in vitro.

To determine whether this is the case, we determined the comparative effects of ectopically expressing various HA-tagged B subunits. Fig. 7A shows that expression of B55α at levels comparable with other B subunits results in a shift in the phosphorylation status of p107, suggesting its dephosphorylation. A less pronounced shift is also observed for p130, which appears only partially dephosphorylated. No relative changes in mobility were noticed when the other B subunits were expressed. A dose-dependent increase in B55α expression shows a clearer shift on p107 migration (Fig. 7B). If ectopic expression of B55α induces p107/p130 dephosphorylation, the levels of B55α that target p107 in the cell must be limiting. We also rationalized that if st disrupts these complexes, B55α-induced dephosphorylation would be prevented. As expected, expression of B55α leads to a clear shift on p107 mobility, which was prevented by expression of st. Indeed, st expression leads to potent hyperphosphorylation of p107, suggesting that intact st-sensitive PP2A holoenzymes are required to maintain the phosphorylation state that is typical from proliferating cells. Noticeable, but less pronounced, dephosphorylation of p130 was observed, and st expression led to a decrease in the expression of p130, which could conceivably result from SCFSKP2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the unstable hyperphosphorylated forms of p130 (25Tedesco D.

It resembles skeletal osteogenesis, and many bone cells as well as bone-related factors involved in both formation and resorption have been localized in calcified arteries. Previously, we showed that aortic medial cells undergo osteoblastic differentiation and matrix calcification both spontaneously and in response to PKA agonists. The PKA signaling pathway is also involved in regulating bone resorption in skeletal tissue by stimulating osteoblast-production of osteoclast regulating cytokines, including receptor-activator of nuclear κB ligand (RANKL) and interleukins. Therefore, we investigated whether PKA activators regulate osteoclastogenesis in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Treatment of murine SMC with the PKA agonist forskolin stimulated RANKL expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Forskolin also stimulated expression of interleukin-6 but not osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of RANKL. Consistent with these results, osteoclastic differentiation was induced when monocytic preosteoclasts (RAW264.7) were cocultured with forskolin-treated aortic SMC. Oxidized phospholipids also slightly induced RANKL expression in T lymphocytes, another potential source of RANKL in the vasculature. Because previous studies have shown that RANKL treatment alone induces matrix calcification of valvular and vascular cells, we next examined whether RANKL mediates forskolin-induced matrix calcification by aortic SMC. RANKL inhibition with OPG had little or no effect on osteoblastic differentiation and matrix calcification of aortic SMC. These findings suggest that, as in skeletal tissues, PKA activation induces bone resorptive factors in the vasculature and that aortic SMC calcification specifically induced by PKA, is not mediated by RANKL."
https://openalex.org/W2054221555,"The Pim-1 protein kinase plays an important role in regulating both cell growth and survival and enhancing transformation by multiple oncogenes. The ability of Pim-1 to regulate cell growth is mediated, in part, by the capacity of this protein kinase to control the levels of the p27, a protein that is a critical regulator of cyclin-dependent kinases that mediate cell cycle progression. To understand how Pim-1 is capable of regulating p27 protein levels, we focused our attention on the SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex that controls the rate of degradation of this protein. We found that expression of Pim-1 increases the level of Skp2 through direct binding and phosphorylation of multiple sites on this protein. Along with known Skp2 phosphorylation sites including Ser(64) and Ser(72), we have identified Thr(417) as a unique Pim-1 phosphorylation target. Phosphorylation of Thr(417) controls the stability of Skp2 and its ability to degrade p27. Additionally, we found that Pim-1 regulates the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C complex) that mediates the ubiquitination of Skp2. Pim-1 phosphorylates Cdh1 and impairs binding of this protein to another APC/C complex member, CDC27. These modifications inhibit Skp2 from degradation. Marked increases in Skp2 caused by these mechanisms lower cellular p27 levels. Consistent with these observations, we show that Pim-1 is able to cooperate with Skp2 to signal S phase entry. Our data reveal a novel Pim-1 kinase-dependent signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation."

We found that in vivo SPRET/Ei mice exhibit strongly reduced expression levels of cytokines and chemokines. To investigate the role of the potent anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the SPRET/Ei phenotype, mice were treated with the GR antagonist RU486 or bilateral adrenalectomy. Under such conditions, both C57BL/6 and SPRET/Ei mice were strongly sensitized to LPS, and the differences in LPS response between SPRET/Ei and C57BL/6 mice were completely gone. These results underscore the central role of GR in the LPS hyporesponsiveness of SPRET/Ei mice. Compared with C57BL/6, SPRET/Ei mice were found to express higher GR levels, which were reflected in increased GR transactivation. Using a backcross mapping strategy, we demonstrate that the high GR transcription levels are linked to the Nr3c1 (GR) locus on chromosome 18 itself. Unexpectedly, SPRET/Ei mice exhibit a basal overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, namely strongly increased corticosterone levels, ACTH levels, and adrenocortical size. As a consequence of the excess of circulating glucocorticoids (GCs), levels of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes are increased, and insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is impaired, both of which result in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in SPRET/Ei mice. We conclude that SPRET/Ei mice are unique as they display an unusual combination of elevated GR expression and increased endogenous GC levels. Hence, these mice provide a new and powerful tool for the study of GR- and GC-mediated mechanisms, including immune repressive functions, neuroendocrine regulation, insulin secretion, and carbohydrate metabolism.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which PPARγ agonists inhibit proinflammatory cytokine expression in rat glomerular mesangial cells. Both natural and synthetic PPARγ agonists potently inhibited RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression induced by TNF-α in mesangial cells, which was dependent on NF-κB signaling. However, PPARγ agonists had little effect on TNF-α-triggered IκBα phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation, p65 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. In the absence of PPARγ ligand, TNF-α induced a physical interaction between nuclear p65 and PPARγ, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Such an interaction was mediated by the C-terminal region of p65. Activation of PPARγ by its agonist prevented PPARγ·p65 complex formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that TNF-α induced p65 binding to the cis-acting κB elements in rat RANTES promoter, whereas disruption of PPARγ·p65 by its agonist blocked p65 interaction with its cognate κB sites. Knockdown of PPARγ via siRNA strategy completely abolished TNF-α-mediated p65 binding to κB sites and negated RANTES induction, suggesting that unliganded PPARγ is obligatory for NF-κB signaling. Consistently, overexpression of PPARγ in the absence of its ligand sensitized mesangial cells to TNF-α stimulation. These results uncover a paradoxical action of the unliganded and ligand-activated PPARγ in regulating NF-κB signaling and demonstrate PPARγ ligand as a molecular switch that controls its ability to modulate inflammatory responses in opposite directions.

In particular, it is known to become virulent at a post-exponential phase in vitro culture. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of differences in expression between the exponential phase and post-exponential phase to identify candidates associated with L. pneumophila virulence using 2-Dimentional Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization–Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Of 68 identified proteins that significantly differed in expression between the two growth phases, 64 were up-regulated at a post-exponential phase. The up-regulated proteins included enzymes related to glycolysis, ketone body biogenesis and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) biogenesis, suggesting that L. pneumophila may utilize sugars and lipids as energy sources, when amino acids become scarce. Proteins related to motility (flagella components and twitching motility-associated proteins) were also up-regulated, predicting that they enhance infectivity of the bacteria in host cells under certain conditions. Furthermore, 9 up-regulated proteins of unknown function were found. Two of them were identified as novel bacterial factors associated with hemolysis of sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Another 2 were found to be translocated into macrophages via the Icm/Dot type IV secretion apparatus as effector candidates in a reporter assay with Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase. The study will be helpful for virulent analysis of L. pneumophila from the viewpoint of physiological or metabolic modulation dependent on growth phase."

Although critical roles have been proposed for integrins in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function, little is known about the involvement of intracellular focal adhesion proteins in HSC functions. This study showed that the ability of c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> HSCs to support reconstitution of hematopoiesis after competitive transplantation was severely impaired by lentiviral transduction with short hairpin RNA sequences for vinculin. The potential of these HSCs to differentiate into granulocytic and monocytic lineages, to migrate toward stromal cell-derived factor 1α, and to home to the bone marrow <i>in vivo</i> were not inhibited by the loss of vinculin. However, the capacities to form long term culture-initiating cells and cobblestone-like areas were abolished in vinculin-silenced c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> HSCs. In contrast, adhesion to the extracellular matrix was inhibited by silencing of talin-1, but not of vinculin. Whole body <i>in vivo</i> luminescence analyses to detect transduced HSCs confirmed the role of vinculin in long term HSC reconstitution. Our results suggest that vinculin is an indispensable factor determining HSC repopulation capacity, independent of integrin functions."

Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Why is the catalytic domain of MMP-12 sufficient for high activity in cleaving protease-resistant fibrils such as elastin and collagen V? Addressing this question may lend insight into specificity of MMPs more generally and into strategies for selective and clinical recognition and inhibition.Past investigations of specificity focused on interactions of medicinal compounds with the S1′ specificity pocket (41Lovejoy B. Welch A.R. Carr S. Luong C. Broka C. Hendricks R.T. Campbell J.A. Walker K.A. Martin R. Van Wart H. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct.

MMP-12 and its close homologues of MMP-3, -8, and -13 possess similar S1′ specificity pockets (42Nar H. Werle K. Bauer M.M. Dollinger H. Jung B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The side chains of protein substrates are, however, too short to sample the depths of the S1′ pocket. Peptides from elastin were recently simulated to extend across the active site cleft of MMP-12 (44Bertini I. Fragai M. Luchinat C. Melikian M. Venturi C. Chemistry. 2009; 15: 7842-7845Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given the high conservation of the central active site cleft, what might imbue the MMP-12 catalytic domain with its specificities? Elastins and collagens should spill out of the cleft. Consistent with this, the triple helical peptidase activity of MMP-1, -8, and -12 involves the V–B loop preceding the active-site helix B (33Bhaskaran R. Palmier M.O. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B.

A triple helical peptide substrate derived from collagen V contacts not only this exosite but also appears to cover other sites in loops and atop the β-sheet even more remote from the active site cleft of MMP-12 (33Bhaskaran R. Palmier M.O. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. Van Doren S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21779-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).To probe subtle features that tune the specificities, we employed: (i) NMR to locate physical contacts between inactivated enzyme and mini-protein substrates, (ii) sequence positions that distinguish enzyme subfamilies, and (iii) subtle, targeted lesions on the surface that aim to impair only specific activities. This BINDSIght combination of experimental interface mapping with distinctiveness in sequence reliably identified less than obvious residues as conferring advantages to MMP-12 in specific activity for substrates from elastin and collagen fibrils, relative to MMP-3. The catalytic domain of MMP-3 is useful for comparison due to its relative lack of the specific activities, its 60% sequence identity with MMP-12, and sharing almost indistinguishable backbone structural coordinates (48Lang R. Kocourek A. Braun M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The BINDSIght approach builds on NMR evidence that 20-kDa species of solubilized elastin protect the surface of MMP-12 from its active-site cleft across flanking loops and a strip across the β-sheet to a broad surface on the most remote side of the catalytic domain. Point mutations of interfacial residues at positions on the periphery of the active site that distinguish MMP-12 from other subfamilies preserve a wild-type level of general MMP peptidase activity while diminishing the specific activities toward much bulkier elastin and collagen triple helical substrates. The evidences suggest that optimization of MMP-12 for digestion of solubilized elastin and some triple helices can involve the perimeter of the active site and at least one exosite.RESULTSThe questions of what surfaces of MMP-12 make it such a good elastase (15Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23824-23829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and type V triple helical peptidase (33Bhaskaran R. Palmier M.O. Lauer-Fields J.L.

Biochem. 2007; 371: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)4 and the BINDSIght approach for recognizing which among a plenitude of candidate residues contribute to the specificities. We decided that understanding the specificity without structures of the complexes requires (i) binding sites mapped accurately, (ii) finding distinguishing side chains at these interfaces, and (iii) functional testing of subtle mutations of these positions to be quantitative and efficient. The BINDSIght strategy incorporates these three values. First, we describe quantitative specific activities as benchmarks for comparison. Second, we report the mapping of crucial sites of contact between MMP-12 and fragments of solubilized α-elastin using NMR. We proceed to consider residues that distinguish MMP subfamilies. We combine this with the experimental interface mapping to anticipate the strongest candidates for tuning specific activities. Finally, the importance of these residues to specificity is quantified from perturbations of mild mutations.High Activities of MMP-12 toward Substrates from Fibrils from Extracellular MatrixWe surveyed the steady-state kinetics parameters of elastolysis, triple helical peptidase, and linear peptidase activities of human MMP-12 and MMP-3 catalytic domains.Soluble α-elastin (from complete solubilization of bovine neck elastin using 0.25 m oxalic acid) (17Partridge S.M. Davis H.F. Adair G.S. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) has been a favorite substrate for elastolysis due to its sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility (68Keller S. Mandl I. Biochem. Med. 1971; 5: 342-347Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), retention of physiological cross-linking (17Partridge S.M. Davis H.F. Adair G.S. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and ability to form fibrils at 37 °C that resemble elastin (26Cox B.A. Starcher B.C. Urry D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 317: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). α-Elastin is polydisperse and averages 17 cross-linked chains with a mass of 60–84 kDa (among species up to 130 kDa) (17Partridge S.M. Davis H.F. Adair G.S. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We used gel filtration to isolate fractions from the α-elastin mixture appearing to migrate around 125 and 20 kDa by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1a), for use in proteolytic enzyme kinetics and NMR interface mapping, respectively. Radioimmunoassay (52Starcher B. Conrad M. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1995; 31: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) detected 46.5 and 48.3 nmol of desmosine per milligram of each fraction of α-elastin. This corresponds to 2.4% and 2.3% (w/w) desmosine, respectively, a heavy degree of cross-linking similar to reports of 1.9% (w/w) desmosine for solubilized bovine neck elastin (54Mecham R.P. Lange G. Connect. Tiss. Res. 1980; 7: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and 1.5% for insoluble bovine elastin (69Starcher B.C. Galione M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Variability in the amount of cross-linking is suggested by pI values of the larger fraction ranging from 4 to 7 with most species having pI from 4.7 to 5.7.4 The two fractions were mixtures of masses peaking at ∼100 and 17.8 kDa, respectively, in MALDI-TOF mass spectra (supplemental Fig. S1, c and d).We conjugated a sample of α-elastin with BO-DIPY FL, isolated gel-filtration fractions of these masses from the reaction mixture, and designated them fEln-100 and fEln-20 (referring to approximate mass). The labeling is heavy enough for self-quenching. Proteolysis of the cross-linked chains releases fluors and fluorescence quenching to support FRET assays (supplemental Figs. S1b and S2) for quantitative comparisons of apparent kcat and Km of soluble elastin hydrolysis by MMP-12 variants. Addition of MMP-12 initially and temporarily quenches fluorescence emission (supplemental Fig. S1b), suggesting that it might draw α-elastin species together. fEln-100 and fEln-20 are subsequently hydrolyzed with by far the slowest apparent turnover numbers kcat that we have observed among substrates of MMPs (supplemental Fig. S2, a and b, and Table 1). This is compensated by their high apparent affinities (lowest apparent Km values of 1.0 μm), relative to other substrates. MMP-12 digests them with apparent second order rate constants kcat/Km of around 10,000 m−1 s−1 for fELN-100 (Table 1) and 1,500 m−1 s−1 for fEln-20 fragments. MMP-3 catalytic domain has 12-fold lower kcat/Km of 830 m−1 s−1 toward fELN-100, which is mainly a consequence of its 13.5-fold lower kcat (Table 1). Km values for small linear peptide substrates, such as soluble Knight's substrate (FS-6) (70Neumann U. Kubota H. Frei K. Ganu V. Leppert D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 328: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), are two orders of magnitude weaker (Table 1). MMP-12 is highly active upon a triple helical peptide from type V collagen (α1(V) 436–447 fTHP (49Bhaskaran R. Palmier M.O. Bagegni N.A. Liang X. Van Doren S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), whereas MMP-3 and other MMPs except MMP-2 and -9 are inactive toward this substrate (34Lauer-Fields J.L. Sritharan T. Stack M.S. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18140-18145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Table 1). MMP-12 also exhibits 265-fold greater catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward DQ-collagen IV compared with MMP-3 (supplemental Fig. S3a and Table 1). Thus, homologous MMP-3 catalytic domain can serve as a “negative” control in comparison with MMP-12.TABLE 1Catalytic properties of MMP-12 variants (25 °C, pH 7.5) for substrates from α-elastin and collagens IV and VMMP-12 variantGeneral substrate FS-6fELN-100α1(V) 436–447 fTHPDQ-Col IVkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kmm−1 s−1s−1μmm−1 s−1s−1μmm−1 s−1s−1μmm−1 s−1Controls MMP-12aWT figures are an average of numerous repetitions.133,800bFrom Liang et al.

https://openalex.org/W2033974065,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane cholesterol is maintained at an optimal concentration of ∼5 mol % by the net impact of sterol synthesis, modification, and export. Arv1p was first identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a key component of this homeostasis due to its probable role in intracellular sterol transport. Mammalian ARV1, which can fully complement the yeast lesion, encodes a ubiquitously expressed, resident ER protein. Repeated dosing of specific antisense oligonucleotides to ARV1 produced a marked reduction of ARV1 transcripts in liver, adipose, and to a lesser extent, intestine. This resulted in marked hypercholesterolemia, elevated serum bile acids, and activation of the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulatory pathway. Knockdown of ARV1 in murine liver and HepG2 cells was associated with accumulation of cholesterol in the ER at the expense of the plasma membrane and suppression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and their targets. These studies indicate a critical role of mammalian Arv1p in sterol movement from the ER and in the ensuing regulation of hepatic cholesterol and bile acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1966442973,"The canonical heptahelical bundle architecture of seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors is intertwined by three intra- and three extracellular loops, whose local conformations are important in receptor signaling. Many 7TM receptors contain a cysteine residue in the third extracellular loop (EC3) and a complementary cysteine residue on the N terminus. The functional role of such EC3-N terminus conserved cysteine pairs remains unclear. This study explores the role of the EC3-N terminus cysteine pairs on receptor conformation and G protein activation by disrupting them in the chemokine receptor CXCR4, while engineering a novel EC3-N terminus cysteine pair into the complement factor 5a receptor (C5aR), a chemo attractant receptor that lacks it. Mutated CXCR4 and C5aRs were expressed in engineered yeast. Mutation of the cysteine pair with the serine pair (C28S/C274S) in constitutively active mutant CXCR4 abrogated the receptor activation, whereas mutation with the aromatic pair (C28F-C274F) or the salt bridge pair (C28R/C274E), respectively, rescued or retained the receptor activation in response to CXCL12. In this context, the cysteine pair (Cys(30) and Cys(272)) engineered into the EC3-N terminus (Ser(30) and Ser(272)) of a novel constitutively active mutant of C5aR restrained the constitutive signaling without affecting the C5a-induced activation. Further mutational studies demonstrated a previously unappreciated role for Ser(272) on EC3 of C5aR and its interaction with the N terminus, thus defining a new microswitch region within the C5aR. Similar results were obtained with mutated CXCR4 and C5aRs expressed in COS-7 cells. These studies demonstrate a novel role of the EC3-N terminus cysteine pairs in G protein-coupled receptor activation and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2042056147,"Protein sequences encode both structure and foldability. Whereas the interrelationship of sequence and structure has been extensively investigated, the origins of folding efficiency are enigmatic. We demonstrate that the folding of proinsulin requires a flexible N-terminal hydrophobic residue that is dispensable for the structure, activity, and stability of the mature hormone. This residue (Phe(B1) in placental mammals) is variably positioned within crystal structures and exhibits (1)H NMR motional narrowing in solution. Despite such flexibility, its deletion impaired insulin chain combination and led in cell culture to formation of non-native disulfide isomers with impaired secretion of the variant proinsulin. Cellular folding and secretion were maintained by hydrophobic substitutions at B1 but markedly perturbed by polar or charged side chains. We propose that, during folding, a hydrophobic side chain at B1 anchors transient long-range interactions by a flexible N-terminal arm (residues B1-B8) to mediate kinetic or thermodynamic partitioning among disulfide intermediates. Evidence for the overall contribution of the arm to folding was obtained by alanine scanning mutagenesis. Together, our findings demonstrate that efficient folding of proinsulin requires N-terminal sequences that are dispensable in the native state. Such arm-dependent folding can be abrogated by mutations associated with β-cell dysfunction and neonatal diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2126450877,"A delay is evident between the development of new policies on TB diagnostics and their implementation at country level. The Stop TB Partnership would benefit from information from national TB program (NTP) managers on progress towards implementation of new recommendations as well as the opportunities and challenges encountered in the process.To solicit information on the introduction of new TB diagnostics at country level, questionnaires were sent out to NTP managers of high-burden TB countries and a subset of managers was interviewed. The results indicate that about 50% of high-burden TB countries are using the TB diagnostic tools newly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Most NTP managers reported that new diagnostics would only be implemented when officially endorsed by the WHO. All countries have plans to adopt newly endorsed diagnostics at reference laboratory level, while approaches to optimize smear microscopy at lower levels of the health service are given less attention. NTP managers reported diverse challenges to the implementation of new diagnostics.More information on the obstacles and advantages of introducing new diagnostic tools should be provided to NTP managers to ensure the rational adoption of new diagnostics. A single recommendation covering the introduction of a package of diagnostic tools might be preferable to NTP managers and facilitate implementation in high-burden TB countries."
https://openalex.org/W2016644856,"The presence of autoantibodies in New Zealand Black (NZB) mice suggests a B cell tolerance defect however the nature of this defect is unknown. To determine whether defects in B cell anergy contribute to the autoimmune phenotype in NZB mice, soluble hen egg lysozyme (sHEL) and anti-HEL Ig transgenes were bred onto the NZB background to generate double transgenic (dTg) mice. NZB dTg mice had elevated levels of anti-HEL antibodies, despite apparently normal B cell functional anergy in-vitro. NZB dTg B cells also demonstrated increased survival and abnormal entry into the follicular compartment following transfer into sHEL mice. Since this process is dependent on BAFF, BAFF serum and mRNA levels were assessed and were found to be significantly elevated in NZB dTg mice. Treatment of NZB sHEL recipient mice with TACI-Ig reduced NZB dTg B cell survival following adoptive transfer, confirming the role of BAFF in this process. Although NZB mice had modestly elevated BAFF, the enhanced NZB B cell survival response appeared to result from an altered response to BAFF. In contrast, T cell blockade had a minimal effect on B cell survival, but inhibited anti-HEL antibody production. The findings suggest that the modest BAFF elevations in NZB mice are sufficient to perturb B cell tolerance, particularly when acting in concert with B cell functional abnormalities and T cell help."
https://openalex.org/W2061770641,"BCR-ABL is a causative tyrosine kinase (TK) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In CML patients, although myeloid cells are remarkably proliferating, erythroid cells are rather decreased and anemia is commonly observed. This phenotype is quite different from that observed in polycythemia vera (PV) caused by JAK2 V617F, whereas both oncogenic TKs activate common downstream molecules at the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To clarify this mechanism, we investigated the effects of BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F on erythropoiesis. Enforced expression of BCR-ABL but not of JAK2 V617F in murine LSK (Lineage−Sca-1hiCD117hi) cells inhibited the development of erythroid cells. Among several signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, an active mutant of N-Ras (N-RasE12) but not of STAT5 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibited erythropoiesis, while N-RasE12 enhanced the development of myeloid cells. BCR-ABL activated Ras signal more intensely than JAK2 V617F, and inhibition of Ras by manumycin A, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, ameliorated erythroid colony formation of CML cells. As for the mechanisms of Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis, we found that GATA-1, an erythroid-specific transcription factor, blocked Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling at the level of MEK through the direct interaction. Furthermore, enforced expression of N-RasE12 in LSK cells derived from p53-, p16INK4a/p19ARF-, and p21CIP1/WAF1-null/wild-type mice revealed that suppressed erythroid cell growth by N-RasE12 was restored only by p21CIP1/WAF1 deficiency, indicating that a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21CIP1/WAF1, plays crucial roles in Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis. These data would, at least partly, explain why respective oncogenic TKs cause different disease phenotypes. BCR-ABL is a causative tyrosine kinase (TK) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In CML patients, although myeloid cells are remarkably proliferating, erythroid cells are rather decreased and anemia is commonly observed.

To clarify this mechanism, we investigated the effects of BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F on erythropoiesis. Enforced expression of BCR-ABL but not of JAK2 V617F in murine LSK (Lineage−Sca-1hiCD117hi) cells inhibited the development of erythroid cells. Among several signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, an active mutant of N-Ras (N-RasE12) but not of STAT5 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibited erythropoiesis, while N-RasE12 enhanced the development of myeloid cells. BCR-ABL activated Ras signal more intensely than JAK2 V617F, and inhibition of Ras by manumycin A, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, ameliorated erythroid colony formation of CML cells. As for the mechanisms of Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis, we found that GATA-1, an erythroid-specific transcription factor, blocked Ras-mediated mitogenic signaling at the level of MEK through the direct interaction. Furthermore, enforced expression of N-RasE12 in LSK cells derived from p53-, p16INK4a/p19ARF-, and p21CIP1/WAF1-null/wild-type mice revealed that suppressed erythroid cell growth by N-RasE12 was restored only by p21CIP1/WAF1 deficiency, indicating that a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21CIP1/WAF1, plays crucial roles in Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis. These data would, at least partly, explain why respective oncogenic TKs cause different disease phenotypes.

Although these oncogenic TKs activate common downstream pathways including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3-K/Akt, and STAT (1Quintás-Cardama A. Cortes J.

Gilliland D.G. Blood. 2008; 112: 2190-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In patients with chronic-phase CML, anemia is a common feature in contrast to the marked leukocytosis in the peripheral blood. Also, bone marrow (BM) examination shows that erythroid islands are reduced in number and size despite the increased cellularity due to the granulocytic proliferation (6Thiele J. Kvasnicka H.M. Schmitt-Graeff A. Zirbes T.K. Birnbaum F. Kressmann C. Melguizo-Grahmann M. Frackenpohl H. Sprungmann C. Leder L.D. Diehl V. Zankovich R. Schaefer H.E. Niederle N. Fischer R. Leuk.

This disease phenotype is totally different from that of PV, in which JAK2 V617F causes erythrocytosis together with the mild leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Furthermore, in blast-phase CML, blast lineages are generally myeloid or lymphoid, and erythroid crisis is a rare incidence with a frequency no more than 5% (7Saikia T. Advani S. Dasgupta A.

BCR-ABL activates several downstream pathways including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, STAT5, and PI3-K/Akt pathways (1Quintás-Cardama A. Cortes J. Blood. 2009; 113: 1619-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 4Ren R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Among them, we have previously shown that Ras plays crucial roles in the growth and survival of BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells, while STAT5 and PI3-K pathways contribute to their growth and survival to the only limited extent (9Sonoyama J. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Zhang X. Kataoka Y. Takai E. Mizuki M. Machii T. Wakao H. Kanakura Y. J. Biol.

In addition, although the role of STAT5 in BCR-ABL-mediated leukemogenesis remains controversial (10Sexl V. Piekorz R. Moriggl R. Rohrer J. Brown M.P. Bunting K.D. Rothammer K. Roussel M.F. Ihle J.N.

Blood. 2006; 107: 4898-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), another group also reported that transformation of murine BM cells by BCR-ABL is blocked by dominant-negative Ras (12Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Witte O.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ras signaling was shown to be indispensable for the pathogenesis of CML in a murine BM transplantation model (13Baum K.J. Ren R. J. Hematol. Oncol. 2008; 1: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activated Ras is considered to be essential for the pathogenesis of CML, and is also speculated to principally determine the disease phenotype of CML, that is, prominent proliferation of myeloid cells accompanied by the suppressed erythropoiesis. Ras is constitutively activated by various oncogenic TKs or mutations of Ras itself in various malignant tumors. Although oncogenic (or constitutively activated) Ras was originally shown to transmit mitogenic and survival signals through Raf/MEK/ERK (14Platanias L.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 4667-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), recent studies have demonstrated that, like other oncogenic stimuli, it also induces growth inhibition/arrest in normal cells to prevent their malignant transformation. In general, this biological phenomenon is called “cellular senescence” and observed in various types of non-hematopoietic cells (15Campisi J. Cell. 2005; 120: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 16Braig M. Schmitt C.A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2881-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, excessive Ras signaling was reported to inhibit erythropoiesis (17Darley R.L. Hoy T.G. Baines P. Padua R.A. Burnett A.K. J. Exp.

Blood. 2002; 100: 4185-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of a similar cellular response in hematopoietic cells. So far, oncogenic Ras has been shown to cause senescence through several signaling pathways other than Raf/MEK/ERK (15Campisi J.

In this report, we found that BCR-ABL but not JAK2 V617F, and among their downstream molecules, Ras but not STAT5 or PI3-K suppress erythropoiesis from murine LSK cells. As for this mechanism, we found that an erythroid-lineage specific transcription factor, GATA-1, blocks Ras-dependent growth and survival by inhibiting MEK1 activity through the direct interaction. Furthermore, we showed that a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21CIP1/WAF1, plays crucial roles in Ras-induced suppression of erythropoiesis using p21CIP1/WAF1-deficient hematopoietic cells.

A murine IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, was maintained in RPMI (nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, TX) and 0.3 ng/ml rmIL-3. NIH3T3 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; nacalai tesque) supplemented with 10% FBS. We introduced G1ERT into Ba/F3 cells by electroporation (250 V and 950 microfarads) and selected stably transfected clones by the culture with G-418 (1.0 mg/ml; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). We further introduced pMYs-IRES-EGFP-N-RasE12 and obtained doubly transfected clones by sorting GFP-positive cells with BD FACSAria Cell-Sorting System (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Their IL-3-independent growth and cell cycle were analyzed with or without the activation of GATA-1 by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT; Sigma-Aldrich).

The experimental designs of this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. Murine BM cells were flushed from both femora and tibiae, and progenitors were concentrated by anti-mouse CD117 MicroBeads and autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). To isolate LSK (Lineage−Sca-1hiCD117hi) cells, selected progenitors were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated (PE-conjugated) monoclonal Abs against murine lineage markers (CD3e (145–2C11), CD45R/B220 (RA3–6B2), Gr-1 (RB6–8C5), CD11b (M1/70), and TER-119 (TER-119)), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC-conjugated) anti-Sca-1 Ab (E13–161.7), and allophycocyanin-conjugated (APC-conjugated) anti-CD117 Ab (2B8), and isolated by FACSAria. All Abs were purchased from BD Biosciences. Preparation of retrovirus particles was performed as described previously (29Fukushima K. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Tokunaga M. Yasumi M. Satoh Y. Shibayama H.

Isolated LSK cells were precultured overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, rmSCF (100 ng/ml), and rhTPO (100 ng/ml). Then, the cells were seeded on 24-well tissue plates coated with RetroNectin (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan), infected with each viral supernatant by spinoculation, and cultured in the same medium containing 10% FBS, protamine sulfate (10 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), rmSCF (50 ng/ml), and rhTPO (50 ng/ml). After 48 h of culture, retrovirus-transduced GFP+ cells were sorted with FACSAria and were subjected to colony assays or stromal coculture. Cells were plated at the indicated density in methylcellulose medium (MethoCult; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) supplemented with the indicated growth factors. Cells were incubated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and the numbers of colonies were counted after the indicated days. A murine BM stromal cell line, MS-5, was cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) α (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% FBS and prepared in 24-well tissue plates 1 day before the seeding. The sorted GFP+ progenitors were seeded (1.5 × 103 cells/well) on the monolayer of MS-5 and cocultured in 2 ml of MEMα supplemented with 10% FBS, rmSCF (50 ng/ml), and rhEPO (3 units/ml). Five days after the initiation of coculture, hematopoietic cells were harvested and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD45 (30-F11) Ab, and APC-conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70) or anti-TER-119 (TER-119) Ab (all of them from BD Biosciences). To evaluate the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, we used BD Phosflow technology (BD Biosciences). The harvested cells were further incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS without cytokines for 4 h, then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa Fluor®647-conjugated anti-ERK1/2 (pT202/pY204) Ab (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Flow cytometric analyses were performed using BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). The data analyses were done with BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR). 5 × 104 of the transduced cells were cytospun onto microscope slides, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. After the incubation in blocking buffer (1 mg/ml of γ-globulin in PBS), the slides were incubated with a monoclonal Ab against p16INK4a (F-12) or p19ARF (5-C3–1) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The slides were then incubated with an Alexa Fluor®546-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG for p16INK4a, or goat anti-rat IgG for p19ARF), followed by the staining of nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (all from Invitrogen). The slides were mounted in Fluoromount (Diagnostic BioSystems, Pleasanton, CA) before viewing on a LSM 5 PASCAL microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 103 of the transduced cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and converted to cDNA by SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using Ampli Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with primers described in supplemental Table S1. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). Amplified signals were normalized to the levels of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). The primer sequences are described in supplemental Table S1. BM samples were obtained from three patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. CD34+ cells were separated using the MACS immunomagnetic separation system, and were subjected to colony assays. All BM samples were obtained after receiving written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and this study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Osaka University Hospital. Statistical analyses were carried out by standard Student t tests. Error bars used throughout indicate S.D. To examine the effects of BCR-ABL on erythropoiesis, we first introduced p210-BCR-ABL into murine LSK cells using the retrovirus vector harboring GFP as a reporter gene. After 48 h, GFP+ cells were sorted and cocultured with a murine BM stromal cell line, MS-5, in the presence of rmSCF and rhEPO for 5 days. As compared with mock-transduced cells, the proportion of CD45lowTER-119+ erythroid cells was reduced in BCR-ABL-transduced cells significantly (Fig. 1A). We also examined the effects of JAK2 V617F on erythropoiesis with the same strategy and found that JAK2 V617F did not reduce the proportion of erythoroid cells. In colony assays, BCR-ABL significantly decreased the number of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), while it increased the number of myeloid colonies (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, JAK2 V617F did not reduce the number of BFU-E. These data indicate that BCR-ABL but not JAK2 V617F inhibits the development of erythroid cells from murine hematopoietic progenitors. BCR-ABL activates mainly Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, JAK2/STAT5, and PI3-K/Akt pathways. Next, to examine the roles of these pathways in erythropoiesis, we transduced LSK cells with an active form of each signal transduction molecule: N-RasE12 for an active form of N-Ras, 1*6 STAT5A for STAT5, and p110CAAX for PI3-K. Compared with Mock, 1*6 STAT5A and p110CAAX increased total erythroid cell numbers by 2.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively (both, p < 0.05), while the proportion of erythroid cells was scarcely influenced by both molecules due to the increase in total cell numbers (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, N-RasE12 remarkably reduced not only the frequency (Fig. 2A) but also the number of erythroid cells (0.28-fold) (Fig. 2B), while it significantly increased the number of CD11b+-myeloid cells (Fig. 2C). We also performed colony assays using N-RasE12- or Mock-transduced LSK cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, N-RasE12 significantly reduced the number of BFU-E (average colony numbers from 1.0 × 103 cells input: Mock-transduced cells, 9.7; N-Ras-transduced cells, 0.33) (p < 0.01). Next, we tried to clarify why JAK2 V617F did not suppress erythropoiesis, because it has been reported to activate Ras as well as BCR-ABL (5Zeuner A. Pedini F. Signore M. Ruscio G. Messina C. Tafuri A. Girelli G. Peschle C. De Maria R. Blood. 2006; 107: 3495-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we introduced JAK2 V617F and BCR-ABL into murine LSK cells, cocultured them with MS-5, and evaluated the Ras activity by expediently measuring the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 after 4-h starvation of cytokines. As shown in Fig. 2E, ERK1/2 was more intensely phosphorylated (activated) in cells transduced with BCR-ABL than in those with JAK2 V617F. We also examined the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 in CML patients' blood cells treated with manumycin A, a potent farnesyltransferase inhibitor which selectively suppresses Ras, or vehicle only. As shown in Fig. 2F, phosphorylation of ERK was reduced by Ras inhibition, indicating that BCR-ABL activates ERK through the activation of Ras. These data indicate that different growth status of erythroid cells between these TKs might result from the preferential activation of Ras signal by BCR-ABL. Furthermore, to make sure that suppressed erythropoiesis caused by BCR-ABL is due to the activation of Ras signal, we examined the effects of Ras-inhibition on erythroid colony formation of BCR-ABL expressing cells. CD34+ cells were separated from BM samples of three patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. They were then cultured in methylcellulose medium containing rhSCF, rhIL-3, and rhEPO, with or without manumycin A. Complete blockage of Ras signal by supplement of sufficient dose (10 μm) of manumycin A eradicated erythroid colony formation (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 2G, the number of erythroid colonies was restored by low doses of manumycin A in all three patients, though there was some difference in degree. This result, actually in primary CML cells, supports our model that, although Ras is indispensable for erythroid cell survival, excessive Ras signal downstream of BCR-ABL rather inhibits erythroid cell proliferation. As described above, oncogenic Ras signaling promoted the proliferation of myeloid cells, but inhibited that of erythroid cells. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the different responses to oncogenic Ras between the two lineages, we examined the effects of GATA-1, which is expressed in erythroid cells but not in myeloid cells, on Ras signal. For this purpose, we transduced N-RasE12 and G1ERT, a chimera gene consisting of full-length GATA-1 and the mutated ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor, into Ba/F3 cells, which was named Ba/F3/N-RasE12/G1ERT. G1ERT reveals GATA-1 activity in response to 4-HT as previously reported (22Ezoe S. Matsumura I. Gale K. Satoh Y. Ishikawa J. Mizuki M. Takahashi S. Minegishi N. Nakajima K. Yamamoto M. Enver T. Kanakura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13163-13170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, N-RasE12 enabled this clone to proliferate and survive independently of IL-3. However, when GATA-1 activity was induced by 4-HT treatment, N-RasE12-dependent cell growth was completely suppressed (Fig. 3A). In agreement with this result, the proportion of growing cells in S-G2/M phase was reduced by 4-HT treatment from 36% to 8% in DNA contents analysis (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, 4-HT treatment induced apoptosis in 78% of cells, which was detected as a subdiploid fraction. From these results, we speculated that GATA-1 might inhibit oncogenic Ras activities, which transmit proliferation and survival signals. Ras signal is known to be transmitted to the nucleus through Raf, MEK, and ERK in this order. To identify which molecule was inhibited by GATA-1 in this pathway, we performed luciferase assays using a reporter gene for ERK (3 × AP-1-Luc) in NIH3T3 and Ba/F3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, GATA-1 significantly reduced the N-Ras- and MEK1-induced AP-1-luciferase activities almost to the baseline levels (white boxes), which indicates that GATA-1 inhibits Ras signal at the level or downstream of MEK. Next, we examined the phosphorylation status of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in Ba/F3/N-RasE12/G1ERT cells by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4C, both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were phosphorylated by N-RasE12 even under the culture without IL-3, which was suppressed by 4-HT in a time-dependent manner. This result implies that GATA-1 suppresses Ras signal at the level or upstream of MEK. Together with the results from luciferase assays, it was speculated that GATA-1 would inhibit MEK activity. To clarify how GATA-1 inhibits MEK activities, we examined the interaction between GATA-1 and MEK1. First, we transfected 293T cells with hemagglutinin-tagged (HA-tagged) GATA-1 and/or Flag-tagged MEK1. Total cellular lysates were prepared after 36 h, and GATA-1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA Ab and MEK1 with the anti-Flag Ab. As shown in Fig. 4D, immunoblotting with the anti-Flag Ab showed that MEK1 was coimmunoprecipitated with GATA-1 only when both molecules were cotransduced. Also, immunoblo"
https://openalex.org/W2066266078,"CRTR-1 is a member of the CP2 family of transcription factors. Unlike other members of the family which are widely expressed, CRTR-1 expression shows specific spatio-temporal regulation. Gene targeting demonstrates that CRTR-1 plays a central role in the maturation and function of the salivary glands and the kidney. CRTR-1 has also recently been identified as a component of the complex transcriptional network that maintains pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. CRTR-1 was previously shown to be a repressor of transcription. We examine the activity of CRTR-1 in ES and other cells and show that CRTR-1 is generally an activator of transcription and that it modulates the activity of other family members, CP2, NF2d9 and altNF2d9, in a cell specific manner. We also demonstrate that CRTR-1 activity is regulated by sumoylation at a single major site, residue K30. These findings imply that functional redundancy with other family members may mask important roles for CRTR-1 in other tissues, including the blastocyst stage embryo and embryonic stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2090276814,"The E2 polyubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 is a mediator of innate immune reactions. Ubc13 mediates the conjugation of keratin (K)63-linked polyubiquitin chains onto TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and IKKγ during NF-κB activation. In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. Although Ubc13 has been shown to be critical for Toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-1 receptor signaling, the function of Ubc13 in the epidermis has not been studied. We generated keratinocyte-specific Ubc13-deficient mice (Ubc13(flox/flox)K5-Cre). At birth, the skin of the Ubc13(flox/flox)K5-Cre mice was abnormally shiny and smooth; in addition, the mice did not grow and died by postnatal day 2. Histological analysis showed atrophy of the epidermis with keratinocyte apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed reduced proliferation, abnormal differentiation, and apoptosis of keratinocytes in the Ubc13(flox/flox)K5-Cre mouse epidermis. In culture, Ubc13(flox/flox)K5-Cre keratinocyte growth was impaired, and spontaneous cell death occurred. Moreover, the deletion of Ubc13 from cultured Ubc13(flox/flox) keratinocytes by means of an adenoviral vector carrying Cre recombinase also resulted in spontaneous cell death. Therefore, Ubc13 is essential for keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and survival. Analyses of intracellular signaling revealed that the IL-1 and TNF-induced activation of JNK, p38, and NF-κB pathways was impaired in Ubc13(flox/flox)K5-Cre keratinocytes. In conclusion, Ubc13 appears to be essential for epidermal integrity in mice."

Although TG1 mutation is an underlying cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, a debilitating skin disease, the pathogenic mechanism is not completely understood. In the present study we show that TG1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated protein that is trafficked through the ER for ultimate delivery to the plasma membrane. Mutation severely attenuates this processing and a catalytically inactive point mutant, TG1-FLAG(C377A), accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and in aggresome-like structures where it is ubiquitinylated. This accumulation results from protein misfolding, as treatment with a chemical chaperone permits it to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and travel to the plasma membrane. ER accumulation is also observed for ichthyosis-associated TG1 mutants. Our findings suggest that misfolding of TG1 mutants leads to ubiquitinylation and accumulation in the ER and aggresomes, and that abnormal intracellular processing of TG1 mutants may be an underlying cause of ichthyosis.

The cornified envelope is an essential component of the epidermal barrier. Indeed a key role for TG1 in barrier assembly is indicated by impaired barrier function in Tgm1 knock-out mice (21Kuramoto N. Takizawa T. Takizawa T. Matsuki M. Morioka H. Robinson J.M. Yamanishi K.

TG1 mutations are present in 50% of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis patients. Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis is a debilitating skin disease characterized by scaly epidermis and reduced barrier function. Over 90 different mutations of the Tgm1 gene have been identified in these patients (22Farasat S. Wei M.H. Herman M. Liewehr D.J. Steinberg S.M. Bale S.J. Fleckman P. Toro J.R. J. Med.

Many of these mutations are deletion or point mutations within the catalytic domain, but disease-associated mutations are also located in other segments of the TG1 protein that do not include residues that are directly required for activity (22Farasat S.

We know little about how TG1 is trafficked within cells and the impact of disease-associated mutation on these processes. In the present report we study TG1 trafficking and the impact of TG1 mutation on this process and on cell phenotype. Our studies indicate that TG1 is trafficked and processed in the ER and then delivered to the plasma membrane. In contrast, ichthyosis-associated TG1 mutants accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and are ubiquitinylated and also shuttled to aggresomes. We propose that inappropriate accumulation of mutant TG1 in intracellular organelles is a potential underlying cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis.

For immunofluorescence, keratinocytes, grown on coverslips, were infected with adenoviruses, or transfected with plasmids, and at 24, 48, or 72 h post-treatment the cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, and methanol permeabilized for 10 min at −20 °C. The coverslips were then incubated for 1 h each with the appropriate antibodies. After washing, the samples were affixed to slides using Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal, or an Olympus OX81 spinning-disc confocal microscope. For immunoprecipitation, total cell extract (150 μg of protein), prepared in lysis buffer, was pre-cleared by addition of 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 25 °C. The lysate was then combined with 50 μl of lysis buffer-equilibrated anti-FLAG-agarose and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The anti-FLAG-agarose was then washed thoroughly with lysis buffer, boiled, and the entire lysate was loaded on a polyacrylamide gel followed by detection of co-precipitated proteins by immunoblot.

Brefeldin A was obtained from Sigma (B5936). Nocodazole was purchased from Calbiochem (486928). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were collected on ice and extracted for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture, and passed 30 times through a 27.5-gauge needle. The resulting extract was centrifuged at 1,000 × g three times. The final supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield microsomes and cytosol. An equal number of cell equivalents of the cytosol and microsome fraction were boiled and electrophoresed for immunoblot. For microsome extraction experiments, identical aliquots of microsome suspension were divided into four tubes and individual tubes were incubated for 30 min on ice with a final concentration of 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11), or 1% Triton X-100. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and the soluble and insoluble fractions were dissolved at 37 °C by addition of SDS to a final concentration of 4%. For proteinase K challenge assay, microsomes were resuspended in protease inhibitor mixture-free lysis buffer. Individual identical aliquots were incubated with 100 μg/ml of Proteinase K with or without 1% of Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to the resulting fractions prior to immunoblot. Keratinocytes were infected with appropriate adenovirus and at 48 h fixed in 0.1 m PIPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were harvested by gentle scraping, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and embedded in 2.5% low melting temperature agarose. Agarose blocks were trimmed to 1 mm3, washed, and dehydrated by progressively lowering the temperature from 4 to −20 °C and increasing the ethanol concentration. The blocks were infiltrated and embedded in unicryl at −20 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Leica UltraE microtome (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) and collected on formvar-coated nickel grids. For immunogold labeling, grids were placed section-side down on a drop of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA, 1% fish gelatin, 0.01 m glycine (blocking solution) for 10 min, and then transferred onto a 10-μl droplet of primary antibody (Santa Cruz, sc25786) diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The grids were washed five times in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 1% fish gelatin. Antibody binding was visualized using 10-nm gold particle-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (British Biocell International) diluted in blocking solution and incubated and washed as for the primary antibody. Grids were then fixed for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% glutaraldehyde, washed with water, and air dried. Samples were visualized using a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV, and images were acquired using an AMT digital camera.

Thus, to study TG1 intracellular function we delivered TG1 using a tetracycline-regulated adenovirus, tAd5-TG1-FLAG, that permits expression of full-length TG1-FLAG. Fig. 1A shows that the expressed TG1-FLAG and endogenous TG1 localize to the plasma membrane (arrows), which is consistent with previous observations (39Steinert P.M. Kim S.Y. Chung S.I. Marekov L.N.

This association is confirmed by the observation that TG1-FLAG is present in the particulate (membrane) fraction (Fig. 1B). A requirement for these experiments is expression of TG1-FLAG at physiological levels. To demonstrate this, we compared the TG1 level in tAd5-EV and tAd5-TG1-FLAG virus-infected monolayer keratinocytes with the endogenous TG1 level in stratified keratinocyte cultures grown at the air-liquid interface. Air-liquid interface cultures mimic in vivo keratinocyte differentiation (41Poumay Y. Dupont F. Marcoux S. Leclercq-Smekens M. Hérin M. Coquette A. Arch. Dermatol.

Chung S.I. Kim S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that TG1 levels increase more than 100-fold upon keratinocyte differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1C, the TG1 level in tAd5-TG1-FLAG-infected keratinocytes does not exceed the level observed in differentiated air-liquid interface cultures indicating that the expressed TG1 level is in the physiological range. As anticipated, expression of TG1 caused production of cornified envelope-like structures (Fig. 1D, upper panels). These structures display properties of cornified envelopes including resistance to challenge with detergent and reducing agent. Fig. 1D (lower panels) shows survival of cross-linked structures in TG1-FLAG expressing cells after treatment with detergent and reducing agent. To assess activity of expressed TG1-FLAG, particulate and cytosol fractions (Fig. 1B) were assayed for activity. Fig. 1E shows that activity is associated with the particulate fraction and increases with enzyme level. These findings indicate that the expressed TG1-FLAG is active and distributes in the cell in a pattern typical of endogenous TG1. We next assessed the intracellular behavior of several TG1 mutants (Fig. 2A). The TG1 includes membrane-anchoring, β-sandwich, catalytic core, and β-barrel domains (22Farasat S. Wei M.H. Herman M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three residues (Cys377, His436, and Asp459) in the TG1 catalytic domain are essential for enzyme activity (43Pedersen L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We first studied a catalytically inactive active-site mutant, TG1-FLAG(C377A). As indicated in the confocal z-series (Fig. 2B), we observe perinuclear accumulation of TG1-FLAG(C377A), although some is also detected at the plasma membrane. This differs from the plasma membrane localization of wild-type TG1-FLAG (Fig. 1A). A second mutant, FLAG-TG1(Δ1–52) lacks the N-terminal 52 amino acids that encode a domain that is thought to be essential for membrane association (40Phillips M.A. Qin Q. Mehrpouyan M. Rice R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11057-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). FLAG-TG1(Δ1–52) localizes to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, a difference in expression level does not explain the difference in distribution of these three proteins. We next assessed the localization of two additional TG1 mutants. These point mutations (V379L and R142C) are associated with ichthyosis (23Herman M.L. Farasat S. Steinbach P.J. Wei M.H. Toure O. Fleckman P. Blake P. Bale S.J. Toro J.R. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Val379 is close to the active site and Arg142 is located upstream in the β-sandwich domain. Keratinocytes were transfected with plasmids encoding TG1-FLAG(V379L) and TG1-FLAG(R142C). As shown in Fig. 2E, these mutants distribute in a perinuclear location similar to that observed for TG1(C377A). In addition, to exclude the possibility that the FLAG epitope has an impact on distribution, we monitored the distribution of the C377A mutant lacking the FLAG sequence. As shown in Fig. 2E, the distribution of TG1(C377A) is identical to that observed for TG1-FLAG(C377A) (Fig. 2B). Little is known regarding the mechanism of TG1 intracellular trafficking except that it is proposed to shuttle between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane dependent upon the presence of myristoyl or palmitoyl lipids attached to the N-terminal anchor domain (35Steinert P.M. Chung S.I. Kim S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Chakravarty R. Rice R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 625-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because TG1 localizes to the plasma membrane (2Eckert R.L. Sturniolo M.T. Broome A.M. Ruse M. Rorke E.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 481-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 45Eckert R.L. Sturniolo M.T. Broome A.M. Ruse M. Rorke E.A. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 2005; 38: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that it may be trafficked via the ER. Fig. 3A shows that endogenous TG1 and TG1-FLAG distribute to the cell membrane (red, arrows) and, in particular, to sites of cell-cell contact, and that FLAG-TG1(Δ1–52) localizes in the cytoplasm. However, these proteins do not localize with BiP (green), a rough ER protein (Fig. 3A). BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) is a resident protein of the ER lumen that acts as a chaperone to facilitate correct protein folding (46Ni M. Lee A.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It is commonly used as an ER marker. Results presented in Fig. 2B indicate that TG1-FLAG(C377A) localizes at a perinuclear location, suggesting it may be associated with the ER. Consistent with ER localization, we show that TG1-FLAG(C377A) colocalizes with BiP (Fig. 3A, yellow staining and arrow) in 40% of TG1-FLAG(C377A) expressing cells, indicating that ER accumulation is a frequent outcome for this mutant (47Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observe perinuclear accumulation in only 3.1% of TG1-FLAG expressing cells (not shown), indicating that wild-type TG1 does not accumulate in the ER. To provide evidence that wild-type TG1-FLAG is trafficked via the ER, we treated cells with brefeldin A, an ER transport blocker (48Nebenführ A. Ritzenthaler C. Robinson D.G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Brefeldin A treatment results in accumulation of wild-type TG1-FLAG in the ER (Fig. 3A). We also monitored for localization with the cis-Golgi marker, GM130 (49Short B. Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R311-R313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe colocalization of endogenous TG1, TG1-FLAG, or TG1 mutants with GM130 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, EGFP-galactotransferase, a marker of the trans-Golgi apparatus, does not colocalize with the wild-type or mutant TG1 (not shown). These findings suggest that wild-type TG1 is rapidly trafficked through the ER but that TG1-FLAG(C377A) accumulates in the ER. To further pinpoint subcellular location, TG1-FLAG and TG1-FLAG(C377A) were expressed in keratinocytes and distribution was monitored by immunogold electron microscopy. When expressed at physiological levels TG1-FLAG localizes with the ER in a small percentage (3.1%) of cells and these rare cells cannot readily be located in the EM. When expressed at identical levels, TG1-FLAG(C377A) accumulates in the ER in the majority of cells and causes ER swelling (Fig. 4). Such swelling is not observed when TG1-FLAG is expressed at physiological levels, but is observed when TG1-FLAG is expressed at five times higher levels (Fig. 4). As expected, no signal and no morphological changes were observed in EV-infected cells (Fig. 4). These findings demonstrate that TG1-FLAG(C377A), when expressed at physiological levels, tends to accumulate in the ER, but TG1-FLAG does not. We next used biochemical methods to examine TG1-FLAG and TG1-FLAG(C377A) subcellular distribution. Microsome and cytosol fractions were prepared by 100,000 × g centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 5A, TG1-FLAG and TG1-FLAG(C377A) are enriched in the microsomal (M) fraction, as is the ER marker, calnexin (50Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To characterize TG1-FLAG membrane association, the microsomal suspension was extracted with 1 m NaCl, which extracts peripheral membrane proteins, or elevated pH (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11), which releases intraluminal proteins (51Ohlendieck K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 244: 283-293PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, TG1-FLAG is not extracted by high salt (NaCl) or elevated pH (pH 11), but is extracted by treatment with Triton X-100, which extracts membrane proteins. We next assessed whether TG1-FLAG is facing the ER lumen. Proteins that are inside the ER are protected from proteinase K digestion. We show"

https://openalex.org/W2010122471,"Due to the advances of high throughput technology and data-collection approaches, we are now in an unprecedented position to understand the evolution of organisms. Great efforts have characterized many individual genes responsible for the interspecies divergence, yet little is known about the genome-wide divergence at a higher level. Modules, serving as the building blocks and operational units of biological systems, provide more information than individual genes. Hence, the comparative analysis between species at the module level would shed more light on the mechanisms underlying the evolution of organisms than the traditional comparative genomics approaches.We systematically identified the tissue-related modules using the iterative signature algorithm (ISA), and we detected 52 and 65 modules in the human and mouse genomes, respectively. The gene expression patterns indicate that all of these predicted modules have a high possibility of serving as real biological modules. In addition, we defined a novel quantity, ""total constraint intensity,"" a proxy of multiple constraints (of co-regulated genes and tissues where the co-regulation occurs) on the evolution of genes in module context. We demonstrate that the evolutionary rate of a gene is negatively correlated with its total constraint intensity. Furthermore, there are modules coding the same essential biological processes, while their gene contents have diverged extensively between human and mouse.Our results suggest that unlike the composition of module, which exhibits a great difference between human and mouse, the functional organization of the corresponding modules may evolve in a more conservative manner. Most importantly, our findings imply that similar biological processes can be carried out by different sets of genes from human and mouse, therefore, the functional data of individual genes from mouse may not apply to human in certain occasions."
