https://openalex.org/W2041331047,"Group I introns possess a single active site that catalyzes the two sequential reactions of self-splicing. An RNA comprising the two domains of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron catalytic core retains activity, and the 5.0 angstrom crystal structure of this 247-nucleotide ribozyme is now described. Close packing of the two domains forms a shallow cleft capable of binding the short helix that contains the 5′ splice site. The helix that provides the binding site for the guanosine substrate deviates significantly from A-form geometry, providing a tight binding pocket. The binding pockets for both the 5′ splice site helix and guanosine are formed and oriented in the absence of these substrates. Thus, this large ribozyme is largely preorganized for catalysis, much like a globular protein enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2019777050,"The repair pathways involved in the removal of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoguanine) in DNA by mammalian cell extracts have been examined. Closed circular DNA constructs containing a single 8-oxoguanine at a defined site were used as substrates to determine the patch size generated after in vitro repair by mammalian cell extracts. Restriction analysis of the repair incorporation in the vicinity of the lesion indicated that up to 75% of the 8-oxoguanine was repaired via the single nucleotide replacement mechanism in both human and mouse cell extracts. Approximately 25% of the 8-oxoguanine lesions were repaired by the long patch repair pathway. Repair incorporation 5′ to the lesion, characteristic for nucleotide excision repair, was not significant. Elimination of the DNA polymerase β (polβ)-dependent single nucleotide base excision repair pathway in extracts prepared from polβ-deficient mouse cells resulted in extension of the repair gap to 4–5 nucleotides 3′ to the lesion in 50% of the repair events, suggesting the increased involvement of the long patch repair pathway. However, about one-half of the 8-oxoguanine repair was still accomplished through replacement of only one nucleotide in the polβ-deficient cell extracts. These data indicate the existence of an alternative polβ-independent single nucleotide repair patch pathway for processing of 8-oxoguanine in DNA.

In living cells reactive oxygen species are formed continuously as a consequence of normal cellular metabolism and are also generated by a number of external factors. The reaction of active oxygen species with DNA results in numerous forms of base damage, and 8-oxoguanine 1The abbreviations used are: 8-oxoguanine, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; NER, nucleotide excision repair; BER, base excision repair; AP sites, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, abasic sites; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; bp, base pair(s); polβ, DNA polymerase β; polδ, DNA polymerase δ; hOGG1, human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase; bp, base pair; XP-A, xeroderma pigmentosum group A. is one of the most abundant lesions generated. An increased level of 8-oxoguanine has been observed after treatment of cells with UV, ionizing irradiation or chemical mutagens that generate oxygen radicals (for review, see Ref.1Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Although many different lesions are formed in DNA after oxidative stress, 8-oxoguanine is one of the most significant and the most studied lesions. 8-Oxoguanine in a syn conformation can base pair with adenine and induce transversion mutations (2Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 3Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This demonstrated mutagenic potential is thought to be involved in cancer and aging (4Ames B.N. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 7: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 5Ames B.N.

To avoid deleterious consequences, 8-oxoguanine must be efficiently removed from DNA. Based on previous studies in bacterial cells it has been established that base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for the removal of this lesion (8Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Recently human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) has been cloned and purified by several groups (9Radicella J.P. Dherin C.

S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), thus providing an enzymatic basis for the involvement of BER in removal of this lesion in mammalian cells. There are two pathways for base excision repair involving different subsets of proteins and operating independently (12Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 13Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

Both pathways are initiated by DNA glycosylases that recognize and remove the damaged base leaving an abasic site (AP site). The AP site is recognized by AP endonuclease, which introduces a DNA strand break 5′ to the baseless sugar, and then DNA polymerase β (polβ) catalyzes β elimination of the 5′ sugar phosphate residue and fills the one nucleotide gap. The nick is then sealed by DNA ligase (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In polβ-deficient cell extracts this repair mechanism is disrupted and the PCNA-dependent pathway then become the major mode of base excision repair (16Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E.

The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent pathway, in addition to DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease, also involves flap endonuclease, PCNA, DNA polymerase δ, and DNA ligase (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Neither of these enzymes can remove a 5′ sugar phosphate and generate a 1-nucleotide gap. To remove the 5′ sugar phosphate, DNA polymerase first adds several nucleotides to the 3′ end of the nick and exposes the 5′ sugar phosphate as part of a single-stranded flap structure. This flap structure is recognized and excised by flap endonuclease, and the DNA is finally ligated by DNA ligase (14Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). These repair events result in a 2–5-nucleotide-long repair patch (13Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G.

In this reaction, PCNA and probably replication factor C assist in loading the DNA polymerase onto DNA (18Podust L.P. Podust V.N. Floth C. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2970-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and also stimulate the endonuclease flap endonuclease (19Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The role of BER pathways has been characterized for the repair of uracil and AP sites (12Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 13Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), but there are no studies on the detailed pathways for the removal of 8-oxoguanine. The processing of 8-oxoguanine may be different from that of uracil or AP sites for several reasons. First, 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase unlike uracil-DNA glycosylase has an intrinsic AP lyase activity, and this raises the possibility for the existence of an alternative BER pathway independent of the AP lyase activity of DNA polymerase β. Second, it has recently been observed that 8-oxoguanine is recognized and processed by the human nucleotide excision repair (NER) system, proposing a role for NER in removal of this lesion (23Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To examine the pathways involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine, we have used a DNA construct containing a single 8-oxoguanine lesion at a defined position. We have explored the role of polβ- and PCNA-dependent BER pathways as well as that of the NER pathway in the removal of this lesion in mammalian cell extracts. The repair synthesis incorporation was measured in the vicinity of the lesion, and the number and directionality of nucleotides replaced were assessed to determine whether the repair occurs via the single nucleotide polβ-dependent pathway, via the longer patch, PCNA-dependent BER pathway, or through the NER system. The repair incorporation was also analyzed in extracts prepared from polβ-knockout cells to explore the role of the polβ-independent pathways in the removal of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. In this paper we report that the single nucleotide repair patch BER pathway is the primary mechanism for processing of 8-oxoguanine by mammalian cell extracts. We also present evidence for the existence of a previously unidentified, polβ-independent single nucleotide repair patch pathway for removal of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. Human lymphoid AG9387 cells (apparently normal) and GM 2250 (xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XP-A)) cells were obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). Cells were grown in the medium recommended by the Repository. DNA polymerase β knockout mouse fibroblasts MB19tsA and isogenic wild-type cell line MB16tsA were obtained from Dr. S. H. Wilson and were grown as described (24Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides used were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX) and gel-purified. The synthetic DNA duplex corresponding to the sequence 5′-ATATACCGCGGCCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATT-3′ was cloned into theSmaI site of M13mp18 DNA. The recombinant single-stranded DNA, named M13In, was purified, and the insert orientation was verified by sequencing. Double-stranded closed circular DNA containing a single lesion was constructed by priming 30 μg of single-stranded M13In DNA with a 6-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide 5′-pATATACCGCG[8-oxo]GCCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATT-3′ for the single 8-oxoguanine construct, and with 5′-pATATACCGCGGCCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATT-3′ for the control plasmid. The 250-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 7 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 100 μm ATP, 500 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP, 40 units of T4 DNA polymerase, 35 Weiss units of T4 DNA ligase, and 100 μg of T4 gene 32 protein (all enzymes from Boehringer Mannheim) was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Closed circular DNA was isolated by CsCl/EtBr density gradient centrifugation, purified by butanol extraction, desalted, and concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon). DNA substrates were stored at −20 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mmEDTA. The presence of a single 8-oxoguanine was verified by sensitivity of 59-mer HindIII restriction fragment to Fpg protein. Reaction was performed in a buffer containing 70 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 70 mm KCl, and 2 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Fpg protein was kindly provided by Dr. A. Grollman. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3–5 g of cells by the method of Manley et al.(25Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Standard 50-μl repair reactions contained 100–200 ng of single 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA, 45 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 40 mm phosphocreatine (di-Tris salt, Sigma), 2.5 μg of creatine phosphokinase (type I, Sigma), 3.4% glycerol (Fluka), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50 μmdCTP, dATP, and TTP, 5 μm dGTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and 100 μg of a whole cell extract protein. When the reaction was complemented with both labeled dGTP and dCTP, the concentration of cold dCTP was also reduced to 5 μm. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 3 h. After the reaction, plasmid DNA was purified from the reaction mixture by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and treated with 20 units of the indicated restriction endonuclease for 3–12 h in a buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Reactions were evaporated in a Speedvac (Savant), and the pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of formamide-dye (0.1% xylene cyanol-0.1% bromphenol blue and 50% formamide), incubated for 5 min at 90 °C, and electrophoresed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea, 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.8), and 2 mm EDTA. The amount of radioactivity was quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). An oligonucleotide containing restriction sites suitable for analysis of DNA repair incorporation in the vicinity of the lesion was cloned in M13mp18 DNA. Single 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA was constructed by priming recombinant single-stranded DNA with an 8-oxoguanine-containing oligonucleotide, and covalently closed double-stranded DNA was purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. The 7280-bp substrate DNA contained a unique 8-oxoguanine lesion and restriction sites suitable for analysis of repair patch size (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the presence of the lesion, we demonstrated that our DNA construct is sensitive to Fpg protein, the bacterial enzyme that recognizes 8-oxoguanine in DNA and cleaves the 5′ and 3′ phosphodiester bonds next to the lesion (26Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The digestion of the substrate DNA withHindIII generates two fragments: a 59-mer fragment containing the lesion and a 7171-bp fragment representing the rest of the DNA. The fragments were then 3′ end-labeled with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The filling of the protruding ends of the 59-mer fragment generated a 63-bp duplex DNA fragment labeled in both strands and containing 8-oxoguanine in only one of them. The labeled DNA was then treated with Fpg protein. The cleavage of the 63-mer fragment at the site of 8-oxoguanine should generate a 15-mer labeled fragment. The result of the described experiment is shown in Fig.2 A. There are no Fpg-sensitive sites in the control DNA, and the expected 15-mer product is observed only in 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA. Because both DNA strands were labeled and only one of them contains the lesion, the radioactivity of the 15-mer fragment (46% of the total amount of radioactivity in the 63- and 15-mer fragments) indicates that at least 92% of the construct DNA contains single 8-oxoguanine at the defined position.Figure 2Characterization of substrate DNA. A, cleavage of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)-containing DNA with Fpg protein. Control or 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA was hydrolyzed with HindIII restriction endonuclease, labeled by end filling with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), incubated with 1 ng of Fpg protein for 30 min at 37 °C, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. B, repair incorporation into the 59-mer HindIII fragment of control (G:C) and 8-oxoguanine-containing (8-oxoG:C) substrate DNA incubated with human whole cell extract. 200 ng of substrate DNA was incubated with 100 μg of whole cell extract protein from the human lymphoblastoid cell line AG9387 in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP for 3 h at 30 °C. The DNA was recovered from the reaction mixture, cut with HindIII, and repair incorporation was analyzed after electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The repair of 8-oxoguanine was measured in the DNA repair incorporation assay. DNA containing 8-oxoguanine or control DNA, prepared by the same method but containing a normal G:C base pair at the same position, were incubated with human whole cell extracts in the presence of all cofactors needed for DNA repair, including 32P-labeled dGTP. After incubation, the DNA was purified from the reaction mixture, cleaved with HindIII restriction endonuclease, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The reaction with HindIII released a 59-bp fragment that contained an 8-oxoguanine residue in substrate DNA. The analysis of the gel shown in Fig. 2 B indicated that after 3-h incubation with human cell extracts some nonspecific incorporation accumulates in both damaged and undamaged DNA constructs (the band at the very top of the gel). However, if normalized to the fragment length, the incorporation into the 59-bpHindIII fragment was 150-fold more than nonspecific incorporation into the rest of the plasmid. The incorporation into the 59-bp HindIII fragment was highly damage-specific;i.e. very little or no incorporation was seen in the corresponding fragment of the control DNA. The incorporation of dGMP into the 59-bp HindIII fragment also indicates that repair of 8-oxoguanine was completed by the cell extract, because we did not observe any labeled intermediates of incision that were not ligated. To estimate the size of the repair patch produced in human extracts, we performed a simultaneous digestion of repaired DNA withHindIII and HaeIII restriction endonucleases. This hydrolysis generates a 48-bp fragment that contains the 8-oxoguanine residue in substrate DNA, a 4-mer fragment that includes nucleotides 2–5, and a 7-mer fragment including nucleotides 7–12 3′ to the lesion. A single nucleotide repair patch would be detected by dGMP incorporation in the 48-mer HindIII-HaeIII fragment, and any further extension of the repair patch would result in the additional labeling of the 4- or 7-mer fragment (Fig.1 A, scheme). The PhosphorImager quantification of the relative incorporation in the restriction fragments revealed that >75% of the total incorporation into the 59-mer HindIII fragment was detected in the 48-mer fragment, and 25% of the incorporation was found in the 4- and 7-mer bands (Fig. 3). When the incorporation was normalized to the number of potential sites for dGMP incorporation (one in the 48-mer, two in the 4-mer and one in the 7-mer fragments), we conclude that ∼84% of the repair incorporation was detected in the 48-mer fragment. Similar experiments were performed in which incorporation of both dCMP and dGMP was measured in the same repair reaction. The nucleotide sequence 3′ to the 8-oxoguanine contains 8 consequent guanines and cytosines from nucleotides 48–55 (Fig.1 A). In these experiments incorporation into each of these nucleotides 3′ to the 8-oxoguanine was monitored. When these results were normalized to the number of potential sites for dGMP and dCMP incorporation, >85% of the incorporation was found in the 48-mer fragment, indicating that a single nucleotide repair patch is the major pathway for the repair of 8-oxoguanine in human cell extracts. All data were pooled and are summarized in TableI.Table IRepair incorporation in the vicinity of 8-oxoguanineRestriction fragmentRadioactivityHuman cell extractsMouse cell extractsPolβ+Polβ−%48-mer84.0 ± 2.585.0 ± 5.365.4 ± 5.84-mer12.0 ± 2.58.2 ± 4.820.4 ± 7.57-mer4.0 ± 1.26.8 ± 1.514.2 ± 1.9The results of restriction analysis of an in vitro repaired 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA were quantified with Phosphorolmager, and the incorporation was normalized to the number of potential sites for incorporation.

Open table in a new tab The results of restriction analysis of an in vitro repaired 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA were quantified with Phosphorolmager, and the incorporation was normalized to the number of potential sites for incorporation. An average of three independent experiments is shown. To elucidate the role of the polβ-independent pathways in the repair of 8-oxoguanine from DNA, we measured the repair of this lesion in extracts prepared from polβ-knockout mouse cells (polβ−/−) and from isogenic wild-type cells (polβ+/+). The substrate DNA containing a single 8-oxoguanine residue was incubated with these extracts, purified, and then digested with HindIII restriction endonuclease. Similar incorporation was found in the 59-mer fragment cleaved from the 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA repaired in normal and polβ-deficient cell extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 1and 2). Surprisingly, nonspecific incorporation was much higher in the polβ+/+ cell extracts than in polβ−/− cell extracts (Fig. 4, compare bands at thetop of the gel). The analysis of repair patch size by hydrolysis with HindIII and HaeIII restriction endonucleases was performed as described above for human cell extracts. The simultaneous incorporation of labeled dGMP and dCMP was monitored in these experiments. After repair of 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA in cell extracts prepared from normal mouse fibroblasts, ∼80–90% of the incorporation was localized in the 48-merHindIII-HaeIII fragment (Fig. 4, lane 3). This indicates that, as was shown above for human cell extracts, mouse cell extracts repair 8-oxoguanine predominantly via the single nucleotide repair patch pathway. In the polβ−/−cell extracts the repair gap most commonly was extended by >1 nucleotide, and more incorporation in the 4- and 7-mer restriction fragments was found (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and4). However, the 48-mer HindIII-HaeIII fragment from DNA repaired in polβ−/− extracts contained up to 65% of the incorporated radioactivity, suggesting that a substantial part of the repair in these extracts was accomplished through a single nucleotide gap. The distribution of incorporation in the restriction fragments observed in several independent experiments with polβ−/− and polβ+/+ mouse extracts is summarized in Table I. A high level of incorporation into the 48-mer restriction fragment indicates that an alternative, previously unidentified, polβ-independent repair pathway generating a 1-nucleotide repair patch is involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in a polβ-deficient cell extracts. Recently it has been reported that in human cell extracts the NER pathway is involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in DNA (23Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We estimated the relative contribution of BER and NER in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. During base excision repair, the AP lyase activity of the glycosylase or a separate AP endonuclease incises the phosphodiester bond next to the lesion. The following DNA repair events result in the replacement of one or more nucleotides located 3′ to the damage (Fig.1 A). In contrast, during NER, the replaced region includes 20–24 nucleotides 5′ and 5–9 nucleotides 3′ to the damaged site (27Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar,28Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, the 46-mer HindIII-EagI fragment of the 8-oxoguanine-containing plasmid should be labeled during in vitro NER (Fig. 1 A). The dGMP and dCMP incorporation into this fragment, when normalized to the total incorporation into the 59-mer HindIII-HindIII fragment, will reflect the relative contribution of NER to the repair of 8-oxoguanine in the cell extract. There are two overlapping EagI restriction sites close to the 8-oxoguanine, so cleavage with HindIII andEagI generates two independent sets of fragments. One of these (46-mer HindIII-EagI and 13-merEagI-HindIII) was used to monitor incorporation 5′ to the lesion. We found that only ∼10% of the total incorporation into the 59-mer fragment was attributable to incorporation into the 46-mer HindIII-EagI fragment (Fig.5 A, lane 2). If this incorporation represents NER activity on the 8-oxoguanine lesion, it should decrease after repair in cell extracts derived from NER-deficient mutants. To test this, incorporation into the 46-merHindIII-EagI fragment after repair of 8-oxoguanine-containing DNA in a XP-A cell extract was analyzed. We reproducibly observed a 30–40% decrease in incorporation into the 59-mer HindIII fragment after the repair reaction in the XP-A extracts (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 1 and3), but there were no changes in the relative incorporation into the 46-mer HindIII-EagI fragment compared with the incorporation into the 59-mer HindIII fragment. We also investigated whether the role for NER would increase when the major BER pathway is disrupted. The experiments with normal and polβ-deficient mouse cell extracts were performed exactly as described above for human cell extracts. No changes in the relative incorporation in the 46-mer HindIII-EagI fragment in the polβ-deficient cell extracts were found compared with the normal cell extracts (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 2and 4). These data suggest that the role of NER in repair of 8-oxoguanine is not increased in polβ-deficient cell extracts. We have examined the involvement of different repair pathways in the processing of 8-oxoguanine in mammalian cell extracts using restriction analysis of in vitro repaired DNA. We made the assumption that the gap size during long patch repair events is at least 4–5 nucleotides and that repair incorporation is independent of the local nucleotide sequence at each guanine and cytosine 3′ to the lesion. Using restriction analysis we have mapped the repair incorporation in the first 11 nucleotides 3′ to the 8-oxoguanine. The data on repair incorporation into restriction fragments in the vicinity of 8-oxoguanine are summarized in Table I. These data are already normalized to the number of potential sites for the dGMP and dCMP incorporation. However, to be interpreted in terms of a relative contribution of the different pathways to repair of 8-oxoguanine, these data should be further adjusted because the 48-mer restriction fragment is labeled not only during the filling of a 1-nucleotide gap but also during repair of longer gaps (Fig. 1 B). Thus, to calculate the absolute contribution of a single nucleotide repair pathway, the long patch component of incorporation into the 48-mer restriction fragment should be subtracted. When the incorporation detected in the 4-mer fragment was subtracted from the total incorporation detected in the 48-mer fragment, we found that 72 ± 2.5% of a repair events were accomplished solely through a single nucleotide repair patch. We thus conclude that in whole cell extracts this pathway is the primary pathway for the repair of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. The other pathways contribute to the repair of the remaining 28 ± 2.5% of the 8-oxoguanine. The final normalized data on the contribution of BER pathways to the processing of 8-oxoguanine by human cell extracts are shown in Fig. 6. These data are in good agreement with a previous finding from this laboratory indicating that multiple pathways are involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in randomly damaged plasmid DNA (29Jaiswal M. Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. Mazur S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, the involvement of NER in the removal of 8-oxoguanine has been reported (23Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We have examined the relative roles of BER and NER in the repair of this lesion in mammalian cell extracts. Although thein vitro repair system we have used in our experiments is optimal for both BER and NER, we were unable to see any significant involvement of NER in the removal of 8-oxoguanine either in whole cell extracts or in cell extracts prepared from polβ-knockout cells, in which the major pathway for base excision repair is disrupted. The excision assay used by Reardon et al. (23Reardon J.T. Bessho T. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was specifically designed to monitor only NER activity, so the sensitivity of their method was high in measuring even minor repair of 8-oxoguanine. In our assay NER and BER compete for the same substrate, and because the BER system is the primary pathway for repair of 8-oxoguanine, it is more effective in processing 8-oxoguanine. Nevertheless, our experiments do not rule out a role for NER in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. NER may serve as a backup system when the major BER pathways are inactivated. Also, NER is important for transcription-coupled repair, and transcription-coupled repair of thymine glycol in DNA has been demonstrated recently (30Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We observed a reproducible 30–40% reduction of total repair incorporation in the XP-A extract (Fig.5 A). The XPA protein binds preferentially to UV-damaged DNA and is involved in DNA damage recognition and processing during NER (28Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The XPA protein also has an affinity for osmium tetroxide-treated DNA (31Asahina H. Kuraoka I. Shirakawa M. Morita E.H. Miura N. Miyamoto I. Ohtsuka E. Okada Y. Tanaka K. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and reduced repair of oxidative DNA damage in XP-A cell extracts has previously been documented by several groups, including this laboratory (29Jaiswal M. Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. Mazur S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Satoh M.S. Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6335-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). So far no role for the XPA protein in BER has been ascribed. It is possible that the XPA protein is involved in the recognition of 8-oxoguanine in DNA and assists other BER proteins in processing of this lesion. There is strong evidence from studies in mammalian cell extracts that DNA polymerase β is the major polymerase participating in single nucleotide gap filling during BER (24Sobol R.W. Horton J.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β has an intrinsic activity that removes the 5′ sugar phosphate by β elimination (36Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 37Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, this enzyme plays a key role in the single nucleotide patch repair pathway, because it both removes the 5′ sugar phosphate generated by DNA glycosylase and AP endonuclease and also fills in the resulting 1-nucleotide gap. In the polβ-deficient cell extracts the repair of uracil and AP sites is accomplished by a PCNA-dependent mechanism and results in a 2–5-nucleotide-long repair patch (16Biade S. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 898-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).2 We found that removal of 8-oxoguanine in polβ-deficient cell extracts was only partially accomplished through a long patch repair mechanism, and approximately one half of the repair events involves a single nucleotide repair patch mechanism (65% incorporation into the 48-mer restriction fragment minus 20% incorporation contributed by long patch repair). During long patch repair, flap endonuclease activity releases the 5′ sugar phosphate residue as a part of a 2–5-base oligonucleotide and is not able to generate a one nucleotide gap (38DeMott M.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We conclude that in addition to long patch repair, another mechanism is involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in polβ-deficient cell extracts. Purified human OGG1 protein can catalyze a β elimination reaction (9Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8010-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 10Roldan-Arjona T. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Klungland A. Anselmino C. Wang R.P. Augustus M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and most probably like its yeast counterpart yOGG1 can also catalyze removal of a 3′ sugar phosphate from an incised AP site (15Sandigursky M. Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Xu Y. Franklin W. Deutsch W.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that hOGG1 alone, or in combination with other enzymes, can generate a 1-nucleotide gap even in the absence of polβ, and it is likely that a polymerase other than polβ can fill the resulting 1-nucleotide gap. Fortini et al. (17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) recently reported that a polβ-independent single nucleotide repair patch mechanism can participate in the repair of uracil in DNA in mammalian cell extracts. In their experiments, Fortini et al. (17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) studied the repair of a plasmid DNA containing a single uracil residue at a defined position. They found that some repair in polβ-deficient cell extracts may be accomplished through a single nucleotide patch repair. The polβ-independent single nucleotide patch repair pathway for removal of uracil and the one that we report in this paper for 8-oxguanine may differ, because different enzymes are involved. In the substrate used by Fortini et al. (17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), uracil-DNA glycosylase removes the uracil from DNA and creates an AP site. In contrast to hOGG1, uracil-DNA glycosylase does not have intrinsic AP lyase activity, and the AP site is presumably further processed by AP endonuclease, which generates a nick with a 5′ sugar phosphate. In the absence of the AP lyase activity of polβ, the slow rate single nucleotide patch repair observed by Fortini et al. (17Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) may be supported by other weak β eliminators or caused by the spontaneous β elimination of the 5′ sugar phosphate during incubation in the whole cell extract. In the case of 8-oxoguanine repair, we observed very efficient involvement of a single nucleotide patch pathway. It was responsible for up to 50% of repair events in a polβ-deficient cell extracts. These data suggest that AP lyase activity of hOGG1 is actively involved into repair of 8-oxoguanine. Based on our results, we propose that this polβ-independent single nucleotide repair patch pathway includes 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase, DNA polymerase (δ or ε), and DNA ligase as a core enzymes. There is a possibility that additional activity is involved in the removal of the 3′ sugar phosphate in the nick generated by hOGG1. We also cannot exclude that some other proteins that are specifically induced only in a polβ-knockout mouse are involved in this pathway. It is not clear whether in whole cell extracts from normal cells this mechanism operates simultaneously with the polβ-dependent single nucleotide patch repair pathway, but at least it is involved as a backup pathway for repair of 8-oxoguanine in a polβ-deficient cell extracts. We thank S. H. Wilson for the generous gift of the polβ-knockout cell line. R. M. Anson, R. Stierum, and S. Mazur are thanked for critical reading of the manuscript."

We have observed that Munc18c, a mammalian homolog of the yeast syntaxin-binding protein n-Sec1p, competed for the binding of VAMP2 to syntaxin 4. Consistent with an inhibitory function for Munc18c, expression of Munc18c, but not the related Munc18b isoform, prevented the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 and IRAP/vp165 translocation to the plasma membrane without any significant effect on GLUT1 trafficking. As expected, overexpressed Munc18c was found to co-immunoprecipitate with syntaxin 4 in the basal state. However, these complexes were found to dissociate upon insulin stimulation. Furthermore, endogenous Munc18c was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane and its distribution was not altered by insulin stimulation. Although expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein-Munc18c primarily resulted in a dispersed cytosolic distribution, co-expression with syntaxin 4 resulted in increased localization to the plasma membrane. Together, these data suggest that Munc18c inhibits the docking/fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles by blocking the binding of VAMP2 to syntaxin 4. Insulin relieves this inhibition by inducing the dissociation of Munc18c from syntaxin 4 and by sequestering Munc18c to an alternative plasma membrane binding site.

Although most cell types also constitutively express the GLUT1 isoform at the cell surface, the insulin-stimulated increase in plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 protein accounts for the majority of post-prandial glucose disposal in both muscle and adipose tissue (4Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutri. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated translocation of these GLUT4-containing vesicles has several features in common with the regulated exocytosis pathway of synaptic vesicle trafficking in neurotransmitter release (5Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The machinery involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming/docking/fusion entails the pairing of protein complexes in the vesicle compartment (v-SNAREs, for vesicle SNAP receptors) with their cognate receptor complexes at the target membrane (t-SNAREs, for target membrane SNAP receptors). Recently, several of the v- and t-SNARE proteins have been identified that specifically participate in the insulin-regulated docking and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the adipocyte plasma membrane. GLUT4 vesicles co-purify with both the VAMP2 and VAMP3 v-SNARE isoforms and specific proteolytic cleavage of VAMP2, expression of a dominant-interfering VAMP2 mutant or inhibitory peptides impairs insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (6Cain C.C.

In addition, transferrin-horseradish peroxidase ablation of recycling endosomes resulted in a selective loss of GLUT4 vesicles containing VAMP3 but did not prevent the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (11Martin L.B.

Although there are no specific endoproteases that cleave either syntaxin 4 or SNAP23/Syndet plasma membrane t-SNARE proteins, studies using blocking antibodies, dominant-interfering mutants, and/or peptide inhibitors have strongly implicated syntaxin 4 and SNAP23/Syndet as the required t-SNARE proteins for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (10Olson A.L.

Thus, these data provide compelling evidence that VAMP2 functions by directing the association of the GLUT4-containing vesicles with syntaxin 4 and SNAP23/Syndet. In the case of synaptic transmission, there are also several modulators of v- and t-SNARE interactions (15Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P.

These proteins bind with high affinity to their cognate plasma membrane syntaxins, and null mutations in these genes cause dramatic reduction in vesicle exocytosis, suggesting that these proteins are essential for normal v- and t-SNARE function (24Hosono R.

In mammals, the Munc18a isoform is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it inhibits the association of VAMP1 and SNAP25 with syntaxin 1 (21Pevsner J. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H.

In contrast to Munc18a, Munc18b and Munc18c are expressed ubiquitously but only Munc18c binds syntaxin 4 with high affinity (27Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol.

Based upon these data, we have now investigated the functional role of Munc18c in modulating the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 vesicle translocation. In this report we demonstrate that Munc18c specifically competes for VAMP2 binding to syntaxin 4 and increased expression of Munc18c in 3T3L1 adipocytes inhibits GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. The Munc18c inhibition was specific for GLUT4-containing vesicles, as there was no effect upon GLUT1 vesicle trafficking. Furthermore, insulin stimulation results in an uncoupling of the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complex. These data are consistent with a model in which Munc18c inhibits GLUT4 translocation in the basal state and with the hypothesis that insulin stimulation results in a de-repression of Munc18c function. The GLUT4 and syntaxin 4 antibodies were isolated as described previously (10Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

The Munc18c polyclonal antibody was obtained by immunization of a carboxyl-terminal synthetic peptide as described previously (13Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T.

VAMP2 and VAMP3 antibodies were prepared by immunization of sheep with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of VAMP2 (amino acids 1–94) and VAMP3 (amino acids 1–81). Monoclonal antibody to the Flag epitope (M2) was purchased from Eastman Kodak Corp.

The pcDNA3 GLUT4-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) construct was prepared by subcloning the full-length rat GLUT4 cDNA in frame into the HindIII andBamHI sites of the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH) to generate a carboxyl-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion. This fusion protein was subsequently subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). The full-length cDNA for Munc18c was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a mouse adipose library (CLONTECH) using 5′- and 3′-untranslated region primers as described previously (13Araki S. Tamori Y. Kawanishi M. Shinoda H. Masugi J. Mori H. Niki T. Okazawa H. Kubota T. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cDNA was shuttled into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison WI) and subsequently subcloned into the NcoI and SalI sites of pLexA (CLONTECH). An in-frame Flag epitope was synthesized and inserted into the EcoRI andNcoI sites to create pLexA-Flag-Munc18c. Plasmids pB42AD-Flag-Munc18c, pcDNA3-Flag-Munc18c, and eGFP-Flag-Munc18c were constructed by subcloning of the EcoRI/SalI fragment derived from the pLexA-Flag-Munc18c construct into compatible sites of pB42AD (CLONTECH), pcDNA3, and pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH), respectively. The full-length Munc18b cDNA was provided by Dr. Hideki Katagiri (University of Tokyo) and subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 with the addition of an in-frame Flag epitope subcloned amino-terminal to the Munc18b start site. The eGFP-GLUT1 construct was made by subcloning the full-length rat GLUT1 cDNA into theXhoI and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C3. The eGFP-IRAP/vp165 plasmid was constructed by inserting all but the extracellular residues (1–135) of the IRAP/vp165 cDNA obtained from Dr. Steven Waters (Metabolics, Inc.) into the HindIII and XhoI of the pEGFP-C3 vector. The full-length syntaxin 4 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Richard Scheller (Stanford University) and polymerase chain reaction primers directed against the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were used to amplify the DNA for subcloning into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. The cytoplasmic domain (residues 2–274) of syntaxin 4 was subcloned in frame into the BamHI and NotI sites of pLexA. The cytoplasmic domains of VAMP2 and VAMP3 were obtained as described previously (10Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the XhoI site of pB42AD. Full-length SNAP23 cDNA was provided by Dr. Paul Roche (National Cancer Institute) and subcloned into the EcoRI andXhoI sites of pB42AD and pcDNA3. Full-length αSNAP cDNA was provided by Dr. Sidney Whiteheart (University of Kentucky) and subcloned in-frame into pB42AD using BamHI andApaI polylinker sites synthesized to extend the multiple cloning site of the pB42AD vector. The three-hybrid vector was constructed by modification of the pB42AD construct as follows: 1) the yeast Gal1-Gal10 bi-directional promoter was substituted for the pB42AD promoter, 2) a second nuclear localization sequence was added to drive the localization of the “competitor” protein, and 3) a Flag epitope was added in frame downstream of the new nuclear localization sequence. Full-length cDNAs for SNAP23, Flag-Munc18c, Flag-Munc18b, and αSNAP, and cytoplasmic domains for VAMP2 and VAMP3 were inserted intoEcoRI and XhoI sites created 3′ of the new nuclear localization sequence Flag tag for competitor cDNAs. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture repository and cultured in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% calf serum at 37 °C and 8% CO2. At confluence, cells were differentiated by incubation in medium containing 25 mmglucose, 10% fetal bovine serum 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 mmdexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After four days the medium was changed to DMEM, 25 mm glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Differentiated adipocytes were used for the experiments 12 days after initiation of differentiation and were placed in a serum-depleted medium for 3 h prior to insulin stimulation. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) were obtained as described previously (30Waters S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CHO/IR cells were incubated in minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Fully confluent CHO/IR cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (0.34 kV and 960 microfarads) with 40 μg of plasmid DNA/cuvette as described previously (31Yamauchi K. Pessin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following electroporation, the cells were allowed to adhere to 10-cm tissue culture dishes for 40–48 h and were then serum-starved for 6 h prior to stimulation with 100 nminsulin at 37 °C. Differentiated adipocytes were transfected by a modification of the electroporation method. Briefly, fully differentiated adipocytes were electroporated (0.16 kV and 960 microfarads) with 50 μg of the eGFP-tagged plasmids plus 200 μg of additional plasmid DNA for analysis of eGFP fluorescence. In the case of plasma membrane sheet analysis, the cells were electroporated with 600 μg of plasmid DNA. Following electroporation, the adipocytes were re-plated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates and allowed to recover for 40–48 h before use. Control and insulin-stimulated adipocytes were washed with ice-cold PBS, and plasma membrane sheets were prepared as described by Robinson et al. (32Robinson L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E383-E393PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.55 mg/ml poly-l-lysine followed by three washes with hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). The cells were placed in sonication buffer (3× hypotonic buffer plus 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and sonicated with a Fisher probe membrane disrupter. Plasma membrane sheets were washed three times with sonication buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. The fixed plasma membrane sheets were quenched for 15 min at 25 °C in 100 mm glycine. The isolated plasma membrane sheets were washed and blocked with 5% donkey serum for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with GLUT4 antibody (1:100 dilution of antisera) or GLUT1 antibody (1:50 dilution) for 15 h at 4 °C. Plasma membrane sheets were then washed three times with PBS, incubated with lissamine rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 4 h in the dark, washed three times with PBS, overlaid with a drop of Vectashield, and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Adipocyte subcellular membrane fractions were obtained using the differential centrifugation method described by Piper et al. (33Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, control and insulin-stimulated 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed and resuspended in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were prepared by shearing the cells through a 22-gauge needle 10 times. Lysates were then centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The low speed pellet (LSP) was obtained by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 41,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 75 min at 4 °C to generate the high speed pellet and cytosol (supernatant) fractions. The crude plasma membrane pellet was obtained by resuspending the pellet from the initial 19,000 × g centrifugation in HES buffer followed by layering onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The plasma membrane layer was removed from the sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. All pelleted fractions were resuspended in HES buffer and assayed for soluble protein content (34Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodies indicated in the individual figure legends. Whole cell detergent extracts were prepared by solubilization in an Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was separated from the soluble extract by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Whole cell lysate (2–4 mg) was combined with 4.5 μg of affinity-purified sheep syntaxin 4 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a second incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride and immunoblotting. The LexA two-hybrid system, originally described by Gyuris et al. (35Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), was used here to examine interactions between known proteins. This two-hybrid system employs the use of three vectors: pLexA or “bait,” pB42AD or “prey,” and the p8op-lacZ reporter plasmid. The bait vector is used to generate fusions of the DNA binding domain of LexA fused upstream of an in-frame cDNA of interest. The prey vector generates fusions of a cassette consisting of the SV40 nuclear localization sequence, the 88-residue B42 acidic activator domain, and the hemagglutinin epitope tag. The reporter p8op-lacZ carries the lacZ reporter gene under the control of eight LexA operators and the minimal TATA region from the GAL1 promoter. p8op-lacZ exhibits no transcriptional activity in the absence of a LexA-fused activator. Syntaxin 4 was used as bait and co-transformed with the p8op-lacZ reporter vector into the pEGY48 strain of yeast cells. The bait vector and the reporter plasmid carry HIS3 and URA3 transformation markers, respectively. The LEU2reporter gene is under absolute control of the LexA operators. The bait showed no intrinsic transcriptional activation in the absence of prey, and was shown to enter the yeast nucleus and bind the operators. Yeast transformants carrying the bait and reporter plasmids were made competent and transformed with various prey constructs as indicated, and plated with selective dropout media containing glucose, nitrogen source, and all amino acids minus uracil, histidine, and tryptophan (the prey vector carries a TRP1 transformation marker). After 2 days at 30 °C, plates were replica plated onto four plates containing X-gal: glucose Ura-His-Trp-, glucose Ura-His-Trp-Leu-, gal/raf Ura-His-Trp-, and gal/raf Ura-His-Trp-Leu- and scored for interaction. Plates showing white colonies on glucose Ura-His-Trp-, no growth on glucose Ura-His-Trp-Leu-, and all blue colonies on the gal/raf media were given a score of ++++ as an indication of high level of interaction as measured by lacZ expression. No blue color was scored as −, while 25, 50 and 75% dark blue color were scored as +, ++, and +++, respectively. lacZ expression as determined by liquid assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate was consistent with our whole plate assay scoring. Liquid extracts were analyzed for expression of the fusion proteins by immunoblotting for that protein directly or by the hemagglutinin epitope tag imbedded in the prey vector. The two-hybrid prey vector was modified to express the competitor protein in addition to the Munc18c-AD fusion protein. Competition was determined by a loss of blue color compared with the three-hybrid vector with only the Munc18c-AD fusion and no competitor protein present. Dark blue color in 100, 75, and 50% were scored as ++++, ++, and −, respectively, as equal expression of the prey and competitor Munc18c proteins theoretically results in a maximal 50% loss of blue color. To examine the intracellular localization of Munc18c in comparison to GLUT4 and several SNARE proteins involved in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we used differential centrifugation to isolate subcellular fractions from 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of the GLUT4 protein in the whole cell extract, which was unaffected by insulin treatment (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2). GLUT4 protein was detected in the low speed pellet, high speed pellet, and plasma membrane fractions but was completely absent from the cytosol fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 3–10). Although insulin did not have a significant effect on the distribution of GLUT4 in the low speed pellet fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4), insulin stimulation resulted in a loss of GLUT4 protein in the high speed pellet fraction with an increase in the amount of GLUT4 protein in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 7–10). The decrease of GLUT4 in the high speed pellet fraction concomitant with its recruitment to the plasma membrane is characteristic of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (2Czech M.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 441-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to GLUT4, VAMP2 and VAMP3 were localized to all the particulate fractions and were absent from cytosol fractions. Interestingly, the relative proportion of VAMP3 in both the low speed pellet and high speed pellet fractions (Fig. 1, lanes 3,4, 7, and 8) compared with the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and10) was significantly greater than that for VAMP2. This is consistent with VAMP3 being more localized to endosomes, which are enriched in the low speed pellet fraction (37Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin stimulation resulted in a more marked translocation of VAMP2 from the high speed pellet to the plasma membrane fraction than VAMP3 (Fig. 1,lanes 7–10). These data are consistent with VAMP2 being predominantly localized to the insulin-responsive GLUT4 vesicle population distinct from the recycling endosome pool (11Martin L.B. Shewan A. Millar C.A. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1444-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to these vesicular proteins, syntaxin 4 and Munc18c were primarily localized to the plasma membrane fraction, although a relatively small amount of Munc18c was found in the cytosol (Fig. 1,lanes 5 and 6). However, there was no significant redistribution of either syntaxin 4 or Munc18c following insulin stimulation (Fig. 1, lanes 7–10). Since Munc18c does not contain any domains directly responsible for membrane targeting, its localization to the plasma membrane probably reflects its interaction with other plasma membrane-bound proteins including syntaxin 4 (27Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 38Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In vitro binding assays have indicated that Munc18c can selectively bind to syntaxin 2 and syntaxin 4 (28Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To further investigate the interaction of syntaxin 4 with Munc18c, we used yeast two- and three-hybrid assay systems (Fig.2). Initially, we examined the relative interaction of a syntaxin 4 LexA DNA binding domain fusion (bait) with several individual SNARE proteins. Syntaxin 4 specifically interacted with Munc18c activation domain fusion (prey) but not with the related Munc18b isoform (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, VAMP2 displayed a specific positive interaction with syntaxin 4, whereas there was no detec"

https://openalex.org/W2315629023,"Ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation has been shown to induce jun N-terminal kinase activity via aggregation-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) but the role of TNFR1 in mediating UV-induced apoptosis has not been explored. Using p53-null cells, we demonstrate that UV-stimulated ligand independent activation of TNFR1 plays a major role in mediating the apoptotic effects of UV-irradiation. UV-irradiation and TNFα acted in a synergistic manner to induce apoptosis. UV-irradiation stimulated the aggregation-mediated activation of TNFR1 which was coupled with activation of caspase 8, the most proximal caspase in TNFα signaling pathway. CrmA and the dominant negative versions of FADD, caspase 8 and caspase 10, that block the apoptotic axis of TNFR1 at different levels, also independently inhibited the UV-induced apoptosis. The engagement of the membrane initiated events was specific for UV-irradiation since neither CrmA nor the dominant negative FADD, caspase 8 or caspase 10 blocked the ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin and melphalan, the UV-mimetic agents known to elicit UV-type DNA damage, also induced apoptosis but differed from UV in that both of the former agents engaged the caspase cascade at a level distal to FADD. Consistent with these findings cisplatin also did not stimulate TNFR1 aggregation. Together these results indicate that DNA damage per se was not sufficient to activate the membrane TNFR1. Based on our results we propose that the plasma membrane initiated events play a predominant role in mediating UV-irradiation-induced apoptosis and that UV-irradiation appears to engage the apoptotic axis of TNFR1 and perhaps those of other membrane death receptors to transduce its apoptotic signals."

https://openalex.org/W1975618272,"The CDKN2 locus expresses two different mRNA transcripts, designated alpha and beta. The protein product of the alpha transcript is the cell cycle inhibitor and tumour suppressor p16INK4a. The beta transcript is translated in an alternate reading frame (ARF) and in humans encodes a 15 kDa protein (p19ARF). Immunohistochemical and Western analysis of p16INK4a has shown that the protein is downregulated in a significant number of tumours, but less is known on the expression of the p19ARF. We have examined the expression of p16INK4a and p19ARF in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by immunostaining (n=49) and multiplex RT-PCR (n=28). In order to investigate the mechanism responsible for p16INK4a downregulation, exon 1alpha methylation was analysed in a PCR-based assay. Of 49 tumours examined by immunostaining, 24 and 20 tumours expressed p16INK4a and p19ARF at nil to low levels, respectively. p19ARF was localized primarily to the nuclei of tumour cells, but was also seen to varying degrees in nuclei of lymphocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. No tumour with normal p16INK4a had decreased p19ARF expression. Among 16 tumours with nil to low p16INK4a expression, 11 tumours exhibited full methylation of at least one site within exon 1alpha and these tumours showed normal p19ARF expression. In contrast, no methylation of exon 1alpha was observed in five tumours which also lacked p19ARF. In normal lung, p16INK4a and p19ARF were not expressed at detectable levels, the multiplex RT-PCR results were balanced, and sites within exon 1alpha were strongly methylated. In tumours, imbalanced multiplex RT-PCR data (p16INK4a<p19ARF) predicted methylation of exon 1alpha (P=0.0006) as well as downregulation of p16INK4a. p19ARF downregulation was inversely correlated with p53 overexpression (P=0.025), whilst negative immunostaining for p16INK4a was inversely correlated with pRb down-regulation (P=0.003) and directly correlated with p53 overexpression as assessed by immunostaining (P=0.015). Our results show that: (1) p16INK4a and p19ARF expression are altered in almost half of resectable NSCLC; (2) methylation within exon 1alpha is a frequent, but not the only mechanism of p16INK4a downregulation; and that (3) the inverse association of p19ARF and p53 alteration is consistent with a linked pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2318659033,"Homozygous deletions of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4A and deficiency of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), both located on chromosome 9p21, have been independently reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To determine the frequency of co-deletion of these two genes, we investigated 50 samples of primary NSCLC using a quantitative PCR-ELISA. All specimens were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded and stored until assayed. Histologic subtypes included 25 adenocarcinomas (50%), 21 squamous cell carcinomas (42%) and four large cell carcinomas (8%). Homozygous deletions of MTAP exon 8 could be detected in 19 of 50 NSCLC samples (38%). Adenocarcinoma (11 of 25, 44%) showed a higher deletion frequency than squamous cell carcinoma (six of 21, 29%). In contrast, homozygous p16INK4A deletions were detected in only nine of 50 (18%) samples using specific primers for p16INK4A exon 1α. No difference between the histological subtypes and p16INK4A deletion frequency was observed. We further investigated the ten samples with MTAP deletions but intact p16INK4A exon 1α with primers specific for p16INK4A exon 3, the exon nearest to MTAP exon 8. Interestingly, none of the ten samples had deletion of the p16INK4A exon 3 coding region. Fine mapping analysis performed in ten samples showed a frequent breakpoint between MTAP exon 4 and exon 5. In addition, p16 protein expression could not be detected in five out of six samples with intact p16 but deleted MTAP locus. These data show a high frequency of homozygous MTAP deletions in NSCLC which is associated with detectable co-deletion of p16INK4A in only half of the cases. This result suggests the existence either of another tumor suppressor gene telomeric of p16INK4A or of deletions involving 3′-untranslated (3′-UTR) regulatory regions of p16INK4A that can interfere with its expression or function."

https://openalex.org/W2313834443,"The Tpl-2 kinase activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and induces IL-2 expression in T-cell lines. Here we show that the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the calcineurin/NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways. We, therefore, conclude that signals generated by the convergence of the MAPK and the calcineurin/NFAT pathway are necessary and sufficient for the activation of the IL-2 promoter by Tpl-2. The activation of both the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter were shown to depend on signals transduced by Raf1. However, it was only the IL-2 promoter whose activation by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant MEK1S218/222A and the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor PD098059. Since the activation of NFAT is MAPK-dependent these findings suggested that the activation of MAPK by Tpl-2 is either independent or only partially dependent on MEK1 and MEK2. In addition, they suggested that the activation of the IL-2 promoter is under the control of not only NFAT but also a second factor whose activation is MEK-dependent. Experiments in COS-1 and EL-4 cells confirmed both hypotheses and revealed that the second factor activated by Tpl-2 is NF-kappaB. While the activation of the IL-2 promoter and an NFAT-driven minimal promoter by Tpl-2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFAT delta418, it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl-2-mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin-dependent and independent pathways. Both pathways were fully blocked by Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L)."

Positive clones were isolated, characterized, and partially sequenced. The obtained sequences show a high level of identity with sequences of porcine formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), suggesting that 58K is rat FTCD.

To define parameters of FTCD association with the Golgi, comparison of its behavior with various Golgi and ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment marker proteins was examined under specific conditions. The results show that extraction parameters of FTCD are similar to those of GM130, a tightly associated Golgi matrix protein. FTCD appears to be a dynamic component of the Golgi, and a proportion of FTCD molecules cycle between the Golgi and earlier compartments of the secretory pathway.

Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 775-1035Crossref Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the Golgi complex consists of a ribbon-like structure composed of stacks of tightly opposed flattened cisternae with extensive vesicular and tubular profiles associated with the rims of the stacks (3Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). The stacks are functionally and morphologically polarized and contain pleiomorphic tubulovesicular structures on the incoming cis-face and the outgoing trans-face (4Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Hermo L. Am. J. Anat. 1979; 154: 455-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 5Ladinsky M.S. Kremer J.R. Furcinitti P.S. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. J.

The tubulovesicular structures near the cis-Golgi have been called the cis-Golgi network, ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) (reviewed in Refs. 7Hauri H.P.

The exact identity and fate of these structures is still debated, but it appears that VTCs represent transport intermediates ferrying cargo from the ER to the Golgi (11Presley J.F. Cole N.B.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar).In addition to the VTC-mediated ER-to-Golgi movement of material, selective retrograde recycling from the Golgi to the ER has been shown to be involved in the retrieval of specific proteins (e.g. see Refs.13Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 14Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.

Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that active cycling through the ER and Golgi may be common to all Golgi proteins (16Stinchcombe J.C. Nomoto H. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The retrograde redistribution of the cycling protein KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) can be seen in untreated cells and seems to involve tubular elements originating from the Golgi region and extending into the periphery of cells (19Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J.M. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Retrograde transport pathways appear to be preferentially enhanced in cells treated with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). In BFA-treated cells, redistribution of resident Golgi proteins (mannosidase II and Gal-T) appears to be mediated by tubules that extend from the Golgi and fuse with the ER (19Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J.M. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 20Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The overall structure of retrograde tubules containing KDEL-R in untreated cells, and Gal-T in BFA-treated cells appears similar (19Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J.M. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). However, whether KDEL-R is redistributed through tubular structures in BFA-treated cells is less clear. A comparison of mannosidase II and KDEL-R redistribution during BFA treatment shows that KDEL-R redistributes more rapidly than mannosidase II and that it does not utilize tubules during its relocation (21Tang B.L. Low S.H. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). The evidence suggests that multiple pathways for relocation from the Golgi may exist for distinct types of resident and cycling molecules.A novel 58-kDa protein (58K) that may be involved in linking Golgi to microtubules was identified and shown to be peripherally associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes (22Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083-16092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the ultimate goal of defining how 58K associates with Golgi membranes and to define its possible role in Golgi membrane dynamics, we initiated molecular characterization of the protein. We cloned and sequenced 58K, and in this report we show that 58K has extensive overall sequence identity with porcine FTCD and is likely to represent rat FTCD. FTCD is a metabolic enzyme involved in the conversion of histidine to glutamic acid (23Beaudet R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Its formiminotransferase activity transfers a formimino group from N-formimino-l-glutamic acid to tetrahydrofolate to generate glutamic acid and 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate, and the cyclodeaminase activity then converts the 5-formiminotetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate and ammonia. FTCD is an octameric enzyme with eight identical subunits arranged in a planar ring (23Beaudet R. MacKenzie R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We examined parameters of rat FTCD association with the Golgi and show that the binding is tight but not dependent on presence of intact microtubules. Interestingly, FTCD appears to be a dynamic component of the Golgi and cycles between the Golgi and earlier compartments of the secretory pathway. FTCD remains associated with membranes in the presence of BFA, but the protein rapidly redistributes from the Golgi, utilizing a temporal and spatial pathway distinct from that used by mannosidase II. FTCD therefore represents a novel marker with which to explore ER-Golgi dynamics. The Golgi complex plays a key role in the processing and sorting of proteins destined for secretion or delivery to other intracellular compartments (1Mellman I. Simons K.

https://openalex.org/W2076897294,"We have demonstrated previously that growth hormone (GH) activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and this activation results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of two FAK substrates, namely paxillin and tensin. We now show here in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with rat GH receptor cDNA that human (h)GH induces the formation of a large multiprotein signaling complex centered around another FAK-associated protein, p130Cas and the adaptor protein CrkII. hGH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p130Cas and CrkII, their association, and the association of multiple other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the complex. Both the c-Src and c-Fyn tyrosine kinases are tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by cellular hGH stimulation and form part of the multiprotein signaling complex as does tensin, paxillin, IRS-1, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, C3G, SHC, Grb-2, and Sos-1. c-Cbl and Nck are also tyrosine-phosphorylated by cellular stimulation with hGH and associate with the p130Cas-CrkII complex. c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) is activated in response to hGH in accordance with the formation of the abovementioned signaling complex, and hGH stimulated JNK/SAPK activity is increased in CrkII overexpressing NIH3T3 cells compared with vector transfected NIH3T3 cells. The formation of such a large multiprotein signaling complex by GH, with the resultant activation of multiple downstream effector molecules, may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH.

Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It possesses diverse and pleiotropic effects on the growth, differentiation, and metabolism of cells. GH is thought to initiate its biological actions, including induction of a number of RNA species in mammalian tissues by interaction with a specific membrane-bound receptor (2Kelly P.A. Ali S. Rozakis M. Goujon L. Nagano M. Pelligrini I. Gould D. Djiane J. Edery M. Finidori J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 123-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GH receptor is phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation presumably by the physical association of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 (3Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The JAK kinases are linked to transcriptional regulation and JAK activation results in the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of latent cytoplasmic STAT transcription factors (4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The activated STAT factors bind to their appropriate DNA-responsive elements to activate gene transcription (4Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Other diverse actions of GH include the stimulation of chemotaxis and migration of monocytic cells (5Wiedermann C.J. Reinisch N. Braunsteiner H. Blood. 1993; 82: 954-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concordantly, we have demonstrated that GH stimulates the re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells with fibroblastic morphology (6Goh E.L.K. Pircher T.J. Wood T.J. Norstedt G. Graichen R. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and reported that this re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton requires the activity of PI 3-kinase. Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) has been postulated to play a central role in the response of the cell to the extracellular matrix (for review, see Ref. 7Guan J.L. Chen H.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 168: 81-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in cell morphology and motility (for review, see Ref. 8Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of FAK stimulates cell migration (9Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and both FAK-deficient endodermal and mesodermal cells migrate slower than their FAK replete counterparts (10Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 11Ilic D. Kanazawa S. Furuta Y. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effect of FAK on the cytoskeleton is presumably mediated by the formation of a p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate)-CrkII complex (12Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) in association with c-Src (for review, see Ref. 13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that GH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and two of its substrates, paxillin and tensin, and that FAK associates with JAK2 and requires the JAK2 binding site on the GH receptor for its phosphorylation (14Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10682-10689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that hGH also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p130Cas and CrkII, their association, and the association of multiple other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to the complex including the c-Src and c-Fyn protein-tyrosine kinases, Nck, c-Cbl, tensin, paxillin, IRS-1, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHC, Grb-2, Sos-1, and C3G. Finally we demonstrate that JNK/SAPK is activated in response to hGH in accordance with the formation of the p130Cas-CrkII complex (15Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The formation of such a large multiprotein signaling complex, with the potential downstream activation of multiple signaling pathways, may be central to many of the pleiotropic effects of GH, including cytoskeletal re-organization, cell migration, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, and/or prevention of apoptosis and gene transcription.

Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable integrants were selected using 1000 μg/ml G418. The complete rat GH receptor cDNA (17Mathews L.S. Enberg B. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9905-9910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) coding for amino acids 1–638 was expressed in CHO4–638 or CHOA-638 cells (16Möller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and will be referred to as CHO-GHR1–638. Both cell clones transfected with the full-length receptor cDNA behaved identically for the experiments described here. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with CrkII cDNA, and the control vector transfected NIH3T3 cells have been described previously (18Blakesley V.A. Beitner-Johnson D. Van Brocklyn J.R. Rani S.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with rat growth hormone receptor were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (F-12) plus 10% v/v fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C as described previously (16Möller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented as above. CHO cells were grown to confluence, incubated 16 h in serum-free medium, washed twice in serum-free medium, and stimulated with the indicated dose of hGH for the indicated time periods. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min with regular vortices. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and the resulting supernatants collected and protein concentration determined. 800 μg of protein was used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were routinely performed by incubating lysates with 2–4 μg/ml amounts of the respective antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected either by incubating with 50 μl of protein G-agarose for 1 h (polyclonal antisera) or by incubating with 5 μg/lysate anti-mouse IgG for 1 h followed by 1-h incubation with protein G-agarose (monoclonal antibodies). Immunoprecipitations were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard electroblotting procedures. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with either 3% insulin-free bovine serum albumin (for phosphotyrosine immunoblotting) or 5% non-fat dry milk (for other immunoblotting) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 22 °C. Blots were then immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with PY20 (1:1000), FAK monoclonal antibody (1:1000), paxillin monoclonal antibody (1:1000), tensin monoclonal antibody (1:250), Nck monoclonal antibody (1:1000), p130Casmonoclonal antibody (1:1000), CrkII monoclonal antibody (1:2500), c-Fyn monoclonal antibody (1:250), Grb-2 monoclonal antibody (1:5000), p85 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), IRS-1 monoclonal antibody (1:250), p130Cas polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Cbl polyclonal antiserum (1:250), Nck polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Src polyclonal antiserum (1:250), c-Src monoclonal antibody (1:250), c-Fyn polyclonal antibody (1:250), C3G polyclonal antiserum (1:250), FAK polyclonal antiserum (1:250), and Sos-1 polyclonal antiserum (1:250). Immunolabeling was detected by ECL (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were stripped and re-probed with the same antibodies used for their immunoprecipitation to ensure equal loading of the immunoprecipitated protein. Blots were stripped by incubation for 30 min at 50 °C in a solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, blots were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. Densitometry was performed by using the GS-700 imaging densitometer from Bio-Rad according to the manufacturer's instructions. Src and Fyn kinase assays were performed as described according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). In brief, supernatant containing 150 μg of protein per sample derived from cells stimulated with hGH was incubated with 1 μg of Src polyclonal antibody or 1 μg of Fyn polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight in a final volume of 500 μl. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. 10 μl (150 μm final concentration) of the substrate peptide, 10 μl of Src reaction buffer, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP stock were added to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate peptides, and a 25-μl aliquot was transferred onto the center of a numbered P81 paper square. The assay squares were washed three times for 5 min each with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone. The assay squares were transferred to a scintillation vial, 5 ml of scintillation mixture added, and the level of radioactivity determined in a scintillation counter. JNK/SAPK assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, CHO-GHR1–638 cells were serum-deprived for 16 h, treated with 50 nm hGH, and the cells lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin) per sample. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of N-terminal c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a final volume of 500 μl in 1 × lysis buffer. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm glycerol phosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. c-Jun phosphorylation was selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific c-Jun antibodies (1:1000 dilution) recognizing phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63. All experiments were repeated at least three times, usually five to seven times. Figures presented for Western blot analyses are representative of multiple experiments. The text under “Results” summarizes the results from multiple Western blot analyses. Consequently, the text in the results section (e.g. description of the time course of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) may not exactly correspond to the actual figure presented. All numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed ttest or analysis of variance. We have reported previously that hGH stimulation of CHO-GHR1–638 cells results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and two of its substrates, namely paxillin and tensin (14Zhu T. Goh E.L.K. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10682-10689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another protein associated with FAK is p130Cas, although it is apparent that p130Casis tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src protein tyrosine kinase family members associated with FAK (19Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine whether hGH could also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, we first treated CHO-GHR1–638 cells for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH, prepared cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with PY20. SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting for p130Cas revealed a hGH- and time-dependent increase in the level of p130Casprotein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A). p130Casprotein was identified as a single band of 130 kDa. Some basal level of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum-deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Caswas observed between 5 and 30 min after stimulation, with the relative level of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We next immunoprecipitated p130Cas from cell extracts of CHO-GHR1–638 cells and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis with PY20. We observed the consistent presence of a time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 130 kDa, which co-migrated with p130Cas protein (Fig.2 A). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 was observed first at 2 min, persisted to 30 min, and then declined at 60 min. p130Cas has been reported to associate with FAK in a Src-dependent manner (for review, see Ref. 13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Other hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were also observed in the p130Cas immunoprecipitates and will be discussed below. However, one of these hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins possessed a molecular mass of 125 kDa. We therefore proceeded to determine the effect of cellular stimulation with hGH on the association state between p130Cas and p125FAK. Immunoprecipitation of p130Cas from cell extracts and Western blot analysis for FAK revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of FAK with p130Cas(Fig. 2 C). Constitutive association between FAK and p130Cas was observed, and hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased p130Cas-FAK association observed first at 2 min, maximal between 5–30 min, and then followed by a decline to 60 min. Thus hGH stimulated the formation of a FAK-p130Cascomplex. p130Cas has also been reported to associate with the adaptor protein CrkII (19Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis for p130Casrevealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of p130Cas with CrkII (Fig. 2 E). hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased p130Cas-CrkII association between 2 and 30 min and followed by a decline at 60 min.Figure 2A, time dependence of the hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in CHO cells stably transfected with GH receptor cDNA (CHO-GHR1–638). CHO-GHR1–638 cells were stimulated with 50 nmhGH for the indicated time periods, cell extracts prepared, and p130Cas protein immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for tyrosine phosphorylation with the use of PY20. The loading control for p130Cas is shown in B. The arrowheadmarks the position of the tyrosine-phosphorylated band detected at 130 kDa.

The loading control for p130Cas is shown in D. Thearrowhead marks the position of p125FAK detected at 125 kDa.

CHO-GHR1–638 cells were stimulated with 50 nmhGH for the indicated time periods, cell extracts prepared, and CrkII protein immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for p130Cas. The loading control for CrkII is shown in F. The arrowhead marks the position of p130Cas detected at 130 kDa. The position of the molecular mass standards is indicated on the right-hand side. The data presented are representative of at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether hGH could also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII, we examined the level of CrkII protein in the phosphotyrosine (PY20) immunoprecipitates from extracts of cells treated with hGH (Fig. 1 B). CrkII protein was identified as a doublet band of 40 and 42 kDa concordant with previous reports demonstrating the existence of 40- and 42-kDa CrkII (22Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); the 42-kDa CrkII being a phosphorylated form of CrkII with subsequent slower electrophoretic migration (23.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Some basal level of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in serum deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The 42-kDa CrkII was the major tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII species following hGH stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII was observed between 2 and 30 min after stimulation, with the relative level of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. From the above results it is apparent that CrkII is a component of a larger signaling complex. We therefore immunoprecipitated CrkII from cell extracts of CHO-GHR1–638 cells stimulated for 0–60 min with 50 nm hGH and examined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkII-associated proteins by Western blot analysis with PY20 (Fig. 3 A). We observed the consistent presence of major time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 130, 125, 120, 85 (not obvious on blot presented), 68, 62, 60, 47, and 42 kDa. The tyrosine-phosphorylated band at 42 kDa co-migrated with the 42-kDa CrkII protein. The other hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins associated with CrkII have been identified below. Other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were obscured by the presence of the IgG heavy chains. Also, when conditions of separation and transfer were optimized, larger molecular mass proteins at 180 and 215 kDa associated with CrkII were also observed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cellular stimulation with hGH (identified below as IRS-1 and tensin, respectively). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII and CrkII-associated proteins was generally observed first at 2 min, persisted to 30 min, and then declined at 60 min. We also proceeded to determine the effect of cellular stimulation with hGH on the association state between CrkII and FAK. Immunoprecipitation of CrkII from cell extracts and Western blot analysis for FAK revealed a time- and hGH-dependent association of FAK with CrkII (Fig. 3 C). hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased FAK-CrkII association observed first at 2 min, maximal between 2 and 30 min, and then followed by a decline at 60 min. We also performed the reciprocal experiment with immunoprecipitation of FAK protein and immunoblotting for the presence of CrkII protein. This experiment depicted in Fig. 3 E also similarly demonstrated the hGH dependence of the FAK-CrkII association. Thus hGH stimulated the formation of a FAK-p130Cas-CrkII complex of signal-transducing proteins. c-Src has been reported to associate with FAK and is responsible for full tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK molecule as well as serving as an adaptor molecule for the association of FAK and p130Cas (for review, see Ref.13Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We also observed above the presence of a hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 60 kDa associated with the CrkII-p130Cas complex. To determine whether hGH could also stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src, we immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cell extracts with PY20 and observed by Western blot analysis for c-Src, a hGH-and time-dependent increase in the level of c-Src protein in the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C). c-Src protein was identified as a single band of 60 kDa. c-Src was basally tyrosine-phosphorylated in serum-deprived cells. hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was first observed 2 min after stimulation. The maximal hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was observed between 2 and 15 min after stimulation, with the relative level of c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation decreasing at 60 min. We also performed the reciprocal experiment by immunoprecipitation of c-Src and Western blot analysis with PY20 and observed a major time- and hGH-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of 60 kDa, which co-migrated with c-Src protein (Fig.4 A). Increased hGH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was also observed first at 2 min, persisted to 15 min, and then declined at 30 and 60 min. We next proceeded to determine the association state between c-Src and FAK and the p130Cas-CrkII complex. We demonstrated a time- and hGH-dependent association of c-Src with FAK by immunoprecipitation of FAK from cell extracts and subsequent Western blot analysis for c-Src (Fig. 4 C). c-Src and FAK were observed to be associated in the unstimulated state (upon longer exposure of the membrane), and hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased c-Src-FAK association between 2 and 15 min, followed by a decline to 60 min. Similarly we also demonstrated a time- and hGH-dependent association of c-Src with the p130Cas-CrkII complex by immunoprecipitation of p130Cas from cell extracts followed by Western blot analysis for c-Src (Fig. 4 E). A basal level of association between c-Src and p130Cas was observed and hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased c-Src/p130Cas association between 2 and 15 min and then followed by a decline to 60 min. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src can either stimulate (Tyr-416) or inhibit (Tyr-527) Src kinase activity (24Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We therefore examined Src kinase activity in the cell after hGH stimulation using a specific assay. Cells were therefore cultured to confluence, stimulated with 50 nm hGH, and Src kinase activity measured. hGH stimulation of cells resulted in increased Src kinase activity, maximal at 2 min and followed by a decline to 60 min (Fig. 4 G). Thus hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src resulted in an initial increase in Src kinase activity followed by a decline to basal levels. Interestingly though, the hGH-stimulated increase in Src kinase activity was only observed in cells grown to confluence, and no hGH stimulation of Src kinase activity was observed in su"

https://openalex.org/W1983788571,"The growth suppressor p53 is an important key element which controls cell cycle progression in response to cellular stress like DNA damage. Its ability to act as transcriptional activator or repressor links transcription and cell cycle control. Several target genes selectively transactivated by p53 are implicated in growth control, apoptosis and DNA repair. Here we report the interaction of p53 with another important dual player of cell cycle control and transcription, the protein kinase complex CDK7/cyclin H/Mat1 (CDK activating kinase, CAK kinase). This is implicated in the activating phosphorylation of CDK2/cyclin A kinase required to allow cells to proceed through the G1/S transition, and on the other hand, as a component of the basal transcription factor TFIIH found to be necessary for CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in order to allow elongation of transcription. Based on previous binding studies of p53 with other C-terminal interaction partners of p53 we demonstrate a direct physical interaction of p53 with cyclin H in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence of this interaction we tested the influence of p53 on the kinase activity of CAK kinase for CTD and CDK2 phosphorylation. The addition of wild type p53 to the kinase reactions resulted in a significant downregulation of CDK2 phosphorylation and CTD phosphorylation by the CDK activating kinase. On the other hand addition of a mutant p53His175 failed to downregulate CDK2 and CTD phosphorylation by the CDK activating kinase. In an attempt to support our findings in vivo we measured CAK kinase activity in p21−/− and p53−/− mice embryonal fibroblasts under conditions when p53 gets activated by irradiation. In the case of p21−/− cells this led to a significant reduction of CTD phosphorylation activity of the CDK activating kinase by irradiation of the cells. On the other hand in p53−/− cells no downregulation of CTD phosphorylation activity of CAK kinase was observed indicating that this kind of negative regulation of CAK kinase activity is exclusively due to a functional p53. These findings imply a direct involvement of p53 in triggering growth arrest by its interaction with the CDK activating kinase complex without the need of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) and potentially suggest a new mechanism for p53-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2101125191,"Prior studies have identified Fibroblast Growth Factor-8 (Fgf8) as a possible proto-oncogene in mouse mammary tumorigenesis. We now report on the generation of two types of Fgf8 transgenic mice that each utilize the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. The first transgene (MMTV-Fgf8b) results in the overexpression of the FGF8b isoform exclusively. Male and female MMTV-Fgf8b transgenic mice are viable and fertile. RNA for FGF8b is detected in mammary gland and salivary gland tissues of transgenic mice by Northern blot analysis. Nearly 85% of breeding transgenic female mice developed mammary lobular adenocarcinomas by 12 months of age, while no tumors developed in non-transgenic littermates. Salivary gland tumors occurred in some animals, always in association with mammary tumors. Several MMTV-Fgf8b transgenic mice had lung metastases at necropsy. The second transgene (MMTV-Fgf8) uses the entire Fgf8 gene and potentially encodes all FGF8 isoforms. Fgf8 is expressed by this transgene in several tissues in addition to those described above, notably the ovaries. The two MMTV-Fgf8 founders developed mammary ductal adenocarcinomas at five and eight months of age, and both displayed ovarian stromal hyperplasia. The founders expressing either transgene did not successfully nurse their pups. These results demonstrate that production of FGF8b, and possibly other FGF8 isoforms, in the mammary and salivary glands contributes to oncogenesis, and that ovarian expression results in stromal hyperplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2074948897,"Jurkat cells express Fas, and rapidly undergo apoptosis in response to Fas ligand or an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. This apoptotic pathway is mediated by a cascade of caspases. In this report, we show that Fas activation induced the processing of caspase 8 in Jurkat cells with a time frame similar to the activation of caspase 3 and the proteolysis of nuclear proteins. Jurkat cell transformants that overexpress Bcl-2 were partially but not completely resistant to the Fas-induced apoptosis. Little processing of caspase 8 was observed upon Fas activation in these transformants. Furthermore, although caspase 8 was recruited to Fas upon Fas activation in the parental Jurkat cells, the recruitment of caspase 8 to Fas was inhibited in the transformants overexpressing Bcl-2. These results suggest that Bcl-2 inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis by preventing the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex that is composed of Fas, FADD/MORT1, and caspase 8."

https://openalex.org/W2007828430,"The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) has been shown to regulate the activity of Lck and Fyn protein tyrosine kinases in T cells. However, it is not clear that these constitute the only CD45 substrates. Moreover, the manner by which PTPase activity and substrate recruitment are regulated, is poorly understood. Previousin vitro studies suggest that the first cytoplasmic PTPase domain (D1) of CD45 is the active PTPase, which may be regulated by an enzymatically inactive second PTPase domain (D2). However, the function of CD45 D2 in vivo is unknown. In this study, reconstitution of CD45− T cells with specific CD45 PTPase mutants allowed demonstration of a critical role for D2 in TCR-mediated interleukin (IL)-2 production. Specifically, replacement of CD45 D2 with that of the LAR PTPase to form a CD45/LAR:D2 chimera, abrogates CD45-dependent IL-2 production. This effect cannot be accounted for by loss of PTPase activity per se. The expression of D1 substrate-trapping mutants reveals an in vivo interaction between CD45 and TCR-ζ that is dependent on CD45 D2. Thus, cells expressing CD45 lacking D2 exhibit abnormal TCR-mediated signaling characterized by hyperphosphorylation of ζ and deficient ZAP-70 phosphorylation.

Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 6Mustelin T.

A. 1993; 90: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, subsequent analysis demonstrated that CD45 can also down-regulate Fyn and Lck activity by dephosphorylating their positive regulatory autophosphorylation sites (9Burns C.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10D'Oro U. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4996-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is also not clear that these PTKs constitute the only CD45 substrates. Cytoplasmic PTPases appear to be targeted to their appropriate substrates by protein interaction and cellular localization motifs (11Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Such interactions with target proteins may also enhance the activity of these PTPases (12Leichleider R. Sugimoto S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, for transmembrane PTPases, very little is known about how substrate specificity and activity are regulated. Recent evidence indicates that the extracellular domain is able to regulate signaling through the cytoplasmic PTPase domains (14Novak T. Farber D.L. Leitenberg D. Hong S.-C. Johnson J. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this regard, most transmembrane PTPases, including CD45, share tandem PTPase domains (18Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L. Schlossman S. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Curiously, the second PTPase domain (D2) of most of these molecules appears to have little or no PTPase activity against various in vitro substrates. Furthermore, PTPase consensus sequences in D2 are less well conserved than in domain 1 (D1), and in some cases, key residues required for enzymatic activity (for example, the catalytic center Cys residue), are absent (20Krueger N. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 21Krueger N. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7417-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Such findings suggest an alternative role for D2 in transmembrane PTPases. In the case of CD45, mutation of the D1 catalytic center Cys to Ser (position 828) completely abrogates in vitro PTPase activity (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas, mutation of the analogous Cys to Ser in D2 (position 1144), has no effect. While, deletion of D2 in its entirety destabilizes D1 rendering it inactive (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), small deletions within D2 strikingly alter the relative activity of CD45 against various substrates in vitro. These results suggest that D2 is not an active PTPase but may play a regulatory role for D1 (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been reported that deletion of large portions of D1 can activate D2 in vitro (24Tan X. Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6835-6838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least raising the possibility that D2 could have cryptic PTPase activity in vivo. Although Cys to Ser (CS) mutation of the catalytic center inactivates PTPase activity, substrate binding is preserved and substrate trapping within the enzyme active site is actually promoted (19Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 25Black D. Bliska J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-CD45 fusion proteins containing CS mutation of D1 were able to co-precipitate phospho-ζ from lysates obtained from activated Jurkat cells (26Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When D1 was active, phospho-ζ was no longer co-precipitated, suggesting that ζ might be a direct substrate for CD45 D1. Swapping either CD45 D1 or D2 with the corresponding domain from the LAR PTPase prevented this in vitro association. These findings suggested that CD45 D2 may influence D1 by playing a role in substrate recruitment. To establish a regulatory role for D2 among transmembrane PTPases and identify in vivo substrates critical to our understanding of CD45 function, we now address the physiologic role of CD45 D2 and substrate recruitment of ζ in TCR-mediated signal transduction. We have transfected a CD45− version of the Jurkat human leukemic T cell line with either wild-type CD45 or PTPase mutants. Direct comparison of these cell lines demonstrates that IL-2 production is dependent on an intact CD45 D1 PTPase. Importantly, we now show that CD45 D2 is also critical for IL-2 production. However, this is not related to loss of D2 PTPase activity per se, nor by a requirement for D2 in the interaction between CD45 and Lck. While enzymatically inactive substrate-trapping mutants of CD45 D1 coprecipitate phospho-ζ, this interaction is dependent on the presence of CD45 D2. Despite active CD45 D1, replacement of CD45 D2 with that of LAR resulted in hyperphosphorylation of TCR-ζ and deficient activation-induced phosphorylation of ZAP-70. These data support a mechanism whereby CD45 D2 regulates IL-2 production through the recruitment of TCR-ζ as a CD45 substrate. The CD45(0) construct encodes wild-type (wt) CD45 PTPase domains in the context of the smallest CD45 extracellular domain under control of the SRα promoter (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L.

Plasmids encoding the isolated CD45 cytoplasmic domains containing CS point mutations of: D1 (position 828), D2 (position 1144), or wt CD45 D1 (amino acids 584–895) fused to wt LAR D2 (amino acids 1590–1881) (26Furukawa T.

Using convenient restriction sites, segments of these constructs were used to replace the analogous wt region of CD45(0) generating full-length (transmembrane) CD45 PTPase mutants. A double mutant, containing CS mutations in both D1 and D2, was generated usingPstI sites. Using polymerase chain reaction, a CS mutation was inserted into position 828 of D2:LAR to generate D1:CS/D2:LAR. DNA sequencing (Keck Biotechnology Center, Yale University) confirmed the expected mutation. The CD4+CD45− J-AS Jurkat clone lacks endogenous CD45 expression by virtue of a stably integrated antisense gene targeting the 5′-untranslated region of CD45 (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L.

J-AS was transfected with CD45(0) constructs encoding either wt or mutant PTPase domains along with the PGK-hyg vector by electroporation, as described (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant clones were screened for CD45 expression by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Two previously described clones expressing the wt CD45R0 isoform, J(0)-2 and J(0)-3, were also used in these studies (16Onodera H. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% iron-fortified calf serum,l-glutamine, and gentamycin. Transfectants were removed from G418 and hygromycin for 7–10 days before use in assays. Cell phenotype was routinely monitored for CD3, CD4, and CD45 expression using commercially available mAbs and analyzed on a FACSTAR IV (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) (10,000 cells/sample), as described (15McKenney D.W.

Anti-CD45 (9.4) and anti-CD3 (OKT3) hybridomas were from the ATCC. mAbs were purified from culture supernatants using Protein-A-Sepharose according to standard methods. The following were kindly provided as gifts: anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mAb 4G10 (from Dr. B. Drucker, University of Oregon, Portland, OR), anti-ζ mAb 6B10.2 (from Dr. A.

Rudd, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). 105 cells/well in triplicate flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates were stimulated with anti-CD3 (OKT3) (from 0.1 to 0.01 μg/ml) plus goat anti-mouse cross-linking (at a 1:1 ratio with OKT3). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1 ng/ml) was added to all wells, as described (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). IL-2 secretion in 20-h cell culture supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Genzyme Corp.). In each experiment, the data were normalized to the response of transfectants expressing (wt) CD45(0) to 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

IL-2 secretion after stimulation with 1 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1 μm ionomycin, was used as a positive control. As described previously (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L.

At the indicated times, ice-cold stop solution (phosphate-buffered saline with phosphatase inhibitors) was added, cells were pelleted and lysed in ice-cold 1% Brij-97 lysis buffer (CD45 immunoprecipitation) or 1% Nonidet P-40 (ζ immunoprecipitation) containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mmsodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, as described (15McKenney D.W.

Briefly, after preclearing, postnuclear supernatants containing equivalent amounts of protein (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad) were incubated with antibody, followed by immunoprecipitation with Protein A-Sepharose (UBI). Immunoprecipitates or postnuclear supernatants (whole cell lysates) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked (5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline), probed with primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells expressing either CD45(0) or D2:LAR were lysed in 1% digitonin, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, AEBSF, aprotinin, and leupeptin (as above), followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CD45, anti-Lck, or control rabbit anti-mouse Ab. After washing 4 times, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm MnCl2 plus 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), for 15 min, as described (30Ross S. Schraven B. Goldman F.D. Crabtree J. Koretzky G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sepharose beads were then washed twice in lysis buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, run on 12% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. After lysis in 0.5% Triton X-100 containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and AEBSF, aprotinin, and leupeptin (as above), CD45 immunoprecipitates from each cell line were extensively washed and resuspended in 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.2), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA with 5 mm dithiothreitol. Equal amounts of each CD45 protein, as confirmed by Western analysis, were analyzed for PTPase activity using the tyrosine phosphatase assay (Promega Corp., Madison WI) which determines the concentration of free phosphate released from a tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptide substrate by the absorbance of a molybdate-malachite green-phosphate complex. Both phosphopeptide substrates, END(pY)INASL and DADE(pY)LIPQQG, supplied with the assay gave equivalent results. Because of the potential regulatory role of the CD45 extracellular domain (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol.

Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29102-29111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32McFarland E. Thomas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28103-28107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the physiologic function of the CD45 PTPase domains was addressed using intact transmembrane CD45 molecules. To this end, CD45− J-AS Jurkat cells were stably transfected to express either wild-type (wt) CD45, or PTPase mutations in the context of the smallest (CD45RO or CD45(0)) extracellular domain. The J-AS parental cell line was initially generated by means of antisense gene targeting of endogenous CD45, as we described (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These cells combine specific targeting of CD45 with expression levels that are undetectable by Western analysis. J-AS cells were stably transfected with (wt) CD45(0), inactivating CS point mutation of the catalytic center of CD45 domain 1 (D1:CS), domain 2 (D2:CS), or domains 1 and 2 (D1:CS/D2:CS) (see Fig.1). In addition, chimeric proteins containing D2 of the LAR PTPase, either in the context of active CD45 D1 (D2:LAR) or inactive CD45 D1 (D1:CS/D2:LAR) were expressed. The transfectants expressed similar levels of CD45, CD3, and CD4 (See Fig.2). Expression of only a single CD45 isoform of 180 kDa was confirmed by Western blotting (as seen in Fig.6 C). Two independent transfected clones expressing each CD45 construct were selected for these studies.Figure 2Phenotypic analysis of surface expression of transfectants. Representative immunofluorescence analysis of CD45, CD4, and CD3 expression of J-AS and (J-AS derived) transfectants expressing various CD45 constructs as noted.

Transfectants before and after stimulation with phenyl arsine oxide/pervanadate were lysed in Brij-97. Equivalent amounts of each lysate were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD45 followed by resolution on 12.5% SDS-PAGE (reducing conditions) and immunoblotting with polyclonal α-Zeta (Panel A). The membrane was stripped and reprobed using α-Tyr(P) (Panel B). 4 × 106 cell equivalents of each lysate used for the immunoprecipitates above were run on 6% SDS-PAGE (non-reducing) and immunoblotted with anti-CD45 (Panel C). L.C. denotes light chain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Before examining the effects of these CD45 mutations on cellular function, the PTPase activity of each was examined in vitro(see Fig. 3). Consistent with previous analysis of isolated cytoplasmic domains, CS mutation of D1 (D1:CS), or D1 and D2 (D1:CS/D2:CS), abrogates the PTPase activity of intact CD45 molecules immunoprecipitated from each transfectant. Likewise, CS mutation of CD45 D2 alone (D2:CS) was without detectable effect (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,23Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, comparison of the D2:LAR chimera to wild-type CD45 (CD45(0) shows that the chimeric protein retains full catalytic activity (Fig. 3). This is not surprising, since D2 of both LAR and CD45 lack activity in vitro and are believed to share similar structure based on conservation of grouped residues at key positions and ∼40% overall amino acid identity (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 33Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Tsai A.M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To examine the in vivo role of CD45 D2, TCR-mediated IL-2 production was assessed (See Fig. 4). In agreement with our previous results, CD45− J-AS cells produce only small amounts of IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 stimulation and IL-2 production is reconstituted by expression of the CD45(0) isoform (15McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression of CD45 containing CS mutations of both D1 and D2 eliminates the restoration of IL-2 production, confirming the principal role of PTPase activity in CD45 function. Consistent with results suggesting that CD45 D1 contains most if not all of the detectable PTPase activity (Fig. 3) (22Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mutation of CD45 D1 alone (D1:CS) also prevented IL-2 secretion, whereas, mutation of the D2 catalytic center (D2:CS) resulted in only a small decrease in IL-2 production that was not statistically different from wt CD45(0). Similar results were obtained using concentrations of anti-CD3 ranging from 0.1 to .01 mg/ml (Fig. 4). Each cell line displayed a similar inherent capacity to produce IL-2 when the proximal signaling apparatus was bypassed using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (data not shown). These data indicate that if D2 does exhibit cryptic PTPase activity in vivo, it does not play a significant role in TCR-induced IL-2 production. Concordantly, expression of chimeric proteins containing active CD45 D1 (in the presence of wt or inactive D2) in CD45− cells was necessary and sufficient to reconstitute TCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and dephosphorylate Lck at its carboxyl-terminal regulatory site (34Desai D. Sap J. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. EMBO. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,36Niklinska B.B. Hou D. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8078-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results cast doubt on physiologically significant PTPase activity of CD45 D2 in vivo. Lack of PTPase activity does not preclude important function. Therefore, to further examine the role of CD45 D2 in IL-2 production, D2 of CD45 was replaced with that of the LAR PTPase, generating a catalytically active chimeric protein containing CD45 D1 and LAR D2 (D2:LAR). In marked contrast to the results obtained with point mutation of the D2 catalytic center (D2:CS), replacement of CD45 D2 with that of LAR (D2:LAR) abrogated the ability of CD45 to promote IL-2 production (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained using various anti-CD3 concentrations. These results suggest that CD45 D2 plays an important regulatory role in CD45 function and this is not explained by loss of D2 PTPase activity per se. One explanation for these findings is that CD45 D2 plays an important role in substrate recruitment. In this regard, Lck acts as a CD45 substrate and co-precipitates with CD45 in non-disruptive detergents (30Ross S. Schraven B. Goldman F.D. Crabtree J. Koretzky G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although Lck interacts with the CD45 cytoplasmic domain (39Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morihawa T. Soula-Rothnut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Alitalo U. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell.

To determine whether D2 is required for this interaction, we compared overall and CD45-associated Lck activity in cells expressing either CD45(0) or D2:LAR using immune complex kinase assays. As seen in Fig.5 A, equivalent Lck activity, as measured by Lck autophosphorylation (56–60 kDa band), is precipitated from both cell lines. Thus, loss of CD45 D2 does not appear to affect overall Lck activity. CD45 immunoprecipitates from both transfectants reveal autophosphorylated Lck, as well as associated LPAP (32–34 kDa) which undergoes in vitro phosphorylation in this assay, as described (30Ross S.

https://openalex.org/W2150869416,"Calmodulin (CaM) has been reported to have affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER). Observations reported here reveal a direct physical interaction between purified CaM and ER. This direct ER-CaM interaction may be an initial event preceding the assembly of ER plus auxiliary proteins into the active ER complex with its DNA motif, the estrogen response element. We demonstrate that CaM is an integral component of this complex by using a system reconstituted from purified ER and nuclear extract from ER-negative breast cancer cells and also with ER-depleted nuclear extract of an ER-positive breast cancer cell line. Although CaM is essential for formation of this complex, it is not sufficient, suggesting roles also of auxiliary proteins. CaM also is functionally required for activation of an ER-responsive promoter, in the 17beta-estradiol-ER pathway of hormone action and regulation of 17beta-estradiol-responsive gene expression that is associated with proliferation of mammary epithelial cells."

These findings should facilitate our understanding of the regulation of β4-integrin gene expression in processes such as cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, and cancer development and metastasis. Integrins comprise a superfamily of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules, each consisting of a dimer of specific α- and β-subunits (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). The β4-subunit specifically associates with the α6-subunit and functions as a receptor for laminins 1, 2, 4, and 5 (2Lee E.C. Lotz M.M. Steele Jr., G.D. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). α6β4-Integrin is expressed at the basal surface of most epithelia and binds to the anchoring filaments as a component of the hemidesmosome, a rigid adhesive microstructure (3Green K.J. Jones J.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The functional importance of β4-integrin in cell adhesion was demonstrated by a recent study on β4-knock-out mice, in which the hemidesmosomes were disrupted, resulting in erosion and blistering of the skin (4Dowling J. Yu Q.C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 5van der Neut R. Krimpenfort P. Calafat J. Niessen C.M. Sonnenberg A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Patients with a hereditary skin blistering disorder called junctional epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia show reduced numbers, or even absence, of hemidesmosomes in the skin due to mutation of this gene (6Niessen C.M. van der Raaij-Helmer M.H. Hulsman E.H. van der Neut R. Jonkman M.F. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β4-Integrin expression has been found to be restricted to proliferating basal keratinocytes and to be suppressed when differentiation commences (7Tennenbaum T. Li L. Belanger A.J. De Luca L.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar). β4-Integrin was initially identified as a tumor-associated antigen, defined by the monoclonal antibody A9 raised against human squamous cell carcinoma (8Kimmel K.A. Carey T.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3614-3623PubMed Google Scholar, 9Van Waes C. Kozarsky K.F. Warren A.B. Kidd L. Paugh D. Liebert M. Carey T.E.

Oncol. 1993; 49: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An extreme example of altered expression is seen in thyroid carcinomas; normal thyroid follicular cells do not express β4-integrin at all, but thyroid cancer cells contain high levels (15Serini G. Trusolino L. Saggiorato E. Cremona O. De Rossi M. Angeli A. Orlandi F. Marchisio P.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An association between enhanced β4-integrin expression and early recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma has been demonstrated (8Kimmel K.A. Carey T.E. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3614-3623PubMed Google Scholar), and β4-integrin expression levels have been found to correlate with the degree of invasiveness of colon carcinoma cells (16Falcioni R. Turchi V. Vittulo P. Navarra G. Ficari F. Cavaliere F. Sacchi A. Mariani-Costantini R. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 573-578PubMed Google Scholar) and with high metastatic potential of lung cancer and melanoma cell lines (17Falcioni R. Kennel S.J. Giacomini P. Zupi G. Sacchi A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5772-5778PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of β4-integrin into colon carcinoma cells enhances their ability to invade laminin matrices (18Chao C. Lotz M.M. Clarke A.C. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4811-4819PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other β-subunits, β4-integrin has an exceptionally large cytoplasmic domain, which associates with cytoskeletal and signaling molecules (19Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. von dem Borne A.E. Sonnenberg A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and it regulates cell proliferation through Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (20Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumemberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Recently, α6β4-integrin was found to activate phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathways upon binding to laminin-1 (21Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The enhanced cell migration resulting from formation and stabilization of actin-containing structures may account for the aggressive behavior of β4-integrin-expressing cancers (22Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). By contrast, β4-integrin expression has been shown to be reduced in basal cell carcinoma of the skin (23Sollberg S. Peltonen J. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and adenocarcinoma of the breast (24Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Botti C. Mottolese M. Bigotti A. Segatto O. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and prostate (25Cress A.E. Rabinovitz I. Zhu W. Nagle R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Invasive types of urinary bladder carcinoma have been found to have lost co-localized β4-integrin and collagen-VII (26Liebert M. Washington R. Wedemeyer G. Carey T.E. Grossman H.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 787-795PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection of β4-integrin into human urinary bladder carcinoma cells has been found to inhibit cell growth and lead to apoptosis (27Kim S.Y. Bachman N.J. Nair T.S. Goldsmith S. Liebert M. Grossman H.B. Lomax M.I. Carey T.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar) by inducing a cell cycle inhibitor, p21 (28Clarke A.S. Lotz M.M. Chao C. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22673-22676Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that β4-integrin has complicated dual functions. Although several studies have shown the significance of altered β4-integrin expression, the mechanism responsible for regulating β4-integrin expression has not been elucidated. β4-Integrin expression seems to be regulated, at least partly, at the transcription level (7Tennenbaum T. Li L. Belanger A.J. De Luca L.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 615-628PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the mechanism responsible for β4-integrin gene expression and the transcriptional basis for cancer invasion and metastasis, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the β4-integrin gene and identified several cis-acting elements. Below, we report that cooperative transactivation by AP1, Ets, MyoD, and other factors is involved in the complicated transcriptional regulation of the β4-integrin gene. A human placental genomic DNA library constructed in the phage vector λ-FIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by plaque hybridization using a 623-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RLU, relative luciferase units. fragment corresponding to nucleotides 287–909 of β4-integrin cDNA (29Tamura R.N. Rozzo C. Starr L. Chambers J. Reichardt L.F. Cooper H.M. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). One positive plaque was identified, and its DNA insert was subjected to characterization by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot analysis. Digestion with HindIII restriction endonuclease and Southern blot hybridization with a synthetic oligonucleotide specific to the 5′-end of β4-integrin cDNA (5′-ATCAGCGTCAGCCTCTCTGG-3′) revealed that an 8.8-kb fragment contained the 5′-flanking region of the β4-integrin gene. This 8.8-kb fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of pUC118 (the resulting plasmid was designated p8.8Hind) and sequenced with an ABI 377 autosequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was fractionated by electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Corp., UK) by capillary blotting. Hybridization was performed by using a radiolabeled human β4-integrin cDNA fragment (nucleotides 287–909) (29Tamura R.N. Rozzo C. Starr L. Chambers J. Reichardt L.F. Cooper H.M. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The quality and quantity of the electrophoresed RNA were determined by rehybridization of the same blot with a 1.0-kb human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA (30Yamada T. Endo R. Tsukagoshi K. Fujita S. Honda K. Kinoshita M. Hasebe T. Hirohashi S. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 589-600PubMed Google Scholar). The signal intensity of both the β4-integrin and G3PDH autoradiograms was measured with an image densitometer (model GS-700; Bio-Rad). The relative expression level of β4-integrin was calculated as the ratio to G3PDH, after subtracting the background signals. Primer extension was carried out as described previously (31Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 79-83Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotide PE-0 (5′-GCGCGGGCGAGCAGGGACTGTCCGAGGGCGGGCGC-3′) was hybridized with 3 μg of mRNA from β4-integrin-expressing human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 (29Tamura R.N. Rozzo C. Starr L. Chambers J. Reichardt L.F. Cooper H.M. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 50 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 μCi/μl [α-32P]dCTP, and the fragments produced were analyzed by 6% denaturing sequencing gel (Long Ranger, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) electrophoresis. A 5.5-kbHindIII-FspI fragment (−5197/+333) was incised from p8.8Hind, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated with anEcoRI/NotI/BamHI adapter (TaKaRa Shuzo, Japan). After BamHI digestion, the fragment was fused upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The following 11 nested deletion mutants were generated from this 5.5-kb fragment using various restriction endonucleases as follows: L5.5K (HindIII, −5197), L2 (BlnI, −2688), L3 (SacI, −1805), L6 (BstXI, −1050), L7 (ApaI, −414), L8 (SmaI, −257), L9 (NheI, −138), L10 (SacII, −106), L11 (BssHII, +105), La (L5.5K −5197/+333 lacking −106 to +105), and Lc (L10 lacking −35 to +105) (Fig. 5). In addition, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing anMluI site at the 5′-end and a BglII site at the 3′-end was constructed by annealing complementary synthetic sequences and designated as F4 (−96/+3). Constructs harboring mutations at the Ets- or AP1-binding sites of F4 (−96/+3), or both, were also generated, and these fragments were inserted into theMluI/BglII site of pGL3-basic. A 3.2-kbFspI-HindIII fragment (+333/+3566), which contained intron 1 of the β4-integrin gene, was added to the BamHI site downstream of the firefly luciferase gene in L5.5K, L7, and L10 in forward (L5.5K-F, L7-F, and L10-F) and reverse (L5.5K-R, L7-R, and L10-R) orientations (Fig. 11). The following intron 1 deletion constructs were made by digesting the above intron-1-containing fragment with appropriate restriction endonucleases and inserting the resulting fragments into the BamHI site of L10 in both orientations as follows: I1-F and R (FspI/SacI, +333/+1328), I2-F and R (SacI/NdeI, +1328/+1905), I3-F and R (NdeI/HindIII, +1905/+3566), I4-F and R (FspI/NdeI, +333/+1905), I5-F and R (NdeI/Tth111I, +1905/+2933), and I6-F and R (Tth111I/HindIII, +2933/+3566). The composition of all of the constructs was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing.Figure 1Restriction map of the β4-integrin genomic clone p8.8Hind.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and three human fibroblast cell lines, WI38, HFL-1, and NB1RGD, which do not express β4-integrin, were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) (35Stanbridge E. Onen M. Perkins F.T. Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1969; 57: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The urinary bladder carcinoma cells and A431 were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the fibroblast cell lines were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at a density of 3–6 × 104 per 16-mm well and transfected 24 h later with complexes containing 1.2–1.9 μl of LipofectAMINE, 4 μl Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), 42 ng pRL-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contained theRenilla luciferase gene as a transfection efficiency control, and 420 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid per well. Lysates were prepared 24–48 h after transfection by adding 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (dual luciferase reporter system, Promega), and their luciferase activity was determined with an analytical luminometer (model TD-20/20, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) and expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU), calculated by determining the ratio of the intensity of the light produced by the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid to that produced by the Renilla luciferase pRL-TK plasmid. Triplicate luciferase assays of all of the samples were performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar), and the gel retardation assays were carried out using a gel-shift assay kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following gel retardation probes were constructed by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and end-labeling them with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase: F0 (−106/−36), F1 (−35/+4), F2 (+5/+44), F3 (+39/+108), D1 (−95/−77), D2 (−56/−30), and D3 (−19/+4).

For each competition assay, an approximately 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was preincubated with the required nuclear extract for 5 min at room temperature before the labeled probe was added. An anti-Jun antibody that reacts with the DNA binding domain common to c-Jun, JunB, and JunD and specific anti-c-Jun, JunB, JunD, Fra-2, and c-Fos antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). DNase I footprinting was performed with a Core Footprinting System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10–20 fmol of DNA probes (P1, −137/+114 and P2, −137/+232) labeled at only one end were incubated with 0–160 μg of nuclear extract or 0.55 μg of recombinant c-Jun protein (Promega) for 10 min on ice. Freshly diluted DNase I was added for 1–2 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped, phenol:chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The dried DNAs were suspended in formamide loading dye and resolved on a 6% denaturing sequencing gel. An 8.8-kb HindIII fragment of a β4-integrin genomic clone was isolated from a human placental genomic library and found to contain an 8.5-kb sequence upstream of the translation initiation site and a 5.2-kb 5′-flanking region preceding two exons that were separated by the first intron, which was approximately 3.2 kb (Fig.1). Exon 1 contained 159 untranslated nucleotides, including the previously described 5′-end of β4-integrin cDNA (29Tamura R.N. Rozzo C. Starr L. Chambers J. Reichardt L.F. Cooper H.M. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1593-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and exon 2 contained 89 nucleotides, including the translation initiation codon. The transcription initiation site was determined by primer extension analysis using a primer antisense to the known 5′-end of β4-integrin cDNA, PE0 (dotted arrow in Fig. 2). Multiple elongation products were identified from the mRNA of β4-integrin-expressing human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 (Fig. 3, lane 1), but they were not produced when the primer extension reaction was carried out without mRNA (lane 2). We also confirmed these results with the mRNA of human lung carcinoma cell line PC10, which expressed a high level of β4-integrin (data not shown). Hereafter, we refer to the most proximal transcriptional initiation site at the cytosine residue of the β4-integrin gene as +1 (arrow in Fig. 2).Figure 3Mapping of the human β4-integrin mRNA transcription initiation site by primer extension analysis. mRNA of the human epidermoid carcinoma cell A431 (lane 1) (29Tamura R.N.

The extension reaction was also performed without mRNA, as a negative control (lane 2). The extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% denaturing sequencing gel. Thearrows indicate anticipated transcription initiation sites, and +1 corresponds to the most proximal site at the cytosine residue of the β4-integrin gene (arrows in Figs. 1 and2).

A data base search of the 5′-flanking region revealed the presence of several putative binding sites for transcription factors, including AP1, Ets, MyoD, NFkB, and SP1, as shown in Fig. 2. β4-Integrin mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting analysis (Fig.4). The human urinary bladder carcinoma cell lines DAB1 (lane 1) and UMUC6-dox (lane 2) expressed β4-integrin mRNA, whereas three other urinary bladder carcinoma cell lines, EJ (lane 3), KU7 (lane 4), and UMUC2 (lane 5), and the fibroblast cell lines WI38 (lane 6), HFL-1 (lane 7), and NB1RGB (lane 8) did not express detectable amounts. These findings agreed with the β4-integrin protein expression results (data not shown), suggesting that β4-integrin expression in these cells is regulated at the transcription level. The results of the analyses of β4-integrin protein expression and the biological behavior of these urinary bladder carcinoma cell lines will be described elsewhere. 2T. Harabayashi, Y. Kanai, T. Yamada, M. Sakamoto, A. Ochiai, T. Kakizoe, T. Koyanagi, and S. Hirohashi, submitted for publication. In order to assess the promoter activity of the β4-integrin 5′-flanking region, nested deletion mutants were cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic. Each resulting recombinant plasmid DNA was then transiently transfected into β4-integrin-expressing DAB1 cells (Fig.5), and the vector pGL3-basic, which has no promoter, was used as a control. Among the constructs containing 5197- (L5.5K), 2688- (L2), 1805- (L3), 1050- (L6), and 414- (L7) bp upstream sequences, L7 showed the highest relative luciferase activity. Luciferase activity decreased progressively to 25% of L7 as the sequence length increased, suggesting the presence of an upstream suppressor activity in −5197/−415. Removal of the upstream region (−414/−106) from L10 led to a 36% decrease in luciferase activity, suggesting the presence of a weak enhancer activity in this region. When the sequence as far as +105 bp downstream was deleted (L11), luciferase activity fell to that of pGL3-basic. Deletion of the regions −106/+105 and −35/+105 from L5.5K (La) and L10 (Lc), respectively, virtually abolished their luciferase activity. These results indicate the presence of a basal promoter at −106/+105. As expected, the activity of this promoter (determined by L10/L11 ratios) was high in the β4-integrin-expressing DAB1 and UMUC6-dox cells and low in EJ, K7, UMUC2, WI38, and NB1RGB cells, which do not express β4-integrin (Table I). The further delimited construct lacking the 3′-half (+4/+105) of L10, designated as F4 (−96/+3), retained significant promoter activity compared with L11, but it had only about one-fifth the activity of L10 (Fig. 5), indicating that the downstream region from +4 to +105 is also necessary for full promoter activity. On the basis of these reporter assay results, we focused first on the promoter region between −106 and +105, which was critical for β4-integrin transcription.Table IActivity of β4-integrin promoter in various human cell linesUrinary bladder carcinomaFibroblastDAB1UMUC6-doxEJKU7UMUC2WI38NB1RGBβ4-Integrin expression++(0.69aThe signal intensity of both the β4-integrin and G3PDH Northern blot autoradiograms was measured with an image densitometer.

Nuclear extracts of DAB1 and WI38, representative β4-integrin-positive and negative cell lines, respectively, were analyzed. Several DNA-protein complexes (♦ in Fig.6) were more abundant in the nuclear extract from DAB1 than from WI38 cells, whereas several rapidly migrating complexes (⋄ in Fig. 6) with F0 and F1 were more abundant in WI38 than in DAB1 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2011908988,"In a large proportion of familial and sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) mutations in the RET (rearranged during transfection) protooncogene have been described. We have investigated the structure of the RET gene promoter and have analysed a region of approximately 1000 nucleotides in its promoter and 5′-upstream segments for the occurrence of 5-methyldeoxy-cytidine (5-mC) residues by using the bisulfite protocol of the genomic sequencing method. With an estimated sensitivity of about 93% of this technique, not a single 5-mC residue could be detected in the control region of a gene that seems to be silenced or exhibit low activity in many adult tissues. In these experiments, the DNAs of peripheral white blood cells (PWBC) from four healthy individuals, from seven patients with familial HSCR, as well as DNAs from different human tissues and from a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line have been included. In a DNA segment starting 790 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site of the RET gene, a few 5-mC residues have been identified. This region possibly constitutes the transition site from an unmethylated promoter to a more extensively methylated region in the human genome. The data presented are remarkable in that a highly 5′-CG-3′-enriched segment of the human genome with 49 5′-CG-3′ dinucleotide pairs in 400 bp within the putative promoter region is completely devoid of 5-mC residues, although this control region is not actively transcribed in most adult human tissues. By hybridization of a PCR-amplified RET protooncogene cDNA probe harboring exons 9–15 to a membrane (Clontech) containing poly-A selected RNAs from 50 different human tissues, weak RET protooncogene expression in many of the neural cell derived tissues has been detected. RNAs extracted from many other human tissues do not share sequence homologies to this 32P-labeled probe. Mechanisms other than DNA methylation obviously play the crucial role in the inactivation of the RET gene promoter in these tissues. We have also demonstrated by the in vitro premethylation of a RET promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene construct and transient transfection experiments into neuroblastoma cells that the transcriptional activity of the RET promoter is decreased by HpaII (5′-CCGG-3′) methylation and abolished by SssI (5′-CG-3′) methylation. Hence, the RET promoter region is sensitive to this regulatory signal. However in vivo, DNA methylation of the promoter region seems not to be the predominant regulatory mechanism for the RET protooncogene. Possibly, in adults the RET gene can be occasionally activated."
https://openalex.org/W1977338147,"The Met tyrosine kinase receptor has been implicated in human cancer. Here we have examined the signaling requirements of three oncogenic forms of this molecule: wild type Met in response to ligand/autocrine stimulation, Met which has been mutationally activated, and Tpr-Met (a constitutively active truncated Met fusion protein). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of a Grb2 binding site, and of specific tyrosine residues (i.e. Y8,9 and Y14,15) for Met function, and we have now explored the relevance of these and other sites for oncogenic Met signaling. Following substitution of various intracellular tyrosines for phenylalanine, we find that the transforming activity of each Met oncogene is dependent upon tyrosines Y8,9 and Y14,15, in addition to two novel tyrosines (Y6 and Y10) not previously implicated in Met signaling. Tyrosines Y6 and Y10 influence a variety of Met-mediated responses both in vitro (transformation, mitogenicity and invasion), and in vivo (tumorigenicity and metastasis). We also show that Tpr-Met is much more dependent on its Grb2 binding site for biological activity than are the other oncogenic forms of the Met receptor. Thus, although the three Met oncogenes examined are similar in their dependency on a number of specific tyrosines for activity, the signaling strategy employed by Tpr-Met can be differentiated from that of the other two."

Here we report the identification of the promoter for the iron transport genes and studied the interaction between the V. anguillarum Fur protein and this promoter. The iron transport promoter was localized in a region approximately 300 base pairs upstream of fatD by both primer extension and S1 mapping analysis. High activity of the promoter was measured in response to iron depletion in the wild-type strain when a promoter-lacZ fusion was examined, whereas the promoter was constitutive in the Fur-deficient strain. Gel retardation and DNase I footprint analysis showed that Fur binds specifically to two contiguous sites comprising the promoter region and the region downstream of the transcription start site. The identified Fur binding sites showed a low degree of homology to each other as well as to the consensus sequence for the Escherichia coli Fur protein. DNase I footprints pattern suggested a sequential interaction of Fur with these two sites that renders a protection in the template strand and a hypersensitivity to the nuclease in the nontemplate strand. The periodicity of the hypersensitive sites suggested that the promoter DNA undergoes a structural change upon binding to Fur, which might play a role in the repression of gene expression.

The marine pathogen Vibrio anguillarum strain 775 possesses a highly efficient plasmid-mediated iron uptake system that competes with the vertebrate host fish for the iron bound to high affinity iron binding proteins, such as transferrin and lactoferrin, leading to the establishment of infection (1Crosa J.H. Nature. 1980; 283: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The pJM1 plasmid-mediated iron uptake system includes an iron scavenger, the siderophore anguibactin, and an energy-coupled iron transport system that internalizes the ferric anguibactin complex (2Crosa J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The iron transport system includes an 86-kDa outer membrane receptor protein encoded by the fatA gene (3Crosa J.H. Hodges L.L. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 223-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Actis L.A. Potter S. Crosa J.H. J.

Tolmasky M.E. Crosa L.M. Crosa J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and two 37-kDa integral membrane proteins encoded by the fatD andfatC genes (6Actis L.A. Tolmasky M.E. Farrell D. Crosa J.H.

These genes are located contiguous in the pJM1 plasmid in the order fatD, -C, -B, and -A. (Fig.1). Genetic studies utilizing transposon (Tn3::HoHo1) insertion mutagenesis have demonstrated that mutations in fatD, -C, or -B affected FatA expression, suggesting an operon organization of these genes (6Actis L.A. Tolmasky M.E. Farrell D. Crosa J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 263: 2853-2860Google Scholar,8Tolmasky M.E. Actis L.A. Crosa J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A further regulatory linkage between iron transport genes and anguibactin biosynthetic genes has also been proposed since insertion mutations in the iron transport genes led to lowering or complete shutoff of anguibactin biosynthesis (8Tolmasky M.E. Actis L.A. Crosa J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of both, siderophore biosynthesis and iron transport genes, is regulated by positive and negative factors which function at low and high iron level, respectively. The positive regulation is mediated by the plasmid-encoded 110-kDa AngR protein whose gene lies immediately downstream of fatA and by trans acting factors encoded in a region located noncontiguous to the iron uptake region in the pJM1 plasmid (5Actis L.A.

The negative regulation is afforded by the chromosomally encoded Fur protein (11Tolmasky M.E. Wertheimer A.M. Actis L.A. Crosa J.H. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RNAα is transcribed as a counter-transcript of thefatB mRNA under the control of Fur (15Chen Q. Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18885-18891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While the repression mediated by RNAα occurs at the post-transcriptional level, the Fur protein seems to regulate the expression of the iron transport genes at the transcription level. Using an RNase protection assay it has been shown that the fatB and fatA messages are no longer negatively regulated at high iron level; and therefore, their expression is constitutive when a null mutation is generated in the furgene of the 775 strain (14Waldbeser L.S. Tolmasky M.E. Actis L.A. Crosa J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10433-10439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Fur in the repression of iron-regulated genes has been described in many bacteria (16Silver S. Walderhaug M. Microbiol.

The primary structure of the Fur protein (about 17 kDa) is highly conserved in a variety of bacteria. The comparison of predicted amino acid sequence showed that V. anguillarum Fur shares a high degree of similarity to its homolog in Vibrio species,Vibrio cholerae (94%) and Vibrio vulnificus(92%), and a lower degree of similarity to E. coli Fur (76%) (11Tolmasky M.E. Wertheimer A.M. Actis L.A. Crosa J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 213-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the identification of the promoter that drives the expression of the polycistronic transcript of the fatDCBAgenes and the interaction of the promoter with the Fur protein in vitro, to understand the regulatory mechanism of Fur in V. anguillarum. Analyses by gel retardation and DNase I footprints showed that the V. anguillarum Fur protein interacts with the promoter region in a different manner from its counterpart of E. coli, suggesting the existence of a different repression mechanism in this organism.

The plasmids pJHC-SC85 and pJHC-SC87 are derivatives of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) containing either the 1.4-kbBstEII-HindIII fragment from the fatDupstream region between the sites HindIII andSmaI in the vector (pJHC-SC85) or the 0.3-kbXmnI-EcoRI fragment from the fatDupstream region between the sites EcoRV and EcoRI in the vector (pJHC-SC87). The plasmid pJHC-TW95Z was constructed using the following cloning steps: the 1.4-kbBstEII-HindIII fragment containing thefatD promoter region was cloned between the sitesSalI and HindIII in a derivative of pBR325 (22Bolivar F. Gene (Amst.). 1978; 4: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), which carries a kanamycin resistance gene inside the ampicillin resistance gene (PstI site) in the opposite orientation to the disrupted gene. The construct was then used as a vehicle to clone the 9-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment containing thelacZYA operon, isolated from the plasmid pPD104 (23Graf J. Dunlap P.V. Ruby E.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6986-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), between the HindIII and NcoI sites of the vector. V. anguillarum cells were grown at 26 °C in Trypticase soy broth (Difco) supplemented with 1% (w/v) NaCl and antibiotics, when necessary, until stationary growth phase. The cultures were then diluted 100-fold in M9 minimal medium (1Crosa J.H. Nature. 1980; 283: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and antibiotics, when necessary. The cells were grown repeatedly until stationary growth phase and subsequently transferred in 100-fold dilution in the minimal medium described above without antibiotics. To generate various iron levels for the cells, the minimal medium in this step was supplemented with either 2 μg/ml ferric ammonium citrate for iron-rich condition or ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (EDDA) from 0 to 15 μm for iron limitation. The cells were grown to optical density of 0.5–1 at 600 nm and harvested to isolate total RNA or to measure the β-galactosidase activity. The amounts of the antibiotics applied in V. anguillarum strains were: 60 μg/ml kanamycin. The Fur-deficient strain was grown in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2.

The primer extension experiment was carried out with the synthetic primers 5′-GTAGCGCACAAAGTAAAGAACGCC-3′ (primer 1) and 5′-GGTCACAGCAGGGATTTAGCAGAGC-3′ (primer 2), which are complementary to the 5′-end region of fatD. The primer was end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to total RNA (50 μg). Reverse transcription from the primer by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and urea-PAGE (6%) were followed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The S1 mapping analyses were carried out using riboprobes as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The riboprobes, 690 nucleotides (nt) containing the XmnI-HindIII segment from the plasmid pJHC-SC85, and 378 nt containing theXmnI-EcoRI segment from the plasmid pJHC-SC87 were prepared by linearization of the plasmid with XmnI andHindIII, respectively, and following transcription with T3 RNA polymerase. RNA-RNA hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight and followed by digestion with S1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting S1 digested samples were analyzed in parallel with a known sequence marker by urea-PAGE (6%). V. anguillarumFur, purified to homogeneity, was obtained from E. Zhelenova from the laboratory of R. Brennan. Gel mobility retardation assay was carried out with the 310-bp HindIII-EcoRI isolated from the plasmid pJHC-SC87 and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by the filling in reaction of the Klenow enzyme. The labeled DNA (24 pm) was incubated with various concentrations of Fur protein (30 nm to 60 μm), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin in the final volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Bistris/boric acid (pH 7.5), 100 μm MnCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 40 mm KCl) at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was separated by nondenaturing (nd) PAGE (5%) in buffer (10 mm Bistris/boric acid (pH 7.5), 100 μm MnCl2) at 90 V for 3 h. DNase I footprint assay was performed according to the method of Galas and Schmitz (27Galas M. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The 315-bp HindIII-PstI fragment and 346-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragments were isolated from the plasmid pJHC-SC87 and labeled at recessive 3′-end of the fragments by the filling in reaction of the Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The labeled DNA preparations were incubated with various concentrations of Fur (480 nmto 60 μm) under the same reaction conditions described in the gel retardation assay at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was exposed to a partial digestion with DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 2 min. After stopping the reaction with 25 mm EDTA, the DNA was precipitated and analyzed by urea-PAGE (6%). To determine the transcription start of the fatDCBA mRNA, primer extension analysis was carried out with a primer (primer 1) complementary to the 5′-end region of the fatD transcript (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig.2 A, a number of primer extension products were observed only with RNA samples harvested under iron limitation. The pattern of the molecular species, two larger and a number of smaller bands, is identical at all three levels of iron limitation. Using molecular standards the two largest bands were estimated as 340 ± 10 nt, which maps the transcription start site(s) about 300 nt upstream of the translational initiation start site of fatD. To identify the precise location of these two start sites, a further primer extension experiment was performed with a primer (Primer 2, Fig.2 A) that hybridizes at the region closer to the start site(s). The molecular weight of the two largest primer extension products was compared with a sequence obtained using the same primer (Fig. 2 A) and located at 302 and 287 nt upstream of the start codon of fatD. The multiple bands detected could be generated as a result of multiple promoters and therefore multiple transcriptional start sites or processing products from larger molecules in vivo orin vitro. Alternatively they could be artifacts of the detection method, generated by the stalling of reverse transcriptase at certain stem-loops in the RNA structure, which might lead to earlier stops during the reverse transcription. To clarify the presence of multiple bands in primer extension analysis, the S1 mapping method was applied. Radiolabeled riboprobes containing either a 302-ntXmnI-EcoRI segment (obtained as a 378-nt fragment using plasmid pJHC-SC87) or a 535-nt XmnI-HindIII segment (obtained as a 609-nt fragment using plasmid pJHC-SC85) were employed in this analysis. RNA-RNA hybrids were subjected to S1 nuclease activity. Fig. 2 B shows S1-mapped transcriptional start sites. As it was the case with the primer extension approach the S1 mapping method detects two major transcripts whose start sites correspond to the two major start sites identified by primer extension analysis, confirming that these two mRNA species are indeed presentin vivo. The S1 mapping method also shows a number of minor bands, all of which are smaller than the two major bands. The pattern of the minor bands detected with two different riboprobes, however, are not identical and distinguishable from bands detected by primer extension experiments. This result suggested that the minor bands observed in the two mapping methods applied here are artifacts of the detection methods. The search of the RNA structure in thefatD upstream region, by the computer program GCG, reveals at least four stem-loop structures (data not shown). When the location of the stem-loops was compared with that of the early stops detected in primer extension analysis, there was no consistency between them. The DNA sequence of the fatD upstream region is highly rich in A + T (78%). Therefore, it is likely that those minor products obtained with both mapping methods are generated by breathing of two strands that leads to early termination of reverse transcription or nicking by S1. It still remains to be identified whether the two major bands are both products of independent transcription initiation at different sites or if the smaller band is a specific degradation product of the larger one. According to the transcription start site mapped by the larger band (95-nt species; Fig. 2 A), we mapped a putative −10 (TAGCAT) and the −35 (CTTACA) promoter region. These sequences, however, share a low homology to the consensus sequence of the E. coli promoter. The diversity of the sequence in the iron transport promoter implies that this promoter might require a transcriptional activator that locates RNA polymerase in the promoter region and enhances its binding. Since the expression of fatDCBA mRNA is regulated by the iron level, it is expected that the putative promoter, identified by primer extension, is also regulated by the iron level in the cell. To assess whether this was the case the putative promoter, called iron transport promoter, was examined using the lacZ-reporter gene expression to verify that fatDCBA genes are indeed driven from this promoter. The 1.4-kb BstEII-HindIII fragment containing the putative promoter region (Fig. 1) was coupled transcriptionally to the lacZ-reporter gene in a pBR325 derivative plasmid, resulting in plasmid pJHC-TW95Z. The fusion construct was subsequently conjugated into the wild-type strain 775 as well as the Fur mutant strain 775MET11. Cells harboring pJHC-TW95Z were grown under various concentrations of iron. The β-galactosidase activity of the cells was measured when cells were in the early stationary growth phase, and the results are presented in Fig.3. As the diagram shows, the β-galactosidase activity of the wild-type cells measured was negligible when the cells were grown in high iron, indicating no promoter activity. However, the overall β-galactosidase activity increased significantly under iron depletion with EDDA. The maximum increase was ∼200-fold at 3 μm EDDA, and the activity decreased slightly under high iron stress (up to 15 μmEDDA). Such iron-responsive activity of the promoter was not observed in the Fur mutant cells (Fig. 3). Here, the β-galactosidase activity was high under both high and low iron conditions, indicating that the promoter is constitutive in the absence of Fur in vivo. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that the promoter within the tested area is activated by iron limitation and repressed in high iron levels. Such iron regulation in a promoter region may be achieved by a complex of the repressor Fur protein with iron, as characterized in many other iron-regulated genes in Gram-negative bacteria. The possibility that the iron regulation of the iron transport promoter is mediated by Fur-iron complex was examined in vitro. To determine the binding activity of the V. anguillarum Fur protein to the promoter, a gel retardation assay was performed under the binding reaction conditions employed for E. coli Fur binding to the aerobactin promoter (19de Lorenzo V. Wee S. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with few minor modifications. The detection of Fur-DNA complex was carried out in the presence of metal ion Mn2+, as a substitution of the natural Fur co-repressor Fe2+, both in the binding reaction and gel electrophoresis (nondenaturing PAGE). The 302-bpXmnI-EcoRI promoter fragment (24 pm), obtained as a 310-bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pJHC-SC87, was incubated with increasing concentrations of V. anguillarum Fur protein (30 nm to 60.8 μm) in the presence of 1 × 104-fold weight excess of nonspecific competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) in the reaction prior to the nondenaturing PAGE. As shown in Fig.4, Fur protein specifically binds to the promoter DNA fragment. The varying amounts of Fur protein in the reaction mixture led to the detection of Fur-promoter complexes with four different gel migrations, designated as complexes a, b, c, and d in Fig. 4. At lower protein concentrations, 30–120 nmmonomer, only a single complex band (a) was detected, and in higher concentrations 240–960 nm two additional complex bands (b and c) appeared. While the complexes a and c seem to be formed in the same high abundance in this protein titration assay, the complex b appeared to be of lower abundance as compared with the other two complexes, a and c. From the gel retardation assay we were not able to estimate the number of Fur protein binding units on the tested DNA fragment. However, it is evident that the complexes b and c result from Fur binding at more than two different sites in the DNA fragment. The less abundant complex b implies an unstable nature of this complex, at least as assessed by the gel retardation method. This could be due to either an unstable conformation of the complex or a Fur binding site with low affinity. At protein concentrations 960 nm and higher, the protein-DNA interaction shows a plateau, indicating that all available Fur binding sites are occupied by Fur. The highest retarded complex d occurred at a 60.8 μm protein concentration. It is likely that this complex was formed as a result of nonspecific binding of Fur aggregates in the tested conditions. Although this gel retardation assay was not a detailed kinetic assay, we estimated the apparent binding constantK app of Fur to the iron transport promoter between 30 and 60 nm. This value is relatively high as compared with that of E. coli Fur to the iucApromoter (5 nm; Ref. 28Wee S. Neilands J.B. Bittner M.L. Hemming B.C. Haymore B.L. Seetharam R. Biometals. 1988; 1: 62-68Google Scholar) and the sodA promoter (10–20 nm; Ref. 29Niederhoffer E.C. Naranjo C.M. Bradly K. Fee J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1930-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To locate the Fur binding sites in the 302-bpXmnI-EcoRI fragment containing the promoter region, DNase I footprinting assays were performed. The DNA fragment was radiolabeled at the 3′-end of either the template or nontemplate strand relative to the fatDCBA transcripts. The binding reaction was carried out with 1.5 nm DNA fragment and varying concentrations of the V. anguillarum Fur protein (480 nm to 60 μm) under the same binding conditions applied in the gel retardation assay. The autoradiograms of DNase I footprint patterns on both strands are shown in Fig. 5 and the summary of the Fur-DNA interaction is represented in Fig. 6. Both template and nontemplate strands showed a large interaction region with Fur that comprised about 83 and 56 nt, respectively. At low protein concentrations (480–960 nm) the template strand reveals a region of 49 nt protected from DNase I cleavage by binding to Fur (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 9). This primary interaction site with Fur, designated as site I, is located directly in the promoter region, spanning from position +10 to −32 relative to the transcription start site, overlapping with the −10 and −35 region of the promoter. In the region between position +10 and −7 the protection was observed in only a few nucleotides. It is possible that protected nucleotides in this region are the result of the paucity of the DNase I footprints. At higher concentrations of protein (>1.9 nm) a protected region appeared in the downstream region of the transcription start site from position +17 up to +50. This secondary binding site (site II, 36 nt) is a few nucleotides smaller than the primary binding site I (42 nt), indicating that Fur binds these two sites either with different multimeric forms or in a different manner. The protection pattern in sites I and II (82 nt) was maintained in the presence of higher protein amounts (Fig. 5, lanes 2–6).Figure 6Summary of Fur interaction with the iron transport promoter DNA. The top and bottom strands represent the nontemplate and template strand, respectively. The protected nucleotides are shaded, and the hypersensitive sites are indicated by vertical arrows. The transcription start site (+1) and the direction of transcription of iron transport genes are denoted by a horizontal arrow. The numbersindicate nucleotides relative to the transcription start site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The footprint pattern in the nontemplate strand was detected in the region spanning from position −3 up to position +49. The footprints within this region contain three areas that show hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage. In each case, two hypersensitive nucleotides are flanked by protected nucleotides. These three hypersensitive sites appeared periodically spaced by about 15–16 nucleotides, which means a periodicity of longer than one helical turn of B-DNA. As is the case of the template strand, the footprints of the nontemplate strand revealed two Fur interaction sites (I′ and II′) that are distinguishable in affinity for Fur. The primary interaction at site I′ observed at protein concentrations 480–960 nm reveals protection and hypersensitive sites from position −6 to position +13 (Fig. 5,lanes 8 and 9) within the site I region in the opposite strand. The secondary interaction site (site II′) with two hypersensitive sites was detectable at 1.9 μm Fur in the downstream region of site I′. The site II′ is located in the complementary region of site II. The temporal and spatial coincidences of interaction sites suggested that the footprints at sites I and I′ or at site II and site II′ feature the same event with different consequences. The sensitivity of this strand was enhanced at higher concentrations of protein. The upstream region of the site I′ revealed extremely high sensitivity in a large area of about 80 nt. The hypersensitive sites appeared only in the nontemplate strand, and the main protection was observed in the template strand. These data suggested that the mutimeric forms of Fur bind mainly to the template strand and change the conformation of the strand upon binding that causes a stronger exposure of the less interactive nontemplate strand to the DNase I nucleolytic attack. The enhanced sensitivity in the upstream area could be generated likewise by a conformational change of the DNA, e.g. DNA bending, presumably constrained by protein-protein interaction. Experiments to explore these possibilities are currently being carried out. The regulatory function of the Fur protein in the pJM1-encoded iron uptake system has been demonstrated previously by isolating a Fur-deficient isogenic strain, a null mutant that is constitutive in both, expression of th"

https://openalex.org/W2329881951,"The SH2-SH3 adaptor protein Crkl has been implicated in the signal transduction pathways of several membrane-bound receptors. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with such signalling complexes can generate binding sites for the Crkl SH2-domain and can recruit proteins constitutively bound to Crkl via the Crkl SH3 domain into such complexes. In the current study we show that Crkl, but only a minor amount of the related Crk, form constitutive complexes in vivo with guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G in 3T3 fibroblasts. Adhesion of both normal and transformed cells to fibronectin or other extracellular matrix proteins consistently induces the tyrosine-phosphorylation of C3G. Adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G is dependent on an intact cytoskeleton and peaks at 5–10 min after attachment. In contrast, 3T3 cells stably transfected with Bcr/Abl P210 show a prominent reduction in the amount of C3G complexed to Crkl and do not exhibit tyrosine-phosphorylation of C3G upon spreading and attachment. These data establish that integrin-mediated cell adhesion results in Crkl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G, a pathway which can be disrupted by Bcr/Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2011986913,"Apoptotic cell death was shown to be accompanied or preceded by an elevated expression of the c-fos protooncogene and DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1. We used Fos-deficient mice to study the role of c-Fos during programmed cell death in the prostate. In normal mice apoptosis is induced in the prostate within 2–4 days after castration. Histological features of reduced secretory activity and morphological signs of programmed cell death become obvious. No apparent decrease in secretory activity and no epithelial cell death were observed in Fos-deficient animals after castration. Fragmentation of nuclear DNA was measured by in situ terminal transferase reaction. DNA fragmentation was observed in the prostate epithelium of control mice after castration whereas no similar fragmentation was found in Fos-deficient animals. After castration an AP-1 complex accumulated in the prostate of Fos deficient mice which mainly consists of FosB, Fra-2 and JunD whereas in control animals the AP-1 complex in addition contained c-Fos. Our data strongly suggest that c-Fos is required for programmed cell death of prostate epithelial cells."

Whereas the site of attachment of major group HRVs to ICAM-1 has been mapped to the canyon, a deep cleft encircling the 5-fold axes of icosahedral symmetry (11Olson N.H. Kolatkar P.R. Oliveira M.A. Cheng R.H. Greve J.M. McClelland A. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the binding site of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on minor group viruses remains elusive. The most prominent common structural motive of all members of the LDLR family are various numbers of complement type-A repeats, about 40 amino acids in length, containing six cysteines each, which are involved in disulfide bridges; the C termini exhibit clusters of negatively charged amino acid residues. These repeats form the ligand binding domain and interact with a great number of structurally and functionally unrelated ligands (for reviews, see Refs. 12Schneider W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 13Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Whereas LDLR and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) contain seven and eight consecutive ligand binding repeats, respectively, LDLR-related protein (LRP) and megalin contain four clusters of various numbers of these repeats (for a discussion of the structural features of these proteins, see Ref. 14Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domain is followed by (or interspersed with, in the case of LRP and megalin) regions with similarity to epidermal growth factor precursor; a region that is heavilyO-glycosylated is present in some of the receptors and precedes the transmembrane segment. Finally, the short cytoplasmic domain contains typical internalization signals (NPXY) responsible for clustering of the receptors in coated pits. Previously, we expressed the entire ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor in a soluble form and demonstrated that this region is sufficient for recognition of minor group HRVs (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have also shown that a recombinant fragment of human very low density lipoprotein receptor, which contains eight complement type repeats, binds minor group HRVs as well (9Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In order to identify the smallest structure element of the LDLR molecule required for viral recognition, we expressed soluble LDLR fragments encompassing various numbers of the complement type repeats in the baculovirus system and tested their binding to HRV2, a representative of the minor receptor group. In addition, the potential of these soluble minireceptors with respect to protection of HeLa cells against viral infection was compared. In the present communication, we show that fragments with two or more complement type repeats are recognized by minor group HRVs when immobilized on PVDF membranes and that the presence of more than two repeats is required to inhibit viral infection of HeLa cells.

The resulting vector (pTM1) harbors the polyhedrin promoter, which directs expression of the melittin signal peptide. A multiple cloning site allows for insertion of the gene of interest between the melittin sequence and a C-terminal collagenase site followed by a hexa-His tag.

Oligonucleotides and positions of complementarity are summarized in Table I. The cDNAs were subsequently ligated into the plasmid pTM1. Briefly, polymerase chain reactions with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) started with denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min; 57 °C (for repeats 1-7, 1-5, 3-5, and 3-7), 55 °C (for repeat 2-3), or 59 °C (for repeats 3-4 and 4-5) for 45 s; and 72 °C for 1 min (for repeats 1-7, 1-5, and 3-7), 45 s (for repeat 3-5), or 30 s (for repeats 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5). Oligonucleotides used for amplification were 277/278 (repeat 1-7), 277/303 (repeat 1-5), 302/278 (repeat 3-7), 302/303 (repeat 3-5), 407/373 (repeat 2-3), 362/365 (repeat 3-4), and 364/303 (repeat 4-5) (see also Table I). Fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (cleavage sites are underlined in Table I), and ligated intoXmaI or BamHI/XmaI-digested pTM1. Sequencing of the constructs encoding repeats 3-5 and 3-7 revealed the presence of a mutation due to a synthesis error in primer 302 (TableI), which resulted in a frameshift. The vectors were thus digested withBamHI, filled in with Klenow, and religated to regenerate the correct reading frame.

Bacmid DNAs encoding the various LDLR fragments were isolated and used for Lipofectin-mediated transfection of Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant baculoviruses were harvested, amplified, and used for expression of soluble minireceptors. His-tagged proteins in the cell culture supernatants (50 μl) were detected by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) from SDS-polyacrylamide gels run under reducing conditions. The membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 (TBS-Ca) containing 2% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS-Ca (incubation buffer) for 10 min, and probed with 10 ml of incubation buffer containing HRP-conjugated Ni-NTA at a final dilution of 1:10 000 for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing twice with incubation buffer, HRP was revealed by chemiluminescence. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins was performed as described previously (10Marlovits T.C.

Briefly, Sf9 insect cells grown in 0.4-liter suspension cultures were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5. At 90 h postinfection, the cell culture supernatants were cleared by low speed centrifugation and passed over Ni-NTA affinity columns (3 ml).

Amino-terminal sequencing of proteins electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes was carried out with an instrument from Applied Biosystems.

Cell culture supernatants (20 μl) from recombinant baculovirus infected Sf9 cells were mixed with 80 μl of infection medium (minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 30 mm MgCl2), and serial 2-fold dilutions were made in the same medium. To each dilution (50 μl), 100 TCID50 of HRV2 in 50 μl of infection medium was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at 34 °C. They were then transferred onto subconfluent Rhino HeLa cells (Flow Laboratories) in 96-well plates (containing 100 μl of infection medium) and incubated for 3 days at 34 °C. Cells remaining attached to the plastic were stained with Amido Black (0.1% in acetic acid/methanol/water, 10:40:50, v/v). Controls used were cell culture supernatants from mock-infected and from wild type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and tissue culture media (InsectXpress and HeLa infection medium). To specifically enrich for minireceptors active in ligand binding, Ni-NTA affinity purified recombinant proteins were subjected to chromatography on β-VLDL columns. β-VLDL was prepared from 150 ml of blood collected from three bleedings of a rabbit fed with a high cholesterol diet. Fifteen ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0) were added, and cells were removed by centrifugation in a Heraeus Megafuge 1.0 at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The plasma was transferred into quick seal tubes (Beckman) and centrifuged in a Type 45Ti rotor at 35000 rpm for 16 h. β-VLDL, concentrated as a floating cushion on top of the tube, was saved and gently resuspended in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). β-VLDL (30 mg, as determined with the SDS-Lowry assay (17Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard) was coupled to 8 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose gel according the manufacturer's protocol. Ni-NTA-purified receptor fragments (from 100 ml of Sf9 suspension culture) were passed over 1 ml of β-VLDL-Sepharose and washed with 0.5× TBS-Ca, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NH3 in 0.5× TBS-Ca. Fractions (1 ml) were then concentrated to 0.5 ml, and NH3was removed in a Speedvac concentrator. Forty μl of fraction 2 (purified rLDLR1-7h, rLDLR1-5h, rLDLR3-5h, and rLDLR3-7h) and fraction 9 (used as a control) from the β-VLDL columns that had been loaded with the various minireceptors (as exemplified in Fig. 6 for rLDLR1-5h), were mixed with 60 μl of infection medium, and 2-fold serial dilutions were made in a 96-well plate. Fifty μl of infection medium containing 100 TCID50 HRV2 were added to each well and incubated for 1.5 h at 34 °C. The mixture was transferred onto HeLa cell monolayers in 96-well plates and cell lysis was determined after 5 days of incubation at 34 °C. Cells remaining attached to the plastic were stained with Amido Black and dissolved in 1 m NaOH, andA 560 was determined in a microplate reader. Complete cell lysis was set to 0% protection, and cells were grown in the absence of virus to 100% protection. The concentration of the respective recombinant minireceptor affording 50% cell protection corresponds to the MIC50 (18Andries K. Dewindt B. De Brabander M. Stokbroekx R. Janssen P.A. Arch. Virol. 1988; 101: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA fragments encoding various numbers of complement type repeats of human LDLR (as shown in Fig.1) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pTZ1, a derivative of pLDLR2 containing the entire LDLR cDNA sequence (16Yamamoto T.

Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1984; 37: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Primers (summarized in TableI) were synthesized as to containBamHI or XmaI restriction sites to allow for subsequent cloning into the transfer plasmid pTM1. Recombinant plasmids were selected, and DNA was isolated and used for transposition into the bacmid DNA by transfection into DH10Bac. White colonies were selected, and correct insertion was verified by restriction analysis. The recombinant bacmids were used for Lipofectin-mediated transfection of Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant baculoviruses were used for infection of Sf9 cells grown in 0.4-liter suspension cultures as described previously (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In accordance with earlier observations with the recombinant LDLR fragment rLDLR1-7h, most of the virus binding activity was recovered in the tissue culture supernatant; therefore, only the supernatants were saved at 90 h postinfection. Samples (20 μl) of the cleared supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to a PVDF membrane. The presence of His-tagged proteins in the tissue culture supernatants was then verified with HRP-conjugated Ni-NTA followed by chemiluminescence detection. As seen in Fig.2, infection of the insect cells with the various recombinant baculoviruses resulted in the expression of soluble His-tagged polypeptides with mobilities roughly reflecting the number of complement type repeats expected to be present in the fusion proteins. However, as observed earlier (12Schneider W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Schneider W.J. Beisiegel U. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9533-9538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the apparent molecular masses substantially deviated from those calculated from the amino acid sequences (Fig. 1). For example, human LDL receptor (calculated molecular mass, 95,375 Da) migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 164 kDa (see Ref. 20Schneider W.J. Beisiegel U. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2664-2673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possible N-glycosylation at the sites indicated in Fig. 1 might also influence migrational behavior. With exception of rLDLR4-5h, which was not detectable under these conditions, all proteins were expressed in comparable amounts.Figure 2His-tagged polypeptides are released into the supernatant of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. Fifty-μl samples of cleared cell culture supernatants harvested from Sf9 cells infected with various recombinant baculoviruses harboring LDL minireceptor sequences at 90 h postinfection were run on a 12% (A) or 15% (B) SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Soluble His-tagged proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated Ni-NTA (diluted 1:10 000) followed by chemiluminescence substrate and exposure for 3 min to x-ray film. Complement type repeats present in the minireceptors are indicated at the top of the lanes. The positions of marker proteins run on the same gel are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously demonstrated a virus-neutralizing activity of the detergent-solubilized chicken oocyte very low density lipoprotein/vitellogenin receptor (8Gruenberger M. Wandl R. Nimpf J. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Kuechler E. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7244-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of the recombinant soluble human LDL minireceptor rLDLR1-7h (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and of recombinant soluble human VLDLR (9Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the various soluble LDL minireceptors (Fig. 1) secreted into the cell supernatant of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig.2) were also capable of protecting HeLa cells from infection with a minor receptor group rhinovirus (HRV2). HRV2 at 100 TCID50was incubated with dilutions of the Sf9 cell supernatants for 1.5 h at 34 °C, and HeLa cells grown in 96-well plates were challenged with the mixtures. Upon incubation at 34 °C for 72 h, cells remaining attached to the plastic surface were stained with Amido Black (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a control, HRV2 was preincubated with tissue culture supernatant obtained from Sf9 cells that had been infected with wild type baculovirus. In order to exclude any effect of the media on the viability of the HeLa cells, control incubations were also carried out in the absence of virus. As seen in Fig.3, all tissue culture supernatants containing minireceptors encompassing more than two complement type repeats protected the cells against viral infection in a concentration-dependent manner, although to different degrees. Whereas rLDLR1-5h afforded the highest and rLDLR3-5h the lowest protection, the other minireceptors were intermediate under these experimental conditions. However, this experiment does not allow for a quantitative estimate of the protection potency because it does not take into account differences in expression yield and the fraction of denatured protein present in the various minireceptor preparations. In order to allow for a quantitative comparison of the cell-protecting activity, purification was attempted. The hexa-His tag fused to the C terminus of the various recombinant minireceptors was then used for purification on Ni-NTA columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins eluted from the columns were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing (Fig. 4 A) and nonreducing (Fig. 4 B) conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. It can be inferred from the gel run under reducing conditions that all minireceptors were obtained in comparable yields and migrated as single, well resolved bands reflecting the number of the respective repeats; however, as pointed out above, the apparent molecular masses substantially deviated from those calculated from the amino acid compositions. A completely different picture was obtained upon analysis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4 B). Most of the proteins migrated as a smear or as badly resolved bands, indicating substantial heterogeneity, aggregation, and misfolding. For N-terminal sequencing, proteins were separated under reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. As already shown for rLDLR1-7h (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) signal peptidase cleavage in rLDLR3-5h, rLDLR2-3h, rLDLR3-4h, and rLDLR4-5h was found to occur at ISYIYA↓DR. For rLDLR1-5h, the cleavage site was not determined but was assumed to be identical to that previously found for rLDLR1-7h (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that HRV2 attaches to LDLR, LRP (7Hofer F. Gruenberger M. Kowalski H. Machat H. Huettinger M. Kuechler E. Blaas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), vitellogenin receptor (8Gruenberger M. Wandl R. Nimpf J. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Kuechler E. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7244-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant soluble human VLDLR (9Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), and recombinant soluble rLDLR1-7h (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in ligand blots from SDS-polyacrylamide gels run under nonreducing conditions. This well established technique, which has also been extensively used for the detection of ligand binding to LDL receptor and to other members of this protein family (see, for example, Refs. 22Daniel T.O. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4606-4611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 23Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was thus employed to investigate whether the smaller LDL minireceptors would also bind HRV2. Moreover, we asked whether all conformationally different forms present in the preparation of one given minireceptor (see Fig. 4 B) would be recognized by rhinoviruses. Ni-NTA-purified proteins were thus separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions as in Fig. 4 B and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with 35S-labeled HRV2 followed by autoradiography. As seen in Fig. 5, the virus only bound to distinct molecular forms present within each minireceptor preparation; however, there was no apparent correlation between these virus-binding proteins and the major proteins stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (see Fig. 4 B). The material active in virus binding thus represents only a minor constituent in the Ni-NTA-purified minireceptor preparation. Additional enrichment of minireceptors in a native conformation was obtained with rabbit β-VLDL covalently attached to Sepharose. This natural ligand of LDLR, VLDLR, and LRP was previously used for the purification of vitellogenin receptor (24Barber D.L. Sanders E.J. Aebersold R. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18761-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ni-NTA-purified minireceptors were thus applied onto β-VLDL Sepharose, and the retained material was eluted with 1 m NH3 in 0.5× TBS-Ca. The purification procedure was monitored by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining and by ligand blotting with HRV2; it is exemplified for rLDLR1-5h in Fig. 6. Analysis of the original sample (S), the flow-through (F), and the pool of eluted fractions 1–9 (E) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (Fig.6 A) showed that most of the protein was not retained on the column and was thus recovered in the flow-through. Although the amount of protein in the pool of the eluted fractions (E) was below the detection limit of Coomassie Blue staining, a faint band could be seen in fractions 2 and 3 upon separate analysis. When the same samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 6 B), several bands were seen in the original sample (S) and the flow-through (F) (compare also to Fig. 4 B). Again, no staining was apparent in the pool of the eluate (E), but a faint band now appeared in fraction 2. This indicates that within the many differently folded and aggregated conformers, only a small fraction exhibited the correct native structure enabling binding to β-VLDL. Proteins in the samples were then separated under the same conditions as in the experiment shown in Fig. 6 B and transferred electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane. Virus binding was detected by incubation with HRV2 followed by rabbit anti-HRV2 antiserum and alkaline phosphatase staining. As seen in Fig. 6 C, virus binding to a protein migrating between the 29- and 45-kDa makers was about equal in the original sample (S) and in the pool of the eluted fractions (E), with no binding activity being found in the flow-through (F). Activity was strongly enriched in fractions 2 and 3, indicating a substantial increase in specific virus binding activity. The results with the other minireceptors containing more than two complement type repeats (rLDLR1-7h, rLDLR3-5h, and rLDLR3-7h) were similar (data not shown). However, fragments consisting of only two complement type repeats (rLDLR2-3h, rLDLR3-4h, and rLDLR4-5h) failed to bind to the β-VLDL Sepharose, which precluded further purification. To determine the cell protection capacity of the various minireceptors in a quantitative manner, Ni-NTA and β-VLDL Sepharose-purified rLDLR1-7h, rLDLR1-5h, rLDLR3-5h, and rLDLR3-7h were incubated at decreasing concentrations with HRV2 at 100 TCID50 as described above for the tissue culture supernatants (see Fig. 3). HeLa cells in 96-well plates were challenged with the mixtures and incubated for 5 days at 34 °C. Cells were stained with Amido Black, which was then dissolved in 1 mNaOH, and the color intensity was measured with a microplate reader (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Marlin S.D. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. Stratowa C. Sommergruber W. Merluzzi V.J. Nature. 1990; 344: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 7, rLDLR3-7h afforded the highest cell protection efficiency reducing cell damage to 50% of the control at a concentration of 0.3 μg/ml, whereas the lowest protection was seen for rLDLR3-5h, with a value of 3 μg/ml. The other recombinant proteins revealed intermediate values. Because the tissue culture supernatants containing minireceptors with only two repeats had not shown any cell protective effect at the lowest dilution (Fig. 3) and the Ni-NTA enriched material could not be further purified due to lack of binding to β-VLDL, they were excluded from this analysis. We have previously shown that representatives of the minor group of human rhinoviruses bind LDLR, LRP, VLDLR, and vitellogenin receptor (7Hofer F. Gruenberger M. Kowalski H. Machat H. Huettinger M. Kuechler E. Blaas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 8Gruenberger M. Wandl R. Nimpf J. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Kuechler E.

Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By expression of soluble human LDLR lacking the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain, we then demonstrated that the ligand binding domain was sufficient for virus recognition and inhibition of infection (10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the present work, we analyzed the LDL receptor in more detail and investigated how many complement type repeats were necessary for the structural integrity of the virus binding site. Using the Bac-to-Bac system we expressed LDL minireceptors with several combinations and numbers of ligand binding repeats in Sf9 insect cells and purified them from the cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA columns. Analysis of the recombinant proteins by reducing SDS-PAGE revealed a high electrophoretic purity and homogeneity (Fig. 4 A). However, under nonreducing conditions, most of the fragments migrated as broad weakly resolved bands, indicating extensive heterogeneity and aggregation. Apparently, correct assembly of the large number of disulfide bridges in these truncated receptors constitutes a major problem for the protein folding machinery in these cells. The heterogeneity is mostly due to incorrect disulfide bridges because boiling in SDS in the absence of reducing agents did not change the migrational behavior of the recombinant proteins upon SDS-PAGE (data not shown, but see also Ref. 10Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to enrich for conformations active in ligand binding, we therefore further purified the material by rabbit β-VLDL column chromatography. This method substantially enhanced the homogeneity of the proteins, as seen upon analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6 B), and also increased the specific binding activity considerably (Fig.6 C). Fragments containing only two complement type repeats were not retained on the column. This indicates a higher stringency for the recognition of β-VLDL than for recognition of HRV2 because ligand blotting experiments demonstrated that even two repeats are sufficient for viral recognition (Fig. 5). However, protection of HeLa cells against infection with HRV2 was only observed with receptor fragments encompassing at least three ligand binding repeats (Fig. 3). This is not entirely unexpected because the avidity of the receptor is greatly increased upon immobilization, leading to high local concentrations and consequently to multivalent interaction, which apparently allows for binding to the otherwise weakly binding two-repeat minireceptors. Considerable differences in ligand interaction between membrane-bound receptors and soluble receptors have been reported previously (see, for example, Ref. 26Shafren D.R. Dorahy D.J. Thorne R.F. Kinoshita T. Barry R.D. Burns G.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2318-2323PubMed Google Scholar). Minireceptors with more than two complement type repeats sequentially purified on Ni-NTA and β-VLDL columns were then used for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (which is defined as that concentration that affords protection of 50% of the cells against viral damage). All minireceptors showed MIC50values between 0.3 and 3 μg/ml under these experimental conditions. It is interesting to note that rLDLR3-7h, with only five complement type repeats, exhibited a stronger protection potential than rLDLR1-7h, which encompasses the entire ligand binding domain. The high proportion of dimers present in rLDLR3-7h (that are also retained on the β-VLDL column) might be the reason for the high cell protection potency (Fig. 5 A). Currently, a bacterially expressed two-domain ICAM-1-IgA chimera is being evaluated as antiviral agent against major group HRVs (27Shigeta S. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1998; 9: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of a virus-binding fragment of ICAM-1 (28Bella J. Kolatkar P.R. Marlor C.W. Greve J.M. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4140-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.H. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4134-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) might now aid the design of lower molecular mass antiviral agents. Bacterial expression of human LDLR and refolding into a native conformation has recently been achieved (30Simmons T. Newhouse Y.M. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25531-25536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, recovery was low, and use of this large polypeptide as antiviral appears impractical. The aim of our current study was to define the minimal structure requirements for inhibition of a minor group human rhinovirus. We thus expressed various minireceptors using the baculovirus system. Without the necessity forin vitro refolding, native proteins were recovered in amounts sufficient for cell protection assays. The experiments showed that the presence of at least three ligand binding repeats is required for inhibition of viral infection. Experiments aimed at engineering such small fragments with increased virus neutralization efficiency are currently under way.

Expression of a single effector loop mutant, Ha-Ras(G12V, Y40C) (Ha-RasV12C40), inhibited factor-withdrawal apoptosis, suggesting that activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (Pl3K) pathway is essential to prevent cell death. Neither Ha-Ras (G12V, T35S) (Ha-RasV12S35), which activates the Raf1 signaling pathway, nor Ha-Ras(G12V, E37G) (Ha-RasV12G37), which stimulates the RalGDS pathway, did not have significant effects on factor-withdrawal apoptosis of myeloid cells. Although Ha-RasV12C40 inhibited apoptosis, it did not stimulate entry into the cell cycle. Cell lines containing the combination of Ha-RasV12G37 and Ha-RasV12C40 were capable of factor-independent cell growth, while expression of the other combinations of the Ha-Ras effector mutants were not. The combined expression of Bcl-2 and Ha-RasV12G37 was not sufficient to stimulate factor independent growth, suggesting that Ha-RasV12C40 activates additional signals, besides blocking apoptosis, which are critical for factor-independent growth of myeloid cells. In factor-starved myeloid cells, inducible expression of Ha-RasV12G37 results in decreased level of p27Kip1 protein, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). These data suggest that the factor-independent growth of myeloid cells requires the activation of at least two pathways, one inhibiting factor-withdrawal apoptosis, and another causing cell cycle progression."

https://openalex.org/W2418578196,"I n a curious set of neurodegenerative diseases, a long string of the nucleotide triplet CAG lodges within genes, causing the death of subsets of neurons and ultimately disease. Exactly how these strings of repeats cause cell death is not known, but they do not simply disrupt the function of their target gene. Rather, the long CAG string has a deadly—but undefined—effect of its own.

One popular idea is that the CAG repeats cause the protein to form a toxic aggregate in the nucleus of cells. These so-called nuclear inclusions are common in the brains of patients with these disorders. But in two recent papers in Cell , this explanation is called into question. One group shows, in a cultured cell model system for Huntington's disease ([1][1]), that cells may die even without the presence of nuclear inclusions. In the most dramatic experiment, expression of a fragment of the mutant huntingtin protein containing a 68-repeat insertion, together with an inhibitory form of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, resulted in far fewer intranuclear inclusions. The mutant huntingtin actually triggered more cell death in this situation than it would have in the presence of inclusions, leading the authors to the bold suggestion that the inclusions may actually be protective. A second group made transgenic mice that mimicked the disorder spinocerebellar atrophy type 1 ([1][1]), in which the repeat-containing protein ataxin-1 lacked a self-aggregating region. These mice had no nuclear inclusions, but still showed the characteristic degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The field may now have to look elsewhere for the mechanism by which these repeats do their damage to the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2002714061,"All genomes share critical features of composition, replication, and information management. However, despite these commonalities unifying plants, animals, and microbes, genomic information is also key to the incredible diversity that exists on this planet. This special section presents a sampling of progress in the genome analysis of a variety of organisms.

Although the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana averages less than 20 centimeters in height, it has become of prime importance in plant biology as a model representative of higher plants. (See the [foldout chart][1] summarizing the state of the Arabidopsis genome project and the Review by [Meinke][2] et al. ) Knowledge generated by this project already shows promise in improving agronomic features such as yield and drought resistance in important agricultural crops and is leading toward development of “plant factories” that can produce new products such as biodegradable plastics. Realization of the potential of plant model systems depends on how far comparative genomics can be stretched, and [Gale and Devos][3] discuss its strengths and limitations. Whether we will reach the full potential of what one researcher has called the golden age of plant biology will also depend on budgets; see the News story by [Pennisi][4] about the recent infusion of funds into plant genomic research and the projects that are being planned.

Funding for generating genomic information on some other model systems ( Escherichia coli , yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila , and mouse) and humans has primarily been coordinated under the Human Genome Project. Representatives of the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy present the second 5-year plan ([Collins][5] et al. ) for the project. The focus of this endeavor has evolved from mapping to an all-out push on sequencing, and doing it better, cheaper, and faster. This latest plan also contains a clearer view of the next stages, with an emphasis on providing tools and resources that will enable researchers to ask more far-reaching questions.

Even with all the progress made, uncertainties remain. The ramifications of ramping up the sequencing effort remain unclear. Assembly and finishing of the sequence present unique challenges. And once we have this “book of life,” will we be able to read it? As [Gelbart][6] points out, we are still functional illiterates when it comes to interpreting what the genome has to tell us. How we organize the flood of data that is being generated is a key component of beginning to decipher it.

However, excitement about the future is undeniably building. Chu et al. (p. [699][7]) present a functional genomics study that is an example of the shape of future analyses. The availability of the complete sequence of the yeast genome allowed them to increase by an order of magnitude the number of genes known to be associated with spore formation. See also the Report by Deloukas et al. (p. [744][8]) on the newest version of the physical map of human gene-based markers and the Report (Stephens et al. , p. [754][9]) and Perspective (Hatch, p. [638][10]) on the complete sequence of Chlamydia trachomatis .

The social and ethical ramifications of generating these quanta of genomic information are complex. How do we decide what kinds of research are appropriate and what kinds of research products to release into the environment? How will genomic information change our understanding of concepts such as race and ethnicity? (See the News story by [Marshall][11].) In his Editorial (p. [625][12]), Greely makes a point that should never be lost in the excitement of finding more and more sequence and looking for the genes associated with human diseases and traits: Respect for the people and cultures taking part in these studies should be of prime importance. An appropriate combination of scientific advances and consideration of social and ethical issues will allow us to achieve the full potential of plant biotechnology to feed and supply the world's population and of the Human Genome Project to give new dimensions to medicine and our picture of ourselves.
