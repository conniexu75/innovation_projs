https://openalex.org/W2482717739,"Genetic variants of TREM2, a protein expressed selectively by microglia in the brain, are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Starting from an unbiased protein microarray screen, we identified a set of lipoprotein particles (including LDL) and apolipoproteins (including CLU/APOJ and APOE) as ligands of TREM2. Binding of these ligands by TREM2 was abolished or reduced by disease-associated mutations. Overexpression of wild-type TREM2 was sufficient to enhance uptake of LDL, CLU, and APOE in heterologous cells, whereas TREM2 disease variants were impaired in this activity. Trem2 knockout microglia showed reduced internalization of LDL and CLU. β-amyloid (Aβ) binds to lipoproteins and this complex is efficiently taken up by microglia in a TREM2-dependent fashion. Uptake of Aβ-lipoprotein complexes was reduced in macrophages from human subjects carrying a TREM2 AD variant. These data link three genetic risk factors for AD and reveal a possible mechanism by which mutant TREM2 increases risk of AD. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

The ability to make functional neural cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provides a unique opportunity to study human brain development and neurological disorders. Despite much progress, most protocols used to differentiate hPSCs into neurons are based on 2D methods that are unlikely to recapitulate the complexity and function of 3D in vivo neural circuits (Sasai, 2013Sasai Y. Cytosystems dynamics in self-organization of tissue architecture.Nature. 2013; 493: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These limitations have prompted the development of 3D organoid models that mimic the organization and function of brain parts using hPSCs (Lancaster et al., 2013Lancaster M.A. Renner M. Martin C.A.

In contrast to single-cell-type cultures, organoids consist of multiple cell types that self-organize spatially and can display enhanced cellular maturation and functionality, possibly due to the more appropriate 3D niche environment (Kelava and Lancaster, 2016Kelava I. Lancaster M.A. Stem Cell Models of Human Brain Development.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18: 736-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Extensive research has focused on generating midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons from hPSCs in recent years particularly because the selective loss of mDA neurons is a key pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Grealish et al., 2014Grealish S. Diguet E. Kirkeby A. Mattsson B. Heuer A. Bramoulle Y. Van Camp N. Perrier A.L. Hantraye P. Björklund A. Parmar M.

Here, we report a method for differentiating hPSCs into human midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs) that recapitulate features of the midbrain and may be useful as a model for studying midbrain function and dysfunction. To generate midbrain organoids, we applied a guided self-organizing principle to hPSC culture. First, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were dissociated to single cells to form uniformly sized (approximately 400 μm in diameter) embryoid bodies (EBs) in low-attachment, V-shaped 96-well dishes (Figure 1A). To promote neuroectodermal differentiation toward a floor plate, these EBs were simultaneously treated with dual-SMAD inhibition factors (Noggin and SB431542) and a Wnt pathway activator (CHIR99021). The resulting EBs were patterned toward a mesencephalic fate upon addition of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and FGF8 (Arenas, 2014Arenas E.

Generation of regionally specified neural progenitors and functional neurons from human embryonic stem cells under defined conditions.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). At day 7, nascent neural organoids expressed markers of mDA progenitors such as FOXA2, OTX2, CORIN, and LMX1A (Figure S1A). Subsequently, each neuroectodermal spheroid was embedded in Matrigel to promote growth and organization in 3D (Figure 1A) and then transferred to a tissue culture plate containing neuronal media supplemented with neurotrophic factors (Figure 1A). The organoids were cultured in this manner on an orbital shaker until the day of analysis. These neural organoids grew to more than 2 mm in diameter in 30 days and contained multiple neuroepithelia (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that these neuroepithelia exhibited apical-basal polarity based on the localization of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) (Figures S1D and S1E). Ki67+ proliferating cells and MAP2+ neurons were detected at the apical and the basal surface, respectively (Figure 1B). FACS analysis revealed that the percentage of Ki67+ cells decreased from 51% at day 25 to 19% at day 35; conversely, the proportion of MAP2+ cells increased 3.6-fold (Figure 1C). These data indicate that cells in the hMLOs gradually transitioned from proliferating neuroprogenitors to post-mitotic mature neurons. To further characterize the developing midbrain neuroepithelia, we labeled proliferating progenitor cells with EdU and stained for OTX2, a transcription factor that separates the midbrain from the hindbrain. OTX2 expression was observed in cells within the apical surface and extended to the intermediate region of the neuroepithelia (Figure 1D). Approximately 80% of all cells were OTX2+ and 35% of the cells within neuroepithelia were double positive for EdU and OTX2 (Figure 1E), demonstrating that proliferating cells near the apical region of hMLOs were midbrain progenitors. Next, we examined the cytoarchitecture of the neural organoids at day 35. Similar to the layering of the murine embryonic midbrain floor plate that eventually gives rise to mDA neurons (Baizabal and Covarrubias, 2009Baizabal J.M. Covarrubias L. The embryonic midbrain directs neuronal specification of embryonic stem cells at early stages of differentiation.Dev. Biol. 2009; 325: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the hMLOs at day 35 showed three layers: the proliferative ventral zone (VZ), where neural progenitors reside; the intermediate zone (IZ), which immature mDA neurons pass through as they migrate ventrally; and the mantle zone (MZ), where maturing mDA neurons begin to express genes associated with the synthesis of dopamine (DA) (Figure 1F). In the VZ and IZ, the midbrain progenitors expressed MASH1 and OTX2 (Figures 1G and 1H). We also detected the orphan nuclear receptor NURR1, which is expressed in post-mitotic mDA progenitors, in the IZ (Figure 1I) (Arenas et al., 2015Arenas E. Denham M. Villaescusa J.C. How to make a midbrain dopaminergic neuron.Development. 2015; 142: 1918-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the features of our in vitro hMLOs are similar to those of early in vivo midbrains in the aspect of developing neuroectoderm toward floor plate. Several studies have demonstrated that FOXA2, a floor plate marker, identifies neuronal progenitors that eventually become mDA neurons (Sasaki et al., 1997Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. A binding site for Gli proteins is essential for HNF-3beta floor plate enhancer activity in transgenics and can respond to Shh in vitro.Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed FOXA2 expression in developing hMLOs as early as day 4 (Figure 1J). Intriguingly, at day 14, FOXA2 expression became restricted to specific domains within the neuroepithelia, and by day 24, FOXA2-expressing cells presumably had migrated radially to the MZ (Figure 1J), where they began to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a defining marker of DA neurons. Indeed at day 45 the majority of FOXA2+ cells (54%) also expressed TH (Figures 1K and 1L). Given that some ventral forebrain progenitors could also express FOXA2 (Liu and Zhang, 2011Liu H. Zhang S.C. Specification of neuronal and glial subtypes from human pluripotent stem cells.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 3995-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we sought to examine the expression of other mDA neuroprogenitor markers such as LMX1A and OTX2 together with FOXA2 in the hMLOs at day 14 and 45. We observed that 22% of cells at day 14 were double positive for LMX1A and OTX2 (Figures S1F and S1G). At day 45, 38% of all cells were LMX1A+, and most of them (81%) were also FOXA2+ (Figures S1H and S1I). We further observed that a major fraction of LMX1A+ cells (58%) expressed TH at this time (Figures 1M and 1N). These data strongly suggest that the majority of TH+ neurons in the hMLOs likely originated from FOXA2+ and LMX1A+ progenitors, which were a subset of OTX2+ cells. In addition, we observed robust expression of the mDA markers in hMLOs by qPCR (Figure S1J). Taken together, these data demonstrated a time-dependent induction of floor plate precursors and their subsequent differentiation into TH+ mDA neurons within the developing hMLOs. To further quantify the neuronal populations within the hMLOs, we conducted FACS analysis. At day 35, 6% of the MAP2+ neurons in hMLOs co-expressed TH, and the number increased significantly to 22% by day 60 (Figures S1K–S1M). Approximately 29% were also positive for DA transporter (DAT) (Figures 1O and 1P). Intriguingly, at day 60, we observed that some of the TH+ neurons were also positive for GIRK2 (G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2), which is an important protein with enriched expression in A9 subtype mDA neurons (Figure S1N). In addition, we observed occasional cells double-positive for TH and Calbindin, suggesting that they are likely to be A10-like subtype mDA neurons (Figure S1O). In sum, these data suggest that our neural organoids, after long-term culturing, produced A9-like mDA neurons which expressed TH, DAT, and GIRK2. While the hMLOs consist of DA neurons that are typical of midbrain tissue, the cellular heterogeneity and structure of the organoid culture might allow us to model aspects that cannot be studied using 2D culture. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated gene expression profiles for our organoid model system and 2D-grown mDA neurons (Figures S2A–S2D). Indeed, a large number of genes show differential expression between hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons (Figure 2A, Table S1). To test if the differences of hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons in transcriptomes reflect an upregulation of genes characteristic of brain development, we performed RNA-seq analyses from 10 human prenatal midbrain samples. A cluster analysis using the differentially expressed genes between hMLOs and 2D-DA neurons suggest that the hMLOs indeed show upregulation of genes that are expressed in human prenatal midbrain samples (Figure 2B). The genes that are differentially expressed in hMLOs compared to 2D-DA neurons significantly overlapped with differentially expressed genes in prenatal midbrain compared to 2D-DA neurons (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2E and Table S2, decreased expression: p = 2.2e−248; increased expression: p = 4.13e−313). Among the genes, which are expressed in hMLOs and prenatal midbrain, but not in 2D-DA neurons, were those genes expressed in additional cell types, such as OLIG3 (oligodendrocyte gene) and SLC1A3 (glial cell gene) (Figure 2E). mDA neuron-specific genes were commonly expressed in all samples (Figure 2F). A comparison with publicly available 2D-DA neuron expression data (Lin et al., 2016Lin L. Göke J. Cukuroglu E. Dranias M.R. VanDongen A.M. Stanton L.W. Molecular Features Underlying Neurodegeneration Identified through In Vitro Modeling of Genetically Diverse Parkinson’s Disease Patients.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 2411-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and data from adult midbrain, forebrain, and hindbrain (Consortium, 2015Consortium G.T. GTEx ConsortiumHuman genomics. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pilot analysis: multitissue gene regulation in humans.Science. 2015; 348: 648-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar) further suggests that hMLOs are closer to prenatal midbrain (Figure S2F). Together, this analysis of transcriptome profiles indicates that hMLOs indeed resemble aspects of gene expression profiles of prenatal midbrain that appear to be absent from mDA neurons generated by the conventional 2D method. During the long-term culture of the hMLOs, we observed sparse, black/brown-colored deposits in hMLOs by light microscopy after approximately 2 months. Furthermore, the number of these deposits gradually increased over time (Figure 3A). We hypothesized that these dark deposits were neuromelanin (NM), which are insoluble, black/brown granular pigments that accumulate in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in humans and primates (Sulzer et al., 2000Sulzer D. Bogulavsky J. Larsen K.E. Behr G. Karatekin E. Kleinman M.H. Turro N. Krantz D. Edwards R.H. Greene L.A. Zecca L. Neuromelanin biosynthesis is driven by excess cytosolic catecholamines not accumulated by synaptic vesicles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11869-11874Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed Fontana-Masson staining and found that these deposits stained positive (Figures 3B and S3A). As shown in Figure 3B, large, rough, and darkly stained granules were observed within the neuronal cytosol, which were similar to the stained granules in human postmortem SNpc sections (Figure 3C). Some of these granules in the hMLOs could be observed outside of neuronal cells, indicating that these NM granules could be secreted from mDA neurons within the hMLOs (Figure 3B). In contrast, we failed to detect Fontana-Masson-positive granules from 2D-DA neurons (Kriks et al., 2011Kriks S. Shim J.W. Piao J. Ganat Y.M. Wakeman D.R. Xie Z. Carrillo-Reid L. Auyeung G. Antonacci C. Buch A. et al.Dopamine neurons derived from human ES cells efficiently engraft in animal models of Parkinson’s disease.Nature. 2011; 480: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) (data not shown) or human cerebral organoids (hCOs) (Figures S3B and S3C) grown at a comparable number of days in vitro. Over time the amount of NM granules increased drastically (Figure 3D). Importantly, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that NM granules isolated from the hMLOs exhibited similar morphological characteristics as those isolated from human postmortem SNpc tissue (Figures 3E and 3F, Figures S3D–S3F, and Table S3). Given that NM is a byproduct of DA synthesis in mDA neurons, the addition of an exogenous dopamine precursor (L-DOPA) or DA is expected to accelerate the accumulation of NM in younger hMLO (Fedorow et al., 2005Fedorow H. Tribl F. Halliday G. Gerlach M. Riederer P. Double K.L. Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons: comparison with peripheral melanins and relevance to Parkinson’s disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed a robust distribution of NM-like granules in the hMLOs at day 45 following a 10-day treatment of L-DOPA (50 μM) or DA (50 μM), whereas no NM-like granules were observed in untreated hMLOs or L-DOPA-treated hCOs (Figures 3G and S3G). To determine whether the NM-containing cells were TH+, we immunostained adjacent sections from the same hMLO and observed TH+ cells within the same area that displayed NM-like granules (Figure 3H). NM-like granules have been observed primarily in primates, but not in mice (Fedorow et al., 2005Fedorow H. Tribl F. Halliday G. Gerlach M. Riederer P. Double K.L. Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons: comparison with peripheral melanins and relevance to Parkinson’s disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, no NM-like granules were observed in mouse ESC-derived MLOs (mMLOs) that contained TH+ neurons (Figure 3H). These data indicated that only human mDA neurons grown in 3D could produce NM-like granules in situ. To further characterize the NM-containing mDA neurons, we reasoned that NM-containing cells should be an enriched population of A9 mDA neurons that are present in SNpc, and we thus used FACS to sort out NM-containing cells from hMLOs (Figures S3H and S3I). With this method, we could prospectively isolate NM+ cells in the hMLOs (approximately 7% of total cells) (Figures S3J and S3K). We confirmed that isolated NM-containing cells were enriched with mDA neurons by immnostaining replated NM+ cells with antibodies against MAP2 and TH (Figure S3L). We performed reverse-transcription-specific target amplification on individual NM+ sorted cells and noted that the vast majority of NM-sorted cells (87%) expressed MAP2, but among these cells some were negative for TH (Figure S3M), possibly due to the uptake of extracellularly released NM granules by non-dopaminergic neurons. We then focused our analysis on TH+/MAP2+ cells and characterized their subtype identity by the Fluidigm Biomark Array. Not surprisingly, most cells expressed pan-DA neuronal markers including EN1/2 (Figure S3N). We also noted that SNpc-related genes were more highly expressed in NM-containing cells, compared to ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related genes (Figure S3N) (Poulin et al., 2014Poulin J.F. Zou J. Drouin-Ouellet J. Kim K.Y. Cicchetti F. Awatramani R.B. Defining midbrain dopaminergic neuron diversity by single-cell gene expression profiling.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 930-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), consistent with the known association of NM with A9, but not A10, neurons. Expression of markers indicative of other neuronal lineages was largely absent (Figure S3O). Collectively, these data indicate that the NM-containing neurons in the hMLOs preferentially expressed markers of SNpc, but not VTA, which corroborates well with our immunostaining data (Figure 1). To test whether the neurons in the hMLOs were electrically active and functionally mature, we sliced hMLOs into 350 μm sections and performed acute, targeted, whole-cell patch recordings (Figure 4A) (Paşca et al., 2015Paşca A.M. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Tian Y. Makinson C.D. Huber N. Kim C.H. Park J.Y. O’Rourke N.A.

In voltage-clamp mode, neurons within the hMLOs showed fast, inactivating inward and outward currents, which likely corresponded to the opening of voltage-dependent sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels, respectively (Figure 4B). The peak voltage-gated Na+- and K+-channel currents increased significantly from day 33 to day 65 (Figure 4C). Consistently, we observed a considerable decrease in membrane resistance (Rm) and increase in membrane capacitance (Cm), and these changes correlated with the functional maturation of the neurons (Table S4). Action potentials (APs) were elicited when we depolarized the membrane in current-clamp mode (Figure 4D) and APs could be elicited from the majority of hMLO neurons (69.23%, n = 26) (Figure 4E and Table S4). Next, we investigated whether neurons within the hMLOs exhibited spontaneous synaptic transmission in situ, and we found that most of the recorded neurons showed spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) as well as spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (Figure 4F). In addition, we observed large-amplitude excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs > 20 pA) in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, demonstrating that the neurons inside the hMLOs participated in network activity (Figure 4G). More than 20% of neurons within the hMLOs showed rhythmic discharges, with an average frequency of 2.78 Hz (Figures 4H and 4I), and rebound depolarizations resulted in AP generation after short hyperpolarization of neurons (Figure 4J), which are characteristics of mDA neurons (Pfisterer et al., 2011Pfisterer U. Kirkeby A. Torper O. Wood J. Nelander J. Dufour A. Björklund A. Lindvall O. Jakobsson J. Parmar M. Direct conversion of human fibroblasts to dopaminergic neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 10343-10348Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The application of the specific D2/D3 receptor agonist quinpirole (1 μM) markedly suppressed the firing of recorded neurons (Figures 4K and 4L), indicating the presence of functional dopamine receptors in mDA neurons within the hMLOs. Intriguingly, post hoc immunohistochemistry of the recorded neurons (labeled with biocytin) in the hMLOs revealed that most (n = 8/10) were TH+, indicating that the recorded neurons were indeed mDA neurons (Figure 4M). Furthermore, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements showed that the DA content within hMLOs gradually increased as they matured (Figure 4N). Taken together, these data indicate that mDA neurons within the hMLOs produced DA, exhibited mature neuronal properties, and were able to form synapses with other neurons within the hMLOs. Here, we have demonstrated that hESCs can be steered to differentiate into midbrain progenitors, which subsequently self-organize into 3D hMLOs comprising distinct cell layers with functional mDA neurons, but not the forebrain or the hindbrain (Figures S2G and S2H). Most approaches that have been developed so far have utilized 2D monolayer cultures on flat and rigid substrates to differentiate hPSCs into mDA neurons (Arenas et al., 2015Arenas E. Denham M. Villaescusa J.C. How to make a midbrain dopaminergic neuron.Development. 2015; 142: 1918-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although 2D cell culture has proven to be a valuable method for cell-based studies, lack of the 3D environment and multiple cell types has often led to inaccurate cellular responses and failure to recapitulate important physiological features of tissue in vivo (Fatehullah et al., 2016Fatehullah A. Tan S.H. Barker N. Organoids as an in vitro model of human development and disease.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). TH+ neurons in the hMLOs exhibited biochemical and electrophysiological properties of mature mDA neurons and expressed functional DA receptors (Figures 4K and 4L). Intriguingly, these neurons receive inputs from other neuronal cells in the hMLOs, indicating that they make functional neuronal networks, demonstrating the potential utility of the hMLO in evaluating the degree of synaptic competence and connections. In our hMLOs, we observed other neuronal cells such as GABA+ neurons (Figure S2I), consistent with in vivo midbrain (Korotkova et al., 2004Korotkova T.M. Ponomarenko A.A. Brown R.E. Haas H.L. Functional diversity of ventral midbrain dopamine and GABAergic neurons.Mol. Neurobiol. 2004; 29: 243-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although our transcriptome analysis showed that the hMLOs resemble prenatal midbrain and mDA neurons, future studies using single-cell transcriptome analysis may be required to further validate the similarity of the genetic expression program among them (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G. Badsha F. Florio M. Kanton S. Gerber T. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Lewitus E. Sykes A. Hevers W. Lancaster M. et al.Human cerebral organoids recapitulate gene expression programs of fetal neocortex development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 15672-15677Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found that human mDA neurons within 3D MLOs could produce NM-like granules while human mDA neurons in 2D culture and mouse mDA neurons within 3D MLOs did not. NM is a dark, complex, and insoluble pigment particularly concentrated in the mDA neurons of SN and in the noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus, the two brain areas mostly affected by PD (Fedorow et al., 2005Fedorow H. Tribl F. Halliday G. Gerlach M. Riederer P. Double K.L. Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons: comparison with peripheral melanins and relevance to Parkinson’s disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The origin and physiological function of NM remain controversial: several lines of evidence have demonstrated possible protective features of NM; however, many other studies concluded that NM is a toxic byproduct of DA synthesis in mDA neurons (Zecca et al., 2003Zecca L.

The paucity of knowledge of NM has been due to the limited availability/accessibility of human NM, which could only be extracted from human postmortem midbrain tissues. Given the robustness of our protocol to generate human mDA neurons that readily produce NM granules, our 3D hMLOs provide a source of human DA neuron-derived NM in situ. Thus our method offers a potentially useful approach to study NM granules and associated proteins from PD patient-derived iPSC lines, which may shed light onto the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PD. The hESC lines H1 (WA01) and H9 (WA09) were cultured feeder-free on Matrigel (BD Biosciences) with mTeSR1 (StemCell Technologies, Inc.). hPSC lines before passage 40 were used to generate hMLOs. The hPSCs were dissociated to single cells to form uniform EBs in neuronal induction medium supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Calbiochem). On day 4, hMLOs were cultured with the addition of midbrain patterning factors, 100 ng/mL SHH-C25II (R&D Systems) and 100 ng/mL FGF8 (R&D Systems) for 3 days. When neuroectodermal buds were starting to extrude, the hMLOs were embedded in 30 μL of reduced growth factor Matrigel and grown in tissue growth induction medium containing 100 ng/mL SHH-C25II and 100 ng/mL FGF8. After 24 hr, the hMLOs were embedded in Matrigel, transferred into ultra-low-attachment 6-well-plates (Costar) containing the final organoid differentiation media, which was supplemented with 10 ng/mL BDNF (Peprotech), 10 ng/mL GDNF (Peprotech), 100 μM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 125 μM db-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), and cultured using an orbital shaker. The medium was replenished every 3 days. A detailed protocol of generating hMLOs is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The ventral half of the midbrain was dissected from second trimester prenatal brainstem under visual inspection using a scalpel and hand-held dental drill (Table S5). Cases were donated with informed consent of the mother and were selected on the basis of (1) the absence of any congenital anatomical abnormality upon macroscopic brain inspection and (2) the absence of any major genetic defect noted on prenatal testing. The IRB approval is from the Western IRB (study number, 1126332; WIRB protocol number, 20111080). Immunohistochemistry of all organoids and tissue samples was performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Fontana-Masson staining to detect NM was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A detailed description is available in the Supplemental Experiment Procedures. RNA-seq was performed using hMLOs, 2D-DA neurons, or postmortem midbrain tissues (Table S5). For RNA-seq analysis, reads were mapped with TopHat2-2.0.12 (Kim et al., 2013Kim D. Pertea G. Trapnell C.

TopHat2: accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: R36Crossref PubMed Scopus (8747) Google Scholar), reads were counted using the R package GenomicAlignments (Lawrence et al., 2013Lawrence M.

https://openalex.org/W2493146871,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has emerged as a global public health problem because of its ability to cause severe congenital disease. Here, we developed six mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against ZIKV including four (ZV-48, ZV-54, ZV-64, and ZV-67) that were ZIKV specific and neutralized infection of African, Asian, and American strains to varying degrees. X-ray crystallographic and competition binding analyses of Fab fragments and scFvs defined three spatially distinct epitopes in DIII of the envelope protein corresponding to the lateral ridge (ZV-54 and ZV-67), C-C' loop (ZV-48 and ZV-64), and ABDE sheet (ZV-2) regions. In vivo passive transfer studies revealed protective activity of DIII-lateral ridge specific neutralizing mAbs in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Our results suggest that DIII is targeted by multiple type-specific antibodies with distinct neutralizing activity, which provides a path for developing prophylactic antibodies for use in pregnancy or designing epitope-specific vaccines against ZIKV."
https://openalex.org/W2495582206,"Pancreatic cancer is a deadly malignancy that lacks effective therapeutics. We previously reported that oncogenic Kras induced the redox master regulator Nfe2l2/Nrf2 to stimulate pancreatic and lung cancer initiation. Here, we show that NRF2 is necessary to maintain pancreatic cancer proliferation by regulating mRNA translation. Specifically, loss of NRF2 led to defects in autocrine epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and oxidation of specific translational regulatory proteins, resulting in impaired cap-dependent and cap-independent mRNA translation in pancreatic cancer cells. Combined targeting of the EGFR effector AKT and the glutathione antioxidant pathway mimicked Nrf2 ablation to potently inhibit pancreatic cancer ex vivo and in vivo, representing a promising synthetic lethal strategy for treating the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2497525607,"Clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins is central to cell survival. Here, we describe a new pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis mediated by the proteasome shuttle factor UBQLN2. The 26S proteasome degrades polyubiquitylated substrates by recognizing them through stoichiometrically bound ubiquitin receptors, but substrates are also delivered by reversibly bound shuttles. We aimed to determine why these parallel delivery mechanisms exist and found that UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act. Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2267732457,"This bibliometric study of a large publication set dealing with research on climate change aims at mapping the relevant literature from a bibliometric perspective and presents a multitude of quantitative data: (1) The growth of the overall publication output as well as (2) of some major subfields, (3) the contributing journals and countries as well as their citation impact, and (4) a title word analysis aiming to illustrate the time evolution and relative importance of specific research topics. The study is based on 222,060 papers (articles and reviews only) published between 1980 and 2014. The total number of papers shows a strong increase with a doubling every 5–6 years. Continental biomass related research is the major subfield, closely followed by climate modeling. Research dealing with adaptation, mitigation, risks, and vulnerability of global warming is comparatively small, but their share of papers increased exponentially since 2005. Research on vulnerability and on adaptation published the largest proportion of very important papers (in terms of citation impact). Climate change research has become an issue also for disciplines beyond the natural sciences. The categories Engineering and Social Sciences show the strongest field-specific relative increase. The Journal of Geophysical Research, the Journal of Climate, the Geophysical Research Letters, and Climatic Change appear at the top positions in terms of the total number of papers published. Research on climate change is quantitatively dominated by the USA, followed by the UK, Germany, and Canada. The citation-based indicators exhibit consistently that the UK has produced the largest proportion of high impact papers compared to the other countries (having published more than 10,000 papers). Also, Switzerland, Denmark and also The Netherlands (with a publication output between around 3,000 and 6,000 papers) perform top—the impact of their contributions is on a high level. The title word analysis shows that the term climate change comes forward with time. Furthermore, the term impact arises and points to research dealing with the various effects of climate change. The discussion of the question of human induced climate change towards a clear fact (for the majority of the scientific community) stimulated research on future pathways for adaptation and mitigation. Finally, the term model and related terms prominently appear independent of time, indicating the high relevance of climate modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2485841399,"Variation in the differentiation capacity of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to specific lineages is a significant concern for their use in clinical applications and disease modeling. To identify factors that affect differentiation capacity, we performed integration analyses between hematopoietic differentiation performance and molecular signatures such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin status, using 35 human iPSC lines and four ESC lines. Our analyses revealed that hematopoietic commitment of PSCs to hematopoietic precursors correlates with IGF2 expression level, which in turn depends on signaling-dependent chromatin accessibility at mesendodermal genes. Maturation capacity for conversion of PSC-derived hematopoietic precursors to mature blood associates with the amount and pattern of DNA methylation acquired during reprogramming. Our study therefore provides insight into the molecular features that determine the differential capacities seen among human iPSC lines and, through the predictive potential of this information, highlights a way to select optimal iPSCs for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2487895297,"The genome-wide localization and function of endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in adult stem cells are unknown. Here, we show that in human epidermal stem cells, the two proteins bind in a histone H3K36me3-dependent manner to the most active enhancers and are required to produce their associated enhancer RNAs. Both proteins prefer super-enhancers associated to genes that either define the ectodermal lineage or establish the stem cell and differentiated states. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ in their mechanisms of enhancer regulation: Dnmt3a associates with p63 to maintain high levels of DNA hydroxymethylation at the center of enhancers in a Tet2-dependent manner, whereas Dnmt3b promotes DNA methylation along the body of the enhancer. Depletion of either protein inactivates their target enhancers and profoundly affects epidermal stem cell function. Altogether, we reveal novel functions for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b at enhancers that could contribute to their roles in disease and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2501822306,"Contemporary research suggests that the mammalian brain is a complex system, implying that damage to even a single functional area could have widespread consequences across the system. To test this hypothesis, we pharmacogenetically inactivated the rhesus monkey amygdala, a subcortical region with distributed and well-defined cortical connectivity. We then examined the impact of that perturbation on global network organization using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Amygdala inactivation disrupted amygdalocortical communication and distributed corticocortical coupling across multiple functional brain systems. Altered coupling was explained using a graph-based analysis of experimentally established structural connectivity to simulate disconnection of the amygdala. Communication capacity via monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways, in aggregate, largely accounted for the correlational structure of endogenous brain activity and many of the non-local changes that resulted from amygdala inactivation. These results highlight the structural basis of distributed neural activity and suggest a strategy for linking focal neuropathology to remote neurophysiological changes."
https://openalex.org/W2506440925,"Small immune complexes cause type III hypersensitivity reactions that frequently result in tissue injury. The responsible mechanisms, however, remain unclear and differ depending on target organs. Here, we identify a kidney-specific anatomical and functional unit, formed by resident macrophages and peritubular capillary endothelial cells, which monitors the transport of proteins and particles ranging from 20 to 700 kDa or 10 to 200 nm into the kidney interstitium. Kidney-resident macrophages detect and scavenge circulating immune complexes ""pumped"" into the interstitium via trans-endothelial transport and trigger a FcγRIV-dependent inflammatory response and the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils. In addition, FcγRIV and TLR pathways synergistically ""super-activate"" kidney macrophages when immune complexes contain a nucleic acid. These data identify a physiological function of tissue-resident kidney macrophages and a basic mechanism by which they initiate the inflammatory response to small immune complexes in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2507105795,"To survive, humans must estimate their own ability and the abilities of others. We found that, although people estimated their abilities on the basis of their own performance in a rational manner, their estimates of themselves were partly merged with the performance of others. Reciprocally, their ability estimates for others also reflected their own, as well as the others', performance. Self-other mergence operated in a context-dependent manner: interacting with high or low performers, respectively, enhanced and diminished own ability estimates in cooperative contexts, but the opposite occurred in competitive contexts. Self-other mergence not only influenced subjective evaluations, it also affected how people subsequently objectively adjusted their performance. Perigenual anterior cingulate cortex tracked one's own performance. Dorsomedial frontal area 9 tracked others' performances, but also integrated contextual and self-related information. Self-other mergence increased with the strength of self and other representations in area 9, suggesting it carries interdependent representations of self and other."
https://openalex.org/W2478384716,"Hunger and thirst are ancient homeostatic drives for food and water consumption. Although molecular and neural mechanisms underlying these drives are currently being uncovered, less is known about how hunger and thirst interact. Here, we use molecular genetic, behavioral, and anatomical studies in Drosophila to identify four neurons that modulate food and water consumption. Activation of these neurons promotes sugar consumption and restricts water consumption, whereas inactivation promotes water consumption and restricts sugar consumption. By calcium imaging studies, we show that these neurons are directly regulated by a hormone signal of nutrient levels and by osmolality. Finally, we identify a hormone receptor and an osmolality-sensitive ion channel that underlie this regulation. Thus, a small population of neurons senses internal signals of nutrient and water availability to balance sugar and water consumption. Our results suggest an elegant mechanism by which interoceptive neurons oppositely regulate homeostatic drives to eat and drink."
https://openalex.org/W2481948442,"The forward reaction of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) reduces NADP(+) at the expense of NADH oxidation and H(+) movement down the electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane, establishing an NADPH/NADP(+) ratio severalfold higher than the NADH/NAD(+) ratio in the matrix. In turn, NADPH drives processes, such as peroxide detoxification and reductive biosynthesis. In this study, we generated a congenic mouse model carrying a mutated Nnt(C57BL/6J) allele from the C57BL/6J substrain. Suspensions of isolated mitochondria from Nnt(+/+), Nnt(+/-), and Nnt(-/-) mouse liver were biochemically evaluated and challenged with exogenous peroxide under different respiratory states. The respiratory substrates were also varied, and the participation of concurrent NADPH sources (i.e. isocitrate dehydrogenase-2, malic enzymes, and glutamate dehydrogenase) was assessed. The principal findings include the following: Nnt(+/-) and Nnt(-/-) exhibit ∼50% and absent NNT activity, respectively, but the activities of concurrent NADPH sources are unchanged. The lack of NNT activity in Nnt(-/-) mice impairs peroxide metabolism in intact mitochondria. The contribution of NNT to peroxide metabolism is decreased during ADP phosphorylation compared with the non-phosphorylating state; however, it is accompanied by increased contributions of concurrent NADPH sources, especially glutamate dehydrogenase. NNT makes a major contribution to peroxide metabolism during the blockage of mitochondrial electron transport. Interestingly, peroxide metabolism in the Nnt(+/-) mitochondria matched that in the Nnt(+/+) mitochondria. Overall, this study demonstrates that the respiratory state and/or substrates that sustain energy metabolism markedly influence the relative contribution of NNT (i.e. varies between nearly 0 and 100%) to NADPH-dependent mitochondrial peroxide metabolism."

Food preferences are affected greatly by the qualities of food, including nutrient value, texture, and the taste valence of sweet, bitter, salty, and sour qualities (Foster et al., 2011Foster K.D.

Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). During the last 15 years, many of the gustatory receptor proteins that participate in the discrimination of the chemical composition of food have been defined (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the basis through which food texture is detected is enigmatic, despite the universal appreciation that the physical properties of food greatly influence decisions to consume a prospective offering (Rolls, 2005Rolls E.T. Taste, olfactory, and food texture processing in the brain, and the control of food intake.Physiol. Behav. 2005; 85: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). There are specific tactile features associated with liquid or solid food. Viscosity and creaminess are typical textural features of liquid food, whereas hardness, crispiness, and softness are the main physical characteristics of solid food (Koç et al., 2013Koç H. Vinyard C.J. Essick G.K. Foegeding E.A. Food oral processing: conversion of food structure to textural perception.Annu. Rev. Food Sci. Technol. 2013; 4: 237-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similar to food tastes, food texture provides important information concerning food quality, including freshness and wholesomeness. For instance, people prefer freshly baked bread with relatively soft texture, and tend to reject older bread with a harder texture, even though the chemical composition has not changed significantly over the course of a couple of days. Furthermore, while exploring the food landscape, an animal must make assessments of food hardness and viscosity in order to exert the appropriate force to chew or ingest (Foster et al., 2011Foster K.D. Grigor J.M. Cheong J.N. Yoo M.J. Bronlund J.E. Morgenstern M.P. The role of oral processing in dynamic sensory perception.J. Food Sci. 2011; 76: R49-R61Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Koç et al., 2013Koç H. Vinyard C.J. Essick G.K. Foegeding E.A. Food oral processing: conversion of food structure to textural perception.Annu. Rev. Food Sci. Technol. 2013; 4: 237-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Insufficient chewing force results in poor food processing, while excessive force can cause injury to the tongue or teeth. Food texture in mammals is predominantly detected through poorly understood mechanisms in taste organs. In rodents and humans, a subset of trigeminal nerves such as the lingual nerve provides somatosensitive afferents to the tongue (Westberg and Kolta, 2011Westberg K.G. Kolta A. The trigeminal circuits responsible for chewing.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2011; 97: 77-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Whitehead et al., 1985Whitehead M.C. Beeman C.S. Kinsella B.A. Distribution of taste and general sensory nerve endings in fungiform papillae of the hamster.Am. J. Anat. 1985; 173: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Due to the intrinsic mechanical properties of food, mastication produces compression and shearing forces, which in turn activate mechanosensory neurons in taste organs. However, the molecular identities of mechanosensory neurons and signaling proteins that enable animals to detect food texture are unknown. To address the fundamental issue concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms that function in the sensation of food texture, we turned to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as an animal model. In flies, food quality is evaluated largely through external sensory hairs (sensilla), which decorate the fly tongue (the labellum) and several other body parts (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). These sensilla, which house several sensory neurons, allow the chemical composition of foods, such as sugars and bitter compounds, to be detected prior to entering the mouthparts. Here, we found that Drosophila can discriminate between foods on the basis of hardness and viscosity. We identify a previously unknown type of mechanosensory neuron in the fly tongue that is dedicated to detecting food mechanics. These multidendritic neurons in the labellum (md-L) extend their projections into the bases of most of the external sensilla and are activated by deflections induced by hard and viscous food. The ability of md-L neurons to sense food mechanics is virtually lost due to elimination of the only Drosophila member of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family. Mice and humans each encode eight TMC proteins (Keresztes et al., 2003Keresztes G. Mutai H. Heller S. TMC and EVER genes belong to a larger novel family, the TMC gene family encoding transmembrane proteins.BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and mutations in the founding member of this family, TMC1, cause deafness in mammals (Kurima et al., 2002Kurima K. Peters L.M. Yang Y. Riazuddin S. Ahmed Z.M. Naz S. Arnaud D. Drury S. Mo J. Makishima T. et al.Dominant and recessive deafness caused by mutations of a novel gene, TMC1, required for cochlear hair-cell function.Nat.

Balling R. et al.Beethoven, a mouse model for dominant, progressive hearing loss DFNA36.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that tmc is broadly tuned to detect both soft and hard food textures. Remarkably, optogenetic stimulation of the md-L neurons with different light intensities yields opposing behavioral outcomes—weak light promotes feeding, while strong light represses feeding. We conclude that md-L neurons and TMC are critical cellular and molecular components that enable external sensory bristles on the fly tongue to communicate textural features to the brain, and do so through a pre-ingestive mechanism. We chose the fruit fly as a potential animal model to uncover mechanisms through which basic food textures, such as viscosity for liquid food and hardness for solid food, affect taste preference (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To explore how the viscosity of liquid food influences feeding behavior, we used a colorless, odorless, and tasteless chemical, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), since low levels of HPC dissolved in water (0.5%–1.5%) give rise to a wide range of viscosities (Figure 1A). Moreover, using tip recordings to assay action potentials in fly gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), we established that 0.5%–1.5% of HPC did not elicit gustatory activity (Figures 1B and 1C). However, when HPC was mixed with 100 mM sucrose, it had little effect on sugar-induced action potentials (Figures 1B and 1C). Taken together, HPC is an ideal chemical compound to assess the impact of viscosity on feeding in that it causes a striking change in food viscosity without modifying intrinsic food taste. Next, we used HPC to examine how wild-type flies respond to liquid foods of different viscosities. Toward this end, we conducted proboscis extension reflex (PER) assays. We constrained the legs and wings of the flies within a small pipet tip, which left the proboscis and head exposed (Figure 1D). We then touched the proboscis using a drop of sucrose solution (100 mM) mixed with different concentrations of HPC (0%–1.5%). Pre-starved flies readily accepted sucrose solutions by extending their proboscis (Figure 1E). However, as the sucrose solution became more viscous, the animals showed a significant decline in receptivity to the liquid food (Figures 1F and 1G). We then asked whether the hardness of solid food impacted feeding behavior in fruit flies. To test this idea, we chose agarose as a food-gelling ingredient because food viscoelasticity could be changed readily by varying the concentration of agarose. Furthermore, since agarose is nontoxic, tasteless, and odorless, it serves as an excellent food-supporting material that allows us to investigate the sole contribution of food hardness to feeding behavior. The minimal agarose concentration that can form solid food is ∼0.5%. To quantitatively characterize food texture, we performed rheological measurements (Vélez-Ruiz and Barbosa Cánovas, 1997Vélez-Ruiz J.F. Barbosa Cánovas G.V. Rheological properties of selected dairy products.Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1997; 37: 311-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using 2 mM sucrose combined with a spectrum of agarose concentrations. According to our rheometric assays, the stiffness, or hardness, of food increased exponentially as the agarose concentration rose (Figure 1H). To analyze the impact of food hardness on feeding behavior, we conducted two-way choice assays using a Petri dish (Figure S1, available online) (Zhang et al., 2013aZhang Y.V. Ni J. Montell C. The molecular basis for attractive salt-taste coding in Drosophila.Science. 2013; 340: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2013bZhang Y.V. Raghuwanshi R.P. Shen W.L. Montell C. Food experience-induced taste desensitization modulated by the Drosophila TRPL channel.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1468-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One half of the dish contained 2 mM sucrose and 1% agarose, while the other half contained 2 mM sucrose and a series of agarose concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 4%. With this instrument, we subjected the control flies to two-way feeding behavioral assays and assessed food preference by inspecting the color of their abdomens due to the food dyes. We found that flies preferred consuming food with 1% agarose over softer food (0.5% agarose) and harder foods with decreasing preference as stiffness increases (2%–4% agarose; Figure 1I). Furthermore, to ascertain that the food hardness was directly sensed through the primary taste organ, the proboscis, we performed PER assays using 0.5%–4% agarose gelled with 100 mM sucrose. Consistent with the two-way feeding assays, the PER assays showed that as the agarose concentration rose from 0.5% to 1%, the wild-type flies exhibited enhanced food preferences, while the animals showed a gradual decrease in food preference as the agarose concentration increased above 1% (Figure 1J). Taken together, flies show bi-directional food preferences for foods with varying agarose concentrations, and they prefer food with 1% agarose. Our data indicate that fruit flies elicit gustatory preferences based on viscosity and hardness. Moreover, flies discriminate these fundamental textural properties of liquid and solid foods pre-ingestively, similar to the discrimination of sugars and aversive compounds, which is sensed through GRNs in sensory sensilla external to the mouth parts (Liman et al., 2014Liman E.R. Zhang Y.V. Montell C. Peripheral coding of taste.Neuron. 2014; 81: 984-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To identify candidate molecules that contribute to the detection of a physical property of food, we screened mutants and RNAi lines disrupting a number of different classes of receptors and ion channels that are known to be expressed in the labellum or function in taste and other sensory modalities. These include gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs) and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, several of which are known mechanosensors involved in touch, proprioception, and hearing (Akitake et al., 2015Akitake B.

None of these candidates were required for sensing food mechanics (Figure 2A). Flies lacking the Piezo channel (Kim et al., 2012Kim S.E. Coste B. Chadha A. Cook B. Patapoutian A. The role of Drosophila Piezo in mechanical nociception.Nature. 2012; 483: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) also showed normal discrimination of food hardness (Figure 2A). We also tested a role for Drosophila TMC, since mammalian TMC1 and TMC2 affect hearing (Kurima et al., 2002Kurima K. Peters L.M. Yang Y. Riazuddin S. Ahmed Z.M. Naz S. Arnaud D. Drury S. Mo J.

Genet. 2002; 30: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and therefore may have sensory roles in flies. As opposed to mice and humans, each of which encodes eight TMC family members, fruit flies encode only a single TMC homolog (Kurima et al., 2003Kurima K. Yang Y. Sorber K. Griffith A.J. Characterization of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) gene family: functional clues from hearing loss and epidermodysplasia verruciformis.Genomics. 2003; 82: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To address whether Drosophila tmc was required for sensing food texture, we obtained a fly line with a transposon (PiggyBac; tmcPB), which inserted in the DNA sequence encoding residue 1,365 of the 1,932 amino acid TMC protein. We then compared the control and tmcPB preferences between sucrose embedded in either 1% agarose or 3% agarose. Most wild-type animals chose food containing 1% agarose. However, tmcPB mutant animals exhibited a moderate deficit in choosing 1% agarose food (Figure 2A). Given the mild abnormality displayed by the tmcPB mutant, we generated a null allele (tmc1) by homologous recombination. The 500 base pair deletion included the genomic fragment encoding the 120 amino acid TMC domain (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B), which is highly conserved among human, mouse, fly, and worm TMCs (>50% identity) (Kurima et al., 2003Kurima K. Yang Y. Sorber K. Griffith A.J. Characterization of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) gene family: functional clues from hearing loss and epidermodysplasia verruciformis.Genomics. 2003; 82: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region plays an evolutionally indispensable role. In addition, the deletion changed the reading frame and deleted several donor and acceptor sites used for mRNA splicing. As a consequence, the mRNA transcript is no longer properly processed and is therefore undetectable in tmc1 flies (Figure S2C). The tmc1 flies were viable and healthy, and appeared morphologically normal. Next, we tested the capability of null tmc1 flies to discriminate foods of different stiffness by varying the agarose concentration from 0.5% to 4%. Based on two-way choice assays, tmc1 flies showed severe impairments in discriminating 1% agarose-containing food from softer or harder agarose foods (Figure 2C). Moreover, wild-type flies preferred slightly hard food (2% agarose) over moderately hard (3% agarose) or very hard food (4% agarose; Figures S3A–S3C). In contrast, tmc1 animals showed impairments in discriminating between different hard foods (Figures S3A–S3C). The deficits in avoiding hard foods exhibited by tmc1 were more severe than displayed by tmcPB (Figure S3D). Strikingly, using the PER assays, tmc1 flies had similar preferences for sucrose-containing soft food (1% agarose) and hard food (4% agarose; Figure 2D). Consequently, the mutant flies showed a lower PER relative to controls in response to the soft food and much higher responses to hard food (Figure 2D), indicating that tmc is required to sense both soft and hard foods. The tmc1 mutant also showed severe deficits in discriminating liquid foods with different levels of viscosity (Figure 2E). The defects in discriminating food texture were not secondary to a general feeding abnormality, as tmc1 mutants exhibited normal avoidance of bitter tastants such as quinine, denatonium, strychnine, and berberine (Figure S3E). Taken together, tmc1 mutant flies did not display a general deficit in food consumption or taste preferences. Rather, tmc was selectively required to discriminate among foods with a broad range of hardness or viscosity. To examine whether the deficit in food texture perception was due to the loss of tmc, we conducted genetic rescue experiments with the tmc cDNA. To clone the full-length cDNA from the proboscis, the primary taste organ analogous to the human tongue, we performed RT-PCR (Figure S2C). The tmc cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 1,932 amino acids, which was much larger than its counterparts in worms, mice, and humans (757 to 1,285 amino acids) (Kurima et al., 2003Kurima K. Yang Y. Sorber K. Griffith A.J. Characterization of the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) gene family: functional clues from hearing loss and epidermodysplasia verruciformis.Genomics. 2003; 82: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found that the abnormality exhibited by tmc1 animals in sensing food hardness and viscosity was fully reversed by expressing the tmc cDNA (UAS-tmc) under control of the tmc promoter (tmc-Gal4; Figures 2C–2E and S3A–S3C). To characterize the expression pattern of TMC, we generated TMC antibodies. As revealed by immunocytochemical assays, TMC was localized to md-L neurons (Figure 3A). TMC was present in the dendritic terminals, implying a sensory role (Figure 3A). In contrast, we did not observe anti-TMC immunoreactivity in tmc1 animals, confirming the specificity of the TMC antibodies (Figure 3B). In order to acquire higher-resolution images of the processes of the md-L neuron, we generated a tmc-Gal4 reporter transgene that included a 3 kb promoter region upstream of the tmc transcriptional start site. In combination with the UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter, we found that the tmc-Gal4 specifically stained one multidendritic neuron in each of the two bilaterally symmetrical labella (Figure 3C). Based on double-labeling experiments with TMC antibodies, the neuron was identical to md-L (Figures S4A–S4C). The cell body of the md-L neuron was positioned next to one of the I-type sensilla (I6) at the proximal part of the labella (Figure 3D). Remarkably, md-L neurons extended fine and elaborate dendritic branches innervating the bases of many sensilla, the majority of which (∼70%) were L-type sensilla (Figure 3D). Other than md-L neurons, the tmc-Gal4 reporter labeled a few multidendritic neurons in the ventral cibarial sensory organ (VCSO) (Figure 3E), an accessory taste organ analogous to the human pharynx. The multiple elaborate dendritic branches assembled into a brush-like structure that faced the luminal side of the food-passing tunnel (Figure 3E), implying that they may sense the shearing force during food flow. To examine the relative expression of md-L neurons and GRNs, we generated a QF line (Potter et al., 2010Potter C.J. Tasic B. Russler E.V. Liang L. Luo L. The Q system: a repressible binary system for transgene expression, lineage tracing, and mosaic analysis.Cell. 2010; 141: 536-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) using the same tmc promoter as for the tmc-Gal4 line. We then performed double-labeling experiments with the Gr5a-Gal4 reporter, which labels sugar-sensitive GRNs (Thorne et al., 2004Thorne N. Chromey C. Bray S. Amrein H. Taste perception and coding in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1065-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2004Wang Z. Singhvi A. Kong P. Scott K. Taste representations in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The tmc and Gr5a reporters labeled two morphologically different types of neurons in the labellum: the tmc reporter marked md-L neurons, while the Gr5a reporter stained bipolar GRNs (Figure 3F). The dendritic branches of md-L neurons entangled closely with the GRNs underneath the cuticle (Figure 3F). Furthermore, confocal imaging analysis revealed that many dendritic arbors of md-L neurons are closely associated with the cell bodies of GRNs (Figure 3G). We also examined the projection pattern of the md-L axon in the central brain. The axonal terminals projected to subesophageal zone (SEZ) (Figure 3H), a brain region dedicated to processing taste input from the peripheral system. The particular region targeted by md-L neurons was different from that innervated by GRNs, such as those marked by the Gr5a-Gal4 (Figure 3I). Other than the SEZ, the tmc-Gal4 stained at least two other brain regions: ventral projection neurons of the antennal lobe and a subset of mushroom-body neurons (Figure 3H). We also detected tmc-Gal4 expression in a few neurons located at the wing hinge (Figure S4D) and the leg joint, indicating a potential role in proprioception (Figure S4E). However, we did not detect tmc-Gal4 expression in the tarsal leg segment, a peripheral taste organ (Figure S4E). In summary, tmc molecularly defines a previously unrecognized sensory neuron in the fruit fly proboscis. The unique dendritic arborization pattern of md-L neurons at the bases of many sensilla suggests that these multidendritic neurons may detect compression forces arising from the bending of taste sensilla. To investigate whether md-L neurons might be responsible for detecting mechanical stimuli applied to gustatory sensilla, we performed electrophysiological analysis. We deflected taste bristles using the tip of a fine glass pipet controlled by a piezoelectric activator system. Bending of taste sensilla produced stress at the base of sensilla, and may mechanically activate the underlying dendrites of md-L neurons. We identified the cell body of the md-L neuron using the I6 sensillum as a landmark. We also expressed a GPF reporter (UAS-mCD8::GFP) under the control of the tmc-Gal4 and pinpointed the md-L cell body by fluorescent microscopy. We then recorded the electrophysiological responses of the md-L neuron with a recording electrode impaled in the vicinity of its cell body. This recording configuration allowed for single-unit recordings of md-L neuronal activity. In Drosophila, sensory bristles extend from many body parts, such as the thorax, and exhibit planar cell polarity (Klein and Mlodzik, 2005Klein T.J. Mlodzik M. Planar cell polarization: an emerging model points in the right direction.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Similarly, most of the L-type taste bristles, which are associated with md-L dendrites, point from the dorsal side down to the ventral side. To determine if md-L neurons are sensitive to forces applied in a particular direction, we deflected wild-type L-type sensilla in four different directions: dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior. Strikingly, when we bent the sensilla with a displacement of 20 μm in the dorsal direction, the md-L neurons fired rapidly adapting action potentials (Figures 4A and 4B ; 8.0 ± 1.0 spikes/500 ms). In contrast, deflecting the sensilla in the ventral direction triggered 60% fewer spikes (Figures 4A and 4B; 3.2 ± 0.7 spikes/500 ms). When we bent the taste bristles the same distance in either the anterior or the posterior direction, the md-L neurons produced ≤25% of the spikes generated by a dorsal deflection (Figures 4A and 4B; spikes/500 ms were as follows: anterior, 2.0 ± 0.5; posterior, 1.8 ± 0.4). Furthermore, when we deflected the bristles in four directions over a range of distances (10–30 μm), the md-L neurons were still most sensitive to bending in the dorsal direction (Figures S5A–S5D).

The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory (CMBI), Chinese version of the EPQ-revised Short Scale, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ) were used to gather data. Moderated mediation analysis was used in this study; it was executed using the PROCESS macro so that the mediators and moderator could function together in the same model.The prevalence of anxiety symptoms among the physicians was 31%, and there were no differences between the sexes. The results showed that positive and negative coping styles partially mediated the association between burnout and anxiety symptoms in physicians. The mediated effect of positive coping styles was moderated by Eysenck's Psychoticism traits.Personality traits moderate the strength of the relationships between burnout and anxiety mediated by positive coping styles; however, personality traits do not moderate the strength of the relationships between burnout and anxiety mediated by negative coping styles."

Following its synthesis, ALA is exported to the cytosol where it is converted to coproporphyrinogen III. All the remaining steps of heme biosynthesis take place inside mitochondria. Coproporphyrinogen III is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it is converted to protoporphyrinogen IX by coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Then, protoporphyrinogen IX is oxidized to protoporphyrin IX by protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Lastly, ferrous iron is incorporated into protoporphyrin IX to form heme in the mitochondrial matrix, a reaction catalyzed by ferrochelatase (12Ajioka R.S. Phillips J.D. Kushner J.P.

Furthermore, an anemic phenotype similar to that of ALAS2 deficiency has also been observed in the knockdown of two zebrafish orthologues of SLC25A38 (slc25a38a and slc25a38b), indicating that this gene is important for red blood cell production and function (13Guernsey D.L.

It has been demonstrated that the genetic deletion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SLC25A38 ortholog YDL119c (also named HEM25) produces a respiratory phenotype, indicative of mitochondrial involvement (13Guernsey D.L. Jiang H. Campagna D.R. Evans S.C. Ferguson M. Kellogg M.D. Lachance M. Matsuoka M. Nightingale M. Rideout A. Saint-Amant L. Schmidt P.J. Orr A. Bottomley S.S.

Furthermore, this yeast deletion strain shows significantly reduced ALA levels, the first product in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Given that ALAS2 function is not altered in the deletion strain, it was speculated that the decrease in ALA levels was because of decreased precursor availability. On the basis of these findings, it was hypothesized that SLC25A38 and its yeast orthologue Hem25p facilitate ALA production by importing glycine into mitochondria or by exchanging glycine for ALA across the inner mitochondrial membrane (13Guernsey D.L. Jiang H. Campagna D.R. Evans S.C. Ferguson M. Kellogg M.D. Lachance M. Matsuoka M. Nightingale M. Rideout A. Saint-Amant L. Schmidt P.J. Orr A. Bottomley S.S.

Glycine and folate ameliorate models of congenital sideroblastic anemia.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12: e1005783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has recently demonstrated through phenotype assessment in hem25Δ cells that Hem25p is required to initiate heme synthesis. Human SLC25A38 and yeast HEM25 encode a protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane that belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family, a family of proteins (InterPro entry: IPR018108; PANDIT: PF00153) encoded by nuclear genes (15Palmieri F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties, and physiopathology.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). SLC25A family members mediate the exchange of metabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane and have a tripartite structure consisting of three tandem-repeated sequences of ∼100 amino acids in length (15Palmieri F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties, and physiopathology.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Each repeat contains two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as α-helices and a characteristic sequence motif (15Palmieri F. The mitochondrial transporter family SLC25: identification, properties, and physiopathology.Mol. Aspects Med. 2013; 34: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Herein we report the identification and functional characterization of the mitochondrial glycine carrier protein (named Hem25p) encoded by HEM25 (16Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S. Hildick-Smith G.J. Rhee K.Y. Paw B.H. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates a key enzyme for heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis.Cell. 2015; 161: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hem25p was overexpressed in bacteria, reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, and identified by its transport properties as a glycine carrier. Hem25p functions in yeast mitochondria with properties similar to those observed in the recombinant protein. The cellular localization of the tagged protein was investigated using confocal laser microscopy, and Hem25p was found targeted to mitochondria. The hem25Δ mutant also displayed a severe delay in growth on non-fermentable carbon sources. The hem25Δ cells exhibited lower levels of glycine and ALA both in their mitochondria and in cell lysates as well as decreased respiratory efficiency resulting from the reduced expression of some protein components of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex. Furthermore, the recombinant SLC25A38 protein (henceforth named GlyC, glycine carrier) overexpressed in bacteria and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles transported glycine, and its gene was able to rescue the growth defect in hem25Δ cells. This is the first time that the protein responsible for the uptake of glycine into mitochondria has been identified at the molecular level. Hem25p was overexpressed at high levels in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as inclusion bodies and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). The apparent molecular mass of the purified protein was about 36 kDa (calculated value with initiator methionine 37.3 kDa). The protein was not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before the induction of expression (Fig. 1A, lane 2) or in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Approximately 90 mg of purified protein was obtained per liter of culture. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). Because it has been hypothesized that Hem25p facilitates ALA production by importing glycine into mitochondria (13Guernsey D.L. Jiang H. Campagna D.R. Evans S.C. Ferguson M. Kellogg M.D. Lachance M. Matsuoka M. Nightingale M. Rideout A. Saint-Amant L. Schmidt P.J. Orr A. Bottomley S.S.

Berman J.N. McMaster C.R. Glycine and folate ameliorate models of congenital sideroblastic anemia.PLoS Genet. 2016; 12: e1005783Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the recombinant and purified Hem25p was reconstituted into liposomes, and its ability to transport glycine was tested. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with Hem25p catalyzed active [14C]glycine/glycine exchange, which was abolished by a mixture of the inhibitors PLP and bathophenanthroline (BAT). Reconstituted Hem25p did not catalyze significant homo-exchanges for aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, asparagine, ornithine, lysine, arginine, proline, and threonine (internal concentration, 10 mm; external concentration, 1 mm). No [14C]glycine/glycine exchange was observed with Hem25p that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or after reconstitution of sarcosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for Hem25p or harvested immediately before the induction of expression. The substrate specificity of purified and reconstituted Hem25p was investigated in detail by measuring the uptake of [14C]glycine into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates (Fig. 1C). External glycine was significantly exchanged only in the presence of internal glycine. Furthermore, transport activities were also observed with internal sarcosine, l-alanine, and N-methyl-l-alanine. A low exchange was found with β-alanine and α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, whereas the activity observed with l-serine, ALA, and l-glutamate was approximately the same as that observed in the absence of internal substrate (Fig. 1C). Reconstituted Hem25p, therefore, exhibits a very narrow substrate specificity, which is virtually confined to glycine. The effects of known mitochondrial inhibitors on the [14C]glycine/glycine reaction catalyzed by reconstituted Hem25p were also examined (Fig. 1D). The activity of the recombinant protein was markedly inhibited by tannic acid (17Agrimi G. Di Noia M.A. Marobbio C.M. Fiermonte G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F.

Also bromcresol purple (17Agrimi G. Di Noia M.A. Marobbio C.M. Fiermonte G. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F.

J. 2004; 379: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) had no effect on the activity of the yeast reconstituted protein (Fig. 1D). The time-course of uptake by proteoliposomes of 1 mm [14C]glycine measured either as exchange (with 10 mm glycine inside the proteoliposomes) or as uniport (without internal substrate) is shown in Fig. 1E. All curves fitted a first-order rate equation with rate constants (k) for the exchange and uniport reactions of ∼0.18 min−1 and 0.11 min−1, respectively. The initial rates of glycine uptake (the product of k and intraliposomal quantity of glycine taken up at equilibrium) were about 95.96 ± 4.55 and 16.36 ± 0.72 nmol/min × mg of protein for the exchange and uniport reactions, respectively. The addition of 10 mm unlabeled glycine to proteoliposomes after incubation with 1 mm [14C]glycine for 30 min, when radioactive uptake had almost reached equilibrium, caused an extensive efflux of radiolabeled glycine from both glycine-loaded and unloaded proteoliposomes. This efflux shows that [14C]glycine taken up by exchange or unidirectional transport is released in exchange with externally added substrate (results not shown). The kinetic constants of recombinant purified Hem25p were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external [14C]glycine concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal concentration (10 mm) of glycine. The Km and Vmax values (measured at 25 °C) were 0.75 ± 0.084 mm and 169.8 ± 13.7 nmol/min × mg of protein, respectively (means of 5 experiments). The activity was calculated by taking into account the amount of Hem25p recovered in the proteoliposomes after reconstitution. In other experiments, the uptake of [14C]glycine was measured in proteoliposomes that had been reconstituted with Triton X-100 extracts of mitochondria isolated from wild-type, hem25Δ and hem25Δ transformed with HEM25-pYES2 plasmid (Fig. 2). A very low glycine/glycine exchange activity was observed upon reconstitution of mitochondrial extract from the knock-out strain. This activity was more than double in mitochondria extracts from wild-type and was considerable even in mitochondrial extracts from HEM25-pYES2 (Fig. 2). As a control, the [14C]malate/phosphate exchange (the defining reaction of the dicarboxylate carrier, known as Dic1) (23Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. The mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier is essential for the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on ethanol or acetate as the sole carbon source.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was virtually the same for all types of reconstituted mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 2). Therefore, the absence of HEM25 does not affect the expression or the activity of other mitochondrial carriers. Given that some mitochondrial carrier members are localized in non-mitochondrial membrane (24Palmieri L. Rottensteiner H. Girzalsky W. Scarcia P. Palmieri F. Erdmann R. Identification and functional reconstitution of the yeast peroxisomal adenine nucleotide transporter.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5049-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the intracellular localization of the recombinant Hem25p was investigated (Fig. 3). Hem25p-expressing cells exhibited green fluorescence (Fig. 3, A, E, and I). Upon staining with MitoTracker Red (mitochondrial specific dye) (Fig. 3B), FM4–64 (vacuolar specific dye) (Fig. 3F), and DAPI (nucleic acid dye) (Fig. 3L), the same cells showed a pattern of fluorescence that merged only with the mitochondrial network (Fig. 3C). From the overlapping images it is clear that recombinant Hem25p was localized to mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Structural integrity of the cells was documented by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 3, D, H, and N). The effect of deletion of the HEM25 gene on yeast cells was investigated. On YP and SM media supplemented with glucose, hem25Δ exhibited a slight but definite growth defect as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 4, A–D). However, hem25Δ displayed a growth delay in the YP medium supplemented with ethanol (Fig. 4, E and F). In the SM medium, growth of hem25Δ cells on ethanol was very poor after 70 h (Fig. 4, G and H); in addition, a slower lag-phase of growth was observed more in the SM medium than in the YP medium (Fig. 4H). The growth phenotype of hem25Δ cells was restored when these cells were transformed with HEM25-pYES2, demonstrating that the impaired phenotype is the result of the absence of HEM25 and not of a secondary effect. The observed defect can also be rescued by supplementation of the SM medium with 10 mm ALA (Fig. 4G), whereas the addition of glycine at a high concentration (10 mm) did not restore their lack of growth (Fig. 4G). All together, these results indicate that the defect of hem25Δ cells to grow on non-fermentable carbon source is overcome by expression of Hem25p in mitochondria or by supplementation of ALA, indicating that the defect is related to glycine transport. Importantly, Fig. 4G shows that the hem25Δ cell transformed with plasmid carrying the human SLC25A38 gene restored growth of the hem25Δ strain on ethanol. Furthermore, SLC25A38, expressed in E. coli and reconstituted in liposomes, shows a significant transport of glycine demonstrating without a doubt that it is the human ortholog of Hem25p and than the human mitochondrial GlyC (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5.Glycine uptake in proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant Hem25p or GlyC. [14C]glycine (0.75 mm) was added to proteoliposomes reconstituted with Hem25p (open bar) or GlyC (solid bar) containing 10 mm glycine. The exchange rate was measured after 10 min. Data are the means ± S.D. of at least five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the transport function of Hem25p in vivo, we investigated the effect of HEM25 deletion on glycine content in the cellular lysates and mitochondrial extracts from wild-type cells, hem25Δ cells, and hem25Δ cells transformed with the HEM25-pYES2 plasmid grown on ethanol-supplemented medium. GC-MS/MS analysis revealed that in mitochondria isolated from HEM25-pYES2 cells the amount of glycine is comparable with that determined in wild-type cells (3.21 ± 0.24 nmol/mg of protein and 2.17 ± 0.15 nmol/mg of protein, respectively) (Fig. 6). On the other hand, hem25Δ cells revealed a ∼70% decrease of intramitochondrial glycine (0.64 ± 0.034 nmol/mg of protein). In agreement with Guernsey et al. (13Guernsey D.L. Jiang H. Campagna D.R. Evans S.C. Ferguson M. Kellogg M.D. Lachance M. Matsuoka M. Nightingale M. Rideout A. Saint-Amant L. Schmidt P.J. Orr A. Bottomley S.S.

Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial ALA was also measured and, again, in agreement with Guernsey et al. (13Guernsey D.L. Jiang H. Campagna D.R. Evans S.C. Ferguson M. Kellogg M.D. Lachance M. Matsuoka M. Nightingale M. Rideout A. Saint-Amant L. Schmidt P.J. Orr A. Bottomley S.S.

Genet. 2009; 41: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the amount of mitochondrial ALA in the hem25Δ strain was reduced compared with control (0.04 nmol/mg of protein versus 0.4 nmol/mg of protein), highlighting that loss of Hem25p impairs ALA biosynthesis in vivo. ALA was reinstated in the wild-type levels when the mutant was complemented with the missing gene (0.5 nmol/mg of protein) (Fig. 6). The involvement of Hem25p in heme synthesis implies that the products of the heme pathway could be altered. One of these is heme b, which is incorporated into complexes II and III of the respiratory chain and is present in cytochrome c (25Kim H.J. Khalimonchuk O. Smith P.M. Winge D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2477181674,"A key computational principle for encoding time-varying signals in auditory and somatosensory cortices of monkeys is the opponent model of rate coding by two distinct populations of neurons. However, the subthreshold mechanisms that give rise to this computation have not been revealed. Because the rate-coding neurons are only observed in awake conditions, it is especially challenging to probe their underlying cellular mechanisms. Using a novel intracellular recording technique that we developed in awake marmosets, we found that the two types of rate-coding neurons in auditory cortex exhibited distinct subthreshold responses. While the positive-monotonic neurons (monotonically increasing firing rate with increasing stimulus repetition frequency) displayed sustained depolarization at high repetition frequency, the negative-monotonic neurons (opposite trend) instead exhibited hyperpolarization at high repetition frequency but sustained depolarization at low repetition frequency. The combination of excitatory and inhibitory subthreshold events allows the cortex to represent time-varying signals through these two opponent neuronal populations."

While some reports suggest a correlation between PLR and prognosis, few studies have examined the relationship between PLR and sensitivity to chemotherapy. We conducted a study on whether PLR could serve as a predictor of the therapeutic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).PLR was evaluated in 177 breast cancer patients treated with the NAC 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel and subsequent curative surgery. The correlation between PLR and prognosis, and between PLR and the efficacy of NAC, were evaluated retrospectively.The low PLR group had significantly more patients > 56 years old (p = 0.001) and postmenopausal women (p = 0.001) than the high PLR group. The low PLR group also had a higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rate (p = 0.019). On examining the correlation with prognosis, the low-PLR group was found to have significantly longer disease-free survival (p = 0.004) and overall survival (p = 0.032) than the high PLR group. Multivariate analysis also revealed that lymph node metastasis (p = 0.043, hazard ratio = 4.40) and a high PLR (p = 0.005, hazard ratio = 2.84) were independent, unfavorable prognostic factors.For patients with breast cancer treated with NAC, a low PLR indicated high chemotherapy sensitivity, suggesting that PLR could serve as a predictive marker of the therapeutic effect of NAC."
https://openalex.org/W2481937315,"Motivation and reward can have differential effects on separate aspects of sustained attention. We previously demonstrated that continuous reward/punishment throughout a sustained attention task improves overall performance, but not vigilance decrements. One interpretation of these findings is that vigilance decrements are due to resource depletion, which is not overcome by increasing overall motivation. However, an alternative explanation is that as one performs a continuously rewarded task there are less potential gains/losses as the task progresses, which could decrease motivation over time, producing a vigilance decrement. This would predict that keeping future gains/losses consistent throughout the task would reduce the vigilance decrement. In the current study, we examined this possibility by comparing two versions (continuous-small loss vs. anticipate-large loss) of a 10-minute gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), a challenging go/no-go sustained attention task. Participants began each task with the potential to keep $18. In the continuous-small-loss version, small monetary losses were accrued continuously throughout the task for each error. However, in the anticipate-large-loss version, participants lost all $18 if they erroneously responded to one target that always appeared toward the end of the vigil. Typical vigilance decrements were observed in the continuous-small-loss condition. In the anticipate-large-loss condition, vigilance decrements were reduced, particularly when the anticipate-large loss condition was completed second. This suggests that the looming possibility of a large loss can attenuate the vigilance decrement and that this attenuation may occur most consistently after sufficient task experience. We discuss these results in the context of current theories of sustained attention."
https://openalex.org/W2478642516,"Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) regulates protein homeostasis through its reversible interactions with client proteins. Hsc70 has two major domains: a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), that hydrolyzes ATP, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD), where clients are bound. Members of the BAG family of co-chaperones, including Bag1 and Bag3, are known to accelerate release of both ADP and client from Hsc70. The release of nucleotide is known to be mediated by interactions between the conserved BAG domain and the Hsc70 NBD. However, less is known about the regions required for client release, and it is often assumed that this activity also requires the BAG domain. It is important to better understand this step because it determines how long clients remain in the inactive, bound state. Here, we report the surprising observation that truncated versions of either human Bag1 or Bag3, comprised only the BAG domain, promoted rapid release of nucleotide, but not client, in vitro. Rather, we found that a non-canonical interaction between Bag1/3 and the Hsc70 SBD is sufficient for accelerating this step. Moreover, client release did not seem to require the BAG domain or Hsc70 NBD. These results suggest that Bag1 and Bag3 control the stability of the Hsc70-client complex using at least two distinct protein-protein contacts, providing a previously under-appreciated layer of molecular regulation in the human Hsc70 system."

An effective finite element model is proposed to simulate the push out tests of these shear connectors that encompass nonlinear material behaviour, large displacement and damage plasticity. The finite element models are validated against test results. Parametric studies using this nonlinear model are performed to investigate the variations in concrete strength and connector dimensions. The finite element analyses also confirm the test results that increasing the length of shear connector increases their shear strength proportionately. It is observed that the maximum stress in L-shaped angle connectors takes place in the weld attachment to the beam, whereas in the C-shaped angle connectors, it is in the attached leg. The location of maximum concrete compressive damage is rendered in each case. Finally, a new equation for prediction of the shear capacity of C-shaped angle connectors is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2493214469,"Soil contains various essential and nonessential elements, all of which can be absorbed by plants. Plant ionomics is the study of the accumulation of these elements (the ionome) in plants. The ionomic profile of a plant is affected by various factors, including species, variety, organ, and environment. In this study, we cultivated various vegetable crop species and cultivars under the same field conditions and analyzed the level of accumulation of each element in the edible and nonedible parts using ionomic techniques. The concentration of each element in the edible parts differed between species, which could be partly explained by differences in the types of edible organs (root, leaf, seed, and fruit). For example, the calcium concentration was lower in seeds and fruit than in other organs because of the higher dependency of calcium accumulation on xylem transfer. The concentration of several essential microelements and nonessential elements in the edible parts also varied greatly between cultivars of the same species, knowledge of which will help in the breeding of vegetables that are biofortified or contain lower concentrations of toxic elements. Comparison of the ionomes of the fruit and leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and eggplant (S. melongena) indicated that cadmium and boron had higher levels of accumulation in eggplant fruit, likely because of their effective transport in the phloem. We also found that homologous elements that have been reported to share the same uptake/transport system often showed significant correlation only in a few families and that the slopes of these relationships differed between families. Therefore, these differences in the characteristics of mineral accumulation are likely to affect the ionomic profiles of different families."

This study evaluated the potential effects of metabolic programming on the impairment of insulin signalling in recently weaned offspring from obese dams. Additionally, we investigated if early exposure to an obesogenic environment could exacerbate the impairment of glucose metabolism in adult life in response to a HFD. Swiss female mice were fed with Standard Chow (SC) or a HFD during gestation and lactation and tissues from male offspring were analysed at d28 and d82. Offspring from obese dams had greater weight gain and higher adiposity and food intake than offspring from control dams. Furthermore, they showed impairment in insulin signalling in central and peripheral tissues, which was associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways. Adipose tissue was ultimately the most affected in adult offspring after HFD rechallenge; this may have contributed to the metabolic deregulation observed. Overall, our results suggest that diet-induced maternal obesity leads to increased susceptibility to obesity and impairment of insulin signalling in offspring in early and late life that cannot be reversed by SC consumption, but can be aggravated by HFD re-exposure."

The volume and moisture content of the faeces were observed and the intestinal kinetic power was evaluated. Meanwhile, the colorimetric method and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to determine the changes of nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), vasoative intestinal peptide (VIP) and the P substance (SP) in the serum, respectively. The protein expressions of c-kit and stem cell factor (SCF) were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and western blot, respectively, and the mRNA level of c-kit was measured by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The TGP attenuated STC responses in terms of an increase in the fecal volume and moisture content, an enhancement of intestinal transit rate and the reduction of NO, NOS and VIP in the serum. In addition, the c-kit, a labeling of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) increased at both protein and mRNA levels. SCF, which serves as a ligand of c-kit also increased at protein level.The analysis of our data indicated that the TGP could obviously attenuate STC through improving the function of ICC and blocking the inhibitory neurotransmitters such as NO, NOS and VIP."

Thus, Satb2 is a genetic determinant that mediates proper circuit development in a core sensory-to-motor spinal network. The movements of animals are adapted to their environment by a highly integrative circuitry within the spinal cord that refines motor actions based on a variety of sensory cues (reviewed in Baldissera et al., 1981Baldissera F.

Exteroceptive sensory information continuously streams into the CNS as an animal moves and includes detection of limb position, mechanical pressure, and, in the case of environmental threats, noxious pain. These sensory feedback pathways can rapidly and dynamically regulate motor actions via local spinal circuitry, even in the absence of supraspinal connections (Forssberg et al., 1975Forssberg H.

Electrophysiological studies of sensorimotor circuits have found that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the dorsal spinal cord participate in the transformation of sensory cues into motor actions (Bannatyne et al., 2009Bannatyne B.A. Liu T.T.

It has long been recognized that multimodal sensory cues intersect within the medial deep dorsal horn of the spinal cord where direct-proprioceptive and indirect-nociceptive pathways converge (reviewed in Craig, 2003Craig A.D. Pain mechanisms: labeled lines versus convergence in central processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Interestingly, circuit tracing has found that a significant fraction of spinal premotor neurons are likewise located in the medial deep dorsal horn (Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L. Identification of a cellular node for motor control pathways.Nat.

Together, these studies indicate that multiple types of sensory information including limb position and pain may target a somatotopically organized sensorimotor circuit arrayed across lamina V that modulates motor activity (Schouenborg et al., 1995Schouenborg J. Weng H.R. Kalliomäki J. Holmberg H. A survey of spinal dorsal horn neurones encoding the spatial organization of withdrawal reflexes in the rat.Exp.

Motor antagonism exposed by spatial segregation and timing of neurogenesis.Nature. 2011; 479: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view of sensorimotor integration, the ablation of broad groups of dorsal-spinal inhibitory neurons disrupts motor actions in response to sensory stimuli (Foster et al., 2015Foster E. Wildner H. Tudeau L. Haueter S. Ralvenius W.T. Jegen M. Johannssen H. Hösli L. Haenraets K. Ghanem A. et al.Targeted ablation, silencing, and activation establish glycinergic dorsal horn neurons as key components of a spinal gate for pain and itch.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1289-1304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because the motor and sensory components of action are deeply intertwined (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2007Rizzolatti G. Sinigaglia C. Mirror neurons and motor intentionality.Funct. Neurol. 2007; 22: 205-210PubMed Google Scholar), it has been difficult to study integrative sensorimotor circuitry without definitive cellular markers of the constituent components. A subset of premotor cells in the deep dorsal horn can be identified by the expression of the transcription factor Satb2 (Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L. Identification of a cellular node for motor control pathways.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Satb2 is a DNA binding protein that interacts with nuclear matrix attachment regions and controls gene expression and chromatin remodeling. Functional studies of Satb2 have identified roles for this gene in musculoskeletal development and have shown that this factor is necessary for establishing the proper identity and axon projections of callosal neurons (Alcamo et al., 2008Alcamo E.A.

Interestingly, case studies of human mutations in the Satb2 gene have reported developmental delays in motor skill acquisition, coordination, and sensorimotor behavior (Balasubramanian et al., 2011Balasubramanian M.

Genet. 2005; 48: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we describe the connectivity pattern of Satb2+ interneurons and establish that the Satb2 gene is required for the proper development of spinal circuitry that mediates the transformation of sensory cues into motor behavior. Satb2+ neurons are predominantly inhibitory, receive monosynaptic input from proprioceptive neurons, and are activated by noxious stimuli via polysynaptic pathways. Satb2+ neurons form synaptic connections onto ventral locomotor-interneurons and motor neurons. Based on their neurotransmitter profile and connectivity, we refer to the discrete population of Satb2+ cells in the dorsal horn as inhibitory sensory relay (ISRSatb2) neurons. When the Satb2 gene was mutated the cell position, molecular profile, synaptic inputs, and synaptic outputs of ISRSatb2 neurons were markedly altered. Satb2 mutant mice display abnormal limb hyperflexion of the ankle during walking and hold the hindlimb in a prolonged flexed position following noxious thermal or mechanical stimulation of the paw. Our findings demonstrate that Satb2 is necessary for the connectivity of ISRSatb2 neurons, thereby revealing an intrinsic genetic program that contributes to the formation of a discrete subunit of intraspinal sensorimotor circuitry. Both proprioceptive and nociceptive sensory neurons relay through the deep dorsal horn (lamina IV–VI) of the spinal cord, an area that was recently shown to contain a significant proportion of neurons that are directly upstream of motor neurons (Coulon et al., 2011Coulon P. Bras H. Vinay L. Characterization of last-order premotor interneurons by transneuronal tracing with rabies virus in the neonatal mouse spinal cord.J. Comp. Neurol. 2011; 519: 3470-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L.

Monosynaptic rabies virus reveals premotor network organization and synaptic specificity of cholinergic partition cells.Neuron. 2010; 68: 456-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to identify genes that are expressed in a specific group of neurons within this nexus of sensorimotor information. Satb1/2 was recently identified as a marker of a subset of premotor neurons located in spinal lamina V (Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L. Identification of a cellular node for motor control pathways.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We performed immunohistochemistry with a Satb2-specific antibody and found that, in contrast to many of the dorsal horn molecular markers (Lbx1, Lmx1b, Pax2, Tlx3, GlyT2) that label broad heterogeneous groups of neurons, Satb2 labels a discrete population of neurons in lamina V of the deep dorsal horn (Figures 1A and 1B ). Satb2 expression is first detectable at embryonic day 12 (E12) and continues through the first postnatal week (Figures 1B and S1). Satb2+ interneurons span the mediolateral extent of lamina V (Figure 1B), corresponding to a region where cells that are activated during the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) have been detected with electrophysiology (Schouenborg and Weng, 1994Schouenborg J. Weng H.R. Sensorimotor transformation in a spinal motor system.Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 100: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also observed transient expression of Satb2 in motor neurons of the medial and lateral motor columns as early as E10.5, which perdured in a subset of medial motor neurons into the first postnatal week (Figure S1). Satb2 expression is also detectable in the developing neocortex and specific regions of the musculoskeletal system (data not shown). These findings are consistent with reports of Satb2 expression in the nervous system and other tissues (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V.

To extend previous studies and to determine whether Satb2 marks interneurons of known lineage, we performed colocalization experiments with antibodies for dorsal interneuron subtypes (Alaynick et al., 2011Alaynick W.A.

Lbx1 specifies somatosensory association interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord.Neuron. 2002; 34: 535-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Satb2 is expressed in the Lbx1+ lineage of dorsal interneurons (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V.

Satb2+ interneurons also co-express the LIM homeodomain markers Lim1/2 (Britanova et al., 2005Britanova O. Akopov S. Lukyanov S. Gruss P. Tarabykin V. Novel transcription factor Satb2 interacts with matrix attachment region DNA elements in a tissue-specific manner and demonstrates cell-type-dependent expression in the developing mouse CNS.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and a subset of Satb2+ interneurons coexpresses Ptf1a, a marker of dI4 and dIL lineages (Figure S2). However, when we performed colocalization experiments with markers that subdivide these broad lineage classes (Pax2, Tlx3, Brn3a, Lmx1b, Bhlhb5, or Isl1/2), we found that the Satb2+ interneuron population did not express additional markers of dI4, dI5, dIL, or dI6 lineages (Figure S2). These findings indicate that the classification of Satb2+ interneurons does not align with previously described populations of dorsal interneurons. To gain genetic access to Satb2+ interneurons and define their circuit properties, we devised a temporally inducible Cre labeling strategy. To generate a Satb2:CreERT2 knockin mouse line, CreERT2 was inserted into the ATG of the Satb2 locus (Figure 1C; data not shown). Satb2:CreERT2 animals were crossed with the Cre-dependent reporter Rosa-CAG-LSL-TdTomato to generate Satb2:TdTomato animals. Although Satb2 is downregulated during the first postnatal week, tamoxifen administration at embryonic or early postnatal time points indelibly labels Satb2+ interneurons. Embryonic induction of Satb2:CreERT2 with tamoxifen at E12 labels spinal interneurons as well as a restricted population of motor neurons in the medial motor column (Figure 1D). Thus, TdTomato expression driven by our transgenic line accurately recapitulates Satb2 protein expression (compare Figure 1B to 1D; Figure S1). Genetic labeling of Satb2+ interneurons facilitated further descriptive analyses of this population. To determine the neurotransmitter status of Satb2+ interneurons, we performed double labeling experiments in which we examined the overlap of TdTomato expression with in situ hybridization probes for excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter markers. Only 3.8% of Satb2+ interneurons express the excitatory marker vGlut2, whereas the vast majority of cells express the inhibitory markers Gad65, Gad67, and/or GlyT2 (Figures 1E and 1F; Figure S2). These experiments reveal that Satb2+ neurons represent a spatially restricted population of inhibitory dorsal interneurons arrayed along the mediolateral axis of the deep dorsal horn. Tracing experiments have noted that peripheral sensory commands converge on spinal neurons in the deep dorsal horn of the spinal cord, representing the first point of intersection between the nociceptive and proprioceptive systems (Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L. Identification of a cellular node for motor control pathways.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Primary fibers of proprioceptive sensory neurons and second-order neurons that are recruited during the hindlimb nociceptive NWR reside in overlapping domains within the deep dorsal horn (Craig, 2003Craig A.D. Pain mechanisms: labeled lines versus convergence in central processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although the approximate site of convergence for these two pathways overlaps with the position of Satb2+ interneurons (Figure 1A), their connectivity has not been described. To test whether Satb2+ interneurons receive proprioceptive input, we used a genetic labeling strategy (Parvalbumin-Cre × Rosa-CAG-LSL-Syp-TdTomato-deltaNeo; abbreviated PV:Syn-Tom) in which the presynaptic terminals of proprioceptive fibers are labeled with a synaptophysin-TdTomato fusion protein (Levine et al., 2014Levine A.J. Hinckley C.A. Hilde K.L. Driscoll S.P. Poon T.H. Montgomery J.M. Pfaff S.L. Identification of a cellular node for motor control pathways.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We identified TdTomato+ contacts on the cell bodies of Satb2+ interneurons (Figures 2A and 2B ), indicating that Satb2+ interneurons receive direct input from proprioceptive fibers. We next used a second strategy to visualize the full cell morphology of Satb2+ interneurons. Immunohistochemistry for parvalbumin and vGlut1 revealed proprioceptive contacts along the soma and processes of Satb2:TdTomato+ spinal interneurons. We found that 97% ± 2.6% of Satb2:TdTomato+ spinal interneurons received direct contacts from proprioceptive fibers (Figure S3, n = 29 cells in 3 spinal cords); however, we noted quantitative differences within the Satb2+ interneuron population, which are characterized in more detail below. Nociceptive sensory fibers predominantly target superficial spinal laminae but relay information through the deep dorsal horn via spinal interneurons. To explore whether Satb2+ interneurons are a site of convergence for multimodal sensory inputs, we performed double labeling experiments of proprioceptive fibers and nociceptive relay neurons in Satb2:TdTomato animals. Intramuscular injection of cholera toxin (CTB) into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was performed to label proprioceptive afferents of a muscle that is recruited following the NWR (Schouenborg, 2004Schouenborg J. Learning in sensorimotor circuits.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Capsaicin was then injected into the footpads of these animals, and c-Fos immunoreactivity was used to identify cells that are recruited in response to a painful stimulus (Figure 2C). As expected, c-Fos+ neurons were located in superficial laminae ipsilateral to the injection site, as well as in the deep dorsal horn. At spinal levels of peak c-Fos labeling, 32.3% of Satb2:TdTomato+ neurons coexpress c-Fos in response to capsaicin injection into the footpad (Figure 2D; 42 of 130 TdTomato+ cells, n = 5 spinal cords), indicating that a significant fraction of Satb2+ interneurons are activated even in response to focal stimulation of nociceptive sensory neurons that innervate the foot. In addition, we identified Satb2:TdTomato+ interneurons that express c-Fos following noxious stimulation and receive vGlut1+ contacts from CTB-labeled proprioceptive afferents (Figure 2E). Thus, individual Satb2+ interneurons represent a convergence point for multimodal sensory input. Based on Satb2 expression, neurotransmitter identity, and sensory input, we refer to them as inhibitory sensory relay (ISRSatb2) neurons. Sensorimotor circuit components are known to display a topographic organization along the mediolateral axis of the spinal cord (Arber, 2012Arber S. Motor circuits in action: specification, connectivity, and function.Neuron. 2012; 74: 975-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Levine et al., 2012Levine A.J. Lewallen K.A. Pfaff S.L. Spatial organization of cortical and spinal neurons controlling motor behavior.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The convergence of synaptic inputs onto ISRSatb2 neurons and their distribution along the mediolateral axis prompted us to ask whether ISRSatb2 neurons are composed of a homogeneous population of neurons or whether there is diversity in their identity and connectivity. To test whether interneuron cell body location is a determinant of the amount of proprioceptive input, we quantified the number of PV:Synaptophysin-TdTomato+ contacts on neurotrace+ cell bodies of ISRSatb2 neurons and mapped the number of contacts per cell along the mediolateral axis. These experiments revealed an inverse relationship between cell body distance from the midline and the amount of proprioceptive input: cells positioned closer to the midline had a greater number of proprioceptive contacts, while lateral cells had fewer contacts (Figure 2F). These findings indicate that mediolateral position is an organizational feature that correlates with proprioceptive sensory connectivity onto ISRSatb2 neurons. Although interneurons are topographically organized along the mediolateral axis of the deep dorsal horn, genetic markers that subdivide these groups have not been described. In the cortex, Satb2 participates in an antagonistic genetic interaction with Ctip2 to subdivide cortical progenitors into functionally distinct pools (Alcamo et al., 2008Alcamo E.A. Chirivella L. Dautzenberg M. Dobreva G. Fariñas I. Grosschedl R. McConnell S.K.

To test whether Satb2 and Ctip2 have mutually exclusive expression in the spinal cord, we performed immunohistochemistry for both markers. Surprisingly, in the spinal cord Satb2 and Ctip2 are not mutually exclusive and define two subpopulations of ISRSatb2 cells; medial neurons are Satb2+/Ctip2+, while lateral neurons are Satb2+/Ctip2− (Figures 2G and 2H). This molecular code is detectable as early as E13.5 and is maintained into postnatal stages (data not shown). These experiments reveal that sensory connectivity and molecular profile subdivide ISRSatb2 neurons along the mediolateral axis of the spinal cord (Figure 2I).

The purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of aging on the relationship between aerobic capacity and lean body mass in subjects that chronically train both their upper and lower bodies. Eleven older rowers (58±5 yrs) and 11 younger rowers (27±4 yrs) participated in the study. Prior to the VO2max testing, subjects underwent a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan to estimate total lean body mass. Subsequently, VO2max was quantified during a maximal exercise test on a rowing ergometer as well as a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer. The test protocol included a pre-exercise stage followed by incremental exercise until VO2max was reached. The order of exercise modes was randomized and there was a wash-out period between the two tests. Oxygen uptake was obtained via a breath-by-breath metabolic cart (Vmax™ Encore, San Diego, CA). Rowing VO2max was higher than cycling VO2max in both groups (p<0.05). Older subjects had less of an increase in VO2max from cycling to rowing (p<0.05). There was a significant relationship between muscle mass and VO2max for both groups (p<0.05). After correcting for muscle mass, the difference in cycling VO2max between groups disappeared (p>0.05), however, older subjects still demonstrated a lower rowing VO2max relative to younger subjects (p<0.05). Muscle mass is associated with the VO2max obtained, however, it appears that VO2max in older subjects may be less influenced by muscle mass than in younger subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2492038428,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, frequently metastatic sarcomas that are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a prominent inherited genetic disease in humans. Although loss of the NF1 gene predisposes to MPNST induction, relatively long tumor latency in NF1 patients suggests that additional genetic or epigenetic abnormalities are needed for the development of these nerve sheath malignancies. To study the molecular pathways contributing to the formation of MPNSTs in NF1 patients, we used a zebrafish tumor model defined by nf1 loss in a p53-deficient background together with the overexpression of either wild-type or constitutively activated PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α) under control of the sox10 neural crest-specific promoter. Here we demonstrate the accelerated onset and increased penetrance of MPNST formation in fish overexpressing both the wild-type and the mutant PDGFRA transgenes in cells of neural crest origin. Interestingly, overexpression of the wild-type PDGFRA was even more potent in promoting transformation than the mutant PDGFRA, which is important because ~78% of human MPNSTs have expression of wild-type PDGFRA, whereas only 5% harbor activating mutations of the gene encoding this receptor. Further analysis revealed the induction of cellular senescence in zebrafish embryos overexpressing mutant, but not wild-type, PDGFRA, suggesting a mechanism through which the oncogenic activity of the mutant receptor is tempered by the activation of premature cellular senescence in an NF1-deficient background. Taken together, our study suggests a model in which overexpression of wild-type PDGFRA associated with NF1 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of downstream RAS signaling and thus contributes importantly to MPNST development-a prediction supported by the ability of the kinase inhibitor sunitinib alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib to retard MPNST progression in transgenic fish overexpressing the wild-type receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2506058307,"Enzymes that utilize the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate play essential roles in amino acid metabolism in all organisms. The cofactor is used by proteins that adopt at least five different folds, which raises questions about the evolutionary processes that might explain the observed distribution of functions among folds. In this study, we show that a representative of fold type III, the Escherichia coli alanine racemase (ALR), is a promiscuous cystathionine β-lyase (CBL). Furthermore, E. coli CBL (fold type I) is a promiscuous alanine racemase. A single round of error-prone PCR and selection yielded variant ALR(Y274F), which catalyzes cystathionine β-elimination with a near-native Michaelis constant (Km = 3.3 mm) but a poor turnover number (kcat ≈10 h−1). In contrast, directed evolution also yielded CBL(P113S), which catalyzes l-alanine racemization with a poor Km (58 mm) but a high kcat (22 s−1). The structures of both variants were solved in the presence and absence of the l-alanine analogue, (R)-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid. As expected, the ALR active site was enlarged by the Y274F substitution, allowing better access for cystathionine. More surprisingly, the favorable kinetic parameters of CBL(P113S) appear to result from optimizing the pKa of Tyr-111, which acts as the catalytic acid during l-alanine racemization. Our data emphasize the short mutational routes between the functions of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes, regardless of whether or not they share the same fold.

PLP-dependent enzymes are found in every organism, and it has been estimated that 1.0–1.5% of all genes in the genomes of free-living prokaryotes code for them (3Percudani R. Peracchi A. A genomic overview of pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Almost all known PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze reactions involving the Cα, Cβ, and Cγ atoms of amino acids or other metabolites with an amino group. Examples of the reactions catalyzed include racemization, elimination, transamination, decarboxylation, β- and γ-replacement, and retro aldol cleavage. Mechanistically, these reactions share the same first step, which is the formation of an external aldimine between the substrate and PLP (2Raboni S. Spyrakis F. Campanini B. Amadasi A. Bettati S.

Acta. 2011; 1814: 1407-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cofactor plays a catalytic role in labilizing one of the bonds at Cα of the substrate, lowering the activation barrier for forming a carbanionic intermediate. The roles of the protein moiety are largely to ensure cleavage of the correct bond at Cα and to guide the reaction of the intermediate toward the correct product (5Richard J.P. Amyes T.L. Crugeiras J. Rios A. The PLP cofactor: lessons from studies on model reactions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Historically the PLP-dependent enzymes have been classified into five different fold types (6Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Modeling of the spatial structure of eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylases.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Schneider G. Käck H. Lindqvist Y. The manifold of vitamin B6 dependent enzymes.Structure. 2000; 8: R1-R6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), although this classification has recently been expanded to include two more folds that use PLP in a different mechanistic context (to stabilize radical intermediates) (2Raboni S. Spyrakis F. Campanini B. Amadasi A. Bettati S. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Contestabile R. Mander L. Liu H.-W. Comprehensive Natural Products II: Chemistry and Biology. Elsevier Ltd., New York2010: 273-350Crossref Google Scholar). Curiously, fold types I to V all use the same “phosphate-binding cup” to anchor PLP in the active site (8Denesyuk A.I. Denessiouk K.A. Korpela T. Johnson M.S. Functional attributes of the phosphate group binding cup of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have argued that this is evidence for the ancient recruitment of a single cofactor-binding subdomain into the various extant folds (via non-homologous recombination) (9Setiyaputra S. Mackay J.P. Patrick W.M. The structure of a truncated phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase suggests a unified model for evolution of the (βα)8 barrel fold.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 408: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This model implies partial homology between the fold types. However, for simplicity here we will refer to enzymes with different fold types as being non-homologous. Furthermore, the reaction specificities of PLP-dependent enzymes do not correlate strictly with their fold type. For example, aminotransferases that adopt fold types I and IV are known (2Raboni S. Spyrakis F. Campanini B. Amadasi A. Bettati S. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Contestabile R. Mander L. Liu H.-W. Comprehensive Natural Products II: Chemistry and Biology. Elsevier Ltd., New York2010: 273-350Crossref Google Scholar). Together, these features raise two fundamental questions about the evolution of PLP-dependent enzymes. First, how have proteins with different folds evolved to control the reactivity of the cofactor? Second, what evolutionary processes or constraints explain the observed distribution of functions among folds? In this study, we have addressed these questions by focusing on the two PLP-dependent enzymes alanine racemase (ALR) and cystathionine β-lyase (CBL). Previously, we showed that overexpression of ALR rescued an Escherichia coli strain in which the gene encoding CBL (metC) had been deleted (10Patrick W.M. Quandt E.M. Swartzlander D.B. Matsumura I. Multicopy suppression underpins metabolic evolvability.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CBL is essential for E. coli to grow on minimal media, as it catalyzes the penultimate step in methionine biosynthesis. We were intrigued that ALR appeared to possess promiscuous CBL activity, as the two enzymes are not homologues (with the possible exception of their phosphate-binding cup subdomains). ALR (EC 5.1.1.1) and CBL (EC 4.4.1.8) are also unrelated with respect to the physiologically relevant substrates they recognize and the overall reactions they catalyze. E. coli CBL is a homotetramer that catalyzes the formation of l-homocysteine from l-cystathionine (Fig. 1A). Each monomer adopts the type I PLP-binding fold and includes the following three domains: the N-terminal domain contributes to tetramerization; the C-terminal domain consists of an anti-parallel β-sheet with α-helices on the solvent side; and the middle domain harbors PLP, which is found in a parallel seven-stranded β-sheet covered by adjacent β-helices (11Clausen T. Huber R. Laber B. Pohlenz H.-D. Messerschmidt A. Crystal structure of the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate dependent cystathionine β-lyase from Escherichia coli at 1.83 Å.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 202-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the resting state, PLP forms an internal aldimine with active site residue Lys-210. The enzyme has been identified as a potential antibiotic target, as its inhibition impacts protein synthesis and also DNA synthesis (via the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine) in bacteria (12Ejim L.J. Blanchard J.E. Koteva K.P. Sumerfield R. Elowe N.H. Chechetto J.D. Brown E.D. Junop M.S. Wright G.D. Inhibitors of bacterial cystathionine β-lyase: leads for new antimicrobial agents and probes of enzyme structure and function.J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ALR interconverts l-Ala and d-Ala, with the latter being an essential constituent of the cell wall peptidoglycan. Indeed, the absence of d-Ala leads to a defective cell wall and cell death. The essentiality of ALR for cell wall biosynthesis renders it an attractive antibiotic target (13Anthony K.G. Strych U.

Each monomer adopts a type III PLP-binding fold (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal domain of each monomer is a (βα)8 barrel; the C-terminal domain mainly comprises β-strands (15Wu D. Hu T. Zhang L. Chen J.

In the E. coli enzyme, Tyr-255′ (with the prime indicating a residue from the opposing monomer than Lys-34) acts as the catalytic base that deprotonates l-Ala. Lys-34 acts as the catalytic acid, protonating the carbanionic intermediate to yield d-Ala. The roles of Tyr-255′ and Lys-34 are reversed during the racemization of d-Ala into l-Ala. Here, we characterize the promiscuous CBL activity of ALR and show that it can be improved by directed evolution. We also demonstrate a novel example of reciprocal promiscuity in the absence of homology; CBL is a promiscuous and evolvable ALR. Thus, our study also highlights the short mutational routes that may have been sufficient to evolve families of homologous PLP-dependent enzymes with disparate reaction specificities. E. coli ΔmetC is unable to grow on M9/glucose agar; however, in our hands it formed colonies on medium supplemented with 0.1 mm l-methionine after 1–2 days of incubation. This demonstrated that deleting CBL ablates methionine biosynthesis, as expected. E. coli ΔmetC that harbored a plasmid-encoded CBL (pCA24N-metC) survived in the absence of exogenous l-methionine (supplemental Table S1). Previously, we showed that ALR overexpressed from a high copy plasmid (pCA24N-alr) could rescue E. coli ΔmetC, with colony formation taking 5–6 days when expression was induced with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (10Patrick W.M. Quandt E.M. Swartzlander D.B. Matsumura I. Multicopy suppression underpins metabolic evolvability.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As with all of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the ASKA collection (23Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. Complete set of ORF clones of Escherichia coli ASKA library (a complete set of E. coli K-12 ORF archive): unique resources for biological research.DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), the 3′ end of the alr insert is fused to the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pCA24N-alr. Therefore, we removed the GFP tag to confirm that complementation was due to ALR itself and was not a peculiarity of the ALR-GFP fusion. Cells overexpressing the GFP-less ALR did form colonies, after a shorter incubation period (3–4 days) (supplemental Table S1). Throughout this study, no growth was observed for the negative control (an E. coli ΔmetC clone that harbored the empty vector without a gene insert, pCA24N-NoIns (24Soo V.W. Hanson-Manful P. Patrick W.M. Artificial gene amplification reveals an abundance of promiscuous resistance determinants in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)). This complementation assay appeared to show that ALR possessed promiscuous CBL activity. However, we also considered the possibility that ALR might rescue the methionine auxotrophy of E. coli ΔmetC via a metabolic bypass, rather than by catalyzing the CBL reaction. To test this, we overexpressed ALR in an E. coli strain lacking the enzyme that follows CBL in the biosynthetic pathway, methionine synthase. The growth of this strain (E. coli ΔmetE) was tested on M9/glucose medium. If ALR overexpression had led to the growth of this strain, then this would have suggested that the cell was (somehow) rerouting metabolic flux to synthesize methionine by a previously undescribed pathway. Examples of this phenomenon have been characterized for a different metabolic pathway (25Kim J. Kershner J.P. Novikov Y. Shoemaker R.K. Copley S.D. Three serendipitous pathways in E. coli can bypass a block in pyridoxal-5′-phosphate synthesis.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 436Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, we observed no growth of E. coli ΔmetE expressing ALR, in up to 1 week of incubation (supplemental Table S1). This demonstrated that ALR overexpression did not lead to methionine production via an alternative pathway. Next, we attempted to measure the CBL activity of purified His6-tagged ALR by using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to detect the formation of homocysteine. However, no CBL activity was detected in vitro, at an enzyme concentration of 7 μm, concentrations of the substrate (l-cystathionine) up to 10 mm, and at temperatures of 25, 30, or 37 °C. We could not use higher l-cystathionine concentrations due to its low solubility (∼5.6 mg·ml−1 in 0.04 n HCl). In our control reactions that lacked enzyme, we observed the spontaneous decomposition of DTNB at an average background rate of ≤0.35 μm/min. This places an approximate upper limit on the CBL activity of ALR. In these assays we would have observed turnover of l-cystathionine if it had been greater than ∼0.05 per min per active site. Promiscuous activities are often orders of magnitude lower than native activities, and therefore, they can be exceedingly difficult to detect in vitro (25Kim J. Kershner J.P. Novikov Y. Shoemaker R.K. Copley S.D. Three serendipitous pathways in E. coli can bypass a block in pyridoxal-5′-phosphate synthesis.Mol. Syst.

Biol. 2008; 377: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A simple strategy to circumvent this problem is to improve the promiscuous activity by directed evolution. The underlying assumption is that directed evolution approaches are unlikely to yield an activity that was not there before, although they are highly effective at improving weak but pre-existing functions (27Peisajovich S.G. Tawfik D.S. Protein engineers turned evolutionists.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We subjected the alr gene to a low mutation rate error-prone PCR (epPCR) and cloned the products into pCA24N. The resulting plasmids were used to transform E. coli ΔmetC, yielding a library that contained 3.4 × 107 alr variants. Sequencing the alr gene inserts (each 1,077 bp) from 20 colonies allowed us to use PEDEL-AA (28Firth A.E. Patrick W.M. GLUE-IT and PEDEL-AA: new programmes for analyzing protein diversity in randomized libraries.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W281-W285Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to estimate the mean mutation rate at 0.8 base substitutions per allele, which corresponded to an average of 0.6 amino acid substitutions per ALR variant. The library was regrown and plated on M9/glucose with a reduced IPTG concentration (5 μm, instead of 50 μm) to increase the selection stringency. Under these conditions, the parental strain (E. coli ΔmetC harboring pCA24N-alr) took 12–13 days to form colonies. Clones with higher CBL activity were selected based on their ability to form colonies more rapidly than the parental strain. After only 2 days of incubation, we picked 32 colonies for further analysis. The growth phenotypes conferred by the selected alr variants were verified by isolating plasmid DNA from each colony and reintroducing it into fresh aliquots of E. coli ΔmetC. Sequencing revealed that a single genotype, encoding the ALR(Y274F) mutant, dominated the pool with a frequency of 25/32 = 78% (Table 1). All of the other selected clones also possessed the Y274F mutation, in addition to 1–2 substitutions at other positions. The ubiquity of the Y274F mutation provided strong evidence that it was essential for improving the CBL activity of ALR.TABLE 1ALR mutants selected from an epPCR library for their ability to rescue E. coli ΔmetCVariantFrequencyMutation(s)ALR-125Y274FALR-21Y274F, A335TALR-31R266S, Y274FALR-41M29I, Y274FALR-51T97S, P252R, Y274FALR-61I242V, Y274FALR-71L241M, R263H, Y274FALR-81V150I, Y274F Open table in a new tab Of the selected mutations, Y274F is the only substitution located in the vicinity of the active site.

The other nine mutated residues (Table 1) are either found on the surface of the dimeric enzyme or, in the cases of the buried residues Thr-97 and Leu-241, they appear to play simple structural roles on β-strands, where they have been conservatively replaced with serine and methionine in variants ALR-5 and ALR-7, respectively. Nevertheless, we were wary that distal residues can play important functional roles. Therefore, we used the Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) server (31Somarowthu S. Ondrechen M.J. POOL server: machine learning application for functional site prediction in proteins.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2078-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to predict and rank the functionally important residues in ALR, using PDB entry 2RJG as the input. For any given structure, all of the functionally important residues are typically in the top 8–10% of those ranked by POOL (31Somarowthu S. Ondrechen M.J. POOL server: machine learning application for functional site prediction in proteins.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2078-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two Tyr-274 residues in the ALR dimer had the 11th and 16th highest POOL scores of 716 total residues (i.e. inside the top 2.5%). All of the other mutated residues in Table 1 had POOL scores outside of the top 35%. Thus, the additional substitutions in variants ALR-2 to ALR-8 were likely to be neutral or mildly deleterious, and we focused our attention on ALR(Y274F). We purified His6-tagged ALR(Y274F) and assayed it for cystathionine β-lyase activity, which was found to be low but measurable (Table 2). At 0.85 s−1·m−1, the kcat/Km was ∼2.7 × 106-fold lower than that of CBL for the same reaction. This was mainly due to a poor kcat of ∼10 turnovers/h/active site. In comparison, the Km value of ALR(Y274F) for l-cystathionine was only 85-fold lower than that of CBL for its native substrate, and at 3.3 mm, it was comparable with that of wild type ALR for l-Ala (Km = 0.87 mm).TABLE 2Steady state kinetic parameters of ALR, CBL, and their evolved variantsCystathionine → homocysteine + Pyruvate + NH3l-Ala → d-AlaEnzymekcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kms−1mms−1·m−1s−1mms−1·m−1ALRNDaND means, not detected.NDaND means, not detected.<0.8555 ± 40.87 ± 0.156.4 × 104ALR(Y274F)(2.8 ± 0.3) × 10−33.3 ± 1.00.8540 ± 51.5 ± 0.62.6 × 104CBL90 ± 14(3.9 ± 0.7) × 10−22.3 × 1063.3 ± 0.651 ± 465CBL(P113S)95 ± 30.12 ± 0.027.9 × 10521.6 ± 0.458 ± 33.7 × 102CBL(P113A)81 ± 110.31 ± 0.072.6 × 1054.6 ± 0.523 ± 52.0 × 102CBL(P113T)30 ± 20.21 ± 0.021.4 × 1055.8 ± 0.539 ± 41.5 × 102CBL(P113Q)96 ± 80.12 ± 0.028.0 × 1053.6 ± 0.633 ± 101.1 × 102CBL(Y111F)0.07 ± 0.01(2.3 ± 1.9) × 10−23.1 × 103NDaND means, not detected.NDaND means, not detected.∼0.011a ND means, not detected. Open table in a new tab The promiscuous aminotransferase and aldolase activities of the ALR from Geobacillus stearothermophilus have been improved by site-directed mutagenesis (32Yow G.-Y.

In these examples, improvements in the new activities were accompanied by drastic reductions in the alanine racemase activity, by 3–4 orders of magnitude. In contrast, the improvement of CBL activity in ALR(Y274F) was accompanied by a weak trade-off in its native activity. In vitro alanine racemization assays showed that ALR(Y274F) had a 1.4-fold decrease in kcat and a 1.7-fold increase in Km, compared with ALR (Table 2). Given the location of Tyr-274′ at the entrance to the active site, it seemed likely that mutation to a smaller Phe residue was useful for allowing the new (and larger; Fig. 1) substrate, cystathionine, to bind productively. To confirm this hypothesis, we used x-ray crystallography to solve the structures of the His6-tagged ALR(Y274F) variant and an inhibitor-bound form. The inhibitor, (R)-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid (l-Ala-P), is a phosphonate analogue of l-Ala that is a substrate for the transaldimination reaction, in which the Schiff base linkage between Lys-34 and PLP in the active site of the resting enzyme is displaced by the amino group of the incoming substrate. Thus, l-Ala-P forms a stable external aldimine with PLP in the ALR active site (17Stamper G.F. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Stamper C.G.

As expected, the Y274F mutation had no significant effect on the overall architecture of ALR. A pairwise comparison of the uninhibited ALR and ALR(Y274F) dimers (from PDB entries 2RJG and 4WR3, respectively) using PDBeFold (34Krissinel E. Henrick K.

In the wild type ALR structure, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-274′ forms a hydrogen bond (2.6 Å) with a crystallographic sulfate, and it has been proposed that this sulfate mimics the position of l-Ala on its route into the active site (15Wu D.

Herein, we performed a replication experiment to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MEF2B and TRHDE gene exons, the 5'untranslated regions (within 1000bp), the 3' untranslated regions (within 1000bp) and their associations with Ujumqin sheep growth traits in 4-month age and 6-month age, respectively. Finally,3 SNPs were selected to be investigated including 1 SNP in 3'untranslated regions in MEF2B gene (rs417014745 A>G) and 2 SNPs in TRHDE gene (rs426980328 T>C and rs430810656 G>A).The χ2 test showed all the 3 variations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05) status. Association analysis suggested that rs426980328 T>C was significantly associated with body weight and chest girth in 4-month age (P<0.05). rs430810656 G>A exhibited extremely significant association with body weight and chest girth in 4-month age (P<0.01). rs417014745 A>G was extremely significantly associated with body weight and chest girth in 4-month age and chest girth in 6-month age (P<0.01), and it was also significantly associated with body weight in 6-month age (P<0.05).

These results suggested MEF2B and TRHDE genes affected growth traits in Ujumqin sheep and the combination effect of the two genes also played a significant effective role. These SNPs might have potential value as genetic markers for growth traits and it could be used in Ujumqin sheep breeding in future. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings."

Relative to FrmR, RcnR is less responsive to formaldehyde in vitro, and RcnR does not sense formaldehyde in vivo, but reciprocal mutations FrmRP2S and RcnRS2P, respectively, impair and enhance formaldehyde reactivity in vitro. Formaldehyde detoxification by FrmA requires S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, yet glutathione inhibits formaldehyde detection by FrmR in vivo and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2496486830,"Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi are major parasites of wheat, reducing production worldwide. Both are sedentary endoparasitic nematodes, and their development and parasitism depend strongly on nutrients obtained from hosts. Secreted fatty acid- and retinol-binding (FAR) proteins are nematode-specific lipid carrier proteins used for nutrient acquisition as well as suppression of plant defenses. In this study, we obtained three novel FAR genes Ha-far-1 (KU877266), Ha-far-2 (KU877267), Hf-far-1 (KU877268). Ha-far-1 and Ha-far-2 were cloned from H. avenae, encoding proteins of 191 and 280 amino acids with molecular masses about 17 and 30 kDa, respectively and sequence identity of 28%. Protein Blast in NCBI revealed that Ha-FAR-1 sequence is 78% similar to the Gp-FAR-1 protein from Globodera pallida, while Ha-FAR-2 is 30% similar to Rs-FAR-1 from Radopholus similis. Only one FAR protein Hf-FAR-1was identified in H. filipjevi; it had 96% sequence identity to Ha-FAR-1. The three proteins are alpha-helix-rich and contain the conserved domain of Gp-FAR-1, but Ha-FAR-2 had a remarkable peptide at the C-terminus which was random-coil-rich. Both Ha-FAR-1 and Hf-FAR-1 had casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, while Ha-FAR-2 had predicted N-glycosylation sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three proteins clustered together, though Ha-FAR-1 and Hf-FAR-1 adjoined each other in a plant-parasitic nematode branch, but Ha-FAR-2 was distinct from the other proteins in the group. Fluorescence-based ligand binding analysis showed the three FAR proteins bound to a fluorescent fatty acid derivative and retinol and with dissociation constants similar to FARs from other species, though Ha-FAR-2 binding ability was weaker than that of the two others. In situ hybridization detected mRNAs of Ha-far-1 and Ha-far-2 in the hypodermis. The qRT-PCR results showed that the Ha-far-1and Ha-far-2 were expressed in all developmental stages; Ha-far-1 expressed 70 times more than Ha-far-2 in all stages. The highest expression level of Ha-far-1 was observed in fourth-stage juvenile (J4), whereas the highest expression level of Ha-far-2 occurred in second-stage juvenile (J2). In conclusion, we have identified two novel far genes from H. avenae and one from H. filipjevi and have provided further indication that nematode far genes are present in a variety of nematode species, where the FAR proteins share similar basic structure, expression pattern and biochemical activities."

Verbal autopsy for every fifth case and InterVA-4 used to assign likely cause of death.6748 neonatal deaths identified, giving a neonatal mortality rate of 24.4 per 1000 live births. Of these, 51.3% occurred in the community and 48.7% at or on the way to a health facility. Almost half (46.1%) occurred within 24 hours of birth with 83.6% of all deaths occurring in the first seven days of life. Birth asphyxia was the leading cause of death (43%), followed by infections (29.3%), and prematurity (22.2%). In 68.3% of cases, care had been provided at a health facility before death occurred. Care-seeking was significantly higher among mothers who were educated (RR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04-1.35) or who delivered at a health facility (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.37-1.60) and lower among mothers who had 2-4 previous births (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96), for baby girls (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.93), and for low birth weight babies (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96).Most parents of neonates who died had accessed and received care from a qualified healthcare provider. To further reduce neonatal mortality, it is important that the quality of care provided, particularly skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care, and neonatal care during the first month of life is improved, such that it is timely, safe, and effective."
https://openalex.org/W2476239586,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world. Despite its prevalence, its mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. Peptidoglycan (PG) is important for helical shape, colonization, and host-pathogen interactions in C. jejuni. Therefore, changes in PG greatly impact the physiology of this organism. O-acetylation of peptidoglycan (OAP) is a bacterial phenomenon proposed to be important for proper cell growth, characterized by acetylation of the C6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylmuramic acid in the PG glycan backbone. The OAP gene cluster consists of a PG O-acetyltransferase A (patA) for translocation of acetate into the periplasm, a PG O-acetyltransferase B (patB) for O-acetylation, and an O-acetylpeptidoglycan esterase (ape1) for de-O-acetylation. In this study, reduced OAP in ΔpatA and ΔpatB had minimal impact on C. jejuni growth and fitness under the conditions tested. However, accumulation of OAP in Δape1 resulted in marked differences in PG biochemistry, including O-acetylation, anhydromuropeptide levels, and changes not expected to result directly from Ape1 activity. This suggests that OAP may be a form of substrate level regulation in PG biosynthesis. Ape1 acetylesterase activity was confirmed in vitro using p-nitrophenyl acetate and O-acetylated PG as substrates. In addition, Δape1 exhibited defects in pathogenesis-associated phenotypes, including cell shape, motility, biofilm formation, cell surface hydrophobicity, and sodium deoxycholate sensitivity. Δape1 was also impaired for chick colonization and adhesion, invasion, intracellular survival, and induction of IL-8 production in INT407 cells in vitro. The importance of Ape1 in C. jejuni biology makes it a good candidate as an antimicrobial target."

Type IV pili (T4P) are among the key virulence factors used by P. aeruginosa for host cell attachment, biofilm formation, and twitching motility, making this system a promising target for novel therapeutics. Point mutations in the conserved PilMNOP alignment subcomplex were previously shown to have distinct effects on assembly and disassembly of T4P, suggesting that it may function in a dynamic manner. We introduced mutations encoding Cys substitutions into pilN and/or pilO on the chromosome to maintain normal stoichiometry and expression levels and captured covalent PilNO heterodimers, as well as PilN and PilO homodimers, in vivo. Most covalent PilN or PilO homodimers had minimal functional impact in P. aeruginosa, suggesting that homodimers are a physiologically relevant state. However, certain covalent homo- or heterodimers eliminated twitching motility, suggesting that specific PilNO configurations are essential for T4P function. These data were verified using soluble N-terminal truncated fragments of PilN and PilO Cys mutants, which purified as a mixture of homo- and heterodimers at volumes consistent with a tetramer. Deletion of genes encoding alignment subcomplex components, PilM or PilP, but not other T4P components, including the motor ATPases PilB or PilT, blocked in vivo formation of disulfide-bonded PilNO heterodimers, suggesting that both PilM and PilP influence the heterodimer interface. Combined, our data suggest that T4P function depends on rearrangements at PilN and PilO interfaces."

We performed mark, release and recapture (MRR) experiments using Wolbachia as an internal marker with daily collections with BG-Traps during the first two weeks of releases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The MRR design allowed us to investigate two critical parameters that determine whether Wolbachia would successful invade a field population: the probability of daily survival (PDS) of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti females, and the wild population density during releases. Released females had a PDS of 0.82 and 0.89 in the first and second weeks, respectively, immediately after releases, which is well within the range of previous estimates of survivorship of wild mosquitoes in Rio de Janeiro. Abundance estimation of wild population varied up to 10-fold higher depending on the estimation method used (634–3565 females on the average-difference model to 6365–16188 females according to Lincoln-Petersen). Wolbachia-released mosquitoes were lower than the density estimation of their wild counterparts, irrespectively of the model used. Individually screening mosquitoes for the presence of Wolbachia reduced uncertainty on abundance estimations due to fluctuation in capturing per week. A successful invasion into local population requires Ae. aegypti fitness is unaffected by Wolbachia presence, but also reliable estimates on the population size of wild mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W2505178615,"Tumor surveillance of natural killer (NK) cells is mediated by the cytotoxicity receptor natural-killer group 2 member D (NKG2D). Ligands for NKG2D are generally not expressed on healthy cells, but induced on the surface of malignant cells. To date, NKG2D ligand (NKG2D-L) induction was mainly described to depend on the activation of the DNA damage response, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate NKG2D-L expression remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the acetyltransferases CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 play a crucial role in the regulation of NKG2D-L on tumor cells. Loss of CBP/p300 decreased the basal cell surface expression of human ligands and reduced the upregulation of MICA/B and ULBP2 in response to histone deacetylase inhibitors or DNA damage. Furthermore, CBP/P300 deficiency abrogated the sensitivity of stressed cells to NK cell-mediated killing. CBP/p300 were also identified as major regulators of mouse NKG2D ligand RAE-1 in vitro and in vivo using the Eμ-Myc lymphoma model. Mechanistically, we observed an enhanced activation of the CBP/p300 binding transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) correlating to the NKG2D-L upregulation. Moreover, increased binding of CREB and CBP/p300 to NKG2D-L promoters and elevated histone acetylation were detectable. This study provides strong evidence for a major role of CBP and p300 in orchestrating NKG2D-L induction and consequently immunosurveillance of tumors in mice and humans. These findings might help to develop novel immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer."

In contrast with this medical importance, the pathophysiological events remain poorly known. Murine models of brain cytomegalovirus infection, mostly neonatal, have brought recent insights into the possible pathogenesis, with convergent evidence for the alteration and possible involvement of brain immune cells.In order to confirm and expand those findings, particularly concerning the early developmental stages following infection of the fetal brain, we have created a model of in utero cytomegalovirus infection in the developing rat brain. Rat cytomegalovirus was injected intraventricularly at embryonic day 15 (E15) and the brains analyzed at various stages until the first postnatal day, using a combination of gene expression analysis, immunohistochemistry and multicolor flow cytometry experiments.Rat cytomegalovirus infection was increasingly seen in various brain areas including the choroid plexi and the ventricular and subventricular areas and was prominently detected in CD45low/int, CD11b+ microglial cells, in CD45high, CD11b+ cells of the myeloid lineage including macrophages, and in CD45+, CD11b- lymphocytes and non-B non-T cells. In parallel, rat cytomegalovirus infection of the developing rat brain rapidly triggered a cascade of pathophysiological events comprising: chemokines upregulation, including CCL2-4, 7 and 12; infiltration by peripheral cells including B-cells and monocytes at E17 and P1, and T-cells at P1; and microglia activation at E17 and P1.In line with previous findings in neonatal murine models and in human specimen, our study further suggests that neuroimmune alterations might play critical roles in the early stages following cytomegalovirus infection of the brain in utero. Further studies are now needed to determine which role, whether favorable or detrimental, those putative double-edge swords events actually play."

In the TM domain composed of a 12-helix bundle, both LeuT and DAT from Drosophila harbor a centrally located primary substrate binding site, S1, and two Na+ ions bound at sites termed Na1 and Na2 (supplemental Fig. S1).

For DAT, electrophysiology and computations revealed the role of the Na2 site occupancy in controlling the permeation of cations and showed that Li+ binding in the Na2 site is regulated by Cl− (45Borre L. Andreassen T.F. Shi L. Weinstein H. Gether U. The second sodium site in the dopamine transporter controls cation permeation and is regulated by chloride.J. Biol.

Assessing the conformational changes associated with substrate and ion binding, MD simulations (31Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L. Weinstein H. Noskov S. Shi L.

J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) initiated from the outward occluded state of LeuT with Na+ in the Na1 and Na2 sites but without substrate in the S1 site revealed a gradual widening of the EC vestibule as the transporter converged to a conformation similar to that seen crystallographically for the substrate-free LeuT (16Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The outward opening was further enhanced in MD simulations carried out without Na+ in Na1 and found to be modulated by the protonation state of Glu290 (31Zhao C. Stolzenberg S. Gracia L. Weinstein H. Noskov S. Shi L. Ion-controlled conformational dynamics in the outward-open transition from an occluded state of LeuT.Biophys. J. 2012; 103: 878-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In microsecond scale, unbiased MD simulations of a full-length model of human DAT (hDAT) described recently (51Khelashvili G. Stanley N. Sahai M.A. Medina J. LeVine M.V. Shi L. De Fabritiis G. Weinstein H. Spontaneous inward opening of the dopamine transporter is triggered by PIP-regulated dynamics of the N-terminus.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6: 1825-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we found great similarity between the conformational rearrangements of DAT and those described previously for LeuT (based on results for both transporters obtained from simulations as well as experiments that were shown to be in excellent agreement (30Kazmier K. Sharma S. Quick M. Islam S.M. Roux B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. McHaourab H.S. Conformational dynamics of ligand-dependent alternating access in LeuT.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). However, in the simulations of the DAT system, we also observed for the first time a strong tendency for K+ ions to partition from the solution, through the IC vestibule, into the Na2 site of the transporter following the release of the Na2-bound Na+. 3G. Khelashvili and H. Weinstein, unpublished data. 3G. Khelashvili and H. Weinstein, unpublished data. Given the similarity in conformational transitions of DAT and LeuT, we reasoned that K+ would partition similarly into inward facing LeuT once the water penetration on the intracellular side connects the protein to the high physiological concentrations of K+ ions in the cytoplasm. Here we investigate the consequences of K+ presence in the Na2 site on the structure and conformational dynamics of the prototypical NSS transporter LeuT, because this may represent a general feature of this family of transporters when they have transitioned toward the inward facing conformation. The intriguing possibility that K+ binding in an apo structure that should be ready for a return to the start of a transport cycle could play a functional role prompted the detailed comparative investigation of the effects of K+ and Na+ in the Na2 site of the LeuT transporter, for which a role of ions in controlling the gating dynamics has been elucidated in a number of experimental and computational studies. In particular, two questions were suggested by the recent findings for DAT (51Khelashvili G. Stanley N. Sahai M.A. Medina J. LeVine M.V. Shi L. De Fabritiis G. Weinstein H. Spontaneous inward opening of the dopamine transporter is triggered by PIP-regulated dynamics of the N-terminus.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6: 1825-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) regarding the possible involvement of K+ in the return step of transport cycle of LeuT-fold NSS: 1) What are the consequences of K+ in Na2 when both the Na+ ions and substrate have left the transporter? and 2) How does this compare with the state of the system when a Na+ ion binds in that same site under the same conditions? We present here the results of a computational investigation of these conditions with microsecond scale unbiased atomistic MD simulations and enhanced sampling with ensemble MD and relate the findings regarding the various constructs to experimentally measured affinities under corresponding conditions. We show here that simulations of apo LeuT with/without K+ in Na2 indicate a strong dependence of the outcomes on the protonation state of Glu290 (see supplemental Fig. S1 for structural details). The effects of changes in the charge carried by the Glu290 residue in LeuT have been shown (4Zomot E. Bendahan A. Quick M. Zhao Y. Javitch J.A. Kanner B.I. Mechanism of chloride interaction with neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.Nature. 2007; 449: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Kantcheva A.K. Quick M. Shi L. Winther A.M. Stolzenberg S. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Nissen P. Chloride binding site of neurotransmitter sodium symporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8489-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to correspond to those produced by the presence or absence of Cl− in the eukaryotic NSS homologs such as DAT and SERT. We find that when Glu290 is in its charged (deprotonated) form, K+ appears relatively stable in the Na+ binding region. In contrast, when Glu290 is protonated (neutral) K+ is destabilized and released from the Na2 site to the aqueous the solution on the extracellular side. This release of K+ is enabled by the formation of a continuous water channel connecting the EC vestibule to the functional sites (S1, Na1, and Na2) and leads to a widening of the EC vestibule of the transporter. Importantly, our analysis shows that the penetration of water into the channel formed when Glu290 is protonated is accompanied by a rearrangement of residues associated with the substrate-binding S1 site, specifically Leu25 and Tyr108 and eventually Phe253; together these residues are proposed to constitute a “water gate” (see supplemental Fig. S1 for the relative positions of these key residues). In parallel MD simulations addressing the second question, regarding the comparison with Na+-bound states, we find that the same repositioning of Leu25 and Tyr108 is required for the partitioning of Na+ ions from the extracellular solution into the ion binding sites of LeuT and that this occurs only when Glu290 is negatively charged (deprotonated). These mechanistic findings point to the protonation state of Glu290 as a determinant factor in the structural reconfiguration of the extracellular vestibule of LeuT. This reconfiguration results in the opening of the water gate to enable the transporter to bind the Na+ and K+ ions under the physiological conditions prevalent, respectively, in the extracellular and the intracellular environments.

It is characterized by parasite sequestration, a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and a strong inflammation in the brain. We investigated the role of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), an important modulator of neuroinflammatory responses, in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Strikingly, mice with a deletion of the CB2-encoding gene (Cnr2−/−) inoculated with Plasmodium berghei ANKA erythrocytes exhibited enhanced survival and a diminished blood-brain barrier disruption. Therapeutic application of a specific CB2 antagonist also conferred increased ECM resistance in wild type mice. Hematopoietic derived immune cells were responsible for the enhanced protection in bone marrow (BM) chimeric Cnr2−/− mice. Mixed BM chimeras further revealed that CB2-expressing cells contributed to ECM development. A heterogeneous CD11b+ cell population, containing macrophages and neutrophils, expanded in the Cnr2−/− spleen after infection and expressed macrophage mannose receptors, arginase-1 activity, and IL-10. Also in the Cnr2−/− brain, CD11b+ cells that expressed selected anti-inflammatory markers accumulated, and expression of inflammatory mediators IFN-γ and TNF-α was reduced. Finally, the M2 macrophage chemokine CCL17 was identified as an essential factor for enhanced survival in the absence of CB2, because CCL17 × Cnr2 double-deficient mice were fully susceptible to ECM.

Cerebral malaria: why experimental murine models are required to understand the pathogenesis of disease.Parasitology. 2010; 137: 755-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Disease pathogenesis is associated with a widespread activation of microglial cells, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and endothelial cell damage (1Hunt N.H. Golenser J. Chan-Ling T.

It was suggested that macrophages support pathogenic T cell responses in the CNS leading to the death of mice with experimental CM (ECM). Conversely, macrophages are also capable of mediating anti-parasite responses by clearance of parasites or production of IL-10, a cytokine shown to limit disease progression (9Patel S.N. Serghides L.

It may therefore hold a therapeutic potential for the treatment of infectious CNS disorders. CB2 signaling affects various macrophage functions, such as antigen uptake, antigen presentation, and chemokine/cytokine production. For example, macrophages isolated from Cnr2−/− mice presented reduced T cell stimulatory potential in vitro compared with WT controls, indicating CB2-mediated alterations in antigen processing (20Buckley N.E. McCoy K.L. Mezey E. Bonner T. Zimmer A. Felder C.C. Glass M. Zimmer A. Immunomodulation by cannabinoids is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB(2) receptor.Eur. J.

In addition, it was demonstrated that activation of CB2 negatively regulated IL-12p40 and NO production but enhanced IL-10 release in LPS-activated macrophages (22Correa F. Mestre L. Docagne F. Guaza C. Activation of cannabinoid CB2 receptor negatively regulates IL-12p40 production in murine macrophages: role of IL-10 and ERK1/2 kinase signaling.Br. J.

In this study, we investigated the role of CB2 in ECM by using Cnr2−/− mice, mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeras, and a pharmacological approach. We could demonstrate that CB2 modulates susceptibility to ECM associated with anti-inflammatory macrophage effector responses. Our findings and the fact that the therapeutic application of the CB2 antagonist SR144528 conferred enhanced CM resistance in C57BL/6 mice provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting CB2 for the treatment of ECM. We studied different components of the endocannabinoid system after PbA infection of C57BL/6 mice (20Buckley N.E. McCoy K.L. Mezey E. Bonner T. Zimmer A. Felder C.C. Glass M. Zimmer A. Immunomodulation by cannabinoids is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB(2) receptor.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 396: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 24Kogan N.M. Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids in health and disease.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2007; 9: 413-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (Cnr2) mRNA was markedly enhanced in the brain at day 6 after infection (Fig. 1A), whereas cannabinoid receptor 1 (Cnr1) expression remained unchanged (2−ΔCt, control: 0.009 ± 0.00065; ECM: 0.009 ± 0.0003). Fatty acid amide hydrolase and diacylglycerol lipase β brain mRNA levels were not altered (2−ΔCt, control: 0.0054 ± 0.0008; ECM WT: 0.0052 ± 0.0015). However, diacylglycerol lipase α, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), and monoacylglycerol lipase, an enzyme metabolizing 2-AG, were significantly increased (Fig. 1B). The enhanced expression of these enzymes suggested an increased turnover of 2-AG. We determined indeed similar 2-AG levels in PbA-infected and control mice, whereas arachidonic acid (AA) levels were higher, potentially reflecting 2-AG hydrolysis (Fig. 1C). Thus, brain 2-AG signaling via CB2 seems to be affected by PbA infection. We found that PbA-infected WT mice developed severe ECM starting at day 5 and succumbed to ECM 24–48 h later (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, infected Cnr2−/− mice exhibited a diminished clinical score and an enhanced survival (p < 0.0001). Approximately 50% of the infected Cnr2−/− mice were protected from development of ECM and finally succumbed to hyperparasitemia and severe anemia after >20 days. This variability in survival points toward threshold effects influencing cerebral symptoms and survival of Cnr2−/− mice. Parasitemia in Cnr2−/− mice was similar to controls, indicating that a reduced parasite burden in the blood did not account for enhanced survival (Fig. 1F). However, attenuated ECM in Cnr2−/− mice was accompanied by a reduction of parasite-specific 18S RNA levels in the brain (Fig. 1G). The reduced 18S RNA in the presence of a comparable parasitemia in Cnr2−/− versus WT mice indicates a reduction in parasite sequestration in the brain (25Baptista F.G. Pamplona A. Pena A.C. Mota M.M. Pied S. Vigário A.M. Accumulation of Plasmodium berghei-infected red blood cells in the brain is crucial for the development of cerebral malaria in mice.Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the integrity of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) by assessing the diffusion of Evans Blue into the brain (1Hunt N.H. Golenser J. Chan-Ling T. Parekh S. Rae C. Potter S. Medana I.M. Miu J. Ball H.J. Immunopathogenesis of cerebral malaria.Int. J. Parasitol. 2006; 36: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Belnoue E. Potter S.M. Rosa D.S. Mauduit M.

Control of pathogenic CD8+ T cell migration to the brain by IFN-γ during experimental cerebral malaria.Parasite Immunol. 2008; 30: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast to WT mice, infected Cnr2−/− brains displayed a reduced Evans Blue staining, indicative of an attenuated BBB disruption (Fig. 1H). Thus, the severity of PbA infection and incidence of ECM were significantly reduced in Cnr2−/− mice, which could account for the higher survival rate of these mice. We next asked whether severity of ECM could also be modulated by pharmacological blockade of CB2 (26Pertwee R.G. Ligands that target cannabinoid receptors in the brain: from THC to anandamide and beyond.Addict. Biol. 2008; 13: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice were treated daily with the CB2 antagonist SR144528. Most strikingly, these mice also showed an enhanced survival rate (p = 0.0116; Fig. 1I). These data demonstrate that the reduced ECM incidence in Cnr2−/− mice is due to a disrupted CB2 signaling rather than being a consequence of compensatory developmental changes. They also indicate a therapeutic potential of CB2 antagonists/inverse agonists. To evaluate whether expression of CB2 on hematopoietically derived immune cells affects disease pathology, we reconstituted lethally irradiated WT mice with BM cells from Cnr2−/− (Cnr2−/− → WT) or WT (WT → WT) mice (Fig. 1J). Cnr2−/− → WT mice showed enhanced survival after PbA infection (p < 0.01), whereas all WT → WT chimeras succumbed to ECM. Thus, CB2 deficiency on immune cells, but not radioresistant CNS cells, protects against ECM. Recruitment of immune cells to the brain is an important step in ECM pathology (7Rénia L. Potter S.M. Mauduit M. Rosa D.S. Kayibanda M. Deschemin J.C. Snounou G. Grüner A.C. Pathogenic T cells in cerebral malaria.Int. J.

The absolute number of mononuclear brain-infiltrating cells was markedly reduced in Cnr2−/− mice at day 6 after PbA infection (Fig. 2A). Within this population, we observed increased percentages of CD11b+ cells; >31% of cells that immigrated into the Cnr2−/− brain expressed CD11b, whereas <14% of CD11b+ cells were found in WT brains (Fig. 2B). Equivalent percentages of CD4+ T cells were found in the WT and Cnr2−/− brains (data not shown), whereas percentages of CD8+ T cells were reduced in the brains of Cnr2−/− mice (Fig. 2C). We also found a reduced number of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ T cells in the Cnr2−/− brain, indicating that a Treg-mediated mechanism does not contribute to disease protection in the absence of CB2 signaling (WT: 0.02 × 104 ± 0.01; Cnr2−/−: 0.01 × 104 ± 0.005) (27Amante F.H.

We therefore focused on the reduced brain recruitment of CD8 T lymphocytes and the increased percentage of CD11b+ myeloid-derived cells in the brains of infected Cnr2−/− mice, because both cell types are essential for acquisition and regulation of immunity in ECM (8Amante F.H.

Med. 2013; 19: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine whether CB2 expression in myeloid or lymphoid cells was required for susceptibility to ECM, we generated mixed BM chimeras by reconstitution of lethally irradiated WT mice with mixed BM from Cnr2−/− and RAG-2−/− mice (Cnr2−/− + RAG-2−/− → WT). In these mice, hematopoietically derived immune cells were CB2-deficient, with the exception of myeloid cells originating from RAG-2−/− BM cells (Fig. 2D). As controls, irradiated WT mice were reconstituted with Cnr2−/− (Cnr2−/− → WT) or WT BM cells (WT → WT). Again, infectedCnr2−/− → WT mice demonstrated enhanced survival in comparison with WT → WT chimeric mice (p = 0.0089). However, mixed BM chimeras (Cnr2−/− + RAG-2−/− → WT) showed 100% mortality (Fig. 2D). These data point toward a contribution of CB2-expressing myeloid cells to the enhanced susceptibility to ECM. To analyze a possible role of CB2 in modulating CD8 T cell responses in this model, we investigated Th1 responses and cytotoxicity in Cnr2−/− and WT T cells (Fig. 2E). IFN-γ and granzyme B (GrzB) production was equivalent in Cnr2−/− and WT CD8+ T cells when stimulated with cognate peptide-loaded spleen-derived DCs from infected RAG-2−/− mice, indicating that CB2 may not have a major CD8+ T cell intrinsic function under these conditions. Next, we investigated immune responses in the spleens of infected Cnr2−/− and WT mice. Cnr2−/− spleens exhibited increased weight and total splenic cell numbers at day 6, indicating an altered cellular composition (Fig. 2, F and G). Flow cytometry determined that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B220+ CD11c− B cells, were present in equivalent numbers in the spleens of infected WT and Cnr2−/− mice (CD4+ T cells in WT: 17.65 × 106 ± 5.3 versus Cnr2−/−: 18.79 × 106 ± 4.0; CD8+ T cells in WT: 10.94 × 106 ± 7.18 versus Cnr2−/−: 9.65 × 106 ± 4.8; B220+ CD11c− B cells in WT: 51.8 × 106 ± 39.9 versus Cnr2−/−: 53.5 × 106 ± 33.5). No differences in NK cell numbers and percentages were found in the spleens from day 6 infected WT and Cnr2−/− mice (percentage of NK1.1 cells in WT: 0.97 ± 0.2 versus Cnr2−/−: 0.75 ± 0.3; number of NK1.1 cells in WT: 1.6 × 106 ± 0.3 versus Cnr2−/−: 2.1 × 106 ± 1.0). Equivalent percentages of GrzB-producing NK cells in infected mice further suggested that NK cells may not play a central role in immune protection against ECM in Cnr2−/− mice (Fig. 2H). We next investigated whether parasite-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which are required in ECM induction (30Haque A. Best S.E. Unosson K. Amante F.H. de Labastida F. Anstey N.M. Karupiah G. Smyth M.J. Heath W.R. Engwerda C.R. Granzyme B expression by CD8+ T cells is required for the development of experimental cerebral malaria.J.

Cytokines: accelerators and brakes in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria.Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 491-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), were altered in Cnr2−/− mice. Splenocytes isolated from Cnr2−/− and WT mice were isolated at day 6 after infection with an OVA-transgenic parasite strain. Cnr2−/− splenocytes produced lower levels of IFN-γ and GrzB after restimulation with the SIINFEKL peptide when compared with WT splenocytes (Fig. 2I). Also, reduced percentages of GrzB+ CD8+ T cells in spleen cultures of Cnr2−/− mice indicated diminished splenic anti-parasitic T cell responses in the infected Cnr2−/− mice (Fig. 2J). In contrast, MACS-purified CD8+ T cells from the spleens of infected Cnr2−/− mice produced these factors equivalently to WT CD8+ T cells when restimulated with peptide presented by CB2-competent antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 2K). Thus, CB2 does not affect CD8 T cell function in ECM in a cell-intrinsic way. To characterize CD11b+ myeloid cells in Cnr2−/− mice in more detail, we first analyzed dendritic cells and macrophages generated from the BM of Cnr2−/− and WT mice. GM-CSF-generated Cnr2−/− BM DCs induced equivalent OT-II T cell responses when compared with WT BM DCs, as represented by proliferation, IFN-γ release, and GrzB production (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that CB2 does not affect basic T cell priming properties of BM DCs. M-CSF-generated CD11b+ BM macrophages from Cnr2−/− mice expressed enhanced Ym1 and arginase-1 (Arg-1) mRNA levels under IL-4-stimulatory conditions (Fig. 3C). They also exhibited enhanced expression of mannose macrophage receptors (MMRs) and secreted reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 (Fig. 3, D and E), pointing toward anti-inflammatory properties of these cells (32Gordon S. Martinez F.O. Alternative activation of macrophages: mechanism and functions.Immunity. 2010; 32: 593-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). In a next step, we investigated myeloid cell responses in vivo in infected Cnr2−/− and WT mice. In the blood, numbers of CD11b+ CD11c− cells and Ly6Ghi neutrophils increased equivalently in Cnr2−/− and WT mice (Fig. 3F). In addition, comparable numbers of CD11chi MHC II+ DCs were found at all time points after infection with equal proportions of conventional DCs (CD11b+ CD11c+, CD4+ CD11c+ DCs, and CD8+ CD11c+ DCs) as well as B220+ plasmacytoid DCs (Fig. 3G). However, in the splenic red pulp of infected Cnr2−/− mice, CD11b expression was markedly increased at day 6 after infection when compared with WT controls (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometry further verified enhanced percentages of CD11b+ cells in the spleens of Cnr2−/− mice at this time point (Fig. 4B). Because CD11b is expressed on several myeloid cell types comprising macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs, we further characterized CD11b-expressing cells in Cnr2−/− mice (33Mildner A. Jung S.

Higher percentages of CD11b+ cells that were negative for CD11c accumulated in the spleens of infected Cnr2−/− mice, indicating that these cells do not exclusively represent CD11b-expressing DC subsets (Fig. 4C). Rather, numbers of CD11chi DCs decreased equally in the spleens of both mouse strains after infection (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we identified no differences in the percentages of conventional and plasmacytoid DCs in WT versus Cnr2−/− mice at day 6 after infection (Fig. 4E). However, counts of CD11b+ Ly6Ghi neutrophils markedly increased at this time point of infection in Cnr2−/− mice but not in WT mice (Fig. 4F). We further investigated whether increased numbers of CD11b+ cells in the Cnr2−/− spleen also comprise macrophages by utilizing previously published gating strategies (36Wu X. Gowda N.M. Gowda D.C. Phagosomal acidification prevents macrophage inflammatory cytokine production to malaria, and dendritic cells are the major source at the early stages of infection: implication for malaria protective immunity development.J.

Red pulp macrophages (CD11blo F4/80+ CD169lo MHC IIlo), marginal zone macrophages (F4/80− CD11b− MARCO+; MMs) and a subset of CD11b+ F4/80hi CD169lo MHC-IIlo cells accumulated in the spleens of infected Cnr2−/− mice, with the exception of metallophilic marginal zone macrophages (F4/80− CD11b− CD169+; MMMs) (Fig. 4G). These data suggest that accumulated CD11b+ cells in Cnr2−/− versus WT spleens contain macrophages as well as neutrophils. We next investigated the phenotypic and functional profiles of splenic CD11b+ cells in PbA-infected Cnr2−/− and WT mice. At day 6 after infection, CD11b+ cells in the Cnr2−/− spleen exhibited enhanced expression of MMRs and Arg-1 activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, isolated Cnr2−/− CD11b+ cells secreted higher amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at this time point, suggesting that these cells exerted protective functions in Cnr2−/− mice after PbA infection (Fig. 5C). To clarify the identity of IL-10-producing CD11b+ cells in Cnr2−/− mice, we measured cytokine release in DCs, neutrophils, and macrophages isolated from the spleens of PbA-infected mice. We found no difference in the percentages of TNF- and IL-10-producing CD11chi MHC-II+ DCs in the spleens of day 6 infected Cnr2−/− and WT mice in vitro and an equivalent increase of TNF+ DCs after LPS restimulation of these cells (Fig. 5D)"
https://openalex.org/W2520336046,"Rickettsia belong to a family of Gram-negative obligate intracellular infectious bacteria that are the causative agents of typhus and spotted fever. Outer membrane protein B (OmpB) occurs in all rickettsial species, serves as a protective envelope, mediates host cell adhesion and invasion, and is a major immunodominant antigen. OmpBs from virulent strains contain multiple trimethylated lysine residues, whereas the avirulent strain contains mainly monomethyllysine. Two protein-lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) that catalyze methylation of recombinant OmpB at multiple sites with varying sequences have been identified and overexpressed. PKMT1 catalyzes predominantly monomethylation, whereas PKMT2 catalyzes mainly trimethylation. Rickettsial PKMT1 and PKMT2 are unusual in that their primary substrate appears to be limited to OmpB, and both are capable of methylating multiple lysyl residues with broad sequence specificity. Here we report the crystal structures of PKMT1 from Rickettsia prowazekii and PKMT2 from Rickettsia typhi, both the apo form and in complex with its cofactor S-adenosylmethionine or S-adenosylhomocysteine. The structure of PKMT1 in complex with S-adenosylhomocysteine is solved to a resolution of 1.9 Å. Both enzymes are dimeric with each monomer containing an S-adenosylmethionine binding domain with a core Rossmann fold, a dimerization domain, a middle domain, a C-terminal domain, and a centrally located open cavity. Based on the crystal structures, residues involved in catalysis, cofactor binding, and substrate interactions were examined using site-directed mutagenesis followed by steady state kinetic analysis to ascertain their catalytic functions in solution. Together, our data reveal new structural and mechanistic insights into how rickettsial methyltransferases catalyze OmpB methylation.

The levels of methylation of OmpB from several virulent and avirulent strains appear to correlate well with the virulence level of the strains. In-depth analysis of methylation profiles, using semiquantitative integrated LC-MS/MS methods on the locations, states, and levels of methylated lysine residues in OmpB purified from several rickettsial strains, revealed that (i) OmpBs from virulent strains contain clusters of highly trimethylated lysine residues and (ii) OmpB from the avirulent strain contains primarily monomethyllysine residues and no trimethyllysine (16Abeykoon A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 1491-1494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If methylation of OmpB indeed causes virulence, rickettsial virulence could be mediated in part by cellular proteins involved in the regulation of these processes. Two classes of rickettsial protein-lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) have been identified and termed PKMT1 and PKMT2 via bioinformatics analysis, cloning, overexpression, and characterization in terms of their enzyme activity using recombinant OmpB fragments as the substrates (25Abeykoon A.H. Chao C.-C. Wang G. Gucek M. Yang D.C. Ching W.-M. Two protein lysine methyltransferases methylate outer membrane protein B from Rickettsia.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both classes of PKMTs catalyze methylation of recombinant OmpB but show distinct levels of specificity and types of methylation. At distinct sites, PKMT1 catalyzes primarily monomethylation and produces substantially lower levels of di- and trimethylated lysine, whereas PKMT2 catalyzes almost exclusively trimethylation at relatively specific sites (16Abeykoon A. Wang G. Chao C.-C. Chock P.B. Gucek M. Ching W.-M. Yang D.C. Multimethylation of Rickettsia OmpB catalyzed by lysine methyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7691-7701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In recombinant fragments of OmpB, RpPKMT1 can catalyze monomethylation of its 39 lysyl residues, and 14 of these residues can be trimethylated by RpPKMT2 (16Abeykoon A. Wang G. Chao C.-C. Chock P.B. Gucek M. Ching W.-M. Yang D.C. Multimethylation of Rickettsia OmpB catalyzed by lysine methyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7691-7701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Homologous PKMTs have been found in more than 40 different rickettsial species including RP789 from Rickettsia prowazekii (RpPKMT1), RT776 from Rickettsia typhi (RtPKMT1), RP027-028 from R. prowazekii (RpPKMT2), and RT0101 from R. typhi (RtPKMT2). The locations, states, and levels of methylation in methylated recombinant OmpB fragments using these PKMTs and the methyl donor AdoMet were determined using LC-MS/MS. The observed lysine methylation profiles from in vitro methylation correlate well with those found in native OmpBs purified directly from Rickettsia (16Abeykoon A. Wang G. Chao C.-C. Chock P.B. Gucek M. Ching W.-M. Yang D.C. Multimethylation of Rickettsia OmpB catalyzed by lysine methyltransferases.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 7691-7701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results indicate that virulent strains contain and express both PKMT1 and PKMT2, but the avirulent strain contains a frameshift mutation of PKMT2 gene and does not possess active PKMT2 (13Zhang J.-Z. Hao J.-F. Walker D.H. Yu X.-J. A mutation inactivating the methyltransferase gene in avirulent Madrid E strain of Rickettsia prowazekii reverted to wild type in the virulent revertant strain Evir.Vaccine. 2006; 24: 2317-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The primary substrate of rickettsial PKMTs appear to be limited to OmpB because these purified PKMTs fail to catalyze the methylation of histones or Escherichia coli proteins (25Abeykoon A.H. Chao C.-C. Wang G. Gucek M. Yang D.C. Ching W.-M. Two protein lysine methyltransferases methylate outer membrane protein B from Rickettsia.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKMT1 and PKMT2 exhibit unusually broad amino acid sequence specificity and produce distinct methylation profiles in OmpB. To our knowledge, with the exception of PrmA methyltransferase that catalyzes trimethylation at multiple residues of ribosomal protein L11 (26Demirci H. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Jogl G. Recognition of ribosomal protein L11 by the protein trimethyltransferase PrmA.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and of archaeal protein-lysine methyltransferase that multimethylates Cren7, a chromatin protein (27Niu Y.

Structural comparison of PKMT1 and PKMT2 may uncover insights into their different product specificity. Comparative structural analyses with known structures of PKMTs (28Zhang X. Tamaru H. Khan S.I.

In this study, we determined the crystal structures of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 as well as the complexes with the cofactor, AdoMet or AdoHcy. Our structural data provide the first look of this family of PKMTs that specifically target OmpB, allowing us to identify conserved active site residues and a putative substrate binding cleft, and revealed their catalytic roles using site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme kinetic analyses. Together, our data provide structural and mechanistic insights into rickettsial PKMTs and enable us to propose a model that describes the molecular basis for how the rickettsial PKMTs interact with AdoMet and OmpB for substrate specificity and catalysis. Crystal structural analysis was performed to investigate the catalytic action of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 in their methylation of OmpB. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence alignment of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2. The sequence of RpPKMT1 exhibits a 44% identity with that of RtPKMT2 and an N-terminal extension of 28 residues. RpPKMT1 catalyzes predominantly lysine monomethylation, whereas RtPKMT2 catalyzes almost exclusively trimethylation (16Abeykoon A. Wang G. Chao C.-C. Chock P.B. Gucek M. Ching W.-M. Yang D.C.

To determine the crystal structure, the purified recombinant RpPKMT1, SeMet-labeled RpPKMT1, and RtPKMT2 were prepared and crystallized. All structures were solved in space group P21. Selenium single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing was used to solve the structures of SeMet-substituted RpPKMT1 to 2.9-Å resolution. This structure was then used as a search model to solve the native structures of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 to a final resolution of 2.6 and 3.1 Å, respectively (Table 1). The RpPKMT1 structure consists of modeled residues Tyr43–Val553 of chain A and chain B, whereas the RtPKMT2 structure consists of modeled residues Pro14–Gly534 of chain A and chain B. For all structures, two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit related by 2-fold symmetry with significant interactions, indicating a possible homodimer.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement summaryRpPKMT1 selenium SADRpPKMT1 nativeRpPKMT1-AdoMetRpPKMT1-AdoHcyRtPKMT2 nativeRtPKMT2-AdoHcyData collectionλ (Å)0.9791.01.01.01.01.0Space groupP21P21P21P21P21P21Mol/ASU222222a, b, c (Å)100.1, 65.0, 108.898.5, 62.5, 107.998.0, 62.9, 107.698.0, 62.1, 107.497.2, 66.9, 222.683.4, 91.0, 105.8α, β, γ (°)90, 101.18, 9090, 100.78, 9090, 100.42, 9090, 100.88, 9090, 89.82, 9090, 112.3, 90Resolution (Å)50–2.9 (3.0 2.9)50–2.6 (2.69–2.6)50–3.0 (3.11–3.0)50–1.9 (1.97–1.9)50–3.1 (3.21–3.1)50–3.2 (3.31–3.2)Completeness (%)aIndicates statistics for last resolution shell shown in parentheses.99.8 (99.9)99.5 (96.9)95.0 (89.7)99.4 (97.3)95.6 (96.0)97.5 (90.4)RedundancyaIndicates statistics for last resolution shell shown in parentheses.6.3 (6.2)3.7 (2.9)2.4 (2.0)3.3 (2.8)3.7 (3.6)2.8 (2.4)RsymaIndicates statistics for last resolution shell shown in parentheses.,bRsym = Σhkl,j (|Ihkl − 〈Ihkl〉|)/Σhkl,jIhkl where 〈Ihkl〉 is the average intensity for a set of j symmetry-related reflections and Ihkl is the value of the intensity for a single reflection within a set of symmetry-related reflections.0.20 (0.91)0.16 (0.69)0.12 (0.52)0.12 (0.72)0.11 (0.77)0.14 (0.69)I/σ(I)aIndicates statistics for last resolution shell shown in parentheses.12.5 (2.3)9.5 (1.9)8.4 (1.5)13.9 (1.5)15.1 (1.7)7.0 (1.4)RefinementResolution (Å)48–2.620–3.020–1.948–3.148–3.2RcR-factor = Σhkl(‖Fo| − |Fc‖)/Σhkl|Fo| where Fo is the observed structure factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure factor amplitude./RfreedRfree = Σhkl,T(‖Fo| − |Fc‖)/Σhkl,T|Fo| where a test set, T (5% of the data), is omitted from the refinement.0.21/0.240.20/0.230.20/0.250.23/0.280.24/0.28Bonds (Å)0.0040.0070.0070.0050.005Angles (°)0.8561.2451.0370.9831.166Protein atoms80128069805081658025Ligand atoms5452254Waters333928B-factorsProtein45.460.7336.178.972.9Ligand61.521.073.3Waters34.739.1Ramachandran analysisePerformed using MolProbity.Favored (%)96.792.697.590.186.6Allowed (%)2.96.82.49.112.5Outliers (%)0.40.60.10.80.9Protein Data Bank code5DO05DPD5DNK5DOO5DPLa Indicates statistics for last resolution shell shown in parentheses.b Rsym = Σhkl,j (|Ihkl − 〈Ihkl〉|)/Σhkl,jIhkl where 〈Ihkl〉 is the average intensity for a set of j symmetry-related reflections and Ihkl is the value of the intensity for a single reflection within a set of symmetry-related reflections.c R-factor = Σhkl(‖Fo| − |Fc‖)/Σhkl|Fo| where Fo is the observed structure factor amplitude and Fc is the calculated structure factor amplitude.d Rfree = Σhkl,T(‖Fo| − |Fc‖)/Σhkl,T|Fo| where a test set, T (5% of the data), is omitted from the refinement.e Performed using MolProbity. Open table in a new tab The crystal structures of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 are shown in Fig. 2. The overall three-dimensional folds of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 are well conserved with a root mean square deviation of 1.51 Å (Fig. 2, A–C). The RpPKMT1 monomer contains four subdomains consisting of an N-terminal AdoMet binding domain (Tyr43–Asn179, Tyr261–Tyr286, and Arg318–Ile331), a dimerization domain (Thr180–Phe260 and Leu287–Arg317), a middle domain (Asn332–Arg447), and a C-terminal domain (Ser448–Val553) (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.B). The alignments of the secondary structure and the domain boundaries revealed in the crystal structure of RpPKMT1 with its amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. Similar to RpPKMT1, the RtPKMT2 monomer consists of an N-terminal AdoMet binding domain (Ala14–Thr152, Thr232–Phe258, and Arg289–Lys306), a dimerization domain (Leu153–Gly231 and Ile259–Lys290), a middle domain (Ile307–Thr416), and a C-terminal domain (Lys417–Gly534). The four domains are spatially arranged as an open palm where the AdoMet binding domain occupies the center of the palm, the dimerization domain orients as the thumb, and the middle and C-terminal domains together position as the fingers (Fig. 2B, right panel). The AdoMet binding domain in both structures contains a well conserved core Rossmann fold, characteristic of type 1 AdoMet-dependent MTs (31Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: a chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 share an open cleft located along the base of the AdoMet binding domain that may serve as the putative protein substrate binding site. A number of loops from each of the adjacent domains are ideally positioned to interact with protein substrates. The most prominent structural difference between RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 occurs in the C-terminal domain where RtPKMT2 contains an elongated loop (His440–Ser451) (Fig. 2, C and D). This extension is mediated by an insertion of six amino acid residues (Asn444–Met449) in RtPKMT2 as indicated in the sequence alignment in Fig. 1. Interestingly, this loop is located in close proximity to the AdoMet binding domain and may play a role in enzyme-substrate interactions. The RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 crystal structures are arranged as a 2-fold symmetric dimer mediated by the mostly helical dimerization domain (Fig. 2E). To determine whether the dimers observed in the crystal structures were the biological unit, size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering was performed. The data show that both PKMTs also exist as dimers in solution (Fig. 2F). The buried surface area of the dimers is 1540.6 and 1451.3 Å2 for RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2, respectively, with further stabilization from multiple hydrogen bonds along the dimer interface. The overall electrostatics of the two structures differ in various regions and may contribute to interactions with substrate; however, further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis (Fig. 2G). The crystal structures of RpPKMT1 bound with AdoMet or AdoHcy were solved by crystal soaking and co-crystallization experiments, respectively. Both ligands were found to bind within the AdoMet binding domain along the conserved Rossmann fold (Fig. 3A). The complex with AdoMet yielded a lower resolution structure with the AdoMet ligand showing disorder at the binding site as evidenced by poor density along the carboxyl end of the AdoMet molecule (Fig. 3B). However, the complex with AdoHcy was solved at 1.9-Å resolution with significantly more order in the ligand (Fig. 3C) and surrounding residues. Fig. 3D shows the network of amino acid residues in RpPKMT1 that interact with AdoHcy. Both ligands were found in extended conformations within the deep narrow elongated pocket formed along the base of the AdoMet binding domain (Fig. 3A). The methyl donor side of AdoHcy faces the open cleft, whereas the interior face interacts with the AdoMet binding domain. The structures of AdoHcy and AdoMet superimpose well, and therefore they both bind at essentially the same site in RpPKMT1. Furthermore, structural comparison of apo-RpPKMT1 with the AdoMet- and AdoHcy-bound complexes reveals few overall structural changes upon binding of the cofactor. Slight conformational changes in the side chains of Ser129 and Leu103 are observed moving toward the ligand as well as some slight changes along the dimerization interface. Overall no large domain shifts or conformational changes were observed between the apo and holo structures. The same results as RpPKMT1 were observed for RtPKMT2 in complex with AdoHcy. Structural analysis of RpPKMT1 and RtPKMT2 revealed that the six-residue insertion, Asn444–Met449, presents as an elongated loop in the C-terminal domain of RtPKMT2 (FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2.D). The location of the elongated loop in RtPKMT2 and the amino acid residues in the stick model are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. This loop is ideally positioned along the AdoMet binding site and can also potentially interact with the protein substrate (Fig. 4C). Because RpPKMT1 functions primarily as a monomethyltransferase and RtPKMT2 mainly catalyzes the trimethylation reaction, we hypothesized that this loop may account for the different methylation reactions catalyzed by the two PKMTs. Therefore, we explored the catalytic function of this loop first by deleting residues Asn444–Met449 in RtPKMT2 and second by inserting the Asn444–Met449 loop of RtPKMT2 into the corresponding location in RpPKMT1. Inserting the six-residue loop into RpPKMT1 showed a faster initial increase for the methylation process relative to that observed with the WT enzyme under the indicated experimental conditions (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows that deletion of residues Asn444–Met449 in RtPKMT2 led to an increase in the initial rate for the incorporation of the radioactive methyl group into the recombinant OmpB(AN) from [methyl-3H]AdoMet. The apparent catalytic and Michaelis-Menten constants of RpPKMT1, the loop-inserted RpPKMT1, RtPKMT2, and the loop-deleted RtPKMT2 were analyzed using much lower enzyme concentrations, and the results are shown in Table 2. These data reveal that loop insertion into RpPKMT1 did not alter much the values of kcat, whereas the value of Km was noticeably reduced. When the elongated loop was deleted from RtPKMT2, the values of both kcat and Km were elevated. Table 2 also shows that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the loop-containing methyltransferases is about 2-fold higher than that observed in the absence of the elongated loop. Note that the comparative analysis shown in Fig. 5, A and B, and the observed values of kcat shown in Table 2 indicate that the rate of the RpPKMT1-catalyzed monomethylation reaction is about 200-fold faster than that of RtPKMT2-catalyzed trimethylation reaction.FIGURE 5.Time courses of methylation and methylation profiles of OmpB catalyzed by PKMTs and their loop mutants. A, time courses of methylation catalyzed by the RpPKMT1 and loop-inserted RpPKMT1. Time courses of OmpB(AN) methylation catalyzed by RpPKMT1 (●) or loop-inserted RpPKMT1 (○) were monitored by the incorporation of radioactive [methyl-3H]AdoMet (0.16 mm) into 2 μm OmpB(AN) in 8.3 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0"

Although the targets of most of the first-line antibiotics have been identified, less research has focused on the intrabacterial stress responses that follow upon treatment with antibiotics. Studying the roles of these stress genes may lead to the identification of crucial stress-coping mechanisms that can provide additional drug targets to increase treatment efficacy. A three-gene operon with unknown function that is strongly up-regulated upon treatment with isoniazid and ethambutol is the iniBAC operon. We have reproduced these findings and show that iniBAC genes are also induced in infected host cells, although with higher variability. Next, we set out to elucidate the genetic network that results in iniBAC induction in Mycobacterium marinum. By transposon mutagenesis, we identified that the operon is highly induced by mutations in genes encoding enzymes of the vitamin B12 biosynthesis pathway and the vitamin B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA-mutase MutAB. Lipid analysis showed that a mutA::tn mutant has decreased phthiocerol dimycocerosates levels, suggesting a link between iniBAC induction and the production of methyl-branched lipids. Moreover, a similar screen in Mycobacterium bovis BCG identified that phthiocerol dimycocerosate biosynthesis mutants cause the up-regulation of iniBAC genes. Based on these data, we propose that iniBAC is induced in response to mutations that cause defects in the biosynthesis of methyl-branched lipids. The resulting metabolic stress caused by these mutations or caused by ethambutol or isoniazid treatment may be relieved by iniBAC to increase the chance of bacterial survival."
https://openalex.org/W2489501352,"microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is a common feature of cancer cells, but the complex roles of miRNAs in cancer are not fully elucidated. Here, we used functional genomics to identify oncogenic miRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer and evaluate their impact on response to epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-targeting therapy. Our data demonstrate that miRNAs with an AAGUGC motif in their seed sequence increase both cancer cell proliferation and sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Global transcriptomics, proteomics and target prediction resulted in the identification of several tumor suppressors involved in the G1/S transition as AAGUGC-miRNA targets. The clinical implications of our findings were evaluated by analysis of AAGUGC-miRNA expression in multiple cancer types, supporting the link between this miRNA seed family, their tumor suppressor targets and cancer cell proliferation. In conclusion, we propose the AAGUGC seed motif as an oncomotif and that oncomotif-miRNAs promote cancer cell proliferation. These findings have potential therapeutic implications, especially in selecting patients for EGFR-targeting therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2498995883,"Social context, specifically within the family, influences adolescent eating behaviours and thus their health. Little is known about the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of parental feeding practices on eating. We explored relationships between parental feeding practices and adolescent eating habits and brain activity in response to viewing food images. Fifty- seven adolescents (15 with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 21 obese and 21 healthy weight controls) underwent fMRI scanning whilst viewing images of food or matched control images. Participants completed the Kids Child Feeding Questionnaire, the Childrens’ Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) and took part in an observed meal. Parents completed the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionniare and the DEBQ. We were particularly interested in brain activity in response to food cues that was modulated by different feeding and eating styles. Healthy-weight participants increased activation (compared to the other groups) to food in proportion to the level of parental restriction in visual areas of the brain such as right lateral occipital cortex (LOC), right temporal occipital cortex, left occipital fusiform gyrus, left lateral and superior LOC. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus had higher activation (compared to the other groups) with increased parental restrictive feeding in areas relating to emotional control, attention and decision-making, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, frontal operculum and right middle frontal gyrus. Participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus also showed higher activation (compared to the other groups) in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus and angular gyrus when they also reported higher self restraint. Parental restriction did not modulate food responses in obese participants, but there was increased activity in visual (visual cortex, left LOC, left occipital fusiform gyrus) and reward related brain areas (thalamus and parietal operculum) in response to parental teaching and modelling of behaviour. Parental restrictive feeding and parental teaching and modelling affected neural responses to food cues in different ways, depending on motivations and diagnoses, illustrating a social influence on neural responses to food cues."
https://openalex.org/W2484612406,"Background The identification of breakpoints involved in chromosomal damage could help to detect genes involved in genetic disorders, most notably cancer. Until now, only one published study, carried out by our group, has identified chromosome bands affected by exposure to oil from an oil spill. In that study, which was performed two years after the initial oil exposure in individuals who had participated in clean-up tasks following the wreck of the Prestige, three chromosomal bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31) were found to be especially prone to breakage. A recent follow-up study, performed on the same individuals, revealed that the genotoxic damage had persisted six years after oil exposure. Objectives To determine whether there exist chromosome bands which are especially prone to breakages and to know if there is some correlation with those detected in the previous study. In addition, to investigate if the DNA repair problems detected previously persist in the present study. Design Follow-up study performed six years after the Prestige oil spill. Setting Fishermen cooperatives in coastal villages. Participants Fishermen highly exposed to oil spill who participated in previous genotoxic study six years after the oil. Measurements Chromosome damage in peripheral lymphocytes. For accurate identification of the breakpoints involved in chromosome damage of circulating lymphocytes, a sequential stain/G-banding technique was employed. To determine the most break-prone chromosome bands, two statistical methods, the Fragile Site Multinomial and the chi-square tests (where the bands were corrected by their length) were used. To compare the chromosome lesions, structural chromosome alterations and gaps/breaks between two groups of individuals we used the GEE test which takes into account a possible within-individual correlation. Dysfunctions in DNA repair mechanisms, expressed as chromosome damage, were assessed in cultures with aphidicolin by the GEE test. Results Cytogenetic analyses were performed in 47 exposed individuals. A total of 251 breakpoints in exposed individuals) were identified, showing a non-uniform distribution in the human ideogram. Ten chromosome bands were found to be especially prone to breakage through both statistical methods. By comparing these bands with those observed in certain exposed individuals who had already participated the previous study, it was found in both studies that four bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31 and 17p11.2) are particularly sensitive to breakage. Additionally, the dysfunction in DNA repair mechanisms was not significantly higher in oil-exposed individuals than in non-exposed individuals. Limitations The sample size and the possibility of some kind of selection bias should be considered. Genotoxic results cannot be extrapolated to the high number of individuals who participated occasionally in clean-up tasks. Conclusion Our findings show the existence of at least four target bands (2q21, 3q27, 5q31 and 17p11.2) with a greater propensity to break over time after an acute exposure to oil. The breaks in these bands, which are commonly involved in hematological cancer, may explain the increase of cancer risk reported in chronically benzene-exposed individuals. In addition, a more efficiency of the DNA repair mechanisms has been detected six years after in fishermen who were highly exposed to the oil spill. To date, only this study, performed by our group on the previous and present genotoxic effects, has analyzed the chromosomal regions affected by breakage after an acute oil exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2483462088,"The mirid bug Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dür), a polyphagous pest, is dependent on olfactory cues to locate various host plant species and mates. In this study, we traced the projection pathway of the antennal sensory neurons and visualized their projection patterns in the central nervous system of A. lucorum through confocal microscopy and digital reconstructions. We also examined the glomerular organization of the primary olfactory center of the brain, the antennal lobe, and created a three-dimensional model of the glomeruli. We found that the axons of the sensory neurons project into the brain via the ipsilateral antennal nerve, and descend further into the gnathal ganglion, prothoracic ganglion, mesothoracic ganglion, and metathoracic ganglion, and reach as far as to the abdominal ganglion. Such a projection pattern indicates that antennal sensory neurons of A. lucorum may be potentially directly connected to motor neurons. The antennal lobe, however, is the major target area of antennal sensory neurons. The antennal lobe is composed of a large number of glomeruli, i.e. 70-80 glomeruli in one AL of A. lucorum. The results of this study which provide information about the basic anatomical arrangement of the brain olfactory center of A. lucorum, are important for further investigations of chemosensory encoding mechanisms of the mirid bug."
https://openalex.org/W2501894396,"Since the recent devastating outbreak of Ebola virus disease in western Africa, there has been significant effort to understand the evolution of the deadly virus that caused the outbreak. There has been a considerable investment in sequencing Ebola virus (EBOV) isolates, and the results paint an important picture of how the virus has spread in western Africa. EBOV evolution cannot be understood outside the context of previous outbreaks, however. We have focused this study on the evolution of the EBOV glycoprotein gene (GP) because one of its products, the spike glycoprotein (GP1,2), is central to the host immune response and because it contains a large amount of the phylogenetic signal for this virus. We inferred the maximum likelihood phylogeny of 96 nonredundant GP gene sequences representing each of the outbreaks since 1976 up to the end of 2014. We tested for positive selection and considered the placement of adaptive amino acid substitutions along the phylogeny and within the protein structure of GP1,2. We conclude that: 1) the common practice of rooting the phylogeny of EBOV between the first known outbreak in 1976 and the next outbreak in 1995 provides a misleading view of EBOV evolution that ignores the fact that there is a non-human EBOV host between outbreaks; 2) the N-terminus of GP1 may be constrained from evolving in response to the host immune system by the highly expressed, secreted glycoprotein, which is encoded by the same region of the GP gene; 3) although the mucin-like domain of GP1 is essential for EBOV in vivo, it evolves rapidly without losing its twin functions: providing O-linked glycosylation sites and a flexible surface."
https://openalex.org/W2485681905,"Pigs provide outstanding models of human genetic diseases due to their striking similarities with human anatomy, physiology and genetics. Although transgenic pigs have been produced using genetically modified somatic cells and nuclear transfer (SCNT), the cloning efficiency was extremely low. Here, we report an improved method to produce diploid cloned embryos from porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs), which were synchronized to the G2/M stage using a double blocking method with aphidicolin and nocodazole. The efficiency of this synchronization method on our piPSC lines was first tested. Then, we modified our traditional SCNT protocol to find a workable protocol. In particular, the removal of a 6DMAP treatment post-activation enhanced the extrusion rate of pseudo-second-polar bodies (p2PB) (81.3% vs. 15.8%, based on peak time, 4hpa). Moreover, an immediate activation method yielded significantly more blastocysts than delayed activation (31.3% vs. 16.0%, based on fused embryos). The immunofluorescent results confirmed the effect of the 6DMAP treatment removal, showing remarkable p2PB extrusion during a series of nuclear transfer procedures. The reconstructed embryos from metaphase piPSCs with our modified protocol demonstrated normal morphology at 2-cell, 4-cell and blastocyst stages and a high rate of normal karyotype. This study demonstrated a new and efficient way to produce viable cloned embryos from piPSCs when synchronized to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which may lead to opportunities to produce cloned pigs from piPSCs more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2495126374,"The visual system is able to recognize a scene based on a sketch made of very simple features. This ability is likely crucial for survival, when fast image recognition is necessary, and it is believed that a primal sketch is extracted very early in the visual processing. Such highly simplified representations can be sufficient for accurate object discrimination, but an open question is the role played by color in this process. Rich color information is available in natural scenes, yet artist's sketches are usually monochromatic; and, black-and-white movies provide compelling representations of real world scenes. Also, the contrast sensitivity of color is low at fine spatial scales. We approach the question from the perspective of optimal information processing by a system endowed with limited computational resources. We show that when such limitations are taken into account, the intrinsic statistical properties of natural scenes imply that the most effective strategy is to ignore fine-scale color features and devote most of the bandwidth to gray-scale information. We find confirmation of these information-based predictions from psychophysics measurements of fast-viewing discrimination of natural scenes. We conclude that the lack of colored features in our visual representation, and our overall low sensitivity to high-frequency color components, are a consequence of an adaptation process, optimizing the size and power consumption of our brain for the visual world we live in."
