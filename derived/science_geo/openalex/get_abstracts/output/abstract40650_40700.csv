https://openalex.org/W2080835064,"The nature and position of transcriptional control elements responsible for the expression of genes encoded by the retrovirus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have not been precisely defined. In this study it is shown that the mammalian Sp1 transcription factor binds to promoter sequences within the AIDS retrovirus long terminal repeat (LTR) and activates RNA synthesis five- to eightfold in reconstituted reactions in vitro. Experiments in which regions of DNA were protected from added reagents by specifically bound proteins (footprinting) indicated that the upstream promoter region of the AIDS virus LTR lies between -45 and -77 (relative to the RNA start site, +1) and contains three tandem, closely spaced SP1 binding sites of variable affinity. Base-substitution mutations targeted to one or all three Sp1 binding sites were found both to eliminate the binding of Sp1 and to cause up to a tenfold reduction in transcriptional efficiency in vitro. These findings suggest that one important component of the AIDS virus transcriptional control region interacts with a cellular transcription factor, Sp1, and that this factor must function in conjunction with transcriptional elements located downstream of the RNA cap site to mediate the response of the LTR to viral trans-activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077228061,"Antigen or mitogen-induced activation of resting T cells induces the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as well as the expression of specific cell surface receptors for this lymphokine. Failure of the production of either IL-2 or its receptor results in a failure of the T-cell immune response. The receptor is composed of a 33,000-dalton (251-amino acid) peptide precursor that is post-translationally glycosylated into the mature 55,000-dalton form. In contrast to resting T cells, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia cells constitutively express large numbers of IL-2 receptors. Because IL-2 receptors are present on the malignant T cells but not on normal resting cells, clinical trials have been initiated in which patients with adult T-cell leukemia are treated with a monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1987395633,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor are important in the development of cells derived from the neural crest. Mouse L cell transformants have been generated that stably express the human NGF receptor gene transfer with total human DNA. Affinity cross-linking, metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, and equilibrium binding with 125I-labeled NGF revealed that this NGF receptor had the same size and binding characteristics as the receptor from human melanoma cells and rat PC12 cells. The sequences encoding the NGF receptor were molecularly cloned using the human Alu repetitive sequence as a probe. A cosmid clone that contained the human NGF receptor gene allowed efficient transfection and expression of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2051840801,A chemically synthesized peptide consisting essentially of two separate regions (residues 141 to 158 and 200 to 213) of a virus coat protein (VP1) from the 01 Kaufbeuren strain of foot-and-mouth disease virus was prepared free of any carrier protein. It elicited high levels of neutralizing antibody and protected cattle against intradermolingual challenge by inoculation with infectious virus. Comparative evaluation of this peptide with a single-site peptide (residues 141 to 158) in guinea pigs suggests the importance of the VP1 carboxyl terminal residues in enhancing the protective response.
https://openalex.org/W2047899601,"The in vitro synthesized precursor of the alpha-factor pheromone, prepro-alpha-factor, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was translocated across yeast microsomal membranes in either a homologous or a wheat germ cell free system. Translocated prepro-alpha-factor was glycosylated, sedimented with yeast microsomal vesicles, and was protected from digestion by added protease, but was soluble after alkaline sodium carbonate treatment. Thus prepro-alpha-factor was properly sequestered within yeast microsomal vesicles, but was not integrated into the lipid bilayer. In marked contrast to protein translocation across mammalian microsomal membranes, translocation of prepro-alpha-factor across yeast microsomal membranes could occur posttranslationally. This reaction required protein components in the yeast microsomal fraction that could be inactivated by alkylation or proteolysis, was ATP-dependent, and was insensitive to the presence of a variety of uncouplers and ionophores."
https://openalex.org/W2002873026,"We present evidence that the SV40 enhancer consists of three functional units, A, B, and C, each of which can cooperate with the others or with duplicates of itself to enhance transcription. We show that, when element C, containing the core consensus sequence, is inactivated by point mutations, revertants with restored enhancer function contain duplications of either one or both of the elements A and B. To search for additional elements, we isolated revertants of a mutant with the three elements mutated. These revertants do not identify any other elements; instead, enhancer function is effectively restored by ""double duplications,"" in which the first duplication event either partially or entirely recreates one of the three elements A, B, and C and the second duplication then creates two copies of the newly created sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1632355607,"Reactivities of chromium compounds with DNA were investigated by the DNA sequencing technique using 32P 5'-end-labeled DNA fragments, and the reaction mechanism was investigated by ESR spectroscopy. Incubation of double-stranded DNA with sodium chromate(VI) plus hydrogen peroxide or potassium tetraperoxochromate(V) led to the cleavage at the position of every base, particularly of guanine. Even without piperidine, the formation of oligonucleotides was observed, suggesting the breakage of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone. ESR studies using hydroxyl radical traps demonstrated that hydroxyl radical is generated both during the reaction of sodium chromate(VI) with hydrogen peroxide and the decomposition of potassium tetraperoxochromate(V), and that hydroxyl radical reacts significantly not only with mononucleotides but also with deoxyribose 5-phosphate. ESR studies using a singlet oxygen trap demonstrated that singlet oxygen is also generated both by the same reaction and decomposition, and reacts significantly with deoxyguanylate, but scarcely reacts with other mononucleotides. Furthermore, ESR studies suggested that tetraperoxochromate(V) is formed by the reaction of sodium chromate(VI) with hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that sodium chromate(VI) reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form tetraperoxochromate(V), leading to the production of the hydroxyl radical, which causes every base alteration and deoxyribose-phosphate backbone breakage. In addition, sodium chromate(VI) plus hydrogen peroxide generates singlet oxygen, which subsequently oxidizes the guanine residue. The mechanism by which both hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen are generated during the reaction of sodium chromate(VI) with hydrogen peroxide was presented. Finally, the possibility that this reaction may be one of the primary reactions of carcinogenesis induced by chromate(VI) is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019065642,"The E. coli ada gene positively controls its own expression and that of other genes (alkA, alkB, aidB) involved in repair of DNA alkylation damage. The cloned ada and alkA genes and purified Ada protein have been used in cell-free systems to identify the inducing signal. Self-methylation of the Ada protein by transfer of a methyl group from a phosphotriester in alkylated DNA to a cysteine residue in the protein converts it to an activator of transcription. The covalently modified Ada protein binds specifically to promoter regions containing the sequence d(AAANNAAAGCGCA) immediately upstream of the RNA polymerase binding sites. This is apparently the first example of conversion of a regulatory gene product to a transcriptional activator by a posttranslational modification event."
https://openalex.org/W2111800688,"Blood clotting factor IX is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide that would be expected to be proteolytically cleaved in at least two positions during maturation to remove the prepeptide and propeptide regions. We show that a point mutation causing hemophilia B changes the amino acid at position -4 in the propeptide region of factor IX from an arginine to a glutamine, which results in the expression of a stable longer protein with 18 additional amino acids of the N-terminal propeptide region still attached. This suggests that in the normal maturation of factor IX the signal peptidase cleaves the peptide bond between amino acid residues -18 and -19, generating an unstable profactor IX intermediate. Further proteolytic processing to the mature factor IX depends on the arginine residue at -4. The significance of the homologous arginine residue in other processed proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2056871573,"The virion envelope glycoprotein gp85 confers a high degree of subgroup specificity for interaction with distinct cell receptors. Specific subgroups of gp85 have been associated with a cytopathic virus-cell interaction, most likely resulting from reduced resistance to superinfection, which allows the buildup of excessive amounts of viral DNA. Previous nucleotide sequence analysis of the gp85 coding region identified small regions of variable amino acid sequence within a conserved framework. To define the role of these variable regions we constructed a series of molecular clones carrying novel combinations of variable regions from viruses. Analysis of rescued virus shows that receptor binding is determined by the interaction of two major regions and one minor region in the middle of gp85. Cytopathogenicity is not associated with any specific variable region but rather with the ability to recognize the subgroup B receptor on chicken cells."
https://openalex.org/W2099125391,"The v-erbB, v-src, v-fps, v-sea, and v-Ha-ras oncogenes induce avian erythroid progenitor cells to self-renew in an erythropoietin-independent manner. These transformed erythroblasts retain both their capacity to differentiate into erythrocytes and their requirement for complex growth media. However, previous studies showed that erythroblasts transformed by v-erbB plus v-erbA (which by itself is not oncogenic) are blocked in differentiation and grow in standard media. Here we show that the introduction of v-erbA into erythroblasts transformed with v-src, v-fps, v-sea, or v-Ha-ras likewise induces a fully transformed phenotype. It also reduces the capacity of ts sea- and ts erbB-transformed erythroblasts to differentiate terminally in an erythropoietin-dependent manner after a temperature shift. Cooperativity involving v-erbA also occurs in vivo since chicks infected with a retroviral construct encoding v-erbA and v-src develop both acute erythroblastosis and sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W1536629235,"The relationship of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange to the chemotactic responsiveness of human neutrophils was investigated. The pHi changes, measured from the equilibrium distribution of 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, were correlated with the migratory behavior of the cells as assessed by the leading front method. Exposure of cells to 10 nM FMLP caused activation of Na+/H+ exchange, leading to a rise in pHi from approximately 7.25 to approximately 7.75. This intracellular alkalinization was inhibited by amiloride and by three more potent analogues. All four compounds reduced the chemotactic response to FMLP with apparent Ki values similar to those for inhibition of the pHi transients, thereby suggesting that the blocking effect of the drugs on directed cell migration was related to inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange. The effect was specific for stimulated cell locomotion: FMLP-induced chemotaxis and chemokinesis were inhibited in parallel, whereas random motility was unimpaired. The relationship of pHi to function was also studied as the pHi of FMLP-activated cells was varied between 6.8 and 8.6 by altering the chemical gradients for Na+ and H+ across the cell membrane. There was a direct, positive correlation between the pHi value attained following FMLP-stimulation and the locomotor response to a chemotactic gradient. These results indicate that the motile functions of human neutrophils can be regulated by their pHi."
https://openalex.org/W1602344919,"Efficient delivery of hydrophobic water-insoluble substrates and cofactors to membrane-bound enzymes is a recurring problem which has impeded kinetic analyses. Kinetic analysis of the Escherichia coli sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase, an extremely hydrophobic integral membrane protein of 122 residues, was facilitated by the development of a mixed micellar assay. beta-Octyl glucoside micelles quantitatively solubilized diacylglycerol kinase from membranes of strains which overproduced the enzyme up to 250-fold and provided an effective method to disperse and deliver the hydrophobic water-insoluble substrate, sn-1,2-dioleoyglycerol. Diacylglycerol kinase was active in mixed micelles containing octyl glucoside and dioleoyglycerol. Several phospholipids stimulated activity up to 6-fold, suggesting a cofactor function. Activation by phospholipids was not stereospecific and was mimicked partially by fatty acids. Half-maximal activation was observed at 1 mol % cardiolipin, suggesting that a small number of phospholipids are sufficient to activate the enzyme. Activity was dependent on the mole fractions of dioleoylglycerol and phospholipid in the mixed micelles, but independent of micelle number. Several lines of evidence indicated that the transfer of diacylglycerol between micelles was much more rapid than its utilization by the enzyme. Diacylglycerol kinase exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to diacylglycerol and MgATP. A second Mg2+ ion (in addition to MgATP) was required for activity. When Mg2+ was excluded from the assay, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Co2+ supported activity to lesser extents. These data establish a suitable system for in-depth kinetic analysis of the E. coli diacylglycerol kinase and its phospholipid cofactor requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2080892216,"The Syrian cardiomyopathic hamster has a hereditary disease in which a progressive myocardial necrosis mimics human forms of cardiac hypertrophy. Lesions are associated with calcium overload and can be prevented with the calcium antagonist verapamil. Numbers of receptor binding sites for calcium antagonists in heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle were markedly increased in cardiomyopathic hamsters. The uptake of calcium-45 into brain synaptosomes was also increased in cardiomyopathic hamsters. The increase in calcium antagonist receptors and related voltage-sensitive calcium channels may be involved in the pathogenesis of this cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1479988478,"Two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to detect a protein (ic) synthesized in rat corpus luteum cells in response to acute stimulation by human chorionic gonadotropin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. This induced protein ic is isoelectric at pH 6.5 (isoelectric focusing) and has an apparent molecular weight of 28,000 (sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis). The human chorionic gonadotropin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP dose response and time course of synthesis of the protein parallel those of progesterone synthesis in stimulated luteal cells. Additionally, cycloheximide, which inhibits the increase in progesterone formation caused by human chorionic gonadotropin or cAMP, also inhibits the synthesis of ic. Proteolytic polypeptide mapping suggests that ic has a very similar primary structure to another protein (pc), which has the same molecular weight as ic, differs from ic in pI, and is synthesized only in unstimulated cells. These polypeptide maps also demonstrate the close similarity of pc and ic to two proteins p and i, synthesized in control and in adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated rat adrenal cortex cells, respectively (Krueger, R. J. and Orme-Johnson, N. R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10159-10167). In both adrenal cortex and corpus luteum, binding of a tissue-specific polypeptide hormone acts via cAMP to cause increased steroidogenesis and induction of the synthesis of protein i (ic), with the same time course and hormone dose dependence. Also in both tissues, inhibition of protein synthesis at the level of translation (e.g. by cycloheximide addition) causes inhibition of i (ic) synthesis and of stimulated steroid production. This close correlation between the two different tissues in conditions which cause induction of the synthesis of these proteins suggests that the proteins may be common intermediaries in the control by polypeptide hormones of steroidogenesis in endocrine tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1607018086,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretory process was studied by evaluating secretion efficiency, processing efficiency, and the efficiency of protein folding for hybrid proteins containing the yeast prepro-alpha-factor leader region. Secretion of three proteins, beta-endorphin, calcitonin, and a consensus alpha-interferon (IFN-Con1), were compared in terms of secretion efficiency into the culture medium, beta-Endorphin and calcitonin, both small proteins, were found to be efficiently secreted from logarithmically grown cells. In contrast, the larger IFN-Con1 accumulated in the periplasmic space and cell wall. The glycosylated, unprocessed prepro-alpha-factor/IFN-Con1 fusion protein was also found to be secreted into the culture medium. The presence of (Glu-Ala) dipeptides in the alpha-factor spacer peptide increased the efficiency of cleavage at Lys-Arg in the prepro-alpha-factor/IFN-Con1 protein fusion. Purified secreted IFN-Con1 was structurally characterized to determine the effect of passage through the yeast secretory pathway on the fidelity and efficiency of protein folding. The disulfide structure of the secreted protein was found to be identical with that reported for the native human alpha-interferons."
https://openalex.org/W2016621398,"Two crystal structures of deamino-oxytocin have been determined at better than 1.1A resolution from isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering x-ray measurements. In each of two crystal forms there are two closely related conformers with disulfide bridges of different chirality, which may be important in receptor recognition and activation."
https://openalex.org/W1573628824,"We investigated interactions of phosphonoformic acid (PFA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), and other phosphonyl derivatives with the Na+ gradient [Na+ extravesicular greater than Na+ intravesicular; Nao+ greater than Na+i]-dependent transport system for phosphate (Pi) in renal cortical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). PFA and PAA inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the Na+ gradient [Na+o greater than Na+i]-dependent uptake of Pi by rat kidney BBMV. PFA was a more potent inhibitor than PAA while phosphonopropionic acid, hydroxymethylphosphonic acid, and phenylphosphonic acid had no effect on Pi transport. The inhibitory effect of PFA was competitive (Ki approximately equal to 4.6 X 10(-4) M) and reversible upon dilution. The uptake of Pi by BBMV in the absence of Na+ gradient [Nao+ = Na+i] was also inhibited by PFA. The PFA had no effect on uptake of L-[3H]proline, D-[3H]glucose, or 22Na+ by BBMV nor did it alter intravesicular volume of BBMV. The relative (%) extent of inhibition by PFA was not altered by changes in the extravesicular pH or changes in the steepness of the Na+ gradient [Nao+ greater than Na+i]. The inhibition of PFA was analogous in renal BBMV from rats, mice, rabbits, or dogs. Unlike other known inhibitors of brush border membrane (BBM) transport of Pi, e.g. arsenate, NAD, and ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate, PFA and PAA had no inhibitory effect on BBM-bound or solubilized alkaline phosphatase. Also, PFA did not interfere with the activity of renal cortical (Na-K)ATPase. Administration of PFA (0.5 g/kg/day, intraperitoneally) to thyroparathyroidectomized rats fed a low Pi diet elicited an increase in urinary excretion of Pi, but did not change the excretion of Na+, K, and Ca2+. The results show that the PFA, and to a lesser degree PAA, are specific competitive inhibitors of the Na+-Pi cotransport in renal cortical BBM and are suitable probes for studies of this transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1562574479,"A series of halodibenzo-p-dioxins with the photolabile aryl azide functional group were synthesized and screened as potential photoaffinity labels for the Ah receptor, and 2-azido-3-iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin was selected for radiosynthesis with 125I (specific activity 2176 Ci/mmol, equilibrium dissociation constant, KD = 0.76 nM). Following incubation of this 125I-labeled photoaffinity ligand with the protamine sulfate-precipitated fraction of C57BL/6J mouse liver cytosol, and irradiation with long wavelength ultraviolet light, the radiolabeled macromolecules were precipitated with acetone and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Among the labeled products, two peptides with apparent molecular masses of 95,000 and 70,000 daltons had the following properties: 1) they were selectively labeled at low ligand concentrations; 2) they were labeled in approximately a 1:1 ratio; 3) co-incubation with receptor agonists inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of both peptides to a similar extent, and structure activity relationship for inhibition of labeling by these agonists corresponded to that for their binding affinity to the Ah receptor; 4) upon nondenaturing chromatographic separation of photoaffinity labeled cytosol on high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion and anion exchange columns, the 95- and 70-kDa peptides coelute; 5) the migration of these peptides upon denaturing electrophoresis is the same in the presence or absence of a thiol reducing agent; and 6) proteolysis of the 95- and 70-kDa peptides produces a similar pattern of cleavage peptides. The simplest structure of the Ah receptor in mouse liver cytosol, appears to be a dimer composed of two noncovalently linked subunits of apparent molecular masses of 95 and 70 kDa, which have homologous structure and similar ligand binding sites, but other possibilities are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1963633345,"The human N-myc gene is related to the c-myc proto-oncogene, and has been shown to have transforming potential in vitro. Many studies have reported amplification of N-myc in human neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma cell lines. In primary tumors, amplification of the gene was found to correlate directly with behavior of the tumor. Specific restriction fragments of a partial complementary DNA clone of N-myc from LA-N-5 human neuroblastoma cells were placed into a bacterial expression vector for the purpose of producing antigens representative of the N-myc protein. Rabbits immunized with these antigens produced antisera that recognized a protein of 62-64 kilodaltons in neuroblastoma cells. By several criteria, this protein appears to be part of the same proto-oncogene family as the c-myc protein. Moreover, the antisera to fragments of this protein were capable of histochemically identifying malignant cells in clinical specimens."
https://openalex.org/W1551303136,"It is generally accepted that ATP is required for intracellular protein breakdown. Reticulocytes contain a soluble ATP-dependent pathway for the degradation of highly abnormal proteins and for the elimination of certain proteins during cell maturation. Reticulocytes and erythrocytes also selectively degrade proteins damaged by oxidation. When these cells were exposed to oxidants, such as phenylhydrazine or nitrite, they showed a large increase in protein breakdown. This oxidant-induced proteolysis was not inhibited in cells depleted of ATP. However, ATP depletion did prevent the degradation of pre-existent cell proteins. In reticulocyte extracts, phenylhydrazine-treated hemoglobin is also degraded rapidly by an ATP-independent process, unlike endogenous proteins and many exogenous polypeptides. This lack of an ATP requirement means that the degradation of oxidant-damaged proteins does not require ligation to ubiquitin (even though phenylhydrazine treatment does make hemoglobin a very good substrate for ubiquitin conjugation). In many respects, the pathway for breakdown of oxidant-treated hemoglobin differs from the ATP-dependent process. The latter has a much higher activation energy than the degradation of oxidized proteins. The ATP-dependent process is inhibited by hemin, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, diisopropylfluorophosphate and N-ethylmaleimide. The ATP-independent pathway is less sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, hemin, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and is not affected by diisopropylfluorophosphate. In addition, only the ATP-dependent proteolytic process is inactivated by dilution or incubation at 37 degrees C in the absence of nucleotides. Reticulocytes thus contain multiple soluble systems for degrading proteins and can rapidly hydrolyze certain types of abnormal proteins by either an ATP-independent or ATP-dependent process. Erythrocytes lack the ATP-dependent process present in reticulocytes; however, erythrocytes retain the capacity to degrade oxidant-damaged hemoglobin. These two processes probably are active in the elimination of different types of abnormal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1913743281,"We have used a myosin heavy chain gene fragment to probe two chicken genomic libraries. The fragment, derived from a gene expressed in the fast-white fibers of adult chickens, contains 1400 bases upstream from the translational start site and 1600 bases downstream from the initiation codon. Thirty-one unique nonoverlapping clones were isolated. All of the genes showed homologies in the nucleotide sequences which code for the globular head portion of the myosin protein while no extensive homologies were detected in the 5'-flanking sequences. The relationships between the genes were studied using oligomeric sequences as probes. The hybridization patterns showed that seven of the genes fall within a well defined subgroup. The exon containing a domain of the nucleotide (ATP) binding site was sequenced for all seven of these genes and shown to be, except for 2 nucleotides in one of the genes, completely conserved. The lack of sequence conservation in the 5'-nontranslated portions of the genes was exploited in the preparation of transcript-specific probes. We have used these probes to show that two of the isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific manner in the chicken."
https://openalex.org/W1577807210,"We have isolated a gene coding for a sulfur-rich zein protein from a maize genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of this gene predicts a protein composed of 180 amino acids, including a 20-amino acid signal peptide. As is true of other zeins, there are no intervening sequences in the gene. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this gene with that of a homologous cDNA clone revealed only a single difference resulting in a valine/alanine substitution. The Mr 15,000 zein contains no repetitive nucleotide sequences and shows no homology with genes encoding the Mr 22,000 and 19,000 zeins. Circular dichroism analysis of the Mr 15,000 zein protein revealed that it is composed primarily of beta and turn structures. This gene has a short region of nucleotide sequence homology to the cysteine-rich domain of the Mr 27,000 zein, as well as the cysteine-containing barley B-hordein."
https://openalex.org/W1563317426,"Photodynamic modification of DNA by hematoporphyrin (Hp) was characterized by the DNA sequencing technique using 32P-labeled DNA fragments, and the reaction mechanism was investigated by ESR spectroscopy. Mild photodynamic treatment of single-stranded DNA with Hp induced an alteration of guanine residues, and subsequent treatment with piperidine led to chain cleavages at each guanine residue. On the other hand, methylene blue plus light modified the guanine residues in both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. ESR studies using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone as singlet oxygen traps demonstrated that Hp plus light produced almost the same amount of singlet oxygen as methylene blue plus light and that the photochemically generated singlet oxygen reacts significantly with guanylate but only slightly with other mononucleotides. An ESR spin destruction method revealed that photoexcited Hp generated porphyrin radical, but guanylate did not react with this radical. These results indicate that photoexcited Hp reacts with oxygen to generate singlet oxygen which oxidizes the guanine residues of single-stranded DNA and that the difference in photoreactivities of DNA with Hp and methylene blue may be explained in terms of the structural difference in their intercalating abilities."
https://openalex.org/W1518877783,"alpha-Thrombin, a potent mitogen for the hamster fibroblast cell line CCL 39, stimulates by approximately 3-fold 86Rb+ uptake in a mutant lacking the Na+/H+ antiport activity (PS 120). The major component of this stimulated 86Rb+ (K+) uptake is a bumetanide-sensitive flux (IC50 = 0.4 microM), which accounts for 50% of total K+ uptake in Go-arrested cells and is approximately 4-fold stimulated by maximal thrombin concentrations (EC50 = 5 X 10(-4) units/ml). This bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake represents a Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport, as indicated by its dependence on extracellular Na+ and Cl- and by the existence in PS 120 cells of a bumetanide-sensitive K+-dependent 22Na+ uptake. The stimulation reaches its maximum within 2 min, is reduced at acidic intracellular pH values (half-maximal at pHi = 6.8), and can also be induced, to a lesser extent, by EGF and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, the effects of which are nearly additive. In contrast, preincubation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate results in inhibition of thrombin- and EGF-induced stimulations, suggesting that activated protein kinase C might exert a feedback inhibitory control. This study clearly demonstrates that the growth factor-induced activation of the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport is separated from the activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. However, activation of this cotransporter does not seem to play a major role in the mitogenic signaling pathway since its complete inhibition with bumetanide reduces only by 25-30% reinitiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1596012657,"The complete sequence of the rat parvalbumin mRNA was determined by sequencing a near full length cDNA clone and a primer extension product of the 5' untranslated region of this clone. The parvalbumin sequence contained 72 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region, 333 nucleotides of the coding sequence, and 183 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated sequence in the case of the shorter parvalbumin messenger RNA or 556 nucleotides in the case of the larger parvalbumin messenger RNA. The two RNAs were derived from a single primary transcript since two clones were sequenced which were identical except for the site of polyadenylation. The polyadenylation signal of the shorter, more abundant RNA was AATAAA while the putative signal for the larger RNA was GATAAA. A 32-base pair sequence comprising part of the 5' untranslated region and the first seven codons of the parvalbumin cDNA was 81% homologous to a region of the chicken calmodulin cDNA encoding part of the first Ca2+-binding domain. This homology indicates that this portion of the parvalbumin mRNA may have evolved from a primordial first domain. A parvalbumin genomic clone which hybridized to probes derived from both the coding and 3' untranslated region of the cDNA was cloned from a rat genomic library. Partial sequencing identified an uninterrupted stretch of 585 base pairs identical to the 3' end of the parvalbumin cDNA. Two introns were localized in the genomic clone. Their position with respect to the parvalbumin amino acid sequence corresponded to the intron locations found in genes of several other Ca2+-binding proteins. This result indicates that, despite the deletion of one Ca2+-binding domain, the remainder of the parvalbumin gene has maintained the structural pattern of the Ca2+-binding protein gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1594959615,"Abstract We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the rat apolipoprotein (apo-) A-IV gene and analyzed its structural and evolutionary relationships to the human apolipoprotein A-I, E, and C-III genes. The rat A-IV gene is 2.4 kilobases in size and consists of three exons (142, 126, and 1157 base pairs) interrupted by two introns (277 and 673 base pairs). The 5'-nontranslated region and most of the signal peptide are encoded by the first exon. Thus, the apo-A-IV gene lacks an intron in the 5'-nontranslated region of its mRNA in contrast to all other known apolipoprotein genes. Sequences coding for amphipathic docosapeptides span both the second and third exons of the rat A-IV gene. We demonstrate that this is also true for the human apolipoprotein genes. This gene family seems to have evolved by the duplication of an ancestral minigene that resulted in the formation of two exons. Thereafter, evolution of these sequences was dominated by intraexonic amplification of repeating units coding for amphipathic peptides. Sequence divergence of these repeats resulted in the functional differentiation of the apolipoproteins. However, conservation of the fundamental amphipathic pattern allowed members of this protein family to retain their lipid-binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W1489425218,"The nucleotide affinity analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (FSBA) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of ADP-mediated platelet activation. Utilizing this compound, the role of ADP in epinephrine-mediated platelet activation was evaluated. Pretreatment of platelets with FSBA under conditions producing covalent incorporation was able to completely block epinephrine-stimulated aggregation of human platelets. In addition, the exposure of latent fibrinogen-binding sites by epinephrine was also inhibited in platelets modified by FSBA. The inhibition of epinephrine-mediated activation of the cells was time dependent, reflecting the need for covalent modification of the ADP receptor by FSBA. The inhibitory effect of FSBA was not due to effects on the affinity of binding methyl [3H]yohimbine or the number of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Studies of the effect of epinephrine on the ability of ADP to protect against FSBA incorporation demonstrated that epinephrine can increase the affinity of ADP for its receptor 10-fold without affecting the total amount of FSBA covalently bound. This effect of epinephrine is mediated through the alpha 2-adrenoreceptor since the effect can be reversed by the competitive antagonist, methyl yohimbine. These results suggest that promotion of platelet aggregation and the exposure of fibrinogen receptors by epinephrine is dependent on ADP. The mechanism by which epinephrine renders low concentrations of ADP effective appears to be mediated by an increased avidity of the ADP receptor for the nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1580836719,"Mouse liver homogenates transformed leukotriene A4 into a 5,6-dihydroxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. This novel enzymatic metabolite of leukotriene A4 was characterized by physical means including ultraviolet spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. After subcellular fractionation, the enzymatic activity was mostly recovered in the 105,000 X g supernatant and 20,000 X g pellet. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) or digestion with a proteolytic enzyme abolished the enzymatic activity in the high speed supernatant. A purified cytosolic epoxide hydrolase from mouse liver also transformed leukotriene A4 into a 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid with the same physico-chemical characteristics as the compound formed in crude cytosol, but not into leukotriene B4, a compound previously reported to be formed in liver cytosol (Haeggstrom, J., Radmark, O., and Fitzpatrick, F.A. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 835, 378-384). These findings suggest a role for leukotriene A4 as an endogenous substrate for cytosolic epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme earlier characterized by xenobiotic substrates. Furthermore, they indicate that leukotriene A4 hydrolase in liver cytosol is a distinct enzyme, separate from previously described forms of epoxide hydrolases in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1585677287,"Abstract Fluorescein-labeled (Na,K)ATPase reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles has been used to study conformational transitions. Addition of K+ or Na+ to the vesicle medium induces fluorescence changes characteristic of the E2(K) or E1Na states of fluorescein-labeled (Na,K)ATPase (Karlish, S.J.D. (1980) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 12, 111-136). The cation effects are exerted from the cytoplasmic surface of inside-out-oriented pumps. Equilibrium cation titrations and measurements of rates of conformational transitions have led to the following observations. 1) The rate of E2(K)----E1Na or E2(T1)----E1Na is 4-6-fold faster and E1K----E2(K) is about 2-fold slower in vesicles compared to enzyme. In equilibrium titrations the K0.5 for K+ is higher and that for Na+ is lower for vesicles compared to enzyme. The conformational equilibrium E(1)2K----E2(2K) is apparently shifted toward E(1)2K in vesicles compared to enzyme. 2) Diffusion potentials, positive-outside, induced with valinomycin or Li+ ionophore AS701, do not affect the rates of E2(T1)----E1Na or E1K----E2(K), or equilibrium cation titrations. This demonstrates that the conformational transitions E(1)2K----E2(2K) are voltage-insensitive steps, confirming a prediction based on transport experiments. 3) In vesicles containing choline, K+, Na+, or Li+, the rate of E2(T1)----E1Na increases in the order given. Vesicles with reconstituted fluorescein-labeled (Na,K)ATPase provide a convenient system for correlating directly properties of conformational transitions with cation transport."
https://openalex.org/W1504738392,"Beta-Adrenergic receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors are both expressed on the cell surface of human astrocytoma cells. Incubation with a catecholamine or epidermal growth factor results in rapid internalization of the respective receptor. The internalized receptors co-migrate in light fractions on sucrose gradients. Astrocytoma cells maintain a constant ATP concentration by either glycolytic or mitochondrial ATP production. When cells are incubated in a medium depleted of substrates for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, addition of inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthesis causes a rapid reduction in cellular ATP content. An immediate return to control ATP levels occurs upon addition of an appropriate nutrient, such as glucose. Decreasing the cellular ATP content to less than 10% of control markedly inhibits internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors and epidermal growth factor. The inhibition of endocytosis is reversed as soon as the intracellular ATP content is restored. Previous work by others (Clarke, B.L., and Weigel, P.H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 128-133) suggested that ATP is not required for internalization (per se) of asialoglycoprotein in hepatocytes but was required for recycling of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. In contrast, our results indicate that in astrocytoma cells the process of internalization of epidermal growth factor and beta-adrenergic receptors, per se, is highly ATP dependent."

Electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry revealed two major binding environments representing strongly and weakly immobilized species. The disorder parameter of weak/strong, determined from the respective peak amplitudes, was irreversibly elevated following incubation of endothelial cells with a superoxide-generating system, indicating increased membrane fluidity. The rate of increase in membrane disorder was dependent upon superoxide generation rates. Incorporation of the spin-label at concentrations less than 250 microM had no effect on cell viability.

https://openalex.org/W2150901257,"Pancreatic polypeptide, a 36-amino acid peptide hormone, is synthesized in pancreatic islets of Langerhans and acts as a regulator of pancreatic and gastrointestinal functions. We isolated cDNA clones encoding rat pancreatic polypeptide precursor from an islet cDNA library and determined their nucleic acid sequences. Rat pancreatic polypeptide was found to be flanked on the amino terminus by a putative signal peptide and on the carboxyl terminus by Gly-Lys-Arg followed by a 30-amino acid peptide. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the signal peptide and the pancreatic polypeptide of the rat were highly homologous to those of the human (Boel, E., Schwartz, T. W., Norris, K. E., and Fill, N. P. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 909-912). On the other hand, the rat carboxyl-terminal peptide differed markedly from the corresponding domain of the human precursor and did not contain any sequence similar to the icosapeptide, which has so far been known to be a second stable product from mammalian pancreatic polypeptide precursors (Schwartz, T. W., Hansen, H. F., Hakanson, R., Sundler, F., and Tager, H. S. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 708-712).

https://openalex.org/W1577015808,"The Escherichia coli cca gene which encodes the enzyme tRNA nucleotidyltransferase has been cloned by taking advantage of its proximity to the previously cloned dnaG locus. A series of recombinant bacteriophages, spanning the chromosomal region between the dnaG and cca genes at 66 min on the E. coli linkage map, were isolated from a lambda Charon 28 partial Sau3A E. coli DNA library using recombinant plasmids containing regions between dnaG and cca as probes. Two of the recombinant phage isolates, lambda c1 and lambda c4, contained the cca gene. A BamHI fragment from lambda c1 was subcloned into pBR328, and cells containing this recombinant plasmid, pRH9, expressed tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity at about 10-fold higher level than the wild type control. The cca gene was further localized to a 1.4-kilobase stretch of DNA by Bal31 deletion analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the cca gene was determined by the dideoxy method, and revealed an open reading frame extending for a total of 412 codons from an initiator GTG codon that would encode a protein of about 47,000 daltons. Southern analysis using genomic blots demonstrated that the cca gene is present as a single copy on the E. coli chromosome and that there is no homology on the DNA level between the E. coli cca gene, and the corresponding gene in the Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Petunia hybrida, or Homo sapiens genomes. Homology was found only with DNA from the closely related species, Salmonella typhimurium. These studies have also allowed exact placement of the cca gene on the E. coli genetic map, and have shown that it is transcribed in a clockwise direction."
https://openalex.org/W1553675699,"Abstract The chromatin structure of the growth hormone gene and flanking DNA was analyzed in GC rat pituitary tumor cells, which appropriately express and regulate the gene. Thyroid hormone induced the DNase I hypersensitivity of a chromatin domain spanning the transcriptional initiation site from approximately -200 to +150. Three inducible hypersensitive sites were discerned in this region. One of these sites was in the first intron of the gene. The second site was within a region of 5' flanking DNA which promotes accurate, thyroid hormone-regulated transcriptional initiation. Centered between these two sites was a third hormone-inducible hypersensitive site mapping at the position of the TATA sequence. The hormone responsiveness of these hypersensitive sites suggests that occupied 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine receptor interacts with sequences flanking the growth hormone promoter, perhaps facilitating the binding or activation of a transcription factor at the TATA homology. Three hormone-independent hypersensitive sites were identified near or within intron or flanking DNA sequences similar to Chinese hamster ovary type 2 repetitive DNA. Two additional hormone-independent hypersensitive sites were located more than 1000 nucleotides up-stream of the growth hormone promoter. These sites were present in the cloned genomic DNA and were the only distinct sites found in rat spleen and cultured rat liver cells. Thyroid hormone treatment of GC cells appeared to increase the moderate DNase I sensitivity of the growth hormone gene region beyond that found in deinduced or glucocorticoid-treated cells. Dexamethasone had no discernible effect on the chromatin structure of the gene or flanking DNA in these studies."

https://openalex.org/W1529273305,"A nucleotide pyrophosphatase isolated from Haemophilus influenzae was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized with respect to molecular weight, substrate specificity, pH profile, thermal stability, functional group involvement, and effectiveness of selective inhibition. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAD to NMN and AMP and appears located appropriately to facilitate the internalization of NAD needed to satisfy the V-factor growth requirement of the organism. In the processing of NAD and structurally related substrates, the enzyme exhibited negative cooperativity. Structural alterations in the purine moiety of these dinucleotide substrates had pronounced effects on the negative cooperativity of the enzyme. AMP, ADP, and several related nucleotides were observed to be effective substrate-competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Several of the dinucleotides serving as substrates for the nucleotide pyrophosphatase were evaluated with respect to substituting for NAD in supporting growth of the organism. AMP and ADP inhibited growth of the organism when NAD served as V-factor, and this inhibition correlated well with the inhibitory effects of these nucleotides on the purified nucleotide pyrophosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1589738901,"Abstract In Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms, transcription of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes occurs at only one of several possible expression sites at any given time. Activation and inactivation of some expression sites are correlated with recombinational events that alter their chromosomal position (Van der Ploeg, L. H. T., Cornelissen, A. W. C. A., Michels, P. A. M., and Borst, P. (1984) Cell 39, 213-221). We present evidence that a 430-kilobase pair (kb) chromosome, containing the 1.8 expression-linked copy, is taken up in a reciprocal recombination when the 1.8 gene is inactivated. As a result, the 430-kb chromosome is reduced in length either to 140 kb (in variant 118b') or to 350 kb (in variant MITat 1.2000) and the 1.8 expression-linked copy is moved to a larger chromosome in both cases. The subsequent activation of the telomeric 118 VSG gene in variant 118b', located on a 2000-kb chromosome, occurs without detectable recombinations while, for variant MITat 1.2000, still another expression site is activated. We discuss a model that explains the occurrence of these apparently random recombinational events at expression site switching and antigenic variation."
https://openalex.org/W1597679751,"The ratio of superoxide production to oxidation of NADPH affected by the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase of human neutrophils is strongly influenced by pH, NADPH substrate concentration, aging of the enzyme, or its exposure to excess deoxycholate. Freshly prepared enzyme exhibited a Km for NADPH of 52 microM as determined by assaying NADPH oxidase activity, or approximately 33 microM by measurement of superoxide formation. In the range of 100-150 microM NADPH at pH 7.6 and in the presence of 0.06% deoxycholate, the univalent flux of electron equivalents given up by NADPH to O2 was 99%. Following storage of the oxidoreductase overnight on ice, its Km for NADPH rose to 125 microM as determined by monitoring oxidation of NADPH but was unaltered when measured in terms of superoxide production. Concomitantly, its capacity to affect univalent reduction of O2 fell approximately 20-30% under the same assay conditions. Univalent flux rates of less than 40% were observed with exposure of the enzyme to concentrations of deoxycholate in excess of 0.1% or to pH values below 6.0 or above 8.0. The capacity of the enzyme to carry out univalent reduction fell with increasing NADPH concentrations in a manner resembling that previously reported with increasing concentrations of xanthine in the case of xanthine oxidase (Fridovich, I. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4053-4057). The reduced form of the neutrophil oxidoreductase, like xanthine oxidase, thus appears to be capable of conducting both 1- and 2-electron transfer steps in reducing O2. Its capacity to affect univalent reduction of O2 depends upon the concentration of electron donor (NADPH) supplied as well as conditions of storage and assay of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582789812,"The fluorescent chelating agent quin 2 has been employed to monitor alterations of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in response to alpha 1-adrenergic receptor activation in adherent BC3H-1 cells. To correlate the kinetics of [Ca2+]i changes with transmembrane fluxes of this ion, continuous monitoring of [Ca2+]i has been undertaken on a monolayer of cells. Previous measurements of the transmembrane efflux of Ca2+ show a distinct lag in the response over a range of phenylephrine concentrations. By contrast, the elevation of [Ca2+]i is rapid (t1/2 approximately 2 s) and maintained for 30 s before it begins to decline to basal concentrations. The differences in kinetics indicate that the temporal delay in cellular Ca2+ efflux results from either activation of the transport system for Ca2+ extrusion or translocation of free Ca2+ to the transport site. The decline of [Ca2+]i with continued agonist exposure parallels both the efflux kinetics from the cell and the decline of total cellular Ca2+. At a time when free [Ca2+]i approaches the resting concentration, total cellular Ca2+ is reduced to a steady state value of 60% of that seen prior to stimulation. The Kact for phenylephrine-stimulated elevation in [Ca2+]i on the monolayer is 0.51 microM, which is similar to the Kact of 0.90 microM observed for phenylephrine-activated 45Ca2+ efflux. Addition of phentolamine subsequent to phenylephrine addition immediately reverses the agonist-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization, initiating a rapid return of [Ca2+]i to resting levels. A comparison of the kinetics of Ca2+ mobilization with its transmembrane flux suggests that the agonist augments the rate of recycling of intracellular Ca2+ between the free and bound states rather than causing release as a single bolus from the bound stores."
https://openalex.org/W1595922302,"Abstract Homogeneous diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate alpha, beta-phosphorylase (Ap4A-phosphorylase), the enzyme recently found in yeast (Guranowski, A., and Blanquet, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3542-3547) catalyzes an exchange reaction between the beta-phosphate of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) and orthophosphate from the medium (Pi). The common purine and pyrimidine ribonucleoside diphosphates as well as ADP analogs modified either in aglycone, sugar, or at the anhydride bond beta-position are substrates. The Km and rate values for the NDP-Pi exchange reaction were estimated at pH optima. These optima are 6.5 for UDP, 7.0 for ADP or CDP, and 8.0 for GDP. In the presence of 10 mM K2HPO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.0), the Km for ADP is 0.7 mM with a rate constant at saturating ADP of 96 s-1. The Km value for orthophosphate is 2 mM. In the NDP-Pi exchange reaction, phosphate can be substituted with arsenate and apparent arsenolysis of NDPs yields corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. The same pH optimum of 6.5 is found for arsenolysis of ADP, GDP, and CDP. Whereas the Ap4A phosphorylase sulfhydryl groups are essential for catalyzing the Ap4A phosphorolysis, the NDP-Pi exchange reactions, and the arsenolysis of NDPs, the divalent metal ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Co2+, and Cd2+), which had been shown to be essential cofactors of the former reaction, are not required for the two latter ones. Used at concentrations which are optimum for Ap4A phosphorolysis, the cations (particularly Mg2+ and Cd2+) inhibit the NDP-Pi exchange and the arsenolysis of NDPs. Interestingly, the Ap4A phosphorylase exhibits higher specificity for adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) than for any other NDP tested. The V/Km ratio is almost 5-fold higher with APS than with ADP. However, in the presence of orthophosphate, the APS is irreversibly converted to ADP. Thus, the enzyme displays a property already attributed to ADP-sulfurylase (EC 2.7.7.5), (Grunberg-Manago, M., Del Campillo-Campbell, A., Dondon, L., and Michelson, A. M. (1966) Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1567305461,"Abstract The diester bonds of phosphorothioate trimer analogs of (A2'p5')2A (2-5A core) of the Sp stereoconfiguration were found to be extremely stable to hydrolysis by both serum and cellular phosphodiesterases. The corresponding Rp isomers, although still more stable than parent ppp(A2'p5')2A (2-5A), were significantly more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than were the Sp isomers. Utilization of these novel 2-5A trimer isomers containing various combinations of Sp or Rp configurations at the internucleotidic phosphorothioate linkages revealed a further specificity of this enzymatic hydrolysis. Thus, the stereoconfiguration of the bond adjacent to the one undergoing hydrolysis influenced the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis, as well as did the chain length of the oligomer. The most stable trimer analog, which contained both internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages of the Sp configuration, had a half-life of 30 days in serum, which is a 1500-fold increase over that of parent 2-5A core. This is the first report on biochemical stability of an oligonucleotide containing more than one phosphorothioate linkage of the Sp configuration and is the first demonstration that a phosphorothioate internucleotide bond of the Sp configuration can increase the enzymatic stability of an adjacent phosphorothioate bond. In marked contrast to all previous 2-5A core analogs of increased stability, the activity (antiproliferative and antiviral) of the stable phosphorothioate 2-5A core analogs was obtained with the intact trimer, i.e., it was not attributed to antimetabolite degradation products."
https://openalex.org/W2105907007,"Complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) was purified from beef heart mitochondria in the form of protein-phospholipid-Triton X-100 mixed micelles (about 1:80:100 molar ratio). Detergent may be totally removed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the resulting lipoprotein complexes retain full enzyme activity. In order to understand the role of surfactant in the mixed micelles, and the interaction of Triton X-100 with integral membrane proteins and phospholipid bilayers, both the protein-lipid-surfactant mixed micelles and the detergent-free lipoprotein system were examined from the point of view of particle size and ultrastructure, enzyme activity, tryptophan fluorescence quenching, 31P NMR, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The NMR and IR spectroscopic studies show that surfactant withdrawal induces a profound change in phospholipid architecture, from a micellar to a lamellar-like phase. However, electron microscopic observations fail to reveal the existence of lipid bilayers in the absence of detergent. We suggest that, under these conditions, the lipid:protein molar ratio (80:1) is too low to permit the formation of lipid bilayer planes, but the relative orientation and mobility of phospholipids with respect to proteins is similar to that of the lamellar phase. Protein conformational changes are also detected as a consequence of surfactant removal. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates an increase of peptide beta-structure in the absence of Triton X-100; changes in the amide II/amide I intensity ratio are also detected, although the precise meaning of these observations is unclear. Tryptophanyl fluorescence quenching by acrylamide shows that a significant fraction of the Trp residues sensing the quencher become less readily available to it in the absence of surfactant. The temperature dependence of enzyme activity (expressed in the form of Arrhenius plots) is also different in the presence and absence of detergent. The effects of surfactant removal do not appear to be readily reversible upon readdition of Triton X-100."
https://openalex.org/W1519709310,"Reduction of cytochrome b in isolated succinate-cytochrome c reductase is a triphasic reaction. Initially, there is a relatively rapid, partial reduction of the cytochrome b, the rate of which matches the rate of reduction of cytochrome c1. This is followed by partial or complete reoxidation of the b, which is then followed by slow rereduction. At very low concentrations of succinate, the initial partial reduction of b is followed by reoxidation, but the third (rereduction) phase is absent, owing to insufficient substrate to rereduce the cytochromes. If antimycin is added at various times during the triphasic reaction, it inhibits the reoxidation and also inhibits the rereduction phase. Antimycin does not inhibit the initial phase of b reduction and, if added before or during this phase, it causes reduction of b to proceed to completion as a monophasic reaction. Myxothiazol inhibits the first phase of b reduction and the subsequent reoxidation, but does not inhibit the third, slow phase of b reduction. The resulting monophasic reduction of b which is observed in the presence of myxothiazol is slower than that in the presence of antimycin. The combination of both inhibitors, whether added together or successively during the triphasic reaction, completely inhibits b reduction. The triphasic reduction of cytochrome b is consistent with electron transfer by a protonmotive Q cycle in which there are two pathways for cytochrome b reduction. One pathway allows the initial phase of cytochrome b reduction by a myxothiazol-sensitive reaction in which reduction of b by ubisemiquinone is linked to reduction of iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1 by ubiquinol. In the second phase of the triphasic reaction, the b cytochromes are reoxidized by ubiquinone or ubisemiquinone through an antimycin-sensitive reaction. If oxidation of ubiquinol by iron-sulfur protein is blocked, either by myxothiazol or by reduction of iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome c1, the b cytochromes can be reduced by reversal of the antimycin-sensitive pathway, thus accounting for the third phase of b reduction."

https://openalex.org/W1500544829,"The effect in reticulocyte lysates of proteins with blocked amino groups on the ATP-dependent degradation of casein and serum albumin was studied in order to assess the extent to which proteins with blocked and with free amino groups share common paths of proteolytic degradation. Completely acetylated or succinylated casein and acetylated or succinylated serum albumin (reduced and carboxymethylated), in addition to other amino-modified proteins, inhibited the ATP-dependent proteolysis of both casein and reduced carboxymethylated serum albumin. Inhibition of serum albumin degradation by acetylated serum albumin was competitive, whereas inhibition of casein degradation by acetylated casein was largely competitive with evidence of mixed kinetics. The different amino-blocked proteins studied, which were largely unfolded under assay conditions, were similarly effective as inhibitors on a weight basis, with Ki values in the range 0.2-0.6 mg/ml; there was no correlation between the ability of the blocked proteins to serve as proteolysis substrates and their effectiveness as inhibitors. Studies of the effects of acetylated proteins on the conjugation of ubiquitin to serum albumin and casein demonstrated that the acetylated proteins blocked formation of ubiquitin-albumin conjugates and of selected casein conjugates; the steady state concentration of selected conjugates of endogenous lysate proteins was increased in the presence of amino-blocked proteins. The results suggest that proteins with blocked amino groups, which cannot serve as substrates for ubiquitin conjugation, can compete for binding to those ubiquitin conjugation factors that recognize and ubiquitinate potential substrates of the ubiquitin pathway. The similar inhibitory properties of the different blocked proteins in turn suggest that a common factor in binding to these conjugation factors may be recognition of the polypeptide backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1516155668,"A cytosolic protein is described which inhibits the binding of vasopressin and angiotensin to their rat liver receptors in the presence of calcium. The binding of insulin and transferrin was unaffected. Inhibition was temperature-dependent; it was maximal in 10 min at 37 degrees C, but required longer incubation times at lower temperatures. The pH optimum was 7.4. Inhibition also required the presence of calcium, with half-maximal inhibition at 6-8 microM calcium, but did not require any other low molecular weight cofactors. Inhibition could be reversed by washing the membranes at pH 5.5, but not by incubation with EGTA. Sephacryl S-300 chromatography showed that activity eluted in two peaks with approximate molecular weights of 70,000 and 150,000. In the presence of calcium, the inhibitory activity eluted at 150,000; in the absence of calcium, most of the inhibitory activity eluted at 70,000. A radiolabeled cytosolic protein with a molecular weight of 70,000 was eluted from inhibited rat liver membranes at pH 5.5 as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We propose that vasopressin and angiotensin II, which both mobilize calcium in hepatocytes via phosphatidylinositol turnover, can, by this same mechanism, activate a protein(s) which reduces further binding to their receptors."

The extensive metabolism of the spontaneously incorporated PtdIns strongly suggests that this PtdIns does not rapidly equilibrate with the endogenous PtdIns pools.
