https://openalex.org/W2092508425,"TRAIL (also known as Apo-2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family that rapidly induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed cell lines. The human receptor for TRAIL was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF-receptor family (designated death receptor-4, DR4) that contains a cytoplasmic “death domain” capable of engaging the cell suicide apparatus but not the nuclear factor kappa B pathway in the system studied. Unlike Fas, TNFR-1, and DR3, DR4 could not use FADD to transmit the death signal, suggesting the use of distinct proximal signaling machinery. Thus, the DR4-TRAIL axis defines another receptor-ligand pair involved in regulating cell suicide and tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2163976012,"In an effort to better understand the mechanism of toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, we employed an iterative search of human expressed sequence tags to identify novel basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) proteins that interact with either the Ah receptor (AHR) or the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). We characterized five new “embers f the AS superfamily,” or MOPs 1-5, that are similar in size and structural organization to the AHR and ARNT. MOPs 1-4 have N-terminal bHLH and PAS domains and C-terminal variable regions. MOP5 contained the characteristic PAS domain and a variable C terminus; it is possible that the cDNA contains a bHLH domain, but the entire open reading frame has yet to be completed. Coimmunoprecipitation studies, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and transient transfection experiments demonstrated that MOP1 and MOP2 dimerize with ARNT and that these complexes are transcriptionally active at defined DNA enhancer sequences in vivo. MOP3 was found to associate with the AHR in vitro but not in vivo. This observation, coupled with the fact that MOP3 formed tighter associations with the 90-kDa heat shock protein than the human AHR, suggests that MOP3 may be a conditionally active bHLH-PAS protein that requires activation by an unknown ligand. The expression profiles of the AHR, MOP1, and MOP2 mRNAs, coupled with the observation that they all share ARNT as a common dimeric partner, suggests that the cellular pathways mediated by MOP1 and MOP2 may influence or respond to the dioxin signaling pathway.

The AHR and ARNT are dimeric partners that transcriptionally up-regulate genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds. The AHR is activated by a number of widespread environmental pollutants, such as the prototypical agonist, TCDD. In the absence of ligand, the AHR is primarily cytosolic and functionally repressed, presumably as the result of its tight association with HSP90 (5Perdew G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that agonist binding initiates translocation of the receptor complex to the nucleus and concomitantly weakens the AHR·HSP90 association. Within the nucleus, HSP90 is displaced, and the AHR dimerizes with its partner ARNT, resulting in a bHLH-PAS dimer with binding specificity for enhancer elements upstream of gene products that metabolize foreign chemicals (6Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, SIM is the master regulator of midline cell lineage in the embryonic nervous system (7Muralidhar M.G. Callahan C.A. Thomas J.B. Mechanisms of Development. 1993; 41: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Genetic, in vitro, and in vivo studies suggest that SIM may also dimerize with an ARNT-like protein in Drosophila and regulate enhancer sequences present in the sim, slit, and Toll structural genes (7Muralidhar M.G. Callahan C.A. Thomas J.B. Mechanisms of Development. 1993; 41: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Wharton Jr., K. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T.

PER has been shown to form heterotypic interactions with a second Drosophila protein TIM in vivo, and homotypic interactions with the ARNT molecule in vitro (11Zeng H. Qian Z. Myers M.P. Rosbash M.

The distinguishing characteristic of these proteins is a 200-300 stretch of amino acid sequence similarity known as the PAS domain. In the AHR, the PAS domain has been shown to encode sites for agonist binding, surfaces to support dimerization with other PAS domains, as well as surfaces that form tight interactions with HSP90 (1Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In addition to the PAS domain, the AHR, ARNT, and SIM also harbor a bHLH motif that plays a primary role in dimer formation. The bHLH motif is found in a variety of transcription factors that utilize homotypic interactions to dimerize and regulate various aspects of cell growth and differentiation (1Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 13Neuhold L.A. Wold B.

Dimerization specificity is conferred by sequences within both the bHLH and determinants within secondary interaction surfaces, such as the “leucine zipper” or “PAS” domains (1Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8185-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 12Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Diff. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these dimerization surfaces also appear to restrict pairing to within a given bHLH protein superfamily, thus minimizing cross-talk between important cellular pathways (17Baxevanis A.D. Vinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). At the time we began this work, the AHR and ARNT were the only mammalian bHLH-PAS proteins that had been identified (see “Discussion”). Because other bHLH protein families utilize multiple homotypic interactions to provide fine control in the regulation of various gene batteries, we predicted that additional bHLH-PAS proteins existed in the mammalian genome and that a subset of these proteins would dimerize with either the AHR or ARNT. We propose that identification of such partners and determination of their pairing rules are the first steps in characterizing the potential points of cross-talk between different bHLH-PAS-mediated signaling pathways, as well as understanding the pleiotropic responses initiated by potent AHR agonists like TCDD. These observations led us to initiate a search for additional family members from libraries of human ESTs. The bHLH-PAS domains of the huAHR, huARNT, drSIM, and the PAS domain of drPER were used as query sequences in BLASTN searches of the GenBank™ data base between December of 1994 and October of 1995, using the following default values: data base = NR (NR, non-redundant subset), expect = 10, word length = 12 (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments comparing AHR and PER led us to define candidate ESTs as those “hits” that yielded scores of 150 or higher. As a method to confirm the similarity of these EST sequences to known bHLH-PAS proteins, each candidate EST subsequently was compared with the NR subset of GenBank™ using the BLASTX program, matrix = blosum 62, word length = 3. Only ESTs that retrieved known bHLH-PAS proteins by this method of confirmation were further characterized. Sequences of oligonucleotides are given below. In cases where the oligonucleotide was used in gel shift assays, the 6-bp target sequence is underlined. In an effort to obtain extended open reading frames for each EST, an anchored-PCR strategy was employed to amplify additional flanking sequence from a variety of commercial cDNA libraries that were constructed in the phagemid Lambda Zap (tissues: HepG2, fetal brain, and skeletal muscle) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (Table I) (19Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and analyzed by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe generated from the corresponding parent EST plasmid (Table I). After autoradiography, the positive PCR products were purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned using the pGEM-T vector system (Promega, Madison, WI). Dideoxy sequencing was performed to characterize each positive clone (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression plasmids were constructed by standard protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For a summary of clone designations, PCR primers, DNA templates, and GenBank™ accession numbers, refer to Table I. A brief description follows. Oligonucleotides OL404 and OL365 were used as primers in a PCR to amplify a 970-bp fragment from a HepG2 cell cDNA library. This fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector in the T7 orientation and designated PL439. To generate pGMOP1, the SalI/XhoI fragment of hbc025 was subcloned into SalI-digested PL439. To increase transcription efficiency of the MOP1 cDNA, pGMOP1 was digested with KpnI and SacI and this fragment subcloned into the corresponding sites of pSputk generating PL415 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (22Falcone D. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The complete ORF of the MOP1 cDNA was amplified using the PCR and oligonucleotides OL425 and OL536. This fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site in the pSport polylinker (Life Technologies, Inc.). This plasmid was designated PL611. The PCR was employed using OL477 and OL450 to amplify a 931-bp MOP2 fragment from a HepG2 cDNA library. This fragment was cloned into pGEM-T in the SP6 orientation and designated PL424. Using OL560 and OL590, PCR amplification from this same library yielded a 3′ fragment of the MOP2 cDNA. This fragment was cloned into pGEM-T in the SP6 orientation and was designated PL445. PL424 was digested with SalI and EcoRI and the fragment ligated into a SalI/EcoRI-digested PL445 to generate a full ORF MOP2 expression vector designated PL447. The complete ORF of the MOP2 cDNA was cloned into pSport as follows; PL447 was digested with SacII, treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of dNTPs, and subsequently digested with SalI. This fragment was purified and ligated into pSport, digested with HindIII, repaired with Klenow, then digested with SalI. This construct was designated PL477. Using the primers OL145 and OL489 and a human fetal brain cDNA library as template, the PCR was used to obtain a 1380-bp fragment. This fragment was isolated and cloned into pGEM-T as above, and this plasmid designated PL487. A fragment of MOP3 was obtained by the PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), primers OL657 and OL689, and PL487 as template. To obtain a full-length MOP3 cDNA fragment, the megaprimer fragment obtained above was used in the PCR against oligonucleotide OL611 using IMAGE clone 50519 as a template (23Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). This product was cloned into pGEM-T in the SP6 orientation as above and designated PL425. Using primers OL520 and OL145 and a HepG2 cDNA library as template, the PCR was performed to isolate a 5′ fragment of the MOP4 cDNA. This fragment was cloned in the T7 orientation of pGEM-T and designated PL448. The cDNA insert of the phage clone F9047 (from C. C. Liew, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) was amplified by the PCR using oligonucleotides OL418 and OL419 and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (24Hwang D.M. Hwang W.S. Liew C.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1329-1333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This clone was designated PL420. An EcoRI fragment of PL448 was isolated and cloned into a partially EcoRI digested PL420. This clone was subjected to the PCR using oligonucleotides OL698 and OL146, the fragment cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and designated PL545. The PCR was used to obtain a 1260-bp fragment of the MOP5 gene using oligonucleotides OL685 and OL686 and IMAGE clone 42596 as template. This fragment was purified and subcloned into the pGEM-T vector as above in the SP6 orientation. This plasmid was designated PL528, and subsequently digested with SalI and partially digested with NcoI. This fragment was ligated into NcoI/SalI-cut pSputk, and the resulting vector designated PL554. The epo-luciferase plasmid, pGL2EPOEN, was constructed as follows. The hypoxia-responsive enhancer from the 3′ region of the EPO gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides OL499 and OL500 and human genomic DNA as template (amplified fragment corresponds to nucleotides 127-321 as reported in the EPO structural gene sequence found in GenBank™ accession no. GBL16588). This fragment was digested with KpnI and NheI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the plasmid pGL2-Promoter (Promega). Antisera against MOP1, MOP2, AHR, and ARNT were prepared in rabbits using immunization protocols that have been described previously (25Poland A. Glover E. Bradfield C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 20-26PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar). Crude antisera were chosen for use in all coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and the preimmune sera from the same rabbit served to preclear the samples. For MOP1, the plasmid hbc025 was digested with EcoRI and the 604-bp fragment was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 1 in the presence of dNTPs and cloned into the SmaI site of the histidine tag fusion vector pQE-32 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). This clone, designated PL377, was transformed by electroporation into M15(REP4) cells for expression under IPTG induction. The expressed protein was purified from 8 M urea using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, extensively dialyzed against 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol before its use as an immunogen. Antiserum produced against this protein was designated R3752. For AHR, the human cDNA clone PL71 (27Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and cloned into the corresponding site of the histidine fusion vector pQE31 (Qiagen). The AHR protein fragment was expressed and purified exactly as described for MOP1 (above). Antiserum produced against this protein was designated R2891. For MOP2, a SacI/PstI fragment of PL445 was cloned into SacI/PstI cut pQE-31 to generate PL456. This clone, designated PL456, was transformed into M15(REP4) cells and the protein expressed under IPTG induction. The histidine-tagged fusion protein was first extracted in guanidine hydrochloride, dialyzed extensively, and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as above. Antiserum produced against this protein was designated R4064. ARNT-specific antiserum was raised against huARNT protein purified from baculovirus as described previously (28Chan W.K. Chu R. Jain S. Reddy J.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26464-26471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA prepared from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas were probed with random primed cDNA fragments using an aqueous hybridization protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Hybridization solution contained 5 × SSPE (0.75 M NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4), 2 × Denhardt's solution (0.04% w/v Ficoll 400, 0.04% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.04% w/v bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat denatured salmon sperm DNA. The blot was prehybridized for 3-6 h at 65 °C, the hybridization solution was changed, and 1-5 × 106 cpm/ml of a random primed cDNA fragment was added. Samples were hybridized overnight at 65 °C, washed twice with 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 30 mM Na3 citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS at room temperature, once with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at the hybridization temperature, and once with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at the hybridization temperature.

Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). To amplify the region corresponding to the bHLH-PAS domains of MOP1, OL715 and OL716 were employed in the PCR using PL415 as template. To amplify the region corresponding to the bHLH-PAS domains of MOP2, OL717 and OL718 were employed in the PCR using PL447 as template. To amplify the region corresponding to the bHLH-PAS domains of MOP3, OL719 and OL720 were employed in the PCR using PL486 as template. To amplify the region corresponding to the bHLH-PAS domains of MOP4, OL721 and OL722 were employed in the PCR using PL545. Since a more detailed domain map existed for the AHR, a construct was made with a fine deletion of the transactivation domain. The N-terminal portion of the AHR was amplified by the PCR using oligonucleotides OL180 and OL124 and pmuAHR as template (30Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3′ end of the AHR cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides OL201 and OL202 and pmuAHR as template. This product was digested with NotI and cloned into the corresponding site of pSGAhNΔ166 (30Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PL188 was digested with KpnI and XbaI, and this fragment cloned into the corresponding sites of PL187. This clone was designated PL204. A cDNA fragment of the AHR was amplified by the PCR using OL392 and OL393 and PL204 as template. This product was cloned using the pGEM-T system and designated pGTAHRΔTAD. This construct was digested with XhoI and this fragment ligated into SalI-cut pBTM116 (32Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). This construct was designated pBTMAHR. LexAARNT was constructed by PCR using oligonucleotides OL226 and OL176 and PL87 as template. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T as above, and the BamHI fragment cloned into a BamHI-digested pGBT9 vector (Clontech). This construct was cut with BamHI and subcloned into a BamHI-digested pBTM116. This construct was designated LexAARNT. Following amplification these products were purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector. These clones were designated PL537 (MOP1), PL538 (MOP2), PL539 (MO3), and PL540 (MOP4). These plasmids were digested with BamHI/PstI (PL537), BamHI/SalI (PL538 and PL540), and EcoRI/SalI (PL539), and these fragments ligated into the appropriately digested pBTM116. These clones were designated LexAMOP1, LexAMOP2, LexAMOP3, and LexAMOP4, respectively. Full-length expression plasmids harboring the AHR and ARNT were constructed as follows: PL104 (pSporthuAHR) was cut with SmaI, the insert purified and subcloned into SmaI site of pCW10, and this plasmid was designated PL317. This clone was digested with SmaI and subcloned into a SmaI-cut pRS305, and this clone designated pRSAHR. The ARNT cDNA (PL101) was digested with NotI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSGBMX1. This plasmid was designated PL371, and subsequently was digested with NotI and XhoI, and this fragment cloned into the corresponding sites of pSGBCU11. This clone was designated PL574. The LexAMOP fusion protein constructs were cotransformed with a yeast expression vector containing the full-length AHR or ARNT into L40, a yeast strain containing integrated lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes. As controls, LexAAHR and LexAARNT were cotransformed with AHR and ARNT. The strength of interaction was visually characterized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside plate assays, performed after 3 days of growth on selective medium (33Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To provide quantitation of the interaction strength, multiple colonies from yeast harboring each bHLH-PAS combination colonies were grown overnight in liquid medium. Liquid cultures were grown for 5 h and assayed for lacZ activity using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescence reporter system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). To determine the effect of AHR agonists on these interactions, yeast were also grown on plates or in liquid culture with and without 1 μMβNF (34Carver L.A. Jackiw V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30109-30112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure expression of each bHLH-PAS construct, Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies raised against the LexA DNA binding domain. Yeast extracts were prepared from 15-ml overnight cultures derived from multiple colonies of yeast expressing each LexAMOP fusion protein. Cultures were subjected to centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 6 M guanidinium HCl, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.01 M Tris, pH 8.0. This suspension was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube containing 500 μl of acid washed glass beads (Sigma), and mixed on the max setting in a Bead-Beater (BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK) for 3 min at 4 °C. The samples were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g, and 400 μl of supernatant was precipitated with 400 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice. After clearing by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the extracts were resuspended in SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and detected with LexA antiserum and secondary antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase by standard protocols (35Jain S.

The full-length cDNA clone encodes a 752-amino acid cytoplasmic protein with one lipase motif (GXS465XG) and eight ankyrin repeats. Expression of the cDNA in mammalian cells generates an active 85-kDa protein. Mutagenesis studies show that Ser465 and the ankyrin repeats are required for activity. We demonstrate that iPLA2 selectively hydrolyzes the sn-2 over sn-1 fatty acid by 5-fold for 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine in a mixed micelle. Moreover, we found the fatty acid preference at the sn-2 position to be highly dependent upon substrate presentation. However, iPLA2 does have a marked preference for 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid presented in a vesicle, generating the lipid second messenger lysophosphatidic acid.

INTRODUCTIONPhospholipase A2 enzymes are a broad group of proteins that have been intensively studied due to their potential involvement in the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes through the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrently, with fatty acid hydrolysis, lysophos-pholipid is released, the precursor for the proinflammatory molecule platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PAFplatelet-activating factorsPLA2secretory phospholipase A2cPLA2cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase A2iPLA2cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2BELbromoenol lactonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCphosphorylcholinePIphosphorylinositolPAphosphatidic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryDTTdithiothreitolPAPC1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl PCkbkilobase pair(s). as well as a potent mitogen in the case of lysophosphatidic acid (2Jalink K. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar).Phospholipase A2 enzymes can be divided into several groups based on sequence similarity and subcellular localization. Groups I-III consist of low molecular weight, 13-18-kDa, extracellular (sPLA2) enzymes found in snake venoms, mammalian pancreas, and synovial fluid. These enzymes require millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ for maximal activity and fail to exhibit any preference for the fatty acid substituent at the sn-2 position of phospholipids (4Dennis E.A. The Enzymes. Vol. 16. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 307-353Google Scholar, 5Wong P.Y-K. Dennis E.A. Phospholipase A2: Role and Function in Inflammation. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). There are numerous reports that have causally linked sPLA2 to various inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. However, in several mouse strains the sPLA2 gene is naturally disrupted, yet these strains have been frequently used as antigen-induced arthritic models (6Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of sPLA2 in eicosanoid production and inflammation has become less clear. Conversely, the widely expressed 85-kDa cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase (cPLA2) of Group IV has the expected characteristics of an enzyme mediating hormonally induced eicosanoid and PAF production (7Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L-L. J. Lipid Mediators. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). cPLA2 has a 20-fold preference for arachidonic acid over unsaturated fatty acids in phospholipid substrates (8Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) and consists of two functional domains: a calcium-dependent lipid binding domain (CaLB) and a calcium-independent catalytic domain (8Clark J.D.

The former domain mediates the translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum upon treatment with extracellular factors that raise intracellular Ca2+ concentrations to submicromolar levels (10Glover S.

In the catalytic domain, Ser228 has been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity (12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F.

Schrag J Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). Finally, cPLA2 is activated through phosphorylation of Ser505 (16Lin L-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) by mitogen-activated protein kinase (17Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Other phosphorylation sites have been recently mapped, but their role in the activation of cPLA2 is unclear (18de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomaschi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R.

A wide variety of poorly defined iPLA2 activities have been found in different tissues (Ref. 20Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and references therein), but only three groups have attributed cytosolic iPLA2 activities to distinct polypeptides.Gross and colleagues have assigned an activity found in myocardium (21Hazen S.L.

Hall C.R. Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), to a 40-kDa protein that exists as a 350-kDa complex by gel permeation chromatography (25Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of calcium-independent activity was found to increase during induced myocardial ischemia (22Hazen S.L. Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, others failed to observe the same activation under similar experimental conditions; indeed, a decrease in calcium-independent activity was observed with prolonged ischemia (26Vesterqvist O. Sargent C.A. Grover G.J. Ogletree M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 31: 932-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Since the 40-kDa species copurified with an 85-kDa phosphofructokinase isoform, it was suggested that the activity exists as a complex of the 40-kDa species and four units of the 85-kDa polypeptide. The activity was irreversibly inactivated by a bromoenol lactone (BEL; (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one) (27Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W.

Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Similar calcium-independent BEL-sensitive activities were reported to exist in pancreatic islets (29Gross R.W. Ramanadham S. Kruszka K.K. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), aortic smooth muscle cells (30Lehman J.J. Brown K.A. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The existence of a 40-kDa PLA2 or a functional high molecular weight complex was not demonstrated in these cell lines except in the case of pancreatic islets (33Ramanadham S. Wolf M.J. Ma Z. Li B. Wang J. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activity was stimulated by the presence of ATP (23Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and had a slight preference, 2-fold, for 1-ether over 1-acylphospholipid substrates as well as a 3-fold preference for arachidonic over palmitic acid at the sn-2 position (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but there were no significant phospholipase A1 or lysophospholipase activities associated with the complex.Dennis and colleagues (34Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified an activity from a macrophage cell line, P388D1, correlating with a single 80-kDa polypeptide by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) where the phospholipase activity was substantially enhanced in the presence of detergent (Triton X-100), giving a specific activity 5 μmol/min/mg. Moreover, this preparation showed a 2-fold selectivity for hydrolysis of palmitic acid over arachidonic acid, favored 1-acyl- over 1-ether-containing phospholipids, and has an intrinsic lysophospholipase activity in a mixed micelle assay. However, analogous to the 40-kDa species studied by Gross and co-workers (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hazen S.L. Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 80-kDa activity exists as a 337-kDa complex that was stimulated by ATP (and other nucleoside triphosphates), reversibly inhibited by palmitoyl and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketones, and irreversibly inhibited by BEL and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (35Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y.-C. Hale M.R.

Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Notably, in the absence of detergent, i.e. a vesicle assay, the substrate selectivity at the sn-2 position was reversed compared with the mixed micelle assay, favoring arachidonic over palmitic acid. Also, there was no stimulation of activity by ATP when phospholipid was presented in a vesicle. Recently, the 80-kDa activity has been implicated in phospholipid remodeling in the cell line P388D1 (38Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).More recently, a 28-kDa polypeptide has been purified to homogeneity from rabbit kidney cortex that preferentially hydrolyzes arachidonyl-containing plasmalogen phospholipids in a vesicle assay (40Portilla D. Dai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15451-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In our efforts to molecularly define the cytosolic enzymes that release fatty acid from membrane phospholipids, we describe the purification of an 85-kDa cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2, iPLA2, and expression of a cDNA encoding this activity. The deduced amino acid sequence has one lipase motif (GXSXG) containing the putative active site serine and eight ankyrin repeat sequences and lacks homology with any other known phospholipase A2 enzymes.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated the existence of a novel cytosolic calcium-independent iPLA2 in the cytosol of CHO cells whose sequence is not related to any other phospholipase. We found that the iPLA2 activity correlated with an 85-kDa species in active fractions from two consecutive chromatographic steps. However, we observed that iPLA2 in the native state exists as a oligomeric complex of molecular mass 250-350 kDa, a result that has been found for other calcium-independent phospholipase activities (23Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

We obtained several full-length cDNA CHO clones, and one of these was sequenced and found to encode a 752-amino acid polypeptide. Expression in COS cells generates a single 85-kDa species and 300-fold increase of iPLA2 activity in cytosolic extracts.Although the inferred amino acid sequences of CHO and human proteins are 90% identical, they lack homology to cPLA2, to any sPLA2, or to the 85-kDa phosphofructokinase isoform associated with the 40-kDa myocardial calcium-independent phospholipase (25Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ramanadham S. Wolf M.J. Ma Z. Li B. Wang J. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but are homologous to the murine iPLA2 isolated from P388D1 cells (accompanying manuscript (Ref. 59Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). Significantly, iPLA2 is homologous to two putative proteins from C. elegans, T04B2.5 and F47A4.5, through two distinct sets of sequence motifs. Amino acids surrounding the consensus lipase motif and the relative position of the motif (GTS465TG) to the carboxyl termini are conserved among CHO, human, and C. elegans proteins. Indeed, mutagenesis of Ser465→ Ala in CHO iPLA2 abrogates activity, while Ser252→ Ala in a partial lipase motif, which is not conserved from CHO to human, had no effect. Second, iPLA2 contains eight consecutive ankyrin repeats of approximately 30 amino acids in length. Likewise, one of the C. elegans proteins (F47A4.5) has the two-domain structure of iPLA2 with eight putative ankyrin repeats followed by the region containing the lipase motif. In contrast, T04B2.5 (408 amino acids) has no ankyrin repeats and corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of iPLA2 (340 amino acids). This raises the possibility that F47A4.5 is the C. elegans homolog of iPLA2. More speculatively, T04B2.5, which has a theoretical molecular size of 45 kDa, may be a related lipase that does not require the ankyrin repeat motif for lipolytic activity and, potentially, could be related to the 40-kDa calcium-independent activities observed by others (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The presence of ankyrin repeats in iPLA2 is a novel and intriguing result, since this structural motif has been found in many proteins of diverse function (49Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Bork P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and cell differentiation. Indeed, the predominant function of ankyrin repeats, although poorly defined, appears to be protein-protein interactions in three broad categories: first, the coupling of the spectrin network on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in neural cells and erythrocytes with the cytoplasmic domain of various integral membrane proteins (51Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar); second, the formation of functionally active protein complexes, e.g. the Ets family of nuclear proteins (52Thompson G.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar); and third, the masking of regulatory signals, e.g. the retention of NF-κB by IκBα or the p105 precursor of p50 in the cytoplasm (53Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 54Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar).The demonstration that iPLA2, with or without the Flag epitope, is not posttranslationally modified to a smaller catalytically active protein, at least when expressed in COS or CHO cells, implies the ankyrin repeats are not masking activity. This observation is supported by the loss of lipolytic function when the ankyrin repeats and the first 150 amino acids before the repeats are deleted, although the lipase consensus sequence is retained. Although further deletion experiments will be required to fully define the functional boundaries of the domains. However, the results imply that some or all of the ankyrin repeats are required for function, possibly to enable the ordered association of 85-kDa subunits to give the 250-350-kDa oligomeric complex found by gel permeation chromatography. Also, this region may contain amino acid residues that support catalytic function at the active site of iPLA2. Overall these results suggest that iPLA2 is not the precursor to a 40-kDa species analogous to the one found by others (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9892-9900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but rather that the 85-kDa protein is similar to the 80-kDa activity from the murine macrophage-like cell line, P388D1 (34Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the 80-kDa protein is recognized by the anti-iPLA2 polyclonal sera and has the same electrophoretic mobility as the 85-kDa species (accompanying manuscript (Ref. 59Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)).In preliminary experiments we found the phospholipid selectivity of iPLA2 and the relative reactivity for a particular substrate to be highly dependent upon substrate presentation and detergent concentration. Indeed, our results parallel those found for the 80-kDa activity from P388D1 cells, including the 5:1 regioselectivity for sn-2 versus sn-1 fatty acids (34Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 500 μM Triton X-100, the apparent substrate preference is 1,2-dipalmitoyl PC > 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl PC > 1-hexadecyl-2-arachidonyl PC. Conversely, at 50 μM Triton X-100, the order of preference for these three substrates was reversed, analogous to the substrate selectivity exhibited by the 40-kDa myocardial activity in a vesicle assay (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). iPLA2 does exhibit an intrinsic lysophospholipase and PLA1 activity, depending on the assay conditions. However we found no stimulation of lipolysis by the presence of ATP in either assay system compared with others (23Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14526-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Notably, iPLA2 is a PAF acetylhydrolase indicating a unique flexibility at the active site in being able to accommodate not only long but also short chain fatty acids. This is in contrast to the known intracellular PAF acetylhydrolases that are specific for short chain sn-2 substituents (42Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Stafforini D.M. Rollins E.N. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22308-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further, the enzyme has a marked preference, at 50 μM Triton X-100, for the phosphatidic acid substrate 1,2-dipalmitoyl PA producing the lysophospholipid, lysophosphatidic acid, a second messenger implicated in a number biological events (2Jalink K. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Only two other distinct PA-specific phospholipase A2 activities have been identified, neither of which appears to be biochemically or biophysically similar to iPLA2; the first isolated from activated platelets is calcium-dependent (43Billah M.M. Lapetina E.G. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5399-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the second, a 58-kDa protein from rat brain, is calcium-independent and specific for phosphatidic acid over other phospholipid head groups (57Thomson F.J. Clark M.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Additionally, iPLA2 has similar sensitivity to inhibition by BEL, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (accompanying manuscript (Ref. 59Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) as the P388D1 iPLA2 (35Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y.-C. Hale M.R. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem.

However, although BEL at 30 μM completely inhibits iPLA2 and has no effect on cPLA2 activity in cell lysates, caution should be exercised in using this reagent on intact cells. For instance, the above concentration of BEL used to inhibit iPLA2 will suppress cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release by 50% using a CHO cell line overexpressing cPLA2, E5 (16Lin L-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Similarly, calcium ionophore-induced production of prostaglandin E2 from COS cells transiently transfected with cPLA2 and COX-2 is reduced by 70%. 2S. Jones, unpublished observations. In summary, we have described the isolation, molecular cloning, and characterization of a novel 85-kDa cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2, iPLA2. The unanticipated discovery is the presence of the ankyrin repeats, an important structural and functional motif for many proteins. Clearly, there is ample precedent to suggest that this motif has two roles that are not mutually exclusive: first, to cause the self-association of iPLA2 to form a catalytically competent species that can bind a lipid bilayer, and second, to mediate the interaction with other proteins that may regulate or direct lipolytic activity in particular intracellular locations. Defining these interactions and determining whether the PAF acetylhydrolase activity, as well as the selectivity for phosphatidic acid are biologically relevant will answer the question of involvement of iPLA2 in the inflammatory cascade, the production of lipid second messengers, and general lipid metabolism.Note Added in ProofIt came to our attention during review of this paper that the gene described herein was isolated from CHO cells using the sequence we deposited in GenBank™, accession number I15470 (U. S. Patent 5466595, filed Apr. 14, 1995) by Wolf and Gross (Wolf, M. J., and Gross, R. W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 30879-30885). We would like to correct the statement in the paper of Wolf and Gross that the cDNA we isolated was transiently expressed in the same cell line from which it was obtained, i.e. Chinese hamster ovary cells, The cDNA was transiently expressed in the monkey kidney cell line, COS, demonstrating the cDNA encodes a bona fide catalytic activity rather than an activator of an endogenous activity as was suggested in their paper. INTRODUCTIONPhospholipase A2 enzymes are a broad group of proteins that have been intensively studied due to their potential involvement in the production of proinflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes through the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrently, with fatty acid hydrolysis, lysophos-pholipid is released, the precursor for the proinflammatory molecule platelet-activating factor (PAF) 1The abbreviations used are: PAFplatelet-activating factorsPLA2secretory phospholipase A2cPLA2cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase A2iPLA2cytosolic calcium-independent phospholipase A2BELbromoenol lactonePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCphosphorylcholinePIphosphorylinositolPAphosphatidic acidCHOChinese hamster ovaryDTTdithiothreitolPAPC1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl PCkbkilobase pair(s). as well as a potent mitogen in the case of lysophosphatidic acid (2Jalink K.

https://openalex.org/W2072712583,"The functions of the ecdysone-induced DHR3 and E75B orphan nuclear receptors in the early stages of Drosophila metamorphosis were investigated. DHR3 represses the ecdysone induction of early genes turned on by the pulse of ecdysone that triggers metamorphosis. It also induces βFTZF1, an orphan nuclear receptor that is essential for the appropriate response to the subsequent prepupal pulse of ecdysone. The E75B receptor, which lacks a complete DNA binding domain, inhibits this inductive function by forming a complex with DHR3 on the β FTZF1 promoter, thereby providing a timing mechanism for βFTZF1 induction that is dependent on the disappearance of E75B."

We first prepared AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and anti-AGE antiserum using AGE-RNase A. Then AGE-BSA was administered to human skin microvascular endothelial cells in culture, and their growth was examined. The AGE-BSA, but not nonglycated BSA, was found to induce a statistically significant increase in the number of viable endothelial cells as well as their synthesis of DNA. The increase in DNA synthesis by AGE-BSA was abolished by anti-AGE antibodies. AGE-BSA also stimulated the tube formation of endothelial cells on Matrigel. We obtained the following evidence that it is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that mainly mediates the angiogenic activities of AGE. (1) Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from microvascular endothelial cells revealed that AGE-BSA up-regulated the levels of mRNAs for the secretory forms of VEGF in time- and dose-dependent manners, while endothelial cell expression of the genes encoding the two VEGF receptors, kinase insert domain-containing receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, remained unchanged by the AGE treatment. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that AGE-BSA did increase de novo synthesis of VEGF.

Glucose and other reducing sugars can react nonenzymatically with the amino groups of proteins to form reversible Schiff bases and, then, Amadori products. These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions such as rearrangement, dehydration, and condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives termed advanced glycation end products (AGE) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productsRAGEreceptor for AGEVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorBSAbovine serum albuminHbhemoglobinHRPhorseradish peroxidaseCM-TsLMENα-tosyl-Nε-carboxymethyllysine methyl esterCM-BSAN-carboxymethylated BSAELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionFlt 1fms-like tyrosine kinase 1KDRkinase insert domain-containing receptorMoAbmonoclonal antibody; bp, base pairs.

The formation and accumulation of AGE in various tissues have been known to progress during normal aging and at an extremely accelerated rate in diabetes mellitus. This has been implicated in the development of diabetic micro- and macro-vascular complications (1Brownlee M. Cerami A. Vlassara H. N. Engl. J.

Microvessels are composed of only two types of cells, endothelial cells and pericytes, and have been known to show both functional and structural abnormalities during prolonged diabetic exposure, resulting in the deleterious effects on the organs that they supply (3Feldt-Rasmussen B. Diabetologia. 1986; 29: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Johnson P.C. Brendel K. Meezan E. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1982; 60: 214-217Google Scholar, 5Kuwabara T. Kogan D.G. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1960; 64: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Using pericyte-endothelial cell co-culture systems, we have shown previously that pericytes can not only regulate the growth but also preserve the prostacyclin-producing ability and protect against lipid peroxide-induced injury of endothelial cells (6Yamagishi S. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This has provided a basis for understanding how diabetic retinopathy develops consequent to “pericyte loss,” the earliest histopathological hallmark in diabetic retinopathy (5Kuwabara T. Kogan D.G. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1960; 64: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 7Shepro D. Morel N.M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that AGE exert a growth inhibitory effect and a cell type-specific immediate toxicity on pericytes through interactions with their receptor for AGE (RAGE), a cell surface receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (8Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol.

Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The AGE-induced, RAGE-mediated decrease in pericyte number would then indirectly cause angiogenesis (6Yamagishi S. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of AGE on the growth and tube formation of human skin microvascular endothelial cells, the key steps of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that AGE exert angiogenic activities directly on microvascular endothelial cells and that autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the major mediator of the AGE-driven angiogenesis.

Two weeks later, a booster with the same amount of AGE-RNase A was administered, followed by nine additional booster injections, with one given every 2-3 weeks. Ten days after the final injection, the antiserum was obtained. In the noncompetitive ELISA system, wells of 96-well microtiter plates were coated with increasing amounts of Hb, AGE-Hb, and reduced AGE-Hb. After washing and blocking, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of anti-AGE antiserum (1:4000) for 2 h and then with 100 μl of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) for 30 min. Finally, 100 μl of substrate tetramethylbenzidine solution was added into each well. After 10-15 min, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. In the competitive ELISA system, procedures similar to the noncompetitive ELISA were used except for the following two points. Wells were first coated with reduced 100 ng/ml AGE-Hb solution as absorbent antigens, and then 50 μl of test samples were added as a competitor together with 50 μl of anti-AGE antiserum (1:2000) into each well. Endothelial cells from human skin microvessels were maintained in E-BM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4% bovine brain extracts, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone according to the supplier instructions (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA). Cells at 5-10 passages were used for the experiments. AGE treatment was carried out in a medium lacking epidermal growth factor and hydrocortisone. Endothelial cells cultured for various time periods in the presence or absence of AGE-BSA were dislodged with trypsin, and counted by the dye exclusion method (18Yamagishi S. Hsu C.-C. Kobayashi K.

The candidate cells were then fused with SHM-D33 human myeloma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). A cell line that consistently produced an IgM-MoAb reactive to VEGF was cloned and designated BL-2. Then the BL-2 MoAb was purified from the serum-free supernatant by 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation and by Sephadex G-200 gel chromatography. The specific binding of MoAb BL-2 to VEGF was confirmed by immunoblotting. 2The monoclonal antibody did not cross-react with basic fibroblast growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. Its binding to VEGF-B (49Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VEGF-B and -C proteins were donated from the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and University of Helsinki. Wells of 24-well culture cluster dishes (Coster 3524, Cambridge, MA) were coated with Matrigel solution (250 μl/well) and then allowed to solidify for at least 1 h at 37 °C (24Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K.

After 30 min, the cells were treated with or without 50 μg/ml AGE-BSA for 6 h, 4 microscopic fields selected at random were photographed, and the lengths of tube-like structures were measured with microcomputer-assisted NIH Image (Version 1.56). AGE-BSA was prepared by incubating BSA with glucose and then purified by heparin-Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography. Fig. 1 shows its electrophoretic profile on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Control nonglycated BSA migrated to the position at 68 kDa. On the other hand, the purified materials migrated much more slowly, yielding a broad band larger than 68 kDa. This indicated that covalently linked adducts were formed nonenzymatically on BSA without discernible degradation. As shown in Table I, the purified materials also exhibited spectrophotometric features characteristic to AGE (26Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol.

The peak fluorescence was noted at 440 nm with excitation at 370 nm, and its intensity was increased 10-fold in comparison with nonglycated BSA. Chromogen products also appeared in the purified materials, whereas they were barely detectable in nonglycated BSA. Based on these observations, the purified materials were used as AGE-BSA.Table I.Characterization of AGE-BSAFluorescenceaAn arbitrary value of 1 was assigned to fluorescence of control BSA.

Open table in a new tab As a tool to evaluate AGE and their biological effects, an antiserum was raised against AGE-RNase A. The reactivity of this antiserum to several AGE-modified proteins, Amadori compounds, and carboxymethyllysine derivatives was examined. Since it was possible that AGE-modified proteins might contain early glycation products, the immunoreactivity of the antiserum to reduced AGE-Hb was also tested because the early glycation products are known to be converted to glucitol-lysine by reduction with NaBH4 (14Horiuchi S.

Commun. 1989; 162: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no difference in the immunoreactivity in the noncompetitive ELISA between AGE-Hb and reduced AGE-Hb. Further, as shown in Fig. 2B, the antiserum binding to AGE-Hb was not competed for by 1-deoxy-1-propylamino-D-fructose in the competitive ELISA, indicating that the antiserum does not recognize Amadori compounds. We next tested whether the antiserum reacted to CM-TsLME and CM-BSA in the competitive ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, these glycoxidative products were found to partially inhibit the antiserum binding to reduced AGE-Hb, whereas AGE-Hb and AGE-RNase A fully inhibited its binding (Fig. 2D). Further, the antiserum reactivity to AGE-BSA was dependent on the duration of incubation of BSA with glucose (Fig. 2E). These results suggested that the antiserum could recongnize AGE structures common to various AGE preparations. Endothelial cells obtained from human skin microvessels were cultured in the presence or absence of AGE-BSA, and the viable cell number was determined at days 1, 2, and 3 after the AGE addition. As shown in Fig. 3, AGE-BSA was found to increase the viable microvascular endothelial cell number in a dose-dependent manner; at 50 μg/ml AGE, there was about a 40% increase in viable cell number. Moreover, AGE-BSA significantly increased DNA synthesis in microvascular endothelial cells to 130% (p < 0.01, Fig. 4). However, nonglycated BSA induced no change in either the cell number or DNA synthesis.Fig. 4Effects of antiserum against AGE-RNase A on the AGE-induced DNA synthesis in human skin microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were treated with antiserum against AGE-RNase A in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml AGE-BSA.

As shown in Fig. 4, the anti-AGE-RNase A antiserum was found to completely neutralize the AGE-induced synthesis of endothelial cell DNA at 1%, while the same concentration of the antiserum did not affect DNA synthesis in endothelial cells not exposed to AGE-BSA. Poly(A)+ RNAs were isolated from microvascular endothelial cells treated with various concentrations of AGE-BSA for various time periods, and analyzed by a quantitative RT-PCR technique to determine the effects of AGE on the expression of the VEGF gene. It has been reported that there are four alternatively spliced products from the single VEGF gene, VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206 (29Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 30Ferrara N. Houck K.A. Jakeman L. Leung D.W. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Since Northern blot analysis cannot clearly discriminate the four mRNA species, we employed a more sensitive RT-PCR technique as described previously (20Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this experiment, 486- and 618-base pairs (bp)-long cDNA products would be amplified from mRNAs for VEGF121 and VEGF165, respectively (20Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, microvascular endothelial cells were expressing mRNAs for VEGF121 and VEGF165, the secretory forms of VEGF. When the endothelial cells were exposed to AGE-BSA, the level of VEGF mRNAs was found to be significantly increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The VEGF mRNA level began to increase at 2 h, and reached a maximum at 4 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml AGE-BSA; the peak value was 3-fold higher than the basal level when standardized with the signal intensities of β-actin mRNA as an internal control. Maximal stimulation was achieved at 50-100 μg/ml AGE. However, the larger alternatively spliced products coding for VEGF189 and VEGF206 were not detected in microvascular endothelial cells regardless of the presence or absence of AGE-BSA. To confirm whether AGE-BSA increased the synthesis of VEGF proteins, we performed immunoprecipitation using the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (20Nomura M. Yamagishi S. Harada S. Hayashi Y. Yamashima T. Yamashita J. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28316-28324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) from lysates of the cells that had been treated with or without AGE-BSA. As shown in Fig. 5C, 35S-labeled proteins that migrated to the positions of 18 and 22 kDa, corresponding to VEGF121 and VEGF165, respectively, were immunoprecipitated, and the amounts of these proteins were found to be increased to about 2.5-fold by the AGE treatment. VEGF exerts its biological actions through its specific receptors, KDR and Flt 1 (31Termam B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowics D. Böhlen P. Biochem.

Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). We then determined the types of VEGF receptors expressed in microvascular endothelial cells and whether their expressions could be altered by AGE-BSA. As shown in Fig. 5B, both kdr and flt 1 mRNA were detected in microvascular endothelial cells, and the content of kdr mRNA was more abundant than that of flt 1 mRNA. In contrast to VEGF mRNAs, the levels of the two types of receptors were essentially unchanged by the exposure to AGE-BSA. We next investigated whether vascular VEGF may have a functional role in the AGE action on endothelial cells. Microvascular endothelial cells were preincubated with various concentrations of MoAb BL-2 for 30 min, then exposed to 50 μg/ml AGE-BSA for 24 h in the presence of the antibody, and assayed for [3H]thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig. 6, MoAb BL-2 was found to significantly diminish the AGE-induced increase in DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner; at 10 μg/ml, a complete reversal was obtained. The MoAb alone did not affect DNA synthesis in endothelial cells not exposed to AGE. The process of angiogenesis has been assumed to be completed by the formation of microvascular tubes (19Miyazono K. Okabe T. Urabe A. Takaku F. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4098-4103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro assays for tube formation of endothelial cells have been developed and used to study this crucial step of angiogenesis. Accordingly, we examined whether AGE affect in vitro tube formation of microvascular endothelial cells. For this, we employed an on-gel assay system using Matrigel, in which endothelial cells take only several hours to associate with each together and form microtubes. Microvascular endothelial cells were seeded on Matrigel with or without AGE-BSA, and tube formations were judged after 6 h. As shown in Fig. 7A, AGE-BSA was found to double the length of the tubes of endothelial cells formed on Matrigel; and, the AGE-induced tube formation was inhibited by BL-2 MoAb as was the AGE-induced DNA synthesis of endothelial cells. The MoAb per se did not affect the tube formation. Fig. 7B shows typical micrographs; with 10 μg/ml BL-2 MoAb, AGE-induced tube formation was markedly inhibited. In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that AGE, nonenzymatically glycated protein derivatives formed under hyperglycemia, stimulate the growth and tube"
https://openalex.org/W2017407327,"The cDNA and derived amino acid sequences for the two major non-collagenous proteins of the mouse tectorial membrane, α- and β-tectorin, are presented. The cDNA for α-tectorin predicts a protein of 239,034 Da with 33 potential N-glycosylation sites, and that of β-tectorin a smaller protein of 36,074 Da with 4 consensus N-glycosylation sites. Southern and Northern blot analysis indicate α- and β-tectorin are single copy genes only expressed in the inner ear, and in situ hybridization shows they are expressed by cells both in and surrounding the mechanosensory epithelia. Both sequences terminate with a hydrophobic COOH terminus preceded by a potential endoproteinase cleavage site suggesting the tectorins are synthesized as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked, membrane bound precursors, targeted to the apical surface of the inner ear epithelia by the lipid and proteolytically released into the extracellular compartment. The mouse β-tectorin sequence contains a single zona pellucida domain, whereas α-tectorin is composed of three distinct modules: an NH2-terminal region similar to part of the entactin G1 domain, a large central segment with three full and two partial von Willebrand factor type D repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal region which, like β-tectorin, contains a single zona pellucida domain. The central, high molecular mass region of α-tectorin containing the von Willebrand factor type D repeats has homology with zonadhesin, a sperm membrane protein that binds to the zona pellucida.

These results indicate the two major non-collagenous proteins of the tectorial membrane are similar to components of the sperm-egg adhesion system, and, as such may interact in the same manner. The sensory epithelia of the inner ear contain hair and supporting cells, and the apical surfaces of these epithelia are covered by extracellular matrices which transmit forces to the mechanosensitive stereociliary bundles of the hair cells. In the ampullae of the semi-circular canals, a cupula sits on top of each crista; in the saccule and utricule, the maculae are covered by an otolithic membrane; in the cochlea, a tectorial membrane lies over the surface of the organ of Corti. The structures of these three types of matrices, the cupula, the otolithic membrane, and the tectorial membrane, are complex and not identical, and each may be tailored to provide the optimal stimulus for the type of hair cell present in each organ. The tectorial membrane is the best characterized of these matrices. In the chick it is a dense fibrillogranular matrix (1Tanaka K. Smith C.A. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. & Laryngol. 1975; 84: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) composed of two major glycoproteins, α- and β-tectorin (2Killick R. Malenczak C. Richardson G.P.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Chick α-tectorin is a large (Mr = 196,000) disulfide cross-linked complex composed of six polypeptides, the α1- to α6-tectorins, whereas chick β-tectorin is considerably smaller (Mr = 43,000) and not covalently associated with α-tectorin. The cDNA for chick β-tectorin has been recently cloned (3Killick R. Legan P.K. Malenczak C. Richardson G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and analysis of the sequence indicates β-tectorin is related to the pancreatic zymogen granule protein GP2, the urinary glycoprotein uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), and two components of the extracellular matrix that surrounds the unfertilized egg, the zona pellucida proteins ZP2 and ZP3. The mammalian tectorial membrane is considerably more complex than that of the bird, containing polypeptides that react with antibodies to types II, V, and IX collagen (4Richardson G.P. Russell I.J. Duance V.C. Bailey A.J. Hearing Res. 1987; 25: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Thalmann I. Thallinger G. Crouch E.C. Comegys T.H. Barret N. Thalmann R. Laryngoscope. 1987; 97: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and a number of collagenase-insensitive glycoproteins that account for up to 50% of the tectorial membrane protein (4Richardson G.P. Russell I.J. Duance V.C. Bailey A.J. Hearing Res. 1987; 25: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions these non-collagenous proteins of the mouse tectorial membrane form three broad, diffuse bands on SDS gels with peak masses of 173, 60, and 45 kDa which have been referred to as the high, medium, and low molecular mass tectorins (HMM, 1The abbreviations used are: HMM, MMM, and LMMhigh, medium, and low molecular massCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonia]-1-propanesulfonateGLERgreater and lesser epithelial ridgesPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptasevWFvon Willebrand factorbpbase pair(s)kbpkilobase pair(s).

The polydisperse behavior of the mouse tectorins observed on SDS gels may result partially from glycosylation heterogeneity. For example, mouse HMM tectorin is sulfated and following treatment with endo-β-galactosidase it is converted from a diffuse smear to a sharp band with an Mr of 160,000 (4Richardson G.P. Russell I.J.

Under nonreducing conditions most of the non-collagenous mouse tectorial membrane protein forms a large (Mr > 240,000), disulfide cross-linked complex which may be homologous to chick α-tectorin.

The studies of Kronester-Frei (7Kronester-Frei A. Cell Tissue Res. 1978; 193: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) originally described the presence of two major fibril systems in the mammalian tectorial membrane; the Type A protofibrils, straight unbranched filaments organized in bundles that run predominantly radially across the tectorial membrane, and the Type B protofibrils, described as branched, coiled, irregular diameter fibrils that could apparently exist in two states of hydration, with the highly hydrated form comprising the matrix within which the Type A protofibrils were found, and the weakly hydrated form forming the covernet fibrils, the marginal net, Hensen's stripe, and the limbal undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The Type A protofibrils are entirely degraded by bacterial collagenase (8Hasko J.A. Richardson G.P. Hearing Res. 1988; 35: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and can be labeled by antibodies directed against Types II and IX collagen (9Slepecky N.B. Cefaretti L.K. Yoo T.J. Matrix. 1992; 11: 80-86Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The matrix within which the Type A protofibrils are embedded is resistant to degradation by bacterial collagenase and fixation in the presence of tannic acid reveals it is composed of two types of fine, 7-9-nm diameter filament; a light and a dark staining type that are linked to one another by staggered cross-bridges and arranged in sheets with the filaments lying within the plane of each sheet (8Hasko J.A. Richardson G.P. Hearing Res. 1988; 35: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The alternating arrangement of the two fibril types in these sheets gives the matrix a striated appearance, and these sheets roll up to form the thicker, hydrated Type B protofibrils described by Kronester-Frei (7Kronester-Frei A. Cell Tissue Res. 1978; 193: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the way in which the tectorial membrane matrix is formed and functions in the process of mechanotransduction, we have now deduced the primary structure of the mouse tectorins. The data indicate that the HMM, MMM, and LMM tectorins observed on SDS gels are mainly derived from a single large mouse α-tectorin sequence, with a smaller sequence, that of mouse β-tectorin, contributing partially to the LMM tectorin fraction. The ways in which these two proteins may interact via their different domains to form the observed structure of the non-collagenous matrix of the tectorial membrane are discussed. Mouse and chick tectorial membranes were collected by dissection in phosphate-buffered saline containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM benzamidine, 10 μM pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), washed with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and stored frozen at −70 °C until sufficient numbers had been collected. To prepare the mouse tectorins for sequencing, approximately 550 tectorial membranes were washed with 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitor mixture, and digested overnight at 37 °C with 5 milliunits of endo-β-galactosidase (ICN Biomedicals, Thame, United Kingdom) in a 60-μl volume of the same buffer. Membranes were then washed 3 times with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml bacterial collagenase (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) in a 100-μl volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mM CaCl2 for 4 h at 37 °C. Following collagenase digestion, membranes were washed 5 times with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, and then solubilized by boiling in a 200-μl volume of 0.4% SDS, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, for 2 min. The sample was cooled to room temperature, and 80 μl of 5 times concentrated digestion buffer (2.5% CHAPS, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaN3), 120 μl of H2O and 0.4 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, United Kingdom) added. After digestion with N-glycosidase F for 3 h at 37 °C, the sample was dialyzed against cold H2O overnight, lyophilized, and resuspended in 40 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For the chick tectorins, approximately 800 tectorial membranes were washed once with high salt buffer (1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100), twice with low salt buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100), and finally with H2O. All solutions contained the protease inhibitor mixture. Membranes were then boiled in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and run on 7.5% preparative mini-gels (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The chick α- and β-tectorin bands were cut out from the gels and the protein recovered by electroelution. Electroeluted samples were dialyzed against cold H2O and lyophilized. Lyophilized α-tectorin samples were redissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Total mouse tectorin and chick α-tectorin samples were run on 8.25% mini-gels (using material from 100 to 200 tectorial membranes per lane) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using semidry electroblotting. The membranes were washed with H2O, stained briefly with 0.005% sulforhodamine B in 30% methanol, 0.2% acetic acid, rinsed in H2O, and dried in a dessicator. The stained tectorin bands were identified, cut out from the blots, and sequenced using standard procedures on a 477A liquid-pulse instrument (PE Applied Biosystems) and a Beckman LF 3000 automated NH2-terminal sequencer. Differential analysis of reverse transcriptase (RT)-mediated PCR products obtained from a region of the cochlea that is known to produce the tectorial membrane and from one that is not involved in tectorial membrane production was used to identify products potentially derived from tectorin cDNAs. The combined greater and lesser epithelial ridges (GLER) which are known to produce the tectorial membrane, and the stria vascularii which are not involved in tectorial membrane synthesis were dissected from the cochleae of 100 2-3-day-old postnatal Swiss CD1 mice (Charles River, United Kingdom) in Hepes-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.0, collected separately, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by a one-step oligo(dT)-cellulose selection method (Quick Prep Micro kit, Pharmacia, St. Albans, United Kingdom) and double stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in a final volume of 20 μl using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Degenerate forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the chick α4- and α5-tectorins (α4S1, ATGGCNTCN(CT)TNTA(TC)CCNTT; α4R1, AANGG(GA)TANA(GA)NGANGCCAT; α5S1, GTNACNGCNAA(AG)AA(TC)GA(AG)GA; α5R1, TC(TC)TC(AG)TT(TC)TTNGCNGTNAC) were used to isolate candidate α-tectorin RT-PCR products. A degenerate sense primer based on NH2-terminal sequence from one of the mouse tectorin bands (mtm4S1, GA(AG)CA(TC)ACNCCNAA(TC)AA(AG)GC), and a degenerate antisense primer (βTDEGR, GGNGTNGCCCA(AG)CA(AG)TT) based on an amino acid sequence (CWATPS) conserved in chick β-tectorin and mouse α-tectorin were used to isolate a β-tectorin specific RT-PCR product. Separate PCR reactions using 1-μl aliquots of the two cDNA populations and 50 pmol of each primer in a 50-μl reaction volume (as described in Ref. 3Killick R. Legan P.K. Malenczak C. Richardson G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were hot started and followed by 25 cycles of 50 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 15 s. The reactions ended with a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer and products specific to the GLER were isolated using GeneClean (Stratech Scientific, Luton, United Kingdom). GLER samples were collected from the cochleae of approximately 500 2-3-day-old postnatal Swiss CD1 mice as described above. Total RNA was isolated using guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (11MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) followed by cesium trifluoroacetate gradient centrifugation (12Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and poly(A)+ mRNA selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Quick Prep Micro kit, Pharmacia). A directionally cloned, oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was constructed using commercial kits (Stratagene, Cambridge, United Kingdom). First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with an oligo(dT) primer containing a 5′ XhoI site, the cDNA was then double stranded, EcoRI adaptors were added and the cDNA digested with XhoI. The cDNA was directionally ligated into λ; UniZap XR arms and packaged in vitro. A randomly primed cDNA library was constructed in a similar manner, with the following modifications; poly(A)+ RNA was isolated directly from the GLER of 300 2-3-day-old postnatal mouse cochleae with a Quick Prep Micro kit, first strand cDNA synthesis was primed with a mixture of random hexamers and an antisense primer designed to the 5′ end of clone A2 (GAAATGGAGGCGTAGTGCTG) and, after addition of EcoRI adaptors, the double stranded cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of λ; Zap II. Libraries were screened at high density with 32P-labeled DNA probes. Positive plaques were rescreened to purity and converted to plasmids by phage rescue. Genomic DNA was isolated from neonatal mouse brain by a modification of the method of Blin and Stafford (13Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1989; Google Scholar). Aliquots of DNA (10 μg) were digested to completion with EcoRI, PstI, SacI, or KpnI in the supplied buffers (Promega Ltd., Southampton, United Kingdom), electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) (15Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar), and covalently bound to the dried membrane by UV cross-linking. Hybridization to 32P-labeled DNA probes and washing to high stringency were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from cochlear, brain, heart, liver, kidney, intestine, lung, and skin tissues of 2-3-day-old postnatal mice as described for RT-PCR. Aliquots (3 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 1989; Google Scholar) and transferred to nylon membrane as described above. Hybridization to 32P-labeled DNA probes and washing to high stringency were carried out as described by Angst et al. (16Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probes for Southern and Northern blotting were generated by PCR or restriction enzyme digestion of cDNA clones. Probe fragments were separated by gel electrophoresis, recovered with GeneClean or Gelex resin (Stratech Scientific), and random primer labeled (17Feinberg A.F. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) with [α-32P]dCTP using a MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham). Unincorporated label was removed on Sephadex G-50 columns (Pharmacia) and the probes were denatured with alkali before use. Double stranded plasmid DNA minipreps (Promega) of cDNA clones were sequenced by the method of Sanger et al. (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) and a combination of sequencing templates from nested deletions (19Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) and templates primed with synthetic oligonucleotides. Analysis of DNA and derived amino acid sequences was performed using the DNA Star package (DNA Star, London, United Kingdom). DNA and protein sequence data bases (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, and PDB) were searched using the BLAST network service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (20Altschul F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70722) Google Scholar). Three synthetic peptides for α-tectorin (mα25-38, RELMYPFWQNDTRT; mα742-755, TCPERPEYLEIDIN; mα2000-2014, KDNTIGIEENGVSLT) and one for β-tectorin (mβ226-240, PTDETVLVHENGKDH) based on the derived amino acid sequences of α- and β-tectorin were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin using glutaraldehyde (21Doolittle R.F. Of URFs and ORFs: A Primer on How to Analyze Derived Amino Acid Sequences.University Science Books. 1986; Google Scholar) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Conjugates (500 μg) were suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into rabbits. The immunization was repeated a further three times with Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 4-week intervals. Antipeptide antibodies were affinity isolated using the respective peptide coupled to either cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B or Affi-Gel 15. Mouse tectorial membranes were solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using semi-dry blotting. Nitrocellulose blots were preblocked for 1 h with 3% dried milk powder, 10% horse serum in Tris-HCl buffered salt solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight in the same solution containing the affinity isolated antipeptide antibodies at concentrations of 5 or 50 μg/ml. After washing, bound antibodies were labeled with biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig (1:1000 dilution) (Dako, High Wycombe, United Kingdom), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom). Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized with 0.05 mg/ml bromochloroindolyl phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5). Inner ears from 2-day-old postnatal mice were immersion fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h prior to overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30% sucrose. Tissues were embedded in agarose and cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 μm. Aliquots (10 μg) of plasmid minipreps (Promega) of the α- and β-tectorin cDNA clones A1 and B3 were linearized with either EcoRI or XhoI (Promega, United Kingdom)). Antisense RNA was transcribed from EcoRI cut clones using T7 RNA polymerase and sense RNA was transcribed from XhoI cut clones using T3 RNA polymerase. In situ hybridization, washing and autoradiography were carried out as described by Goodyear et al. (22Goodyear R. Killick R. Legan P.K. Richardson G. Hearing Res. 1996; 96: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence data for the six chick α-tectorins and four mouse tectorin bands are presented in Table I, Table II. The sequences for the chick α2- and α3-tectorin bands are identical suggesting chick α3-tectorin is either a truncated or differentially glycosylated form of chick α2-tectorin. The sequences show no similarity to derived amino acid sequences or proteins in the current data bases (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, and PDB) except for the sequence of the mtm4 band which has 86% identity with the predicted NH2 terminus of mature chick β-tectorin (3Killick R. Legan P.K. Malenczak C. Richardson G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mouse tectorin bands mtm2 and mtm3, which have Mr of 40,000 and 34,000, respectively, have almost identical NH2-terminal sequences, suggesting mtm2 is an incompletely deglycosylated form of mtm3 and that both tectorin bands are derived from the same protein. Furthermore, identity between the sequence YPFW in mtm3 and chick α4-tectorin suggests that the mtm3 sequence is derived from the mouse homologue of chick α4-tectorin. The first nine amino acids of the mtm1 band and chick α1-tectorin also share 67% identity suggesting mtm1 is the mouse homologue of chick α1-tectorin.Table INH2-terminal amino acid sequences of chick α-tectorinsTectorinMrSequenceα1146,000PHYHTFDGFLα260,000MANELQYXQYα356,000MANELQYXQYα443,000MASLYPFW?Pα535,000SDTFPTFTVTAKNEDRT?α631,000SDT?GHYY?VEGXQ Open table in a new tab Table IINH2-terminal amino acid sequences of mouse tectorinsPolypeptideMrSequencemtm1150,000QEYGTFDGFmtm240,000RELMYPFAQmtm334,000RELMYPFWQNmtm431,000KXC?TPNK Open table in a new tab Assuming that the different mouse α-tectorins were derived from a large precursor protein, RT-PCR was performed on poly(A)+ RNA from the GLER and stria vascularis with combinations of forward and reverse primers based on the NH2-terminal amino acid data. Using one primer pair based on the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the chick α4 and α5-tectorins (α5S1 and α4R1), a GLER-specific product of 300 bp was amplified which, while smaller than expected, was not amplified from the stria vascularis cDNA and hybridized to a cochlear-specific mRNA of about 7.5 kb on a Northern blot (data not shown). This GLER-specific PCR product was used to screen 4.5 × 105 plaque-forming units of the oligo(dT)-primed mouse cochlear cDNA library. Thirty-two positive clones were identified, of which two, A1 and A2, were selected for further study. Clone A1 is encoded by a single gene as judged by Southern blotting and, like the GLER specific PCR product, hybridizes to a cochlear-specific mRNA of approximately 7.5 kb on a Northern blot (Fig. 1, a and c). Sequence analysis of A1 and A2 suggested that they were derived from the same mRNA, but both lacked the 5′ end. Clones extending further 5′ were obtained by screening 1.0 × 105 plaque-forming units of the randomly primed mouse cochlear cDNA library with a PCR product from the 5′ end of clone A2. Twenty-four further positives were identified of which one, A3, was found to encode the 5′ end of the mRNA. Clone A1 was completely sequenced on both strands; A2 was sequenced on both strands where it extended 5′ of A1, and clone A3 where it extended 5′ of A2. Other regions were sequenced on one strand only (Fig. 2a). Sequences were assembled into a composite cDNA sequence of 7340 bp containing a large open reading frame (Fig. 2, a and b). A perfect match between the derived amino acid sequence and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of mtm3 confirms the cDNA encodes α-tectorin. Complete identity was also found between the NH2-terminal sequence of chick α1-tectorin and the derived mouse α-tectorin sequence, but the NH2-terminal sequence of mtm1 only matches the derived sequence in 6 out of 9 positions.Fig. 2Cloning strategies (a and c) and sequences (b and d) of α-tectorin (a and b), and β-tectorin (c and d).

https://openalex.org/W2031907844,"Synaptojanin is a nerve-terminal enriched inositol 5-phosphatase thought to function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, in part through interactions with the Src homology 3 domain of amphiphysin. We have used synaptojanin purified from Sf9 cells after baculovirus mediated expression in overlay assays to identify two major synaptojanin-binding proteins in rat brain. The first, at 125 kDa, is amphiphysin. The second, at 40 kDa, is the major synaptojanin-binding protein detected, is highly enriched in brain, is concentrated in a soluble synaptic fraction, and co-immunoprecipitates with synaptojanin. The 40-kDa protein does not bind to a synaptojanin construct lacking the proline-rich C terminus, suggesting that its interaction with synaptojanin is mediated through an Src homology 3 domain. The 40-kDa synaptojanin-binding protein was partially purified from rat brain cytosol through a three-step procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. Peptide sequence analysis identified the 40-kDa protein as SH3P4, a member of a novel family of Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins. These data suggest an important role for SH3P4 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2011661565,"A novel Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) has recently been purified and characterized from P388D1 macrophages (Ackermann, E. J., Kempner, E. S., and Dennis, E. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9227-9233). This enzyme appears to play a key role in regulating basal phospholipid remodeling reactions. Also an iPLA2 from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been purified, molecularly cloned, and expressed (Tang, J., Kriz, R., Wolfman, N., Shaffer, M., Seehra, J., and Jones, S. S. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8567-8575). We report herein that the cloned CHO iPLA2 is equivalent to the mouse enzyme purified from P388D1 cells. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA fragments from P388D1 cells using primers based on the CHO iPLA2 sequence, revealed a high degree of homology between the mouse and hamster enzymes at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (92 and 95%, respectively). Identity between the two proteins was further demonstrated by using immunochemical, pharmacological, and biochemical approaches. Thus, an antiserum generated against the CHO enzyme recognized the P388D1 cell enzyme and gave similar molecular masses (about 83 kDa) for the two enzymes under the same experimental conditions. Further, the CHO enzyme has exactly the same sensitivity to inhibition by a variety of compounds previously shown to inhibit the P388D1 enzyme, including bromoenol lactone, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone, and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. Additionally, covalent modification of the CHO enzyme by [3H]bromoenol lactone is dependent on active enzyme as is the P388D1 iPLA2. Finally, both enzymes have the same specific activities under identical experimental conditions. A novel Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) has recently been purified and characterized from P388D1 macrophages (Ackermann, E. J., Kempner, E. S., and Dennis, E. A. (1994) J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the PLA2s have been implicated in a number of tissue dysfunctions ranging from inflammation to ischemia, much attention has been devoted to the study of the mechanism of action and biochemical characteristics of these enzymes. Depending on their site of action, the PLA2s can be subdivided into two types: the extracellular, secreted enzymes and the intracellular, cytoplasmic enzymes (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the latter, two groups of enzymes can be considered, namely the group IV, Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2, and the Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). phospholipase A2 Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 bromoenol lactone Chinese hamster ovary 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone polymerase chain reaction. In contrast to the group I-IV PLA2s, the Ca2+-independent PLA2s (iPLA2) have been poorly studied, since most of them are labile, constitute only a minor fraction of the total cellular protein, and have lower specific activities. The iPLA2s have been grouped into three main categories based on their biochemical and localization characteristics: lysosomal, brush-border membranes, and intracellular (for review, see Ref. 2Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The lysosomal and brush-border membrane iPLA2s appear to be conserved among the species where they have been identified. However, the intracellular iPLA2 enzymes appear to represent a much more diverse and broad group of enzymes, whose relationship is not so evident. Only four intracellular iPLA2s have been purified to homogeneity, namely a 40-kDa enzyme from myocardium (3Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a 39-kDa enzyme from bovine brain (4Hirashima Y. Farooqui A.A. Mills J.S. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), an 80-kDa enzyme from P388D1 macrophages (5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and very recently a 28-kDa enzyme from rabbit kidney (6Portilla D. Dai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15451-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enzymes from myocardium and P388D1 cells are both modulated by ATP and form oligomeric complexes of about 400 kDa. However, besides their very distinct molecular mass, they also differ significantly in substrate preference and detergent sensitivity (3Hazen S.L. Gross R.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first molecular cloning of an iPLA2 from CHO cells is reported in the accompanying manuscript (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Due to the role of iPLA2 in P388D1 cell metabolism (8Balsinde J. Bianco I. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), it was essential to determine whether or not the enzyme present in these cells was the same as that cloned by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Using a variety of techniques, we demonstrate herein that the enzyme from P388D1 cells and the cloned enzyme from CHO cells is the same molecular entity expressed in different species. Thus, the availability of the macrophage iPLA2 sequence should ensure rapid progress in understanding its physiological function. 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was obtained from Amersham Corp. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-tetrahydro-3-(1-[4-3H]naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one ([3H]BEL) was a generous gift of Drs. Randy H. Weiss and Philip Needleman (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO). Palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF3) and BEL were synthesized in our laboratory as described previously (9Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The iPLA2 activity has been previously described (5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-50 ng of purified iPLA2 was assayed in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Hepes, 400 μM Triton X-100, 100 μM 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (200,000 cpm), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM ATP (pH 7.5). The mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 30 min with shaking, the reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of Dole reagent (2-propanol, heptane, 0.5 M H2SO4; 400:100:20 (v/v/v)), and products were processed by a modified Dole extraction procedure (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When the irreversible inhibitor BEL, MAFP, or 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was used in the assays, the enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor for 5 min at 40 °C. The remainder of enzyme activity was assayed by adding the substrate mixture. When the reversible inhibitor PACOCF3 was used, it was added directly to the assay mixture. Purified proteins were analyzed by a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes with a buffer consisting of 5% nonfat milk, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 60 min. Membranes were incubated with the antiserum generated against the CHO iPLA2 (1:200 into the blocking buffer) for 30 min and then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL; Amersham). 100 ng of the CHO or P388D1 cell iPLA2 was incubated with 7 μM [3H]BEL for 30 min at 40 °C. Excess unreacted [3H]BEL was washed out eight times with H2O using a Centricon 10 (Amicon Inc.). Samples were then analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex). Gels were fixed with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid and incubated for 30 min with a fluorographic reagent (Amplify, Amersham). Bands were visualized by autoradiography (9Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). When MAFP was used to prevent [3H]BEL binding, purified enzyme was preincubated with 20 μM MAFP for 15 min at 40 °C prior to the addition of [3H]BEL. Total RNA from P388D1 cells was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol chloroform extraction method (Stratagene). Polyadenylated mRNA was purified by affinity chromatography using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Stratagene). The mRNA was converted to cDNA using the Stratagene reverse transcriptase-PCR kit. Amplification of specific cDNA fragments was achieved by using recombinant Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Primers were based on the CHO iPLA2 sequence (Ref. 7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar; GenBank™ accession number I15470). The 5′-primer used (AGG ATG CAG TTC TTC GGA CGC C) included the translation initiation codon ATG. The 3′-primer was a reverse primer (CAG TTG ATG GAG CCA GTT GTC C) situated 223 bases after the termination codon TGA. To determine the sequence of the 5′-end (primer region), we performed a standard rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (9Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, cDNA was amplified by PCR using the mouse reverse primer TTC CTA GGA GCT GTA GCA CCT G, which is equivalent to nucleotides 598-619 in the hamster sequence. After attaching a poly(A) tail to the 5′-end of the PCR product obtained, amplification of this product was accomplished by PCR using a dT(18) primer and a mouse reverse primer, ACT CCA GTT GGA AGA GCC GGA A, which is equivalent to nucleotides 205-226 in the hamster sequence. A final round of amplification was performed using the mouse reverse primer TTC CTC CCG GAC ACG TTC ACT T (equivalent to nucleotides 101-123 in the hamster sequence). PCR conditions were as follows: denaturing, 95 °C for 30 s; annealing, 55 °C for 45 s; extension, 72 °C for 120 s; 40 cycles. A last extension step lasted 10 min. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced by automatic DNA cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems 373 automated DNA sequencer, Perkin-Elmer). The intracellular iPLA2 from P388D1 cells was purified and characterized in our laboratory as an approximately 80-kDa protein (5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iPLA2 purified by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) from CHO cells and the protein expressed by the cDNA have a molecular size of 84.5 kDa. Besides this similarity, the purification strategy used by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) contains some analogous steps to those used for the macrophage iPLA2 (5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzymatic profile of the CHO enzyme is comparable. Therefore, we hypothesized that both proteins would share a high degree of similarity if not identity. We began to address this hypothesis by taking advantage of the polyclonal antibody generated by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) against the C-terminal portion of the CHO protein. The antiserum recognized pure iPLA2 from P388D1 cells, as shown by immunoblot (Fig. 1, lane 2). Purified CHO iPLA2 was run in parallel as a control and showed identical mobility, focusing both proteins in the 80-85-kDa molecular mass range (Fig. 1, lane 1). To further establish a similarity between the two proteins, a series of inhibition studies were conducted. We have previously shown that the iPLA2 from P388D1 cells is potently and irreversibly inhibited by bromoenol lactone (BEL). After a preincubation time of 5 min at 40 °C, BEL inhibits pure iPLA2 with an IC50 of about 60 nM (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Likewise, iPLA2 from CHO cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by BEL with an IC50 of 120 nM (Fig. 2A). This inhibition was irreversible even after exhaustive dialysis of treated enzyme compared with control (Fig. 2B). Also, P388D1 iPLA2 is reversibly inhibited by PACOCF3 (IC50 = 4 μM), and again CHO iPLA2 was inhibited by the same reagent with an IC50 of 3 μM (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effect of PACOCF3 on CHO cell iPLA2 activity. Purified CHO cell iPLA2 was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of the indicated concentrations of PACOCF3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since BEL is an irreversible inhibitor, it was possible to label the macrophage iPLA2 by incubation with [3H]BEL (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, labeling with BEL required the presence of active enzyme, since the inhibitory agent is generated in situ from BEL by the hydrolytic action of the enzyme on the lactone ring (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indeed, in previous studies with the P388D1 iPLA2, DTNB prevented labeling of the enzyme with [3H]BEL (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Although DTNB also inhibits the CHO iPLA2 (Fig. 4), we have employed herein the irreversible inhibitor MAFP (11Lio Y-C. Reynolds L.J. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), because it is a much more specific reagent than DTNB. MAFP (20 μM) completely inactivated the CHO iPLA2 (Fig. 4) and prevented labeling of the enzyme with [3H]BEL (Fig. 5). Moreover, in the absence of MAFP treatment, autoradiographic analysis of [3H]BEL-treated enzyme revealed a single spot at about 85 kDa. This is the same molecular size as that obtained for the P388D1 iPLA2 utilizing a similar strategy (10Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) as well as that found by immunoblot (Fig. 1).Fig. 5[3H]BEL labeling of CHO cell iPLA2. CHO cell iPLA2 was incubated with (+) or without (−) 20 μM MAFP for 5 min at 40 °C, as indicated. Afterward, the protein was incubated with [3H]BEL for 30 min at 40 °C. After washing out the excess of [3H]BEL, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide sequence of the P388D1 iPLA2 was obtained by analyzing mRNA from these cells by PCR using primers based on the CHO iPLA2 sequence (Fig. 6). Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the two proteins revealed a 92% sequence homology. Most of the changes of the nucleotide sequence occurred at the third nucleotide of the codon, reflecting the 95% identity at the amino acid level between two closely related species. These results further support the notion that the hamster iPLA2 cloned by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) is the species equivalent to the murine enzyme purified and characterized by us.Fig. 6Comparison between the nucleotide (A) and amino acid (B) sequences of mouse and hamster iPLA2. A colon denotes nucleotides or amino acids that are identical; a dot denotes a conservative amino acid change.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous studies on the P388D1 cell iPLA2 have suggested that this enzyme may play an important role in regulating fatty acid remodeling reactions in the cells (8Balsinde J.

This implies that the iPLA2 enzyme might ultimately regulate several key aspects of cell physiology, such as new membrane synthesis that allows cell proliferation, or fatty acid exchange within phospholipids that allows adaptive homeostatic changes. Although the discovery by Gross and co-workers (14Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that some iPLA2s are potently and selectively inhibited by BEL has accelerated research on this enzyme, study of the iPLA2 is hampered by the fact that it is extremely difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of pure protein for biochemical and sequence analysis. We have presented evidence herein that the enzyme purified and cloned by Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol.

By using a wide variety of approaches, we have found biochemical, immunological, pharmacological, and genetic similarities between the two proteins, strongly suggesting that the same molecular entity is expressed in different species. There is, however, an apparent difference between the two enzymes concerning ATP sensitivity. Tang et al. (7Tang J. Kriz R. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) failed to observe any ATP effect on a partially purified preparation of CHO iPLA2. We have confirmed this finding using the assay system employed for the P388D1 iPLA2. We have previously reported on the apparent activation of P388D1 iPLA2 by ATP (5Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect was shown to depend on the presence of Triton X-100 in the assay system. This, along with the fact that several other nucleotides manifested the same effect (i.e. ADP, UTP, GTP) raised the possibility that it might not be relevant as a regulatory mechanism. We have new data with P388D1 iPLA2 showing that, rather than stimulating the iPLA2, the ATP stabilizes the enzyme and protects it from denaturation; hence, higher activity is found in the presence than in the absence of ATP. 2Y. C. Lio and E. A. Dennis, manuscript in preparation. Considering the fact that the two proteins have slightly different amino acid sequences and purification schemes, it is possible that the CHO enzyme lacks the region with which ATP interacts. Alternatively, it is possible that the CHO enzyme is more resistant to denaturation than the P388D1 enzyme. The availability of the iPLA2 cDNA and protein sequence of the 80-kDa iPLA2, which is now classified as a Group VI PLA2 (16Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), will allow new experimental avenues to be explored in defining the role(s) of iPLA2 in phospholipid metabolism and cellular function. We thank Richard Loo (University of California at San Diego) and Jin Tang (Genetics Institute) for providing pure iPLA2 from P388D1 macrophages and CHO cells, respectively."

The molecular mechanisms that govern the uptake of these compounds in S. cerevisiae have not been described. We report the characterization of FAT1, a gene that encodes a putative membrane-bound long-chain fatty acid transport protein (Fat1p). Fat1p contains 623 amino acid residues that are 33% identical and 54% with similar chemical properties as compared with the fatty acid transport protein FATP described in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Schaffer and Lodish (1994) Cell 79, 427-436), suggesting a similar function. Disruption of FAT1 results in 1) an impaired growth in YPD medium containing 25 μM cerulenin and 500 μM fatty acid (myristate (C14:0), palmitate (C16:0), or oleate (C18:1)); 2) a marked decrease in the uptake of the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue boron dipyrromethene difluoride dodecanoic acid (BODIPY-3823); 3) a reduced rate of exogenous oleate incorporation into phospholipids; and 4) a 2-3-fold decrease in the rates of oleate uptake.

These data support the hypothesis that Fat1p is involved in long-chain fatty acid uptake and may represent a long-chain fatty acid transport protein. Exogenous long-chain fatty acids represent an important class of hydrophobic compounds that serve as substrates for lipid biosynthesis, protein modification, and β-oxidation. While the mechanism that facilitates the uptake of these compounds into eukaryotic cells is not completely understood, information gleaned over the past 15 years is consistent with a facilitated, protein-mediated process. In higher eukaryotic cells, three general classes of membrane-bound fatty acid transport proteins have been described. The first, identified by Abumrad and co-workers (1Abumrad N.A. Forest C.C.

This protein represents the adipocyte homologue of the glycoprotein CD36 and appears to act in concert with intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins to mediate fatty acid uptake (5Spitsberg V.L.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 336-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that pretreatment with anti-FABPpm sera does not block the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in human intestinal cells that normally express FABPpm. These data raise the question of whether the mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase actually represents a membrane-bound fatty acid transport protein. The third, described by Schaffer and Lodish (14Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) is FATP (atty cid ransport rotein). FATP is differentially expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is predicted to function in the transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. The expression of FATP is apparently negatively regulated by insulin at the level of transcription in cultured adipocytes (15Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast and in bacteria also demonstrate that long-chain fatty acid transport is a facilitated process (16Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 792: 310-317Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Tigratti B.L. Baker A.D. Rajaratnam K. Rachubinski R.A. Gerber G.E. Biochem.

Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the proteins that mediate uptake in yeast have not been described, considerable evidence has been accumulated describing the fatty acid transporter FadL in Escherichia coli (20Black P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 442-535Google Scholar, 21Kumar G.B. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1348-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kumar G.B. Black P.N. J. Biol.

Exogenous long-chain fatty acids traverse the cell envelope by a high affinity transport process that minimally requires the outer membrane-bound fatty acid transport protein FadL and the inner membrane-associated acyl-CoA synthetase. The fatty acid transporter FadL, while mechanistically similar, is quite distinct on the basis of amino acid similarities, to the eukaryotic fatty acid transporters described above. fatty acid translocase membrane-bound fatty acid-binding protein fatty acid transport protein boron dipyrromethene difluoride dodecanoic acid supplemented minimal media base pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline cerulenin. The notion of a membrane-bound fatty acid transporter is not universally accepted. One school of thought is that fatty acids are merely transported by diffusion across the membrane. In support of this, it has been demonstrated that when fatty acids are in the nonionized form, uptake into artificial membrane vesicles and 3T3-L1 cells occurs by simple diffusion, obviating the need for a membrane-bound fatty acid transporter (24Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 25Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Tigratti B.L. Gerber G.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that in 3T3-L1 cells, long-chain fatty acid transport can occur by both diffusional and protein-mediated processes. The need for a protein-mediated process must lie in the requirement to regulate the entry of these compounds. A long-chain fatty acid transporter may be required for cells that specifically use these compounds for the production of metabolic energy or for the synthesis of triglycerides. These transporters are also required by microbes such as E. coli that have a hydrophilic cell envelope that is refractory to hydrophobic compounds. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, the gene products involved in uptake of exogenous long-chain fatty acids are unknown. Kohlwein and Paltauf (16Kohlwein S.D. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 792: 310-317Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that fatty acid uptake in Saccharomyces uvarum and Saccharomycopsis lipolytica occurs via a saturable process. The same observations were made in Candida tropicalis supporting the hypothesis that fatty acid transport is a facilitated process (17Tigratti B.L. Baker A.D. Rajaratnam K. Rachubinski R.A. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Knoll et al. (19Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown the uptake of exogenous long-chain fatty acids in S. cerevisiae is saturable and that uptake and activation to CoA thioesters are separable. On the basis of these studies, it is reasonable to predict that a membrane-bound long-chain fatty acid transport protein exists in yeast. S. cerevisiae requires supplementation of oleic acid (C18:1) to remain viable under anaerobic growth conditions due to the suppression of fatty acid desaturation (27Andreasen A.A. Stier T.J.B. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1953; 41: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Supplementation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids is also required for cell viability when fatty acid synthase is blocked by the antibiotic cerulenin (28Duronio R. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Rowley N. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18037-18046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under both conditions, transport and activation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids are required to overcome growth inhibition. The acyl-CoA synthetases encoded by FAA1 and FAA4 (Faa1p and Faa4p, respectively) have been shown to be responsible for activation of imported fatty acids in S. cerevisiae (30Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The overexpression of either Faa1p or Faa4p in faa1Δ faa4Δ cells does not increase the levels of fatty acid uptake. The finding that long-chain fatty acid uptake in yeast is saturable and occurs in the absence of Faap activity supports the proposal for a specific plasma membrane-bound fatty acid transporter. We report the characterization of FAT1 in S. cerevisiae that encodes a 623-amino acid residue protein that shares 33% amino acid identity and 54% amino acids with similar chemical properties to FATP described in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (14Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Disruption of FAT1 results in 1) an impaired growth in YPD medium containing 25 μM cerulenin and 500 μM fatty acid (myristate (C14:0), palmitate (C16:0), or oleate (C18:1)); 2) a decrease in the uptake of the fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue BODIPY-3823; 3) a reduced rate of exogenous oleate incorporation into phospholipids; and 4) a 2-3-fold decrease in the rates of oleate uptake. These data support the hypothesis that Fat1p is a long-chain fatty acid transport protein. Yeast extract, yeast peptone, agar, and yeast nitrogen base were obtained from Difco. Fatty acids and cerulenin were obtained from Sigma. 3H-Labeled fatty acids were from DuPont NEN. BODIPY-3823 was purchased from Molecular Probes. Enzymes required for all DNA manipulations were obtained from Epicenter, Promega, New England Biolabs, U.S. Biochemical Corp., or Boehringer Mannheim. The oligonucleotides for DNA amplification were synthesized on a Gene Assembler Plus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All other chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers and were of reagent grade. Homology searches were performed using Biological Sequence Comparative Analysis Node (BioSCAN) at the University of North Carolina. The nonredundant data base Genpept (Release 93) was used. Alignments of the primary structures of FATP homologies were generated with BESTFIT (Genetics Computer Group) (31Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucl. Acids. Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The isogenic S. cerevisiae strains W303a (leu2, ura3, trp1, ade2, his3) and W303a-fat1Δ-1 (leu2, ura3, trp1, ade2, his3, fat1Δ::HIS3) were used in all of the experiments described. YPD media consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose. Supplemented minimal media (SMM) contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose adenine (20 mg/liter), uracil (20 mg/liter) and amino acids as required for either the gene replacement experiments or the complementation experiments (arginine, tryptophan, histidine, and tyrosine (20 mg/liter); lysine (30 mg/liter); and leucine (100 mg/liter)). YPD/agar plates containing 50 μM fatty acid (myristate, palmitate, or oleate) also contained 0.5% Brij 58, 0.7% KH2PO4 with or without 25 μM cerulenin as required (30Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Growth characteristics of various strains on YPD, YPD/CER, and YPD/CER/fatty acid plates were performed according to Johnson et al. (30Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plates were then incubated at 24, 30, or 37 °C for 72 h. Growth in liquid YPD with or without cerulenin and fatty acid was monitored over a 40-h period. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Yeast genomic DNA was purified from strain W303a as detailed in Kaiser et al. (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, New York1994Google Scholar). For disruption, the FAT1 gene was amplified by thermocycling from genomic DNA using sets of specific primers; 5′-ACCCAGAAATCCTGGGTTATCT-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CAACTCTACTTCAGTAGTGGAAAC-3′ (downstream), both containing BamHI sites (underlined). The HIS3 gene was amplified from pHB3 (obtained from David Nelson, University of Tennessee, Memphis) using the upstream primer 5′-AGCGCCTTTTAAACCACGACGCTTTGTC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TACGCACTTGCCACCTATCACCACAA-3′, both containing EcoRI sites (underlined). The 1549-bp fragment containing the coding sequence of FAT1 was cloned into the BamHI-site of pACYC177 to generate pNJF1. The 480-bp EcoRI fragment within FAT1 was replaced by the 1346-bp EcoRI-fragment containing the HIS3 gene to generate pNJF2. The strain W303a was rendered competent using lithium acetate using standard procedures and transformed with linearized pNJF2 according to Kaiser et al. (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, New York1994Google Scholar). Clones were selected on minimal plates lacking histidine supplementation. His+ isolates were selected and colony-purified on minimal places without histidine. Several isolates were obtained. The disruption of the FAT1 gene with HIS3 was confirmed using DNA amplification of genomic DNA. One such isolate shown to contain a disruption in FAT1, designated W303a-fat1Δ-1 (fat1Δ) was selected for all further studies. The expression of FAT1 was evaluated in strain W303a grown in YPD containing 500 μM oleate. Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit as recommended by the supplier (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase amplification was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described by the manufacturer (Boehringer-Mannheim). Controls received no Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. First-strand cDNA was amplified using primers derived from the sequences corresponding to the C termini of Fat1p or histone H4 (used as an internal control). Fatty acid transport was performed essentially as described by Knoll et al. (19Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (W303a and W303a-fat1Δ-1) were grown in SMM at 24 or 30 °C to midlog phase (A600 = 1.0), collected by centrifugation, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 1/10 of the original volume in PBS. 200 μl of cells (1 × 108 cells) were preincubated for 10 min at 24 or 30 °C in SMM, and the assay was initiated by the addition of [9,10-3H]myristate, [9-10-3H]palmitate, or [9-10-3H]oleate at the concentrations indicated. All fatty acids were prepared as ethanolic stocks. At the defined time points, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were immediately filtered through a Whatman Gf/B-filter, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and air-dried. The amount of cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Background counts were subtracted from the experimental samples by evaluating the amount of radioactivity on control filters with no cells. The final data were expressed in nmol of cell-associated fatty acid/min/1 × 108 cells. All transport data were analyzed using EnzymeKinetics software (version 1.0.4; Trinity Software). The data presented represents the mean from at least three independent experiments. W303a and W303a-fat1Δ-1 cells were grown in SMM at 30 °C to midlog phase (A600 = 1.0). One ml of cells were transferred to a tube containing 50 μM [9,10-3H]oleate (specific activity of 1 Ci/mmol, 50 μCi/ml). At the time points indicated, 1 volume of 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added to stop yeast fatty acid metabolism. The cells were immediately collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g) and resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After neutralization with 1 M KOH, cells were washed four times in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 μM fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using high performance thin layer chromatography as described by Knoll et al. (19Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells (FAT1 and fat1Δ) as noted for transport, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with yeast nitrogen base, resuspended to a density of 1.2 × 109 cells/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by three cycles of sonication at 0 °C. Acyl-CoA synthetase activities were determined in sonicated cell extracts as described by Kameda and Nunn (34Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM ATP, 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μM [3H]oleate, [3H]palmitate, or [3H]myristate, 0.5 mM coenzyme A, and cell extract in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The reactions were initiated with the addition of coenzyme A, incubated at 35 °C for 10 min, and terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol:n-heptane:1MH2SO4 (40:10:1). The radioactive fatty acid was removed by organic extraction using n-heptane. Acyl-CoA formed during the reaction remained in the aqueous fraction and was quantified by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations in the enzyme extracts and purified enzyme samples were determined using the Bradford assay and bovine serum albumin as a standard (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The values presented represent the average from at least three independent experiments. All experiments were analyzed using analysis variance (StatView; Abacus Concepts, Inc.) Cells were grown in SMM at 24 °C and prepared as described above for fatty acid transport. The fluorescent long-chain fatty acid analogue BODIPY-3823 was added from a 5 mM ethanolic stock solution to 1 ml of cells to a final concentration of 50 μM, and cells were incubated for 60 s. Cells were centrifuged and washed three times with 50 μM fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and the labeled cells were analyzed in a Olympus BH2 microscope using a Zeiss 63 × oil planapo objective, and in an MRC 1024 laser Sharp confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) on an Olympus BX50 with a × 60 objective. While the processes that mediate fatty acid uptake in yeast are not defined, it was reasonable to predict that a homologue of one or more of the three putative fatty acid transport proteins from higher eukaryotic cells may be required. We compared the sequence of FAT, mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (plasma membrane FABPpm), and FATP to open reading frames within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae data base. We were unable to find open reading frames within the yeast data base that had significant homology to FAT. While seven different reading frames on five different chromosomes were found to have homology to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, it was difficult to assess which if any of these open reading frames represented the FABPpm homologue in yeast. Of these comparisons, the FATP identified in 3T3-L1 adipocytes appeared to be the most promising candidate. We identified an open reading frame on yeast chromosome II encoding a 623-amino acid protein with 33% sequence identity and 54% similarity to FATP (Fig. 1A). We have designated this open reading frame Fat1p and the structural gene encoding this protein as FAT1. The sequence similarities and identities exist throughout the lengths of Fat1p and FATP and thus suggest they may have similar structures and functions. Three segments of these two proteins are nearly identical. The first segment, between amino acids 255 and 268 of Fat1p, contains a consensus sequence (LIYSGTTGLPK) common to members of the AMP-binding protein family including the family of acyl-CoA synthetases (36Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25513-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Deickman R. Lee Y-O van Liempt H. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The second and third regions of high sequence similarity include amino acid residues 324-399 and 491-544, respectively, and are restricted to Fat1p and FATP. Using the algorithms of Kyte and Doolittle (38Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar), we compared the hydropathy profiles of Fat1p and FATP (Fig. 1B). These analyses demonstrated that both proteins have comparable profiles and in particular predicted that Fat1p, like FATP, contains at least four potential membrane-spanning segments. Fat1p also has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. One of these glycosylation sites (at amino acid residue 534) is identical to that predicted for FATP. On the basis of these comparisons, we propose that Fat1p represents the yeast homologue of the murine long-chain fatty acid transport protein FATP. Examination of the DNA flanking the Fat1p coding sequence identified two potential TATA boxes. The first is found 301 bases upstream from the presumptive translational initiation codon, and the second is 119 bases upstream. Of the two, the first (TATATAA) is predicted to be a very strong binding site for TFIID (39Hahn S. Buratowski P.A. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). There were also two potential polyadenylation sites, AATAAAN14/22CA (14-22 nucleotides without consensus features), found 286 and 294 bases 3′ relative to the presumptive translational termination codon. Examination of the 5′ upstream region indicated that expression of the gene may be controlled by at least three regulators. There are three potential CCAAT elements located beginning at −846, −882, and −982 and two potential overcoming glucose repression elements (consensus (A/C)(A/G)GAAT) beginning at −130 and +88 bp from the predicted start of translation (40Sloots J.A. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since our prediction is that Fat1p is involved in fatty acid transport and metabolism, we searched for potential regulatory sites identified particularly in genes encoding other yeast proteins required for these functions. There were no matches to the consensus sequence for UASINO, which is CATGTGAAAT (41Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These elements are found in many genes whose product is required for phospholipid and fatty acid biosynthesis. Several genes encoding yeast peroxisomal proteins and the Δ9-acyl-CoA desaturase are activated or repressed, respectively, after growth in media containing oleate (42McHale M.W. Dubear K. Kroening D. Bernlohr D.A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have identified DNA elements important for response to oleate (43Einerhand A.W. Kos W. Distel D. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 44Wang T. Luo Y. Small G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each contains the minimal consensus sequence CGGN15/18CCG. There were no elements of this type identified in FAT1. A second oleate response element was identified in the peroxisomal trifunctional fatty acid oxidizing enzyme gene of C. tropicalis when expressed in S. cerevisiae (40Sloots J.A. Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The element has the consensus sequence YGTTRTT(A/C/G). We identified four regions upstream of FAT1 at −369, −520, −727, and −835, which conform to this consensus sequence. It is not known at this time whether any of these DNA segments contribute to the expression or regulation of FAT1. On the basis of the sequence similarities noted above, we predicted that Fat1p, like FATP, was involved in the uptake of long-chain fatty acids. To determine the function of Fat1p in this process, we disrupted FAT1 in S. cerevisiae by the replacement of a 480-bp internal EcoRI fragment (within the open reading frame of FAT1) with a 1.346-kilobase pair fragment encoding the yeast HIS3 gene. This construction was crossed onto the chromosome in the yeast strain W303a (his3) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and several transformants complementing the his3 mutation were identified. One such isolate, designated W303a-fat1Δ-1, was selected and shown to contain a disruption in FAT1 by DNA amplification using thermocycling. Genomic DNA purified from both the FAT1 and fat1Δ strains were amplified using oligonucleotides specific to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the open reading frame within FAT1. The DNA amplification product from the fat1Δ strain was approximately 0.9 kilobase pair larger than the product obtained from the parental strain, confirming that the FAT1::HIS3 fragment was integrated into the chromosome. Reverse transcription and amplification of total mRNA isolated from the FAT1 strain W303a grown in YPD containing 500 μM oleate demonstrated that this gene is expressed (data not shown). We initially tested whether the fat1Δ strain was phenotypically distinct from the parental FAT1 strain. FAT1 and fat1Δ cells were grown to midlog phase and diluted in yeast nitrogen base, and 2 × 103 cells were plated on cerulenin-containing media supplemented with oleate, palmitate, or myristate. The cultures were incubated at 24, 30, and 37 °C for 72 h. As predicted, both strains were unable to grow on YPD plates containing 25 μM cerulenin (YPD/CER) due to the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Growth of the FAT1 strain could be rescued at all temperatures by the addition of 500 μM myristate, palmitate, or oleate to the YPD/CER plates (YPD/CER/MY"

In vitro binding assays reveal that RGS5 and RGS16 bind to Gαi and Gαo subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, but not to Gαs.

A tissue-specific increase in oleate uptake was found in fa/fa and ZDF adipocytes, in which the Vmax was increased 9-fold (p < 0.005) and 13-fold (p < 0.001), respectively. This increase greatly exceeded the 2-fold increase in the surface area of adipocytes from obese animals, and did not result from trans-stimulation secondary to increased lipolysis.

To identify the minimal region of the Fas C-terminal necessary for binding to FAP-1, we employed an in vitro inhibition assay of Fas/FAP-1 binding using a series of synthetic peptides as well as a screen of random peptide libraries by the yeast two-hybrid system. The results showed that the C-terminal three amino acids (SLV) of human Fas were necessary and sufficient for its interaction with the third PDZ (GLGF) domain of FAP-1. Furthermore, the direct cytoplasmic microinjection of this tripeptide (Ac-SLV) resulted in the induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis in a colon cancer cell line that expresses both Fas and FAP-1.

https://openalex.org/W1971150563,"In this article we describe the molecular cloning of Pirin, a novel highly conserved 32-kDa protein consisting of 290 amino acids. Pirin was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen as an interactor of nuclear factor I/CCAAT box transcription factor (NFI/CTF1), which is known to stimulate adenovirus DNA replication and RNA polymerase II-driven transcription. Pirin mRNA is expressed weakly in all human tissues tested. About 15% of all Pirin cDNAs contain a short 34-base pair insertion in their 5′-untranslated regions, indicative of alternative splicing processes. Multiple Pirin transcripts are expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. Western blots and immunoprecipitations employing monoclonal anti-Pirin antibodies reveal that Pirin is a nuclear protein. Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence experiments demonstrate a predominant localization of Pirin within dot-like subnuclear structures. Homology searches using the BLAST algorithm indicate the existence of Pirin homologues in mouse and rat. The N-terminal half of Pirin is significantly conserved between mammals, plants, fungi, and even prokaryotic organisms. Genomic Southern and Western blots demonstrate the presence of Pirin genes and their expression, respectively, in all mammalian cell lines tested. The expression pattern, the concentrated localization in subnuclear structures, and its interaction with NFI/CTF1 in the two-hybrid system classify Pirin as a putative NFI/CTF1 cofactor, which might help to gain new insights in NFI/CTF1 functions."
https://openalex.org/W1979168888,"The Atmosphere Structure Instrument on the Galileo probe detected wavelike temperature fluctuations superimposed on a 700-kelvin temperature increase in Jupiter's thermosphere. These fluctuations are consistent with gravity waves that are viscously damped in the thermosphere. Moreover, heating by these waves can explain the temperature increase measured by the probe. This heating mechanism should be applicable to the thermospheres of the other giant planets and may help solve the long-standing question of the source of their high thermospheric temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2164928505,"Observations with the High Resolution Imager on the Rontgensatellit reveal x-ray emissions from Jupiter's equatorial latitudes. The observed emissions probably result from the precipitation of energetic (>300 kiloelectron volts per atomic mass unit) sulfur and oxygen ions out of Jupiter's inner radiation belt. Model calculations of the energy deposition by such heavy ion precipitation and of the resulting atmospheric heating rates indicate that this energy source can contribute to the high exospheric temperatures(>800 kelvin at 0.01 microbar) measured by the Galileo probe's Atmospheric Structure Instrument. Low-latitude energetic particle precipitation must therefore be considered, in addition to other proposed mechanisms such as gravity waves and soft electron precipitation, as an important source of heat for Jupiter's thermosphere."

Microinjection of cADPr into intact single T lymphocytes dose dependently induced repetitive but irregular Ca2+ spikes which were almost completely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ spikes induced by cADPr could be blocked either by co-injection of cADPr with the specific antagonist 8-NH2-cADPr, by omission of Ca2+ from the medium, or by superfusion of the cells with Zn2+ or SK-F 96365. Ratiometric digital Ca2+ imaging revealed that single Ca2+ spikes were initiated at several sites (“hot spots”) close to the plasma membrane. These hot spots then rapidly formed a circular zone of high Ca2+ concentration below the plasma membrane which subsequently propagated like a closing optical diaphragm into the center of the cell.

Hep3B cells were stably transfected with a wild-type Epo (EpoWT) cDNA or EpoM cDNA construct located downstream of a promoter of cytomegalovirus. Following inhibition of transcription, the half-lives of EpoWT and EpoM mRNAs were 7 h and 2.5 h in normoxia, respectively. The EpoM mRNA half-life remained unchanged in hypoxia. EpoWT mRNA half-life increased ~40% in response to a 6-h hypoxic pre-exposure and an additional ~50% when pre-exposed to 12 h hypoxia. The steady-state level of EpoWT mRNA was 4-fold that of EpoM mRNA reflecting the difference in mRNA decay rates in normoxia. The Epo protein level expressed from exogenous EpoM was unchanged in both normoxia and hypoxia.

The human hepatoblastoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B, have been used extensively to study Epo gene regulation because of their ability to secrete Epo in response to hypoxia and cobalt chloride in a physiological manner (6Goldberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Comparison of human and mouse Epo gene sequences has provided information regarding highly conserved cis-regulatory elements which exist within the 5′UTR, the first intron, and 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of the Epo gene (7Shoemaker C.B.

Analysis of these conserved sequences has provided abundant information regarding tissue- and stimulus-specific gene expression of Epo (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Using reporter gene constructs, a 3′ enhancer element flanking the Epo gene as well as a 5′ minimal sequence required for basal promoter activity have each been shown to confer a 4- to 14-fold induction of Epo gene transcription in response to hypoxia in Hep3B cells (11Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these elements appear to act synergistically by causing a 40- to 50-fold induction in transcription in response to hypoxia (11Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Blanchard K.L. Fandrey J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This induction in transcription leads to an increase in the Epo mRNA steady-state level throughout the first 8 h after which period the Epo mRNA level decreases (13Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increase in Epo mRNA level in response to hypoxia cannot be accounted for by a 5- to 10-fold increase in transcription rate in response to hypoxia (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Costa-Giomi P. Caro J. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, while Epo mRNA levels decrease during prolonged hypoxia, the Epo protein level continues to increase for up to 24 h following hypoxic induction (6Goldberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Epo gene expression may be partly regulated at the post-transcriptional level.Several genes which appear to be regulated by hypoxia are regulated at the post-transcriptional level (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 16Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Hugo H.M. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol.

Using Northern blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the half-life of Epo mRNA in normoxia was determined to be 1.5-2 h (13Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using actinomycin D to block transcription, the half-life of Epo mRNA was extended to 7-8 h in both normoxia and hypoxia (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Epo mRNA half-lives were also prolonged in Hep3B cells treated with cyclohexamide (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led Goldberg and co-workers (12Blanchard K.L. Fandrey J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F.

Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest that Epo mRNA stability may be modulated by a rapidly turning over destabilizing protein.We have previously reported that a protein(s), erythropoietin mRNA-binding protein, specifically binds to a pyrimidine-rich 120-bp region in the 3′UTR of Epo mRNA (17Rondon I.J.

We have also demonstrated that in vitro ERBP complex formation was increased using cytoplasmic lysates of various tissues from mice exposed to hypoxia (17Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B. Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. Bunn H.F. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the effect of ERBP complex formation on Epo mRNA stability in normoxia and hypoxia. A mutated Epo gene with a deleted ERBP binding region was generated. In addition, both wild-type and mutant Epo constructs lack hypoxic responsive elements such that changes in mRNA stability in hypoxia would only reflect hypoxic modulation of ERBP complex formation. We are fully aware that actinomycin D prolongs the half-life of Epo mRNA (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, actinomycin D may be employed in this study to determine the effect of ERBP complex formation on Epo mRNA stability, if ERBP complex formation is not affected by actinomycin D. Moreover, this study does not attempt to determine the physiological half-life of either the Epo wild-type or the mutated Epo mRNA, but rather to compare the differences in their mRNA stabilities. The mRNA half-lives, steady-state mRNA levels, and protein levels of Hep3B cells stably transfected with either the exogenous wild-type Epo gene or the mutant Epo gene and exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia were compared. Furthermore, the effect of ERBP complex formation on the mRNA stability of a heterologous gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), was examined.DISCUSSIONThe rate at which mRNA decays is a precise and complex process that can determine the level of gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, the process of mRNA degradation is primarily governed by specific cis-acting sequences, trans-acting factors, poly(A) shortening, endonucleolytic cleavage, and translation (22Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to environmental stimuli, mRNA decay rates can fluctuate and affect the expression of specific genes, thereby providing the cell with the flexibility to adapt to a changing environment.Epo gene regulation has been studied extensively and compared with other hypoxically regulated genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 23Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence that the expression of VEGF, TH, and Epo are regulated at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels upon exposure to hypoxia (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 24Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

The hypoxic induction of these three genes appears to require the activation of hypoxic inducible factor 1 suggesting that they may all share a common oxygen sensing pathway (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O.

In addition, the transcription rates of Epo, VEGF, and TH peak or plateau following hypoxic induction, while steady-state mRNA levels increase or remain elevated throughout the duration of hypoxic exposure (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Costa-Giomi P. Caro J. Weinmann R. J. Biol.

There is also evidence that hypoxic induction plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of TH and VEGF gene expression by increasing the stability of each mRNA in hypoxia (25Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

Similar to ERBP, proteins have been identified which bind to pyrimidine-rich regions in the 3′UTR of both TH mRNA and VEGF mRNA (26Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 28Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prior to our study, only the effect of the VEGF 3′UTR mRNA binding protein on VEGF mRNA stability has been demonstrated (26Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Epo gene expression may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level; however, no direct evidence has been reported to support this hypothesis. In our study, constructs containing only the Epo cDNA sequence were used; therefore, the observed differences in EpoWT mRNA and EpoM mRNA stability in both normoxia and hypoxia were attributed to the hypoxic modulation of ERBP complex formation.Actinomycin D has been reported to extend Epo mRNA half-life through the modulation of a putative protein(s) with a rapid turning over rate (12Blanchard K.L. Fandrey J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of actinomycin D on prolonging EpoWT mRNA and EpoM mRNA stability was expected to be equivalent if ERBP complex formation was not significantly altered by actinomycin D. We demonstrated that the effect of actinomycin D on ERBP complex formation was minimal up to 14 h following actinomycin D treatment. In determining mRNA half-lives, mRNA levels were measured up to 14 h following the addition of actinomycin D. Therefore, the level of EpoWT mRNA and pCAT-EpoWT mRNA at the last time point may have been only slightly underestimated.The absence of ERBP complex formation with EpoM run-off RNA demonstrates that a 104-bp region contained the binding site for ERBP. mRNA steady-state levels represent the difference between the rate of mRNA induction and rate of mRNA decay. Exogenous mRNA transcription levels of EpoWT mRNA and EpoM mRNA were under the control of a constitutive promoter from cytomegalovirus. Therefore, in normoxia, the 4-fold increase in EpoWT mRNA steady-state level compared with the steady-state EpoM mRNA level, reflected the difference in exogenous Epo mRNA decay rates. The EpoWT mRNA half-life in normoxia was 7 h which is consistent with previous findings of the half-life for endogenous Epo mRNA in actinomycin D-treated Hep3B cells after hypoxic pre-treatment (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shorter half-life of EpoM mRNA, 2.6 h, implies that ERBP complex formation acts to stabilize Epo mRNA. Moreover, this hypothesis is further supported by results of increased CAT activity and prolonged CAT mRNA stability under normoxia in Hep3B cells transfected with pCAT-EpoWT compared with those transfected with either pCAT-EpoM or pcDNA3-CAT.Although genes of interest with various deleted sequences in the 3′UTR have been used extensively to identify the specific mRNA control sites and to elucidate the mechanisms through which they mediate mRNA stability, such data must be interpreted cautiously. We cannot exclude the possibility that the 87-bp deletion may have contained a “stabilizing” cis-element. Moreover, mRNA-binding proteins may bind to either specific mRNA sequences or intrinsic stem-loop(s) structures. It is interesting that when we examined a computer-predicted secondary structure of Epo mRNA, this pyrimidine-rich ERBP binding region is part of several stems pairing with regions in 5′UTR, coding sequence, and further downstream in the 3′UTR. Specific point mutations to disrupt the pairing in different stem regions will help to delineate whether the secondary structure of Epo mRNA plays a crucial role in ERBP complex formation. A 188-bp region downstream and adjacent to the ERBP binding site has been identified to contain a destabilizing cis-element. Deletion of this region prolonged Epo mRNA half-life to 15 h compared with the endogenous Epo mRNA half-life, 2 h (30Ho V. Acquaviva A. Duh E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10084-10090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Part of this region forms a stem with the ERBP binding site, and we speculate that ERBP complex formation may play a role in protecting Epo mRNA as the substrate of endonucleolytic cleavage in this region.The half-lives of exogenous EpoM mRNAs were nearly identical, i.e. 2.5-3 h, when cultured in normoxia and exposed to either 6- or 12-h hypoxia. However, exogenous EpoWT mRNA half-life was increased 38% and an additional 49% over normoxic levels in cells exposed to 6- and 12-h hypoxia, respectively. Rondon et al. (17Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B. Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. Bunn H.F. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported that while ERBP appears to be hypoxically up-regulated in various mouse tissues, there did not appear to be a difference in ERBP complex formation from cytoplasmic lysates derived from Hep3B cells cultured in either normoxia or hypoxia. However, using modified binding conditions, ERBP complex formation was increased using cytoplasmic lysates from Hep3B cells exposed to hypoxia. 2A. Scandurro, and B. S. Beckman, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, the prolonged half-life of EpoWT mRNA is most likely due to increased ERBP complex formation under hypoxia. In contrast, the half-life of EpoM mRNA, lacking the ERBP binding site, remained unchanged in hypoxia. Furthermore, the hypoxic modulation of Epo mRNA was supported by comparing Epo levels expressed by endogenous Epo, exogenous EpoM, or exogenous EpoWT measured in normoxia or after 20-h hypoxia. In hypoxia, Epo produced by Hep3B cells transfected with pcDNA3-EpoM was twice the amount produced by endogenous Epo in untransfected Hep3B cells, and it was also twice that produced by pcDNA3-EpoM in normoxia. This suggests that the absence of ERBP binding formation is likely responsible for the non-hypoxic responsive expression of the exogenous EpoM gene. However, there was a 1.7-fold difference between the Epo level expressed by the exogenous EpoWT gene under hypoxia and normoxia, likely due to the ~2-fold increase in EpoWT mRNA half-life observed in prolonged hypoxia.We conclude that the increase in Epo mRNA stability in hypoxia may account for the discrepancy between decreasing Epo mRNA steady-state levels and increasing Epo expression observed in prolonged hypoxia. We have demonstrated that Epo mRNA stability is increased by the binding of ERBP to the 3′UTR of Epo mRNA. Moreover, the increase in Epo mRNA stability in hypoxia is likely modulated by an increase in ERBP complex formation in hypoxia. Our data have provided the first evidence that Epo mRNA stability is regulated at the post-transcriptional level and shed some light on the mechanism of Epo gene regulation.

Med. 1975; 58: 25-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The human hepatoblastoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B, have been used extensively to study Epo gene regulation because of their ability to secrete Epo in response to hypoxia and cobalt chloride in a physiological manner (6Goldberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Comparison of human and mouse Epo gene sequences has provided information regarding highly conserved cis-regulatory elements which exist within the 5′UTR, the first intron, and 3′- and 5′-flanking regions of the Epo gene (7Shoemaker C.B. Mitsock L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8McDonald J.D. Lin K.F. Goldwasser E. Mol. Cell.

Analysis of these conserved sequences has provided abundant information regarding tissue- and stimulus-specific gene expression of Epo (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Using reporter gene constructs, a 3′ enhancer element flanking the Epo gene as well as a 5′ minimal sequence required for basal promoter activity have each been shown to confer a 4- to 14-fold induction of Epo gene transcription in response to hypoxia in Hep3B cells (11Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these elements appear to act synergistically by causing a 40- to 50-fold induction in transcription in response to hypoxia (11Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Blanchard K.L. Fandrey J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This induction in transcription leads to an increase in the Epo mRNA steady-state level throughout the first 8 h after which period the Epo mRNA level decreases (13Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increase in Epo mRNA level in response to hypoxia cannot be accounted for by a 5- to 10-fold increase in transcription rate in response to hypoxia (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Costa-Giomi P. Caro J. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, while Epo mRNA levels decrease during prolonged hypoxia, the Epo protein level continues to increase for up to 24 h following hypoxic induction (6Goldberg M.A. Glass G.A. Cunningham J.M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that Epo gene expression may be partly regulated at the post-transcriptional level.Several genes which appear to be regulated by hypoxia are regulated at the post-transcriptional level (10Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 16Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Hugo H.M. Bauer C. Gassmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27865-27870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Using Northern blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the half-life of Epo mRNA in normoxia was determined to be 1.5-2 h (13Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments using actinomycin D to block transcription, the half-life of Epo mRNA was extended to 7-8 h in both normoxia and hypoxia (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Epo mRNA half-lives were also prolonged in Hep3B cells treated with cyclohexamide (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led Goldberg and co-workers (12Blanchard K.L. Fandrey J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest that Epo mRNA stability may be modulated by a rapidly turning over destabilizing protein.We have previously reported that a protein(s), erythropoietin mRNA-binding protein, specifically binds to a pyrimidine-rich 120-bp region in the 3′UTR of Epo mRNA (17Rondon I.J.

We have also demonstrated that in vitro ERBP complex formation was increased using cytoplasmic lysates of various tissues from mice exposed to hypoxia (17Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B. Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. Bunn H.F. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the effect of ERBP complex formation on Epo mRNA stability in normoxia and hypoxia. A mutated Epo gene with a deleted ERBP binding region was generated. In addition, both wild-type and mutant Epo constructs lack hypoxic responsive elements such that changes in mRNA stability in hypoxia would only reflect hypoxic modulation of ERBP complex formation. We are fully aware that actinomycin D prolongs the half-life of Epo mRNA (14Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, actinomycin D may be employed in this study to determine the effect of ERBP complex formation on Epo mRNA stability, if ERBP complex formation is not affected by actinomycin D. Moreover, this study does not attempt to determine the physiological half-life of either the Epo wild-type or the mutated Epo mRNA, but rather to compare the differences in their mRNA stabilities. The mRNA half-lives, steady-state mRNA levels, and protein levels of Hep3B cells stably transfected with either the exogenous wild-type Epo gene or the mutant Epo gene and exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia were compared. Furthermore, the effect of ERBP complex formation on the mRNA stability of a heterologous gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), was examined.

A Pol II mutant, polB100, was obtained by mutagenizing cells and assaying for the absence of Pol II activity in crude cell lysates (2Campbell J.L. Soll L. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibiotic concentrations were: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; and kanamycin, 30 μg/ml. Genetic and molecular procedures were standard (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from HMS83 was prepared using phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and packaged using a Lambda EMBL4 vector, from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA., and plated on E. coli Y1088 (Stratagene). A 2.4-kilobase wild-type polB (dinA) fragment from pHY400 (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar) was used as the probe to isolate the polB100 gene from the HMS83 genomic library. Phage DNA from a positive clone was purified and digested with PvuII and PstI. A 5.0-kilobase fragment containing the polB100 gene, determined by Southern hybridization, was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector pT7T318U (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was digested with PstI and SmaI, and the 5.0-kilobase fragment was then subcloned into pT7T318U for sequencing. The entire polB gene and surrounding regions, spanning about 300 base pairs to each side, were sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Site-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) of the wild-type polB overexpression plasmid, pHY400, was used to construct the polB100 overexpressing plasmid, pZQ83. A 25-mer oligonucleotide with a single base substitution in the middle was used. The primer sequence was 5′-CATCACGTAGCCGCAGGGCTGGCG-3′, where, located 14 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus, was incorporated in place of C to generate the mutant primer sequence. After this plasmid was constructed, the 2.4-kilobase polB fragment was resequenced to ensure that this was the only mutation in the gene. The pZQ83 plasmid (AmpR) was transformed into strain ZQ100 (KanR, TetR), a polB deletion strain, so that the mutant enzyme Pol B100 could be purified in the absence of wild-type Pol II. We succeeded in purifying Pol B100 using the same purification procedure used previously for wild-type Pol II (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although we had no difficulty obtaining a high expression level of Pol B100 in the presence of wild-type Pol II, we were unable to overexpress Pol B100 substantially in a Pol II null mutant background. Because the specific activity for nucleotide incorporation of Pol B100 was also extremely low, about 5-10% of that of wild-type, Western gels were run with a high-titer anti-Pol II antibody (11Escarcellar M. Hicks J. Gudmundsson G. Trump G. Touati D. Lovett S. Foster P. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6221-6228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to identify Pol B100 after each purification step. The concentration of Pol B100 was determined by comparing its band intensity in a Western blot with that of a known amount of wild-type Pol II. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay kit from Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA. Extension of a 5′-32P-labeled primer was used as an assay for DNA polymerase activity. Two primer-template DNA constructs were used: the first contained a 32P-labeled 15-mer annealed to an M13 DNA; the second is a gapped primer-template DNA formed by annealing an unlabeled 15-mer downstream from the 32P-labeled primer to generate a 60-mer gap. The assays were carried out as described previously (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following a 5-min reaction, the elongated primer extension product was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The integrated intensities of the primer extension bands were measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to determine the polymerase activities for the mutant and wild-type Pol II. We assayed for potential trace contamination of Pol B100 by Pol I by preincubating purified Pol B100 on ice for 5 min in the presence of anti-Pol I antibody or by a mock preincubation serum in the absence of antibody, followed by an additional 1-min preincubation at room temperature. Primer elongation was then carried out at 37 °C for 5 min (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the difference in elongation catalyzed by Pol B100 in the presence and absence of anti-Pol I antibody served as a measure of Pol I contamination. Klenow fragment (2 units) was used as a positive control to show that the Pol I Ab was active; 1 unit catalyzes incorporation of 10 nmol of nt in 30 min at 37 °C. Trace contamination with Pol III was examined by incubating Pol B100 in the presence of SSB or β and γ complex. Pol II and Pol III core, a complex containing the α polymerase subunit, the γ 3′-exonuclease proofreading subunit, and the θ subunit, are both stimulated to carry out highly processive DNA synthesis in the presence of β and γ complex (17Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M. McEntee K. Echols H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, SSB strongly inhibits Pol III core in the absence of β, γ complex, whereas Pol II activity is either stimulated using primed M13 DNA or is unaffected by SSB using gapped DNA (18Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 167Google Scholar). 3′-Exonuclease activity was measured by degradation of either free 5′-32P-labeled primer molecules (15-mers) or degradation of 32P-labeled primer molecules annealed to M13 template DNA (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The incubation conditions were similar to those used to measure primer elongation except that deoxynucleoside triphosphates were excluded from the reaction. A two-dimensional in situ gel assay (following subsection) was used to determine the fraction of exonuclease activity associated with the Pol B100 polypeptide and the fraction of activity attributable to contaminating exonucleases. A 5′-32P-labeled 30-mer primer annealed to M13 DNA contained a two-base mismatch at the 3′-primer terminus. The labeled primer-template DNA was cast in a standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and purified Pol B 100 was loaded on the gel. Electrophoresis, carried out in the first dimension, resolved proteins having different molecular weights. Removal of SDS by dialysis permitted protein renaturation to occur, thereby allowing exonuclease digestion of mismatched primer-template DNA in situ (19Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Gel slices containing product DNA were recast in a second gel, and primer molecules of different lengths were resolved by electrophoresis carried out in the second gel dimension. Integrated band intensities corresponding to the presence of exonucleolytically degraded 32P-labeled primers of different lengths were quantified by phosphorimaging. We introduced the wild-type dinA gene into HMS83 by growing HMS83 to mid-log phase (A600, 0.5-0.6), followed by infection with a lambda phage (λGG30 2G. Gudmundsson and M. F. Goodman, unpublished results. ) carrying wild-type dinA. The HMS83 strain, containing lambda, carries both wild-type Pol II and mutant Pol B100. A mixture of Pol B100 and wild-type Pol II was purified from this strain by the standard Pol II purification method (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and assayed for polymerase and 3′-exonuclease activities as described above. The earliest Pol II mutants were assigned to the polB locus (4Campbell J.L. Shizuya H. Richardson C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hirota Y. Gefter M. Mindich L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3238-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but recent evidence indicates that the damage-inducible dinA gene is the structural gene coding for Pol II (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Walker G. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6268-6273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is located counterclockwise of polB by approximately 1 min on the E. coli chromosome (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)(Fig. 1). A clearly defined role for Pol II in either replication or repair has yet to emerge; therefore, it is important to ask if polB might be a negative regulator of Pol II expression, or alternatively, if polB and dinA represent the same gene. To address this issue, we have investigated the relationship between polB and dinA and have purified and characterized the Pol B100 gene product and compared it with wild-type Pol II. The strain HMS83, containing both the polB100 allele and an amber mutant in Pol I (polA1), was used to isolate Pol II. Crude cell lysates prepared from HMS83 contained a protein that cross-reacts with a high-titer, highly selective, anti-Pol II polyclonal antibody (11Escarcellar M. Hicks J. Gudmundsson G. Trump G. Touati D. Lovett S. Foster P. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6221-6228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shows the same migration on a Western gel as purified wild-type Pol II (Fig. 2). To isolate the gene coding for Pol II from HMS83, we used an oligonucleotide containing the wild-type dinA sequence to hybridize to HMS83 genomic DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). We cloned and sequenced the dinA gene from HMS83, containing the polB100 allele, and found that it contained a single G → A base substitution at nucleotide position 1309 in dinA, causing a substitution of Gly → Asp at position 401 (G401E) in Pol II (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of a mutation in the structural gene encoding Pol II in the polB100 mutant strain strongly suggests that polB100 is this mutant dinA, i.e. polB is identical to dinA. We will, therefore, refer to the mutant Pol II protein (G401E) as Pol B100. To study the effect of the Gly to Asp mutation on the enzymatic properties of Pol II, we made a site-directed G → A base substitution at nucleotide position 1309 in the dinA gene and placed it on a high copy number plasmid. We purified Pol B100 using as an assay its cross-reactivity against anti-Pol II antibody in Western gels (Fig. 2). It is necessary to overexpress Pol B100 in a strain devoid of wild-type Pol II activity to investigate the polymerase and proofreading properties of the mutant enzyme. For reasons that are unclear, we found previously that the level of overproduction of an exonuclease-deficient mutant of Pol II on a plasmid (16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was roughly 50-fold less in a Pol II null-mutant background than in a wild-type background. The level of overproduction of Pol B100 was found to be compromised in a similar manner. Nevertheless, we were able to purify Pol B100 from the Pol II null-mutant background and assay its polymerase and proofreading activities distinct from either Pol I or Pol III. Clp A, a member of the Clp family of proteases (20Gottesman S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7886-7893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to copurify with Pol B100. Therefore, a clpA deletion strain, ZQ100, was used for purification of Pol B100 (see “Experimental Procedures”). A standard 32P-labeled primer extension assay was used to compare deoxynucleotide incorporation activities of Pol B100 with wild-type Pol II (Fig. 3). Wild-type Pol II was observed to fill a 60-nt gap entirely, whereas Pol B100 added an average of only 2 or 3 nt with barely observable extension bands out to about 10 nt. Pol B100 has approximately 5-10% of the polymerase activity of wild-type Pol II, based on integration of the primer extension band intensities when equimolar concentrations of each enzyme were present in the primer extension assay (Fig. 3). 3′→ 5′ exonucleolytic degradation of the primers was observed for both polymerases, as shown by the appearance of lower molecular weight bands below the original primer band (Fig. 3). We will later present data showing that the proofreading activities of Pol B100 and wild-type Pol II are similar, if not identical. Pol B100 has a 10-20-fold lower polymerase-specific activity than wild-type Pol II and cannot be overexpressed significantly in a null dinA mutant. Therefore, it is necessary to show that the low polymerase activity is attributable to Pol B100 and not to the presence of trace contaminants of either Pol I or Pol III. A primer extension assay run in either the presence or absence of polyclonal Ab prepared against Pol I was used to show that residual Pol B100 activity is not caused by Pol I (Fig. 4). Weak primer extension catalyzed by Pol B100 is unaffected by the presence of anti-Pol I Ab (Fig. 4: compare lane 2 −Pol I Ab, with lane 3, + Pol I Ab). The 10-20-fold higher rate of primer extension catalyzed by wild-type Pol II is also insensitive to the presence of anti-Pol I Ab (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5), in contrast to the strong inhibitory of effect of anti-Pol I Ab on Pol I Klenow fragment activity (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). A hallmark property of Pol II is its ability to interact with the β processivity clamp protein in the presence of the γ clamp loading complex (17Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M. McEntee K. Echols H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hughes Jr., A.J. Bryan S.K. Chen H. Moses R.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4568-4573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4120-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The β, γ complex are components of the Pol III holoenzyme, a complex containing a Pol III core and the β sliding clamp and five-protein subunit clamp loading γ complex (23Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Both Pol II and Pol III core synthesize DNA processively in the presence of β, γ complex and SSB (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 8, respectively). Synthesis by either Pol II or Pol III core alone is considerably less processive (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 9), as shown by the presence of many more intermediate bands migrating between the unextended primer (Fig. 5, lane 1) and 60-nt full-length product DNA (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 9). The mutant Pol B100 was stimulated to synthesize full-length product DNA in the presence of β, γ complex and SSB (Fig. 5, lane 2), whereas synthesis was weakly distributive in the absence of the processivity factors (Fig. 5, lane 3). Thus, the mutant Pol B100 retained the ability to synthesize DNA processively in the presence of β, γ complex + SSB, despite its compromised ability to synthesize DNA. The presence of SSB in the reaction, in the absence of β, γ complex, provides a means to distinguish between primer extension catalyzed by either Pol II or Pol III. Pol III core activity is inhibited strongly by SSB, whereas Pol II is insensitive to SSB on a gapped DNA template (18Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 167Google Scholar). Primer extension products catalyzed by Pol III core were significantly reduced in size and intensity in the presence of SSB (Fig. 5, lane 10). In contrast to the strong inhibitory effect of SSB on synthesis by Pol III core, DNA synthesis by wild-type Pol II was slightly stimulated in the presence of SSB (Fig. 5, lane 7). The key finding is that synthesis by Pol B100 was essentially unaffected by SSB (Fig. 5, lane 4). Thus, it is unlikely that trace contamination by Pol III core is responsible for the primer extension activity observed in the purified Pol B100 fraction. -To demonstrate that 3′-exonuclease activity is an integral part of Pol B100, we ran an in situ two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel (19Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which allows identification of exonucleolytic degradation products and the relative size of the 3′-exonuclease that forms each product. A 32P-labeled primer annealed to ssM13 DNA was cast within a SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to loading Pol B100. The gel was run under denaturing conditions in the first dimension to separate proteins having different molecular mass. Exonucleolytic degradation of the primer molecules occurred in situ following removal of the denaturant by diffusion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lanes cut from the original gel were run on a separate gel, in a second dimension, to resolve primers of different lengths. A detailed technical description of the in situ activity assay is given by Longley and Mosbaugh (19Longley M.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 587-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The intense horizontal band observed on the gel corresponds to nondegraded 30-mer primer molecules (Fig. 6). Exonucleolytic degradation products, ranging from 29 to 23 nt, are present as less intense bands running below the undigested primer band (Fig. 6). The location of each of the product bands along the horizontal direction is determined by the molecular mass of the 3′-exonuclease. Wild-type Pol II gives rise to a single product band (Fig. 6a) at a position corresponding to the 89.9-kDa molecular mass of Pol II (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Walker G. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6268-6273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two sets of primer degradation bands were observed for Pol B100 (Fig. 6b); one at the 89.9-kDa location of Pol II, and the other generated by a contaminating exonuclease having a molecular mass of about 30 kDa. When Pol B100 and wild-type Pol II were mixed together and assayed in situ (Fig. 6c), the banding pattern was identical to that for Pol B100 (Fig. 6b). The mixing data support the idea that Pol B100 contains an associated 3′-exonuclease activity. We measured the rate of primer degradation and found that Pol B100 has approximately the same level of exonuclease activity as wild-type Pol II. Note that in the gel shown in Fig. 6, the amount of wild-type Pol II used was 10 times greater than Pol B100. Pol I Klenow fragment (Fig. 6d) was run in a separate control lane to verify that its degradation products ran at a location consistent with the molecular mass (68 kDa) of the enzyme. We also verified that the degradation products of Pol I ran at a molecular mass of 109 kDa, but the bands were less intense because of a loss of signal emanating from the removal of the 5′-32P label by Pol I-associated 5′→ 3′ exonuclease activity (data not shown). The strain carrying polB100 was originally characterized as having no detectable Pol II activity (4Campbell J.L. Shizuya H. Richardson C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have shown that Pol B100 purified from the polB100 (HMS83) mutant strain contains a Gly401→ Asp401 replacement causing a large reduction in polymerase activity, there remains a remote possibility for the existence of an additional mutation in HMS83 that might suppress or inactivate Pol II. To investigate this possibility, we infected HMS83 with a lambda phage containing a wild-type copy of Pol II (see “Experimental Procedures”) and carried out the standard Pol II purification. A 32P-labeled primer annealed to M13 DNA was extended using either 10 ng of Pol II purified from polB100 (HMS83(λGG13)), which carried a single copy of the dinA gene on lambda and a single chromosomal copy of polB100, (Fig. 7, lane 2), or extended using 5 ng of purified wild-type Pol II (Fig. 7, lane 3). DNA synthesis in lane 2 results from the combined action of wild-type Pol II and mutant Pol B100, present presumably at approximately equimolar concentrations. Pol B100 makes a negligible contribution to the integrated band intensities in lane 2 because the mutant polymerase is 10-20 times less active than wild-type Pol II. The primer extension rates are roughly similar in lanes 2 and 3, and because twice as much protein was present in the lane 2 reaction, it follows that the specific activities were similar for wild-type Pol II purified from the λ-infected polB100 and wild-type polB+ strains. We, therefore, conclude that the 10-20-fold reduction in Pol II activity in the polB100 mutant is caused by replacement of a single amino acid, Gly401→ Asp401, in the dinA gene rather than by the presence of an additional mutation in a “putative” polB control gene. In the 27 years since E. coli Pol II was discovered in 1970 (1Knippers R. Nature. 1970; 228: 1050-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a specific role for this enzyme in DNA replication or repair has not been defined. The structural gene for Pol II was originally thought to be at the polB locus located clockwise of leu, at about 2 min on the E. coli chromosomal map (4Campbell J.L. Shizuya H. Richardson C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hirota Y. Gefter M. Mindich L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3238-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1). However, it was subsequently shown that the structural gene is the SOS-controlled dinA gene, mapping at about 1 min (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Walker G. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6268-6273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in location left open the possibility that polB might act as a control gene for Pol II. In this study, we set out to clarify the relationship between polB and dinA and to characterize Pol II purified from the dinA gene of the polB100 mutant strain (4Campbell J.L. Shizuya H. Richardson C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 494-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found a single G → A base substitution at nucleotide position 1309 in the dinA gene cloned from the E. coli strain HMS83 carrying the polB100 mutant allele. This mutation results in the substitution of Gly → Asp at amino acid position 401 in Pol II. Sequence analysis of the upstream region of dinA from HMS83 showed that the promoter element was located two nucleotides downstream from the 3′ end of araD, as shown previously for wild-type dinA (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and a comparison of sequences surrounding dinA from HMS83 found them to be identical to their wild-type counterpart (7Bonner C.A. Hays S. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7663-7667Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Walker G. Shinagawa H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6268-6273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the polB100 mutant strain HMS83 contains a mutant dinA gene having the same surrounding sequences as wild-type dinA is conclusive evidence that polB and dinA are identical. The polB100 mutant was originally identified by the absence of Pol II polymerase activity in cell lysates prepared from the mutant strain (2Campbell J.L. Soll L. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2090-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We made a site-directed G → A base substitution at nucleotide position 1309 in the dinA gene, placed it on a high copy number plasmid, and purified the mutant Pol II protein (G401E), which we refer to as Pol B100, on the basis of its cross-reactivity against anti-Pol II antibody in Western gels (Fig. 2). We found that Pol B100 contains about 5-10% of the wild-type Pol II polymerase activity (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the substitution of Gly401→ Asp401 causes a dramatic reduction in nucleotide incorporation activity because this mutation is not located in any of the five conserved domains characteristic of the group B (“α-like”) polymerases (24Jung G.H. Leavitt M.C. Hsieh J.C. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8287-8291Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Wang T.S. Wong S.W. Korn D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Replacement of the nonpolar Gly by the polar Asp probably does not cause a dramatic change in the overall physical properties of Pol B100 compared with wild-type Pol II because the purification scheme used for wild-type Pol II (14Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. Campbell J.L. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 13-22Google Scholar, 16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used successfully in purifying the mutant enzyme. However, a large change may be occurring in the active conformation of the mutant polymerase, which will be interesting to investigate by x-ray crystallography (26Anderson W.F. Prince D.B. Yu H. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We showed that residual polymerase activity in the purified Pol B100 preparation was not attributable to contamination by either Pol I or Pol III. Incubation of Pol B100 in the presence of anti-Pol I antibody had no measurable effect on deoxynucleotide incorporation, demonstrating that Pol I was not responsible for the low level of polymerase activity in purified Pol B100 fractions (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). Contamination by Pol III core was ruled out by showing that SSB inhibited primer elongation by Pol III core (Fig. 5, lanes 9 and 10) but not by Pol B100 (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). Both Pol III and Pol II were shown to carry out processive DNA synthesis in the presence of the β sliding clamp and clamp loading γ complex (17Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M. McEntee K. Echols H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hughes Jr., A.J. Bryan S.K. Chen H. Moses R.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4568-4573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weak DNA synthesis catalyzed by Pol B100 was primarily distributive in the absence of β and γ complex (Fig. 5, lane 3). However, despite its low polymerase activity, Pol B100 was able to catalyze processive DNA synthesis in the presence of β, γ complex + SSB (Fig. 5, lane 2), demonstrating that Pol B100 retained Pol II-like biochemical properties. Pol II contains an active 3′→ 5′ exonuclease proofreading activity (16Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15327-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the strongly detrimental effect of the Gly401→ Asp401 replacement on polymerase activity, the mutant enzyme retained a normal level of 3′→ 5′ exonuclease proofreading activity. A mutator phenotype resulted when Pol II was replaced on the E. coli chromosome by a proofreading-defective Pol II allele (27Rangarajan S. Gudmundsson G. Qiu Z. Foster P.L. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found an increase in forward spontaneous mutations rates at rpoB and gyrA loci in a Pol III antimutator (dnaE915) background in normally dividing cells, and a measurement of the spectrum of rpoB chromosomal mutations revealed a G → A transition hot spot specific to the proofreading-defective Pol II exo−. There was also an increase in reversion rates of F′(lacZ) base substitutions and frameshifts in the presence of wild-type Pol III (27Rangarajan S. Gudmundsson G. Qiu Z. Foster P.L. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to the mutator effects of Pol II in dividing cells, a loss of Pol II proofreading also resulted in an increased reversion rate of an F′(lacZ) frameshift mutation in nondividing cells (28Foster P.L. Gudmundsson G. Trimarchi J.M. Cai H. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results document the importance of Pol II-associated proofreading in controlling chromosomal and episomal mutagenesis in vivo. Therefore, the difficulty in defining a phenotype for the polB100 strain may be attributed to the presence of a wild-type proofreading activity for the mutant Pol B100 (Fig. 6). Although a well defined role for Pol II in replication or repair has not yet been defined, it has now been established that Pol II is involved in controlling mutation rates in vivo (27Rangarajan S. Gudmundsson G. Qiu Z. Foster P.L. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Foster P.L. Gudmundsson G. Trimarchi J.M. Cai H. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ability of Pol II to share polymerase accessory proteins with Pol III to achieve high processivity offers the potential for Pol II to “take over” for Pol III, perhaps to carry out specialized tasks requiring moderate to high processivity that cannot be performed by Pol I. We have found that the number of Pol II molecules per cell is in the range of 30-50. 3Z. Qiu and M. F. Goodman, unpublished results. Because there are only about four Pol III molecules per cell (18Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 167Google Scholar), one might expect to find conditions in which Pol II might compete favorably against Pol III for access to the β processivity clamp. Pol II levels are induced by 7-fold following induction of SOS (6Bonner C.A. Randall S.K. Rayssiguier C. Radman M. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18946-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Pol III levels increase by only 2-fold, at most (6Bonner C.A. Randall S.K. Rayssiguier C. Radman M. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18946-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of DNA damage, the increase in intracellular Pol II concentrations might enable the enzyme to recruit the processivity subunits to fill in repair patches numbering perhaps hundreds to thousands of bases. We speculate that Pol II can substitute for Pol III and vice versa in catalyzing long-patch repair. However, the small number of Pol III molecules might place stringent restrictions on the sole use of Pol III to carry out both semi-conservative replication and repair DNA synthesis. It may then fall to Pol II to “pick up the slack” in either or both processes, particularly when SOS is turned on. Now that Pol II has been shown to play a role in the synthesis of chromosomal and episomal DNA in dividing and nondividing cells, it is timely and important to eliminate ambiguities arising from the different map locations of polB and dinA. Data presented in this paper, documenting that polB and dinA are the same gene, eliminate an uncertainty in the pathway governing the regulation of Pol II. We express our appreciation to Dr. Kevin McEntee of UCLA for generous help in all aspects of this work and to Dr. McEntee and Dr. John Petruska, USC, for constructive comments concerning the manuscript. We are grateful for the efforts of Dr. Gary Trump, USC, for preparation of Pol II antibodies and for his continued interest in these studies."

Our studies of the immune response to LAMP-targeted proteins has led to the application of a HIV-1 gp160/LAMP chimeric gene as a novel means to enhance the MHC II presentation of gp160. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that the gp160/LAMP protein had a cellular localization corresponding to that of lysosomes. Pulse-chase analysis confirmed that the rates of synthesis of gp160/LAMP and wild type gp160 were comparable and that both proteins were processed to gp120 at similar rates. However, the gp160/LAMP was degraded more rapidly than the wild type gp160. MHC II-mediated T cell proliferation assays performed with cloned human cell lines showed that gp160/LAMP stimulated greater responses than did the wild type gp160. Moreover, mice vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia expressing gp160/LAMP had greater gp160-specific lymphoproliferation responses and higher titers of anti-V3 loop antibodies than mice vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia expressing wild type gp160."

It makes base-specific contacts via the minor groove, including one to the 1st position of a 5′-TNAT-3′ core by a conserved arginine (Arg-5). Here we show that Arg-5 also contributes to the stability of HOX·PBX complexes, apparently by forming the same DNA contact. We further show that heterodimers of PBX with HOXA1 or HOXD4 proteins have different specificities at another position recognized by the N-terminal arm (the 2nd position in the TNAT core). Importantly, N-terminal arm residues 2 and 3, which distinguish the binding of HOXA1 and HOXD4 monomers, play no role in the specificity of their complexes with PBX. In addition, HOXD9 and HOXD10, which are capable of binding both TTAT and TAAT sites as monomers, can cooperate with PBX1A only on a TTAT site.

https://openalex.org/W2103250483,"Human lactoferrin (hLF) is an iron-binding protein involved in host defense against infection and severe inflammation. Transgenic mice were produced harboring either hLF cDNA or genomic hLF sequences fused to regulatory elements of the bovine alphaS1 casein gene. Recombinant hLF expressed in the milk of transgenic mice (transgenic hLF) was compared with natural (human milk-derived) hLF. Immunological identity of the two forms was shown by double antibody immunoassays and the absence of an anti-hLF antibody response in transgenic mice on hyperimmunization with natural hLF. Mono S cation-exchange chromatography and N-terminal protein sequencing of transgenic and natural hLF revealed identical cationicity and N-terminal sequences. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and absorbance measurements of purified transgenic hLF showed this protein was 90% saturated with iron, whereas natural hLF is only 3% saturated. The pH-mediated release of iron from transgenic hLF was not different from that of iron-saturated natural hLF. Unsaturated transgenic hLF could be completely resaturated upon addition of iron. Slight differences in mobility between transgenic and natural hLF on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were abolished by enzymatic deglycosylation. Binding of transgenic and natural hLF to a range of ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, heparin, single-stranded DNA, Cibacron blue FG 3A, and lectins, was not different. Based on these observations, we anticipate that (unsaturated) rhLF and natural hLF will exert similar, if not identical, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1975672913,"Recently, we identified a novel putative human cytokine expressed by activated CD8+ T cells, which was designated ATAC (ctivation-induced, cell-derived, nd hemokine-related; the same molecule has been identified independently as lymphotactin and single cysteine motif-1).

All groups identified ATAC/single cysteine motif-1/lymphotactin at the cDNA level using methods of reverse genetics, without knowing the biological role of the molecule. The functional experiments reported to date were thus based on the hypothesis that mature ATAC is a secreted molecule and were performed with recombinant proteins assumed to structurally represent the natural cytokine. Since it has been shown for several chemokines that their function is strictly dependent on the correct NH2 terminus (the addition or loss of even a single amino acid residue can have dramatic functional consequences) (10Clark-Lewis I.

This report describes the purification and structural and biochemical characterization of secreted ATAC. In addition, we provide initial functional data obtained with purified natural ATAC and a synthetic analog. The polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a SphI restriction site proximal to Gly23 of human ATAC cDNA and a HindIII restriction site distal to the stop codon of the open reading frame. The resulting SphI-HindIII fragment was subcloned into the vector pQE (QIAGEN Inc.) to express recombinant fusion proteins in E. coli M15 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Denatured recombinant protein was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.) and used for the generation of a goat antiserum. ATAC was immunoprecipitated from supernatants of nylon wool-purified lymphocytes or CD8+ T cells activated by PMA (20 ng/ml; Sigma) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml; Sigma) for 24 h or from supernatants of transfectant 7.10. For detection of intracellular ATAC, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Quantitative immunoprecipitations were performed using an excess of ATAC-specific monoclonal antibody ASA-1 2S. Müller, R. A. Kroczek, manuscript in preparation. or the ATAC-specific antiserum. In some experiments, brefeldin A (Sigma) was added for the last 4 h of cell stimulation at 5 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) on 14% gels under reducing conditions (unless otherwise indicated) using a 6-60-kDa ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a molecular mass marker, transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Tropifluor, Tropix Inc.), and stained with goat anti-ATAC serum using the Western Light kit (Tropix Inc.). For carbohydrate analysis, SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose (BA-S 85, Schleicher & Schuell) and stained using the glycan/protein double-labeling system (Boehringer Mannheim, 1500783) or the glycan differentiation system (Boehringer Mannheim, 1210238). Nylon wool-purified lymphocytes (5 × 106) were activated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h, washed, and incubated in cysteine/methionine-deficient RPMI 1640 medium (labeling medium) and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of labeling medium, pulsed with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (1000 Ci/mmol; Tran35S-label, ICN) for 15 min, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and chased for 2-60 min in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Proteins immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and supernatants with mAb ASA-1 were separated by SDS-PAGE (14% gel), and the gel was fixed and autoradiographed. CD8+ T cells (4-5 × 108) were isolated from nylon wool-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Magnetobeads to a purity of >98% and activated at 2 × 106 cells/ml with PMA and ionomycin for 12-40 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. ATAC was purified from the supernatants using an affinity column generated by coupling mAb ASA-1 to HiTrap-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound material was eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0, and further purified by microbore Mono S cation-exchange HPLC followed by reversed-phase RP18 HPLC. An automated Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer was used for NH2-terminal sequencing of purified ATAC. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrum was recorded on a REFLEX mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a N2 laser in linear mode. Sinapinic acid or α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix (saturated solution in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile at a ratio of 2:1). The protein was dissolved in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (2:1) and mixed 1:1 with the matrix solution. The electrospray ionization mass spectrum was obtained on a TSQ 700 quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ion source. ATAC was dissolved in methanol/water/acetic acid (50:50:1) and introduced into the ion source by a microsyringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Ltd.) at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min. ATAC cDNA containing the entire open reading frame (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J.

Clone 7.10 was selected for high ATAC mRNA expression. ATAC corresponding to the natural protein was synthesized using solid-phase methods, HPLC-purified, renatured, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described elsewhere (10Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C.

CD4+ and CD8+ cells were positively selected (10 min, 4 °C) using Magnetobeads coated with mAb 66.1 (CD4, IgM; Dynal, Inc.) or ITI-5C2 (CD8, IgM; Dynal, Inc.) at a bead/cell ratio of 3:1 and subsequently detached from the beads (45 min, 20 °C) with polyclonal anti-Fab antibodies (Dynal, Inc.). Purified cell populations were >99% CD3+ and 96-99% CD4+ or CD8+. Contamination with CD14+, CD19+, CD37+, and CD57+ cells and nonspecifically isolated CD4+ or CD8+ cells was <1.5%. Viability of purified T cell populations was verified by trypan blue exclusion and was always >97%. Control experiments excluded an influence of the purification procedure on the migration and phenotype of the analyzed cell populations (15Friedl P. Noble P.B. Zaenker K.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 165: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). T cells (3 × 105) were suspended in a collagen solution containing 1.6 mg/ml type I bovine dermal collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA) in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium, pH 7.4. This suspension was allowed to polymerize (20-30 min, 37 °C, 5% CO2) in a self-constructed migration chamber. Immediately after polymerization of the lattices, natural or synthetic ATAC was added to the migration chamber at varying concentrations. Cell migration was recorded by time-lapse video microscopy at 37 °C (magnification × 64, detection depth > 200 mm). Stimulation of T cells with PMA, which induces locomotion in virtually all T cells with little donor variation, was routinely used as a positive control. Locomotor base-line activity and stimulation experiments were performed simultaneously using independent time-lapse units. For evaluation of cell locomotion, the paths of 30 randomly selected cells were digitized as x and y coordinates at a 60-s time interval from step to step using computer-assisted cell tracking as described previously (15Friedl P. Noble P.B. Zaenker K.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 165: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Friedl P. Noble P.B. Zaenker K.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4973-4985PubMed Google Scholar). For evaluation of the dose-response experiments, the mean percentage of cells locomoting over the entire observation period in response to phosphate-buffered saline (locomotor base-line activity) was subtracted from the mean percentage of cells locomoting in response to the various concentrations of ATAC dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. To determine whether ATAC is a secreted protein, CD8+ T cells or nylon wool-purified lymphocytes were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, and the cell lysates and supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with ATAC-specific mAb ASA-1. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an antiserum generated against a recombinant ATAC protein. Whereas no signal could be detected in lysates and supernatants of unstimulated cells used as controls (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), a faint band of ~12 kDa was observed in lysates of activated lymphocytes (lane 3). With supernatants of activated cells, a major band of ~12 kDa, a sharp band of 15 kDa, and a diffuse band ranging from 17 to 19 kDa were obtained (Fig. 1A, lane 4). When brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular transport and protein secretion (17Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), was added for the last 4 h of cell culture, a substantial increase in the 12-kDa signal was detectable in the cell lysates (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 5 and 3). These results determined that natural ATAC is a protein secreted by CD8+ T cells upon stimulation. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrated that mature ATAC is a mixture of several protein species with differing molecular masses. To exclude any selectivity of mAb ASA-1 among the forms of natural ATAC, supernatants of activated CD8+ T cells were also subjected to immunoprecipitation using an ATAC-specific antiserum (Fig. 1B, lane 2; preimmune serum control, lane 1) in parallel with mAb ASA-1 (lane 3). To determine the kinetics of ATAC generation, nylon wool-purified lymphocytes were activated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h to achieve maximal ATAC mRNA levels (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells were pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys for 15 min and chased for various time intervals. Within 25 min of synthesis (15-min pulse, 10-min washing), all ATAC protein species (12, 15, and 17-19 kDa) could be detected in immunoprecipitates of cell lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). All variants of ATAC could also be detected in supernatants of activated lymphocytes as soon as 25 min after synthesis and accumulated thereafter (Fig. 2, lanes 9-13). Lymphocytes activated with PMA (which alone cannot induce the ATAC gene (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) and the corresponding supernatants were used as specificity controls (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The analysis of all cell lysates (Fig. 2, lanes 3-8) and supernatants (lanes 9-13) of PMA- and ionomycin-activated lymphocytes revealed that ATAC is secreted within ~30-40 min of synthesis. CD8+ lymphocytes were stimulated for up to 24 h with PMA and ionomycin, and ATAC was affinity-purified from the culture supernatants with mAb ASA-1 coupled to Sepharose. When the affinity-bound material was subjected to cation-exchange HPLC, the bulk of the 12- and 15-kDa ATAC species was identified in fraction 12 by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A) and further purified to homogeneity (as determined by SDS-PAGE; data not shown) by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4A). Natural ATAC could also be purified by reversed-phase HPLC following enrichment on a heparin column (data not shown).Fig. 4NH2-terminal protein sequencing and mass spectrometry of natural secreted ATAC. A, comparison of a purified ATAC preparation with a chemically synthesized ATAC protein (Val22-Gly114).

The 15-kDa form of purified ATAC observed in the immunoblot (A) and later identified as a glycosylated variant was not detectable in the mass spectrometry experiment since the matrices used (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and sinapinic acid) are not suitable for the analysis of glycoproteins. a.i., arbitrary intensity.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although our initial purification of ATAC was accompanied by a significant loss of the 17-19-kDa species and a relative reduction of the 15-kDa species (Fig. 4A, lane 1), the material was well suited for the characterization of the protein backbone of ATAC since the comparison with a chemically synthesized ATAC protein (Val22-Gly114) (Fig. 4A, lane 2) indicated that the 12-kDa species is a post-translationally unmodified form of ATAC. This comparison also suggested that the 15- and 17-19-kDa variants (see also Fig. 1, Fig. 2) represent post-translational modifications of the 12-kDa ATAC protein species. Automated Edman degradation of the purified ATAC preparation shown in Fig. 4A determined Val22 as the NH2-terminal amino acid residue. This result indicated that mature ATAC is generated from the precursor molecule by proteolytic cleavage between Gly21 and Val22. When the purified ATAC preparation was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Fig. 4B) and electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown), the mass obtained (10,272.1 Da) corresponded well to the calculated 10,271.72 Da for an unmodified Val22-Gly114 ATAC protein. Thus, an estimated 60% of natural ATAC (“12-kDa species,” 10,271.72 Da; compare Fig. 1, Fig. 2) is secreted as an unmodified protein of 93 amino acids (Fig. 4C). For reasons given in the legend to Fig. 4, the 15-kDa species present in the preparation did not give a signal in mass spectrometry. In matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis (Fig. 4B) and electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown), a smaller second peak with a mass of 10,116.9 Da was observed. Since Edman degradation of two independently purified ATAC preparations did not reveal contaminating proteins or the presence of NH2-terminally truncated ATAC protein variants, this peak possibly resulted from the presence of an ATAC variant lacking the COOH-terminal amino acid residues Thr113 and Gly114 (calculated molecular mass of 10,113.56 Da). To further characterize the nature of the observed 15- and 17-19-kDa proteins, we transfected myeloma P3x63Ag8.653 cells with a cDNA containing the entire coding region of ATAC (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When supernatants of transfectant 7.10 were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with mAb ASA-1 followed by immunoblotting, the 12-, 15-, and 17-19-kDa protein species identified corresponded to the proteins immunoprecipitated from supernatants of activated lymphocytes (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). No signal was obtained with supernatants of the nontransfected control myeloma cells (data not shown). The 15- and 17-19-kDa protein species could thus be determined as products of the ATAC gene, which arise by post-translational modification of the Val22-Gly114 ATAC protein (12-kDa species). Further analysis demonstrated that both the 15- and 17-19-kDa proteins are glycosylated (Fig. 5B). In the 17-19-kDa protein, the presence of terminal sialic acid α(2-3)-bound to galactose could be detected (Fig. 5C) (a variable degree of glycosylation is apparently responsible for the observed diffuse nature of this ATAC species). Since the ATAC protein sequence does not contain any consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation, the 15- and 17-19-kDa species could thus be identified as O-linked glycosylation forms of mature ATAC. Mature ATAC contains only two cysteines, at positions 32 and 69. To test for disulfide bonding between these cysteines, ATAC was immunoprecipitated from supernatants of activated lymphocytes, separated in parallel by SDS-PAGE under reducing (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 3) and nonreducing (lane 2) conditions, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The altered mobility of the unfolded protein in the reduced state as compared with its mobility in the nonreduced state indicated the presence of a disulfide bond in the mature ATAC protein. CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T cells were purified and tested in a collagen matrix chemokinesis assay for increased locomotion using time-lapse video microscopy. In all experiments, chemically synthesized ATAC (Val22-Gly114) was used at 400 ng/ml (determined to be the optimal concentration after preliminary titrations). In several experiments, preparations of purified natural ATAC containing both the nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the cytokine in the correct relative amounts (compare Fig. 1) were used in parallel. With CD4+ T cells from different blood donors, a substantial increase in the percentage of migrating cells could be observed in approximately one-third of the experiments (positive results are shown in Fig. 7, A-D). In another one-third of the experiments, there was a modest increase in locomotion; the remaining experiments were negative. The results obtained with purified CD8+ T cells were similar. Again, in approximately one-third of the experiments, a clear increase in locomotion was recorded (positive results are shown in Fig. 7, E-H); in another one-third of the experiments, a modest response was observed. When tested in parallel, the effect of natural ATAC was more pronounced when compared with the synthetic ATAC protein (Fig. 7, A and E). The specificity of the chemokinetic effect of natural ATAC on CD4+ T cells (Fig. 7C) and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7G) was verified with an antiserum raised against the ATAC protein. Representative dose-response effects of ATAC on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are shown in Fig. 7 (D and H). In a number of donors, only one T cell subset responded to ATAC by increased chemokinesis. In terms of structure, we have demonstrated in this work that natural ATAC is a secreted protein of 93 amino acids that is generated from the precursor molecule (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by proteolytic cleavage between Gly21 and Val22. Some 60% of ATAC is secreted as an unmodified cationic protein (pI 11.35) with a molecular mass of 10,271.7 Da, running in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa. A substantial proportion of ATAC is rapidly glycosylated and secreted within 30-40 min of synthesis; these glycosylated forms of ATAC can be identified by SDS-PAGE as 15-kDa (minor fraction) and 17-19-kDa (major fraction) proteins. Finally, we could determine that the two cysteines present in the ATAC protein are linked by a disulfide bridge. Considering the structural aspects, ATAC thus exhibits both similarities to and differences from chemokines of the CC and CXC families, to which it is related by its protein sequence (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Kennedy J. Kelner G.S. Kleyensteuber S.

It shares with these chemokines a disulfide bridge between the two cysteines conserved in all of these molecules. However, ATAC lacks the other pair of cysteines and the second disulfide bond and thus must have a clearly different tertiary structure compared with the CC and CXC molecules (2Müller S. Dorner B. Korthäuer U. Mages H.W. D'Apuzzo M. Senger G. Kroczek R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another conspicuous finding is the comparatively long COOH terminus of ATAC. This finding is relevant, given the observation that modifications of the COOH terminus can be critical for the function of chemokines (10Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike CXC chemokines, which are not glycosylated (19Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Wormald M. Dwek R.A. Van Damme J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a substantial proportion of ATAC is O-glycosylated and thus resembles MCP-1 (19Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Wormald M. Dwek R.A. Van Damme J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Ernst C.A. Zhang Y.J. Hancock P.R. Rutledge B.J. Corless C.L. Rollins B.J. J.

The functional relevance of the observed glycosylation is unclear at present since the aglycosyl form of ATAC is functional in chemokinesis assays with T cells (see below). The cationic nature of the secreted aglycosyl form of ATAC and its observed binding to heparin in vitro (data not shown), features shared with the CC and CXC chemokines, potentially enable ATAC to bind to glycosaminoglycans of the tissue matrix and cell membranes and thus to persist in the microenvironment for a prolonged period of time (22Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 23Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In terms of function, we could demonstrate that natural ATAC, as well as its nonglycosylated form, can induce substantial chemokinesis in primary CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells. When effective, ATAC induced a similar proportion of T cells to locomote, as did interleukin-8 in our previous experiments (16Friedl P. Noble P.B. Zaenker K.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4973-4985PubMed Google Scholar). For as yet unknown reasons, the effect of ATAC on T cells was clearly donor-dependent (a systematic analysis of this donor dependence will require the identification of the ATAC receptor). More important, when chemically synthesized ATAC was tested in parallel with purified natural ATAC, the results were always concordant. Our findings thus differ from the negative results of the chemokinesis assays reported by Kelner et al. (6Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Schall T.J. Zlotnik A. Science. 1994; 266: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), who tested murine lymphotactin for effects on CD4+-depleted, CD8+-depleted, and double-negative murine thymocytes using a filter-based assay system. The interpretation of these divergent results is difficult since both the populations tested and the assay systems used differed considerably; in addition, the assays with murine cells were performed with a form of lymphotactin that probably represents a +1 NH2-terminal variant. Our numerous attempts to induce chemotaxis with ATAC in various cell systems have remained unsuccessful. We have previously reported negative results obtained with two ATAC molecules, Gly21-Gly114 (+1 NH2-terminal variant) and Gly23-Gly114 (−1 NH2-terminal variant), both generated as fusion proteins and also by chemical synthesis and which were tested on unseparated T cells, purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones (2Müller S.

Although neither of the two ATAC variants truly represents the natural molecule, as this work has shown, we know from the chemokinesis assays that the −1 NH2-terminal ATAC variant is functional. 3F. Entschladen and R. A. Kroczek, unpublished observations. Our chemotaxis assays with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and T cell clones, monocytes, and neutrophils performed earlier with supernatants of the ATAC transfectant 7.10 (compare Fig. 5A) (ATAC at 1 μg/ml to 1 pg/ml) were negative as well (2Müller S.

New chemotaxis experiments performed with purified natural ATAC (containing all forms of the molecule) on primary human T cells and also T cells prestimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 for 7 days again gave no conclusive results, although the cells were responsive to MCP-1. 4B. Dorner and R. A. Kroczek, unpublished observations. Thus, our data regarding the chemotactic capabilities of ATAC differ from the studies of Kelner at al. (6Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Schall T.J. Zlotnik A. Science. 1994; 266: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and Kennedy et al. (7Kennedy J. Kelner G.S. Kleyensteuber S. Schall T.J. Weiss M.C. Yssel H. Schneider P.V. Cocks B.G. Bacon K.B. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar), which were performed on murine and human cells using murine (presumed +1 NH2-terminal variant) and human lymphotactin, respectively. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear at present since the test systems used by these investigators were similar to ours. Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether ATAC can functionally be grouped into the family of chemokines. We greatly appreciate the expert technical assistance of Birgit Radke and Katja Ranke."
https://openalex.org/W2082152359,"The <i>SCL/tal-1</i> gene (hereafter designated <i>SCL</i>) encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor which is pivotal for the normal development of all hematopoietic lineages and which is expressed in committed erythroid, mast, and megakaryocytic cells as well as in hematopoietic stem cells. The molecular basis for expression of <i>SCL</i> in stem cells and its subsequent modulation during lineage commitment is of fundamental importance for understanding how early ""decisions"" are made during hematopoiesis. We now compare the activity of <i>SCL</i> promoters 1a and 1b in erythroid cells and in CD34 positive primitive myeloid cells. <i>SCL</i> mRNA expression in CD34 positive myeloid cells did not require GATA-1. Promoter 1a activity was weak or absent in CD34 positive myeloid cells and appeared to correlate with the presence or absence of low levels of GATA-1. However, promoter 1b, which was silent in committed erythroid cells, was strongly active in transient assays using CD34 positive myeloid cells, and functioned in a GATA-independent manner. Interestingly, RNase protection assays demonstrated that endogenous promoter 1b was active in both erythroid and CD34 positive myeloid cells. These results demonstrate that fundamentally different mechanisms regulate the <i>SCL</i> promoter region in committed erythroid cells and in CD34 positive myeloid cells. Moreover these observations suggest that in erythroid, but not in CD34 positive myeloid cells, promoter 1b required integration in chromatin and/or additional sequences for its activity. Stable transfection experiments showed that both core promoters were silent following integration in erythroid or CD34 positive myeloid cells. Our data therefore indicate that additional regulatory elements were necessary for both <i>SCL</i> promoters to overcome chromatin-mediated repression."
https://openalex.org/W2092407683,"We have previously shown that the molecular chaperone HSC70 self-associates in solution into dimers, trimers, and probably high order oligomers, according to a slow temperature- and concentration-dependent equilibrium that is shifted toward the monomer upon binding of ATP peptides or unfolded proteins. To determine the structural basis of HSC70 self-association, the oligomerization properties of the isolated amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of this protein have been analyzed by gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Whereas the amino-terminal ATPase domain (residues 1-384) was found to be monomeric in solution even at high concentrations, the carboxyl-terminal peptide binding domain (residues 385-646) exists as a slow temperature- and concentration-dependent equilibrium involving monomers, dimers, and trimers. The association equilibrium constant obtained for this domain alone is on the order of 105M−1, very close to that determined previously for the entire protein, suggesting that self-association of HSC70 is determined solely by its carboxyl-terminal domain. Furthermore, oligomerization of the isolated carboxyl-terminal peptide binding domain is, like that of the entire protein, reversed by peptide binding, indicating that self-association of the protein may be mediated by the peptide binding site and, as such, should play a role in the regulation of HSC70 chaperone function.

HSC70 shows a very weak ATPase activity that can be stimulated 2-5-fold upon binding of peptides, unfolded proteins, clathrin light chains, and cochaperones of the DnaJ family (11Braell W.A.

HSC70 seems to function through cycles of binding and release of polypeptide substrates coupled to binding and hydrolysis of ATP (15Greene L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2967-2973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in a mechanism involving cochaperones of the DnaJ protein family and a newly isolated factor, Hip (16Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). HSC70 is made of two domains, an NH2-terminal domain of 44 kDa (residues 1-384), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and a COOH-terminal domain of about 30 kDa (residues 385-646), which contains the peptide binding site (17Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang T.-F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the NH2-terminal ATPase domain has been solved by crystallography (19Flaherty K.M. De-Luca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and the secondary structure topology of the peptide binding site (residues 385-543) has been determined by NMR methods (20Morshauser R.C. Wang H. Flynn G.C. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of a complex between a seven-residue peptide and the COOH-terminal domain of DnaK, the bacterial HSP70, has been established (21Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). However, the three-dimensional structure of the entire protein is still unknown. Self-association is a general and well conserved feature of the HSP70 protein family. BiP (22Carlino A. Toledo H. Skaleris D. DeLisio R. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), all show self-association properties. Nevertheless, the structural basis and molecular mechanism of such properties have remained undocumented. To address these questions and define the way self-association of HSC70 may relate to its function, we started the investigation of this process by studying the structure of HSC70 in solution. Using a wide range of biophysical and biochemical techniques, we showed that HSC70 self-associates in solution, in a reversible fashion, into dimers, trimers, and probably high order oligomers, with a dissociation constant of about 5-10 μM (34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the effects of the natural substrates on this equilibrium, and showed that whereas in the presence of ADP, HSC70 exists as a slow and temperature-dependent monomer-oligomer equilibrium, in the presence of ATP, peptides, or unfolded proteins, this equilibrium is shifted toward the monomer (35Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Most importantly, and since the dissociation process of HSC70 oligomers into monomers appeared to be very similar to that of unfolded protein from HSC70, occurring upon ATP binding but not ATP hydrolysis, we proposed that binding of HSC70 to itself may occur via the peptide binding site and may mimic the binding of HSC70 to unfolded protein substrates (35Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we undertook in the present work the identification of the oligomerization domain and analyzed the self-association properties of two mutants corresponding to the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of HSC70. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs, and T4 DNA ligase was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DNA sequencing was accomplished using the T7 sequencing kit from Pharmacia. PET 14b vector and Ni2+-agarose were purchased from Tebu-Novagen. FPLC products were from Pharmacia, and all other chemicals were from Merck. The plasmid carrying the coding sequence of HSC70 NH2-terminal domain was designed as follows. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce an NdeI site at the start codon of the HSC70 coding sequence that had been previously cloned in the PstI sites of the pUC119 polylinker. Then a Pac1 site was introduced to create a stop codon at codon 385, resulting in the replacement of Asp383 and Lys384 by a valine and an asparagine, respectively. The resulting NdeI-PacI fragment was then cloned between the corresponding sites of the pNB5 expression vector described previously (30Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The final plasmid, called pFB5, allowed the expression of the NH2-terminal domain of HSC70 (residues 1-384) in Escherichia coli. The HSC70 COOH-terminal domain (385-646) was expressed using the T7 expression system of E. coli. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce an NdeI site at codon 383 in the HSC70 coding sequence of the pFB7 plasmid described previously (30Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus leading to the replacement of codon 384 by a start codon. Then, after removal of the NdeI-NdeI fragment (codons 1-383), the plasmid was ligated on itself, giving rise to the pNB28 plasmid. Finally, the NdeI-BamHI fragment of pNB28 was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET14b vector, resulting in the NH2-terminal fusion of six histidine residues to the HSC70 COOH-terminal domain (residues 385-646). The integrity of all constructions described above was verified by nucleotide sequencing (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar). Recombinant HSC70 was expressed and purified as described previously (30Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The recombinant NH2-terminal domain of HSC70 was expressed and purified as described for HSC70 except that the first ion exchange chromatographic step was replaced by a 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation. After centrifugation, the ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 80%, and the sample was submitted to centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM KCl, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mM MgCl2, dialyzed in the same buffer, and applied onto an ATP-agarose affinity column as described previously (30Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The HSC70 (His)6-COOH-terminal domain was expressed and then purified using His-bind resin (Ni2+-agarose), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The eluted protein was subjected to a thrombin digestion to remove the histidine tail, and any uncleaved His-COOH-terminal domain was removed by submitting the whole sample to a chromatography on an Ni2+-agarose column. After elution, the protein was concentrated and stored at −80 °C as described previously (30Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (55Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Far A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and all protein concentrations given in the tables and figures are based on the molecular mass of the monomer. Activity of the purified proteins was checked by the measure of the ATPase activity as well as polypeptide substrate binding. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under denaturing conditions (SDS) was carried out in 0.75-mm-thick 12% acrylamide slab gel according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis in native conditions was performed either on a 6 or 10% acrylamide slab gel according to Kim et al. (29Kim D. Lee Y.J. Corry P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FPLC chromatography was carried out at room temperature on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol as described previously (34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a An Ti 60 titanium four-hole rotor with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces as described previously (34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed using the computer program SVEDBERG (38Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar) supplied by John Philo. The apparent molecular mass was determined from the sedimentation coefficient, using the relation (S1/S2)3 = (M1/M2)2 and bovine serum albumin as a reference protein of known molecular mass and sedimentation coefficient (34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 4 °C using three different loading concentrations and three (for the entire protein) or two (for the isolated fragments) rotor speeds. Radial scans of absorbance at 280 nm were taken at 2-h intervals, and samples were judged to be at equilibrium by the absence of systematic deviations in overlaid successive scans and when a constant average molecular weight was obtained in plots representing the average molecular weight versus centrifugation time. Sedimentation equilibrium data were analyzed using the appropriate functions by nonlinear least squares procedures provided in the Beckman Optima XL-A software package. For data analysis according to discrete self-association models, the following general equation was used. C(r)=δ+C1,0exp(σ(r2−r02))+∑N>1C1,0NKNexp(Nσ(r2−r02))(Eq. 1) where C(r) is the total concentration at radius r, Δ is the base-line offset, C1,0 is the monomer concentration at the reference radius r0, N is the stoichiometry of the reaction, and KN is the equilibrium association constant. σ=M1(1−v¯p)ω2/2RT(Eq. 2) where M1 is the monomer molecular weight, v¯ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, Ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the sedimentation equilibrium experiment. The equilibrium constant for the monomer-dimer equilibrium, KM-D, and that for the monomer-trimer, KM-T, are obtained by the fitting procedure, whereas KD-T is calculated from these values. Average weight molecular weights (M¯ w) were obtained, for several rotor speeds and protein concentrations, by fitting the equilibrium sedimentation data to a single species using the equations above. The variation of M¯ w as a function of protein concentration from single runs was determined by calculating the M¯ w from dln(C)/dr2 = M1(1 −v¯ ρ)Ω2/2RT data, on a point by point basis, using a window of 20 points that moves through the entire data point range. Data analysis, according to an unlimited isodesmic association model (40Adams E.T. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 41Adams E.T. Tang L.H.

Chem. 1975; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is defined as follows, Ω(r)={c(r)exp(ϕ1M1(rF2−r2))}/c(rF)(Eq. 3) where Φ1 = (1 −v¯ 1ρ)Ω2/2RT, with v¯ 1 representing the partial specific volume of the smallest assembling species, ρ the solvent density, Ω the angular velocity of the rotor, R the gas constant, and T the absolute temperature of the sedimentation equilibrium experiment. M1 is the molar mass of the monomer; c(r) and c(rF) are the total weight concentrations of the associating solute at radial position r and an arbitrarily chosen reference position, rF, respectively. The parameters of self-association were determined by direct fitting of the Ω function to an isodesmic model according to Morris and Ralston (44Morris M. Ralston G.B. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 23: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Ralston and Morris (42Ralston G.B. Moris M.B. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 253-274Google Scholar), and Winzor and Wills (45Winzor D.J. Wills P.R. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 67-80Google Scholar). A monomer molecular mass of 29,046 Da and a partial specific volume of 0.726 ml/mg at 4 °C, calculated from amino acid composition, were used for the COOH-terminal domain. For the NH2-terminal domain and HSC70, monomer molecular masses of 42,002 and 70,870 Da and partial specific volumes of 0.733 and 0.729 ml/mg at 4 °C were used. The solvent density was taken as 1.00 g/ml. Although a purified preparation of HSC70 appears homogeneous on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1A, lane 2), it presents a polydispersity on a nondenaturating gel, and at least three species are observed (Fig. 1B, lane 1). By contrast, the NH2-terminal ATPase domain migrates as a single band whether in native (Fig. 1B, lane 2) or denaturing conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 3), suggesting that it exists as a single species. However, the COOH-terminal domain presents an electrophoretic behavior similar to that of the entire protein. It exhibits multiple bands in native conditions corresponding to at least three species (Fig. 1B, lane 3), although it shows a single band in denaturing conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 4), indicative of self-association. To obtain further information about the nature and the relative distribution of the species present in each protein preparation, HSC70 as well as the isolated domains were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. While the NH2-terminal domain elutes as a single sharp and symmetrical peak corresponding to a single species having an apparent molecular mass of about 36 kDa (Fig. 2B), the COOH-terminal domain of HSC70 elutes in two overlapping peaks, a major and broad one corresponding to species having an apparent molecular mass of about 200 kDa and a minor one corresponding to species having an apparent molecular mass of about 40 kDa (Fig. 2C), indicating the presence of monomeric and various oligomeric species, probably dimers and trimers. Thus, the COOH-terminal domain alone seems to self-associate in a manner similar to that of the entire protein. The partial separation of these species during chromatography is indicative of the presence of either a mixture or a slow equilibrium between species, comparable with that described for the whole protein (Fig. 2, A and C; Refs. 34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 35Benaroudj N. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18471-18476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To know whether the monomeric and oligomeric species of the COOH-terminal domain exist in a noninterconvertible mixture or in a slow equilibrium, we studied the concentration and temperature dependence of self-association for the isolated domain. As shown in Fig. 3, progressive dilution of the COOH-terminal domain leads to an increase in the amount of the monomeric species at the expense of the oligomeric species (Fig. 3, D, E, and F) in a way similar to that observed for the entire protein (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). These results indicate that the COOH-terminal domain, like the entire HSC70, exists as a slow and concentration-dependent equilibrium between oligomeric and monomeric species (see also Ref. 34Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by the temperature dependence of the COOH-terminal domain self-association. In fact, varying the temperature in the gel filtration experiments had two purposes: first, to confirm that the multiple species observed exist as a slow equilibrium and not as a mixture, and second, to know whether the interactions involved in stabilizing the multimeric species are of a comparable nature in the whole protein and its COOH-terminal domain. As shown in Fig. 4, for HSC70 as well as its COOH-terminal domain, increasing the temperature leads to the dissociation of the oligomers into monomers. However, the COOH-terminal domain appears to be more stable at high temperatures than the entire protein, since above 42 °C it is still undergoing dissociation into monomers (Fig. 4, G and H), whereas HSC70 becomes aggregated as indicated by the presence of a single peak eluting with the void volume of the column (Fig. 4, C and D), due presumably to heat-induced denaturation and subsequent aggregation. Even at higher temperatures, up to 60 °C, the COOH-terminal domain does not seem to aggregate and rather elutes as a single chromatographic peak corresponding to monomeric species (data not shown).Fig. 4Effect of temperature on the self-association properties of HSC70 and its COOH-terminal domain. 7 μM HSC70 (A, B, C, and D) and 17 μM of the COOH-terminal domain (E, F, G, and H) were incubated for 30 min at 25 (A and E), 37 (B and F), 42 (C and G), or 50 °C (D and H) and immediately analyzed by size exclusion chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peaks corresponding to monomeric and oligomeric species are indicated by the letters M and O, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is not clear whether increasing temperatures alter the equilibrium distribution of the species, and thus their respective thermodynamic stability, or the rate of conversion between species, although an effect on the rate has been suggested (46Gao B. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16792-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the absence of calorimetric studies and thermodynamic parameters, interpretation of these results in terms of the nature of forces contributing to stability could only be speculative. Thus, it could be concluded that whether in the case of the COOH-terminal domain or HSC70, the monomer-oligomer equilibrium is temperature-dependent and that the interactions involved in stabilizing their multimeric species are probably of a similar nature, suggesting that self-association of HSC70 could be accounted for by the COOH-terminal domain. Results of sedimentation velocity experiments are summarized in Table I. An average sedimentation coefficient, S¯20,w, of 3.46 S is obtained for the NH2-terminal domain. This value corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 45,240 Da, close to the molecular mass of the monomer predicted from the amino acid sequence (42,002 Da). Increasing protein concentrations, up to 50 μM, did not significantly affect this value, and the NH2-terminal domain remained monomeric over all of the concentration range (data not shown). Moreover, extrapolating the S¯20,w to 0 gives an S¯020,w of 3.24 S, which corresponds to a molecular mass value of 41,108 Da, even closer to that of the predicted one.Table I.Sedimentation coefficients of HSC70 and its NH2- and COOH-terminal domainsHSC70NH2-terminal domainCOOH-terminal domainS¯20,w (S)6.67 ± 0.0083.46 ± 0.0024.25 ± 0.005s20,w (S)4.63 ± 0.101NDaNot determined.2.91 ± 0.0507.09 ± 0.053ND4.53 ± 0.0259.97 ± 0.159ND6.76 ± 0.078a Not determined.

https://openalex.org/W2002464111,"To identify binding domains between angiotensin II (AngII) and its type 2 receptor (AT2), two different radiolabeled photoreactive analogs were prepared by replacing either the first or the last amino acid in the peptide with p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa). Digestion of photolabeled receptors with kallikrein revealed that the two photoreactive analogs label the amino-terminal part of the receptor within the first 182 amino acids. Digestion of 125I-[Bpa1]AngII·AT2 receptor complex with endoproteinase Lys-C produced a glycoprotein of 80 kDa. Deglycosylation of this 80-kDa product decreased its apparent molecular mass to 4.6 kDa and further cleavage of this 4.6-kDa product with V8 protease decreased its molecular mass to 3.6 kDa, circumscribing the labeling site of 125I-[Bpa1]AngII within amino acids 3-30 of AT2 receptor. Treatment of 125I-[Bpa8]AngII·AT2 receptor complex with cyanogen bromide produced two major receptor fragments of 3.6 and 2.6 kDa. Cyanogen bromide hydrolysis of a mutant AT2 receptor produced two major fragments of 12.6 kDa and 2.6 kDa defining the labeling site of 125I-[Bpa8]AngII within residues 129-138 of AT2 receptor. Our results indicate that the amino-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor interacts with the amino-terminal end of AngII, whereas the inner half of the third transmembrane domain of AT2 receptor interacts with the carboxyl-terminal end of AngII.

Treatment of 125I-[Bpa8]AngII·AT2 receptor complex with cyanogen bromide produced two major receptor fragments of 3.6 and 2.6 kDa. Cyanogen bromide hydrolysis of a mutant AT2 receptor produced two major fragments of 12.6 kDa and 2.6 kDa defining the labeling site of 125I-[Bpa8]AngII within residues 129-138 of AT2 receptor. Our results indicate that the amino-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor interacts with the amino-terminal end of AngII, whereas the inner half of the third transmembrane domain of AT2 receptor interacts with the carboxyl-terminal end of AngII.

The AT1 receptor mediates all the known physiological actions of AngII including regulation of blood pressure and water and electrolyte balance (1Peach M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 80: 2745-2751Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The functional roles of the AT2 receptor are not well defined yet but recent studies suggest that it could act as a physiological antagonist of AT1-mediated pressor effect and also regulate central nervous system functions related to locomotion and exploratory behavior (2Hein L. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 3Ichiki T. Labosky P.A. Shiota C. Okuyama S. Imagawa Y. Fogo A. Niimura F. Ichikawa I. Hogan B.L.M. Inagami T. Nature. 1995; 377: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Other studies also suggest that the AT2 receptor inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell death (4Stoll M. Steckelings M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin.

AT1 and AT2 receptors have been cloned from several species. They are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which is characterized by seven putative transmembrane helices. AT1 and AT2 receptors display a low degree (33%) of amino acid sequence similarity (6Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S. Iwai N. Murray J.J. Hasegawa M. Matsuda Y. Inagami T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24539-24542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The elucidation of primary structures of numerous G protein-coupled receptors has prompted investigators to look for and identify domains in receptors directly involved in ligand binding. Most of this work was done on members of the β-adrenergic receptor family which bind bioamines (<0.2 kDa) in the outer third of the plasma membrane between transmembrane helices (10Strader C.D. Ming Fong T. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Ligand-binding domains have also been identified for larger agonist (>10 kDa) such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and follicule-stimulating hormone which bind to the extracellular amino-terminal region of their G protein-coupled receptors (11Bockaert J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding domains of G protein-coupled receptors for small bioactive peptides (0.5-5 kDa) have not been fully characterized. Recent studies suggest, however, that certain proximal loop regions as well as transmembrane regions may be important binding determinants (12Noda K. Saad Y. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28511-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Feng Y.-H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The localization of ligand-binding domains in the G protein-coupled receptor family has been mostly studied using approaches such as, site-directed mutagenesis, deletion analysis, and construction of chimeric receptors (17Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 167-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since these mutations may affect hormone binding indirectly by altering the conformation of a receptor or its expression at the plasma membrane, a more direct approach for the identification of the AT2 receptor ligand-binding domains should be envisaged. We previously reported the covalent labeling of the AT2 receptor with the photoreactive AngII analog [Bpa8]AngII (18Servant G. Boulay G. Bossé R. Escher E. Guillemette G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar, 19Servant G. Dudley D.T. Escher E. Guillemette G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1112-1118PubMed Google Scholar, 20Servant G. Dudley D.T. Escher E. Guillemette G. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, another high affinity photoreactive analog was prepared by replacing the amino-terminal end of AngII with Bpa. These two photoreactive AngII analogs were used to label the AT2 receptor of PC-12 cells. The peptide-binding domains of the receptor were identified with each ligand after targetted enzymatic and chemical fragmentation.DISCUSSIONOur results indicate that, upon binding, the amino-terminal tail of the AT2 receptor interacts with the amino-terminal end of AngII whereas the inner half of the third transmembrane domain of AT2 receptor interacts with the carboxyl-terminal end of AngII. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing data on the binding domains of the AT2 receptor. Our results and those of other groups suggest that there may be a common scheme for the binding domains of small peptide hormones in the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. For example, it has been shown that charged residues in the second and third extracellular loops of the AT1 receptor are major docking points for the amino-terminal end (Asp1 and Arg2 residues, respectively) of AngII (13Feng Y.-H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Hunyady L. Balla T. Catt K.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hydrophobic nature of the phenyl group at position 8 in the AngII molecule (the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide) suggests that its site of interaction with the AT1 receptor is within the membrane. Actually, recent studies suggest that upon binding, the carboxyl-terminal end of the AngII molecule occupies a space between helices III, V, VI, and VII of the AT1 receptor (26Hunyady L. Balla T. Catt K.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Kikyo M. Sano T. Nakagomi Y. Inoue Y. Nakamura N. Morishima I. Guo D.-F. Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14024-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Similarly, binding domains for the undecapeptide substance-P (SP) were identified in the first and second extracellular loops, the amino-terminal ectodomain and the outer half of the transmembrane helices II and VII of the NK-1 receptor (14Fong T.M. Huang R.-R.C. Strader C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25664-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In an elegant study using photoreactive analogs of SP, Li et al. (15Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have shown that the amino-terminal side (the fourth position) of the 125I-[Tyr1,Bpa4]SP peptide interacts with the extracellular amino-terminal tail of the NK-1 receptor while the COOH-terminal side (the ninth position) of the 125I-[Tyr1,Bpa9]SP peptide interacts with the second extracellular loop. The authors proposed a model in which the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide positions itself between helices in the outer part of the plasma membrane whereas the amino-terminal portion of the peptide is stabilized by ectodomains of NK-1 receptor. Based on our results, it is tempting to propose that the AngII molecule binds the AT2 receptor in a similar fashion, with the carboxyl-terminal end sitting deep within the transmembrane domains and the amino-terminal end interacting with the ectodomains of the receptor. The location of the carboxyl-terminal portion of AngII deep in the plasma membrane fits well with known pharmacological properties of AngII. The agonistic nature of AngII is conferred by its carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine residue (29Regoli D. Park W.K. Rioux F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1974; 26: 69-123PubMed Google Scholar) and intrahelical amino acids are known to play a major role in G-protein coupled receptor activation upon direct interaction with ligands (10Strader C.D. Ming Fong T. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that the carboxyl-terminal end of AngII interacts with the third transmembrane domain of the AT2 receptor. Similarly, it has been shown that residues in the third transmembrane domain of the AT1 receptor are required for high affinity binding (16Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon S. Curnow K.M. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1507-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Groblewski T. Maigret B. Nouet S. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.-C. Marie J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results also raise another interesting point. If the AngII molecule interacts at the same time with residues in the amino-terminal extracellular tail as well as residues deeply located in the third transmembrane domain, one could speculate that the ectodomain must lie near the outer membrane surface. The AngII molecule has an estimated length of about ~30 Å (probably less in solution) which is shorter than a transmembrane helix (~40 Å). To account for such a requirement, the putative disulfide bridge located between the amino-terminal tail and the third extracellular loop of the AT2 receptor may play an important conformational role in bringing the amino-terminal tail in close proximity to the plasma membrane surface (Fig. 10).In conclusion, we have identified two peptide-binding regions in the AT2 receptor with the use of highly potent and specific AngII photoreactive analogs. This approach also allowed the determination of the AngII molecule's orientation in its binding pocket. Based on these results, we conclude that AngII interacts with an extracellular segment and a transmembrane helix of AT2 receptor. This interaction pattern, also found in other G-protein coupled receptors for small bioactive peptides, may correspond to a highly conserved feature among this very large family or receptors. By recovering large amounts of labeled receptor, it will be possible to sequence the fragments and pinpoint the precise interaction sites.

https://openalex.org/W2142827505,"O-LinkedN-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a ubiquitous and abundant protein modification found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Several lines of evidence suggest that it is a highly dynamic modification and that the levels of this sugar on proteins may be regulated. Previous workers (Chou, C. F., and Omary, M. B. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4465-4472) have shown that mitotic arrest with microtubule-destabilizing agents such as nocodazole causes an increase in the O-GlcNAc levels on keratins in the human colon cancer cell line HT29. We have sought to determine whether this increase in glycosylation is a general (i.e. occurring on many proteins) or a limited (i.e. occurring only on the keratins) process. A general increase would suggest that the microtubule-destabilizing agents were somehow affecting the enzymes responsible for addition and/or removal of O-GlcNAc. Our results suggest that the changes in O-GlcNAc induced by nocodazole are selective for the keratins. The levels of O-GlcNAc on other proteins, including the nuclear pore protein p62 and the transcription factor Sp1, are not significantly affected by this treatment. In agreement with these findings, nocodazole treatment caused no change in the activity of the enzymes responsible for addition or removal of O-GlcNAc as determined by direct in vitro assay. Interestingly, nocodazole treatment did cause a dramatic increase in modification of N-glycans with terminal GlcNAc residues on numerous proteins.

Although over 50 proteins bearing this modification have been identified to date, no example of a specific function for this modification on any of these proteins has yet been demonstrated. Nonetheless, these proteins share some common features that may suggest a role. Significantly, most of these proteins are also known to be phosphoproteins (1Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P.

Since both phosphate and GlcNAc modify the hydroxyl groups of serines and threonines, it has been proposed that the sugar may function by blocking sites of phosphorylation (4Holt G.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14847-14850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent reports demonstrating competition between glycosylation and phosphorylation on individual proteins have added support to this concept (5Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol.

Modifying a protein with a neutral sugar such as O-GlcNAc could have significantly different effects on the protein compared with phosphorylation. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of proteins may add an additional level of control to protein phosphorylation by constitutively blocking phosphorylation sites.

In addition to competing with phosphate, several lines of evidence suggest that O-GlcNAc may be a regulated modification much like phosphorylation. For example, in several cases, O-GlcNAc has been shown to turn over more rapidly than the proteins it modifies (7Chou C.-F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol.

Enzymes capable of addition and removal of the sugar from proteins have been purified and characterized (9Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They exist as large multisubunit soluble proteins in the cytoplasm of cells. Thus, a system capable of regulated addition and removal of the sugar exists. In addition to simply turning over more rapidly than the protein, changes in the levels of glycosylation induced by various stimuli have been observed in two separate systems. Kearse and Hart (11Kearse K.P. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) showed that mitogenic activation of either isolated T lymphocytes or T-cell hybridomas resulted in rapid (<1 h) changes in the level of glycosylation of several nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Subsequently, Chou and Omary (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that mitotic arrest of a human colon cancer cell line (HT29) with okadaic acid or microtubule-destabilizing agents (such as nocodazole) resulted in an increase in glycosylation of keratins 8 and 18. In addition, Chou and Omary (13Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar) observed increased glycosylation of proteins in a crude nuclear extract as well as on several known plasma membrane proteins. The increase in terminal GlcNAc residues of the plasma membrane proteins could be mimicked by brefeldin A, a Golgi disrupter, suggesting that these changes were on extracellular glycans, not O-GlcNAc. The brefeldin A treatment had no effect on the glycosylation of keratins 8 and 18. Nonetheless, the increase in terminal GlcNAc residues on proteins from the nuclear extracts of these cells suggested that nocodazole may cause a general increase in the levels of O-GlcNAc on proteins in these cells. We have sought to determine whether the increase in glycosylation of the keratins in HT29 cells induced by nocodazole is a selective or a general event. If there is an induction of an O-GlcNAc-transferase or an inhibition of an O-GlcNAc′ase by a stimulus such as nocodazole, one would expect to see changes in the level of glycosylation of several proteins. This appears to be what was observed by Kearse and Hart (11Kearse K.P. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1701-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in mitogenically activated T lymphocytes. We have examined the glycosylation of whole cell extracts as well as several specific proteins (keratins, a nuclear pore protein, and the transcription factor Sp1) in nocodazole-treated HT29 cells. Our data suggest that the change in glycosylation of the keratins is a selective event. We saw no major change in O-GlcNAc levels on the other proteins we examined. In agreement with Chou and Omary (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar), we saw a generalized increase in terminal GlcNAc residues on numerous proteins upon nocodazole treatment. We have demonstrated that this increase is largely due to an accumulation of incompletely processed N-glycans in nocodazole-treated cells. Nocodazole, bovine milk galactosyltransferase, protein G-agarose, and ovalbumin were from Sigma. Galactosyltransferase was autogalactosylated prior to use as described (14Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was purified from culture filtrate of Flavobacterium menigisepticum as described (15Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Anti-keratin monoclonal antibody (L2A1) ascites fluid was generously provided by Dr. Bishr Omary (Stanford University) (16Chou C.F. Omary M.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Anti-nuclear pore monoclonal antibody (414) ascites fluid was obtained from Babco (Berkeley, CA), and an isotype-matched control IgG (ascites fluid) was obtained from Sigma (mineral oil plasmacytoma 21). Rabbit anti-human Sp1 polyclonal antibody (PEP2) and competing peptide were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The human colon cancer cell line HT29 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin/EDTA were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. UDP-[6-3H]galactose (50-60 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (25.8 Ci/mmol), and EN3HANCE were from DuPont NEN. The disaccharide standards (galactose-β1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose-β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose-β1,4-N-acetylglucosamine) were obtained from Sigma. The alditol derivatives of these standards were prepared by reduction with sodium borohydride as described (17Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide YSDSPSTST was synthesized at the Center for the Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules, State University of New York at Stony Brook. All electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Corp. All other reagents were of the highest quality available. HT29 cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Nocodazole treatments were performed by replacing the media on subconfluent plates (50-75% confluent) with fresh complete media with or without 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole. At appropriate time points, the cells were washed once with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) and removed from the plates with trypsin/EDTA. The cells were then washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline, counted, and frozen at −80 °C until use. All galactosyltransferase labelings were performed as modifications of described procedures (14Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell pellets prepared as described above were extracted with hot 1% SDS (0.5 ml/107 cells) for 5 min at 100 °C. Chromatin was sheared by repeated passage of the extracts through a 25-gauge needle. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent protein aliquots (100 μg) were precipitated with 8 volumes of acetone for >4 h at −20 °C. Protein pellets were collected by centrifugation and solubilized in 50 μl of 1% SDS by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, the samples were diluted to 0.5 ml with galactosyltransferase labeling buffer (final concentrations: 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MnCl2, 100 mM galactose) containing 2% (w/v) Triton X-100. At this concentration of detergents (0.1% SDS and 2% Triton X-100), galactosyltransferase is fully active (data not shown). The labeling was conducted under saturating conditions for galactosyltransferase (41.3 milliunits) and UDP-[6-3H]galactose (2 μCi) at 37 °C for 1 h. Unincorporated radiolabel was separated from the labeled proteins by gel filtration chromatography (Sephadex G-50) as described (14Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The protein fraction was concentrated by lyophilization and acetone precipitation prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For galactosyltransferase labeling of keratins, cells were extracted essentially as described by Chou et al. (7Chou C.-F. Smith A.J. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3901-3906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets prepared as described above were extracted for 30 min on ice with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Pic 1 and Pic 2) (0.5 ml/107 cells) (14Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of protein (100 μg) of the extracts were labeled with galactosyltransferase and UDP-[6-3H]galactose as described above. The labeling was stopped by the addition of 25 mM EDTA, and the keratins were immunoprecipitated from the labeling mixture using monoclonal antibody L2A1 and protein G-agarose as described (18Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-510Google Scholar). For galactosyltransferase labeling of nuclear pore proteins and Sp1, cells were extracted with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing Pic 1 and Pic 2 for 30 min on ice. Aggregates were broken by passage of the lysates through a 25-gauge needle several times. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All immunoprecipitations were performed on extract containing 1 mg of protein. Nuclear pore proteins were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 414, and Sp1 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody PEP2 essentially as described (18Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-510Google Scholar). A control for the monoclonal antibody 414 immunoprecipitations was performed with isotype-matched mouse IgG ascites fluid. The Sp1 immunoprecipitations were done with and without the control peptide as described by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were collected with protein G-agarose and washed five times with RIPA buffer. Galactosyltransferase labeling was performed on the immune complexes bound to the protein G-agarose beads in 0.5 ml with galactosyltransferase labeling buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 41.3 milliunits of galactosyltransferase, and 2 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]galactose for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled immune complexes were then washed twice with RIPA buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. PNGase F digestions of galactosyltransferase-labeled protein fractions were performed as described (19Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The released glycans were separated from the protein fraction by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (1 × 50 cm) in 50 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% SDS, 0.02% sodium azide. Quantitation was performed by measuring the radioactivity of aliquots from fractions collected. The protein fractions were lyophilized and acetone-precipitated. Alkali-induced β-elimination was performed on the precipitated, PNGase F-digested protein fractions as described (19Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Released saccharides were separated from the protein fraction by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (1 × 50 cm) as described above. The released saccharide fractions were desalted by passage over Dowex 50-X8 (H+ form) and Dowex 1-X8 (formate form). The desalted saccharides were subjected to size fractionation on a Superdex peptide fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min in Milli Q water (Millipore Corp.) and was calibrated with partially hydrolyzed dextran standards detected using an in-line Rainin refractive index monitor (20Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pooled saccharide fraction from the Superdex column was then separated by high pressure anion-exchange chromatography analysis on a CarboPac MA-1 column (4 × 25 mm; Dionex Corp.) with disaccharide standards as described (8Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3578-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cytosolic fractions for enzyme assays were made by sonicating cell pellets in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 M sucrose containing Pic 1 and Pic 2 (2 × 107 cells/ml). Sonication was for 10 s on ice with a Branson Model 185E probe sonicator set on level 3. Sonicates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (cytosol) were desalted on 1-ml Sephadex G-50 columns as described (9Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to assay. O-GlcNAc-transferase assays were performed essentially as described (9Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the SP-Sephadex assays and YSDSPSTST as the acceptor peptide, although the final volume of the assay was reduced to 25 μl. The O-GlcNAc′ase activity was assayed as described (10Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosamine as substrate. O-GlcNAc′ase assays were performed at pH 6.5 and in the presence of 50 mM GalNAc to inhibit lysosomal hexosaminidases. Similar O-GlcNAc′ase assays were also performed with [3H]GlcNAc-labeled YSDSPSTST as described (10Dong D.L.-Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially identical results were obtained. UDP-HexNAc levels were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of perchloric acid extracts of cell pellets as described (21Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc do not separate using this technique, data are presented as total UDP-HexNAc levels. We have analyzed the ratio of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc by performing carbohydrate analysis after acid hydrolysis (22Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) of the UDP-HexNAc fraction. The ratio of GlcNAc to GalNAc in the pool is ~2:1, consistent with previously published results (21Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All gels were 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described (18Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-510Google Scholar). Detection on Western blots was by ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Protein was estimated using the BCA assay (Pierce). Chou and Omary (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that nocodazole treatment of the human colon cancer cell line HT29 resulted in a significant increase in the glycosylation of keratins 8 and 18. We sought to extend this observation to determine whether the increase in glycosylation was a general phenomenon, or if the change was specific for the keratins. To demonstrate that nocodazole treatment of the HT29 cells does indeed cause a change in the level of O-GlcNAc on the keratins, a time course of nocodazole treatment was performed (Fig. 1). Cells were lysed at the indicated times, and portions of each lysate were labeled with galactosyltransferase under conditions where all accessible terminal GlcNAc residues are modified with [3H]galactose (see “Experimental Procedures”). Keratins 8 and 18 were then isolated by immunoprecipitation and examined by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Glycosylation of keratin 18 was barely detectable in the untreated cells, but it increased markedly between 8 and 24 h of nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1A), coincident with mitotic arrest (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these same conditions, we saw very little glycosylation of keratin 8. Chou and Omary (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported significantly less glycosylation of keratin 8 than keratin 18. During the time course, there was essentially no change in the level of the keratins themselves (Fig. 1B), indicating that there is a true increase in glycosylation of keratin 18 and not just an increase in the level of the protein. We also saw an increase in the labeling of a protein that coprecipitates with the keratins. This protein is most likely an N-glycosylated protein called KAP85 (13Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as described by Chou and Omary (12Chou C.-F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nocodazole induces a dramatic increase in the level of glycosylation of keratin 18. To determine whether the effect of nocodazole on the keratins was a general or a selective event, we examined the glycosylation of proteins from crude lysates of HT29 cells. Lysates of HT29 cells were galactosyltransferase-labeled exactly as described above except that no immunoprecipitation was performed. A dramatic increase in the labeling of numerous protein species occurred between the 8- and 24-h time points (Fig. 2A), coincident with the increase in the glycosylation of keratin 18 shown in Fig. 1. During this same period, no significant changes were seen in the levels of the proteins themselves (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that mitotic arrest with nocodazole induces a large increase in terminal GlcNAc residues on numerous proteins from HT29 cells. Interestingly, the labeling of at least one protein decreased upon nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2A, asterisk). We believe that this decrease is due to a decrease in the solubility of this protein under the extraction conditions used (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The decrease is no longer observed when cell extracts are made with either RIPA buffer or 1% SDS (see Fig. 4). For this reason, subsequent lysates were all made with either RIPA buffer or 1% SDS.Fig. 4Nocodazole does not induce major changes in the profile of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. Galactosyltransferase-labeled samples (25 μg of protein) from control and nocodazole-treated HT29 cells were treated with and without PNGase F (as described in the legend to Fig. 3) and separated by SDS-PAGE.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1833-1843PubMed Google Scholar) had demonstrated that nocodazole could induce an increase in the level of terminal GlcNAc residues on cytokeratins, proteins in nuclear extracts, and extracellular proteins. Since the changes in GlcNAc on extracellular proteins were likely to result from changes in N-glycans, we sought to determine whether the increase in terminal GlcNAc residues shown in Fig. 2 was due to changes in O-linked and/or N-linked GlcNAc. We used the enzyme PNGase F to differentiate between GlcNAc linked to proteins through N-glycans or other means. In untreated cells, essentially all of the radiolabel was resistant to PNGase F digestion (Fig. 3A, compare 0 h − PNGase F with 0 h + PNGase F), implying that the majority of the GlcNAc residues are O-linked. In contrast, the nocodazole-treated samples showed significant sensitivity to the PNGase F digestion (Fig. 3A, compare 32 h − PNGase F with 32 h + PNGase F). In fact, the increase in galactose incorporation caused by the nocodazole treatment could be completely accounted for by the increase in PNGase F-sensitive (i.e. N-linked) material. Thus, nocodazole appeared to induce an increase in terminal GlcNAc residues on N-glycans in these cells, but it caused no significant changes in the PNGase F-resistant (i.e. O-linked) material. To confirm that the labeled sugars remaining on the proteins after PNGase F digestion were in the form of O-GlcNAc, the PNGase F-resistant material from both the control and nocodazole-treated samples was subjected to alkali-induced β-elimination. This caused the majority (>90%) of the radioactivity to be released from the protein fraction (Fig. 3B), indicating that the PNGase F-resistant radioactivity was O-linked to the protein. To determine the structure of the material released by the β-elimination, the samples were subjected to size (Fig. 3C) and high pressure anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3D) analyses. These analyses demonstrated that the released sugars were essentially all in the form of [3H]galactose-β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminitol, the expected product of galactose-labeled O-GlcNAc. Thus, essentially all of the PNGase F-resistant [3H]galactose was linked to O-GlcNAc. To examine whether we could see changes in the level of O-GlcNAc on proteins in response to nocodazole treatment, we examined the pattern of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins from control and nocodazole-treated cells by SDS-PAGE and fluorography after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 4A). As shown above, a large increase in PNGase F-sensitive terminal GlcNAc residues was induced by the nocodazol"
https://openalex.org/W1504590735,"Many signals that cause apoptotic cell death operate by inducing transcription and translation of other (presumably death effector) mediators, and it is well established that stimulus-induced apoptosis can often be blocked by inhibiting transcription and translation. Transcriptional regulation of apoptosis, however, is incompletely understood. To gain insight into nuclear events associated with signal-induced apoptosis during T cell development, we studied signal-induced apoptosis of ex vivo isolated immature CD8(+)4(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Stimuli utilizing the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway or its parts (an alphaCD3/TCR monoclonal antibody, a Ca2+ ionophore, or a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester) or a stimulus that antagonizes TCR signaling and apoptosis in T cell hybridoma (forskolin, a cyclic AMP-signaling activator) resulted in massive apoptosis of DP thymocytes. At the same time, these stimuli induced qualitatively similar but quantitatively unique patterns of inducible transcription factors (TFs) NF-kappaB/RelA-p50, AP-1 (Fos-Jun), and NUR-77. We focused our attention on the role of AP-1 (Fos-Jun) complex, which was strongly induced by all of the above stimuli and thus was a candidate for a proapoptotic TF. However, we found that AP-1/c-Fos induction was vital in prolonging DP thymocyte life, as judged by increased spontaneous and induced death of DP cells in Fos-/- mice. In direct support of this hypothesis, experiments with antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that c-Fos plays an essential role in protecting normal DP thymocytes from Ca2+- and cAMP-induced apoptosis but not from TCR-mediated death. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role for c-Fos in maintaining longevity of DP thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2140643877,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) is known to transmodulate the activity and level of the erbB-2/neu protein in several epithelial cell lines. We therefore determined which structural features of the EGF-R were important in transmodulating erbB-2. We found that the addition of EGF to nontransformed epithelial cells resulted in down-regulation of erbB-2 with the same kinetics and similar extent as the EGF-R. By using cells expressing a series of EGF-R modified by site-directed mutagenesis, we found that EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity was not necessary for down-regulation of erbB-2, but receptor sequences between 899 and 958 in the EGF-R were required. To determine whether transmodulation was associated with activation of erbB-2, tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-2 was determined following addition of EGF. Again, phosphorylation of erbB-2 following EGF addition did not require the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF-R, but did require sequences between 899 and 958. To determine the localization of EGF-R and erbB-2 following EGF addition, the relative distribution of the two receptors was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Surprisingly, the majority of erbB-2 was found in small cytoplasmic vesicles, whereas the EGF-R was predominantly found on the cell surface. Addition of EGF resulted in a redistribution and consequent colocalization of both receptors in endosomal and lysosomal structures. We conclude that activation and transmodulation of erbB-2 does not require intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF-R, but does require sequences in the EGF-R which regulate its trafficking.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF-Repidermal growth factor receptorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. is the prototype for a family of four related cell surface receptors: EGF-R, erbB-2, erbB-3, and erbB-4. Each receptor has a single membrane-spanning domain, a ligand-activated tyrosine kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated and serve as SH2 domain docking sites (1Yarden Y.

Significantly, none of the tyrosine residues known to serve as autophosphorylation sites in EGF-R are conserved in the other erbB family members. epidermal growth factor receptor 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Signaling through EGF-R homologs is known to play a key role in the development of Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mouse embryos. Studies of Drosophila embryos demonstrate the requirement for the Drosophila EGF-R in the establishment of both anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral polarities (8Roth S. Neuman-Silberberg F.S.

Ohshima Y. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1990; 348: 669-693Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recently, mice lacking functional EGF-R have been generated, resulting in many developmental defects in epithelial and neural tissues (11Gassmann M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R.

Ligand activation of EGF-R leads to heterodimer formation between EGF-R and erbB-2, which is thought to result in activation of erbB-2 by transphosphorylation (21Stern D.F. Kamps M.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Kokai Y. Myers J.N. Wada T. Brown V.I. LeVea C.M. Davis J.G. Dobashi K. Greene M.I. Cell. 1989; 8: 287-292Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Transactivation of erbB-2 also occurs upon the addition of heregulin, a ligand for erbB-3 and erbB-4 (23Holmes W.E.

As observed for EGF, heregulin induces the formation of heterodimers between erbB-3 or erbB-4 with erbB-2, resulting in erbB-2 becoming tyrosine phosphorylated (4Dougall W.C. Qian X. Peterson N.C. Miller M.J. Samanta A. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2109-2123PubMed Google Scholar, 7Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl.

Decker S.J. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that EGF-R interacts with erbB-3 and erbB-4 (29Cohen B.D. Green J.M. Foy L. Fell H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4813-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of any member of the EGF-R family results in signaling through multiple receptor types. Understanding how these receptors interact with each other is therefore essential to knowing how they work. The pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R and erbB-2 is important in signal transduction. Specific phosphorylated tyrosines residues serve as docking sites for proteins containing SH2 domains, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit and GRB2 (27Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The assembly of signaling complexes dictates the subsequent pattern of signal transduction. Intracellular trafficking of the activated EGF-R also regulates receptor activity by controlling the availability of substrates and signaling partners (30Baass P.C. Di Guglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although ligand binding induces rapid internalization and subsequent lysosomal targeting of EGF-R, it is uncertain whether erbB-2 trafficking is influenced by the EGF-R. It has been suggested that all members of the erbB family are “internalization defective” except for the EGF-R (31Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), but those studies were done by direct activation of erbB family members or by using chimeric receptors. It has been reported that EGF treatment can stimulate the degradation of erbB-2 in some epithelial cells, but the mechanism of this transmodulation is unclear (32Kornilova E.S. Taverna D. Hoeck W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). If EGF-R activation does alter the trafficking of erbB-2, this could be an important mechanism for regulating both the activity and distribution of these signaling molecules in cells. We have previously investigated the mechanisms that regulate the activity and distribution of EGF-R in cells. We have now extended our studies to examine the ability of the EGF-R to transmodulate erbB-2. We report here that activation of the EGF-R does result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-2 and a subsequent loss in the cellular mass of erbB-2. Surprisingly, this transmodulation does not require either the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF-R or sequences in its regulatory carboxy tail. Sequences containing the lysosomal targeting domain of the EGF-R were required, however, suggesting that correct intracellular trafficking of the EGF-R is necessary for transmodulation of other members of the erbB family. Polyclonal rabbit antibody N-13 directed against a peptide corresponding to residues 1-13 in human EGF-R was a gift of Dr. Debora Cadena. Polyclonal rabbit antibody 1917 to erbB-2 directed against a peptide corresponding to the 18 carboxyl-terminal residues of human erbB-2, were provided by Dr. Gordon Gill. Rabbit polyclonal antibody C18 against amino acids 1169-1186 of neu/erbB-2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine were generated and affinity-purified as described (33Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 528, 579, and 225 against the EGF-R (34Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A. Sato J.D. Masui H. McLeod C. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7755-7760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified from hybridomas obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Monoclonal antibody 13A9 against the human EGF-R was a generous gift from Genentech. Ab5 against the extracellular domain of human erbB-2 was obtained from Oncogene Sciences. Secondary antibodies labeled with either Texas Red or fluorescein were obtained from Cappel Laboratories. B82 mouse L cells, which contain no endogenous EGF receptors (35Davies R.L. Grosse V.A. Kucherlapati R. Bothwell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and B82 cells transfected with normal (WT) or mutated (M721,c′647,c′958, and M721c′958) human EGF receptors were a generous gift of Dr. Gordon Gill. Their construction was described previously (36Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). B82 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories) containing dialyzed 10% calf serum (HyClone). 5 μM Methotrexate was added to the medium for those cells transfected with human EGF receptor. The human mammary epithelial cell line 184A1L5 (37Stampfer M.R. Pan C.H. Hosoda J. Bartholomew J. Mendelsohn J. Yaswen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Martha Stampfer and was cultured in medium DFCI-1 as described (38Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The human mammary epithelial line HB2 was a gift from Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou and were grown as described (39Bartek J. Bartkova J. Kyprianou N. Lalani E.N. Staskova Z. Shearer M. Chang S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SKBR3 cells (40King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in McCoys 5A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone). Confluent cultures of cells were rinsed and lysed in an Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris, pH 8) and debris removed by centrifugation. Samples were brought to 2% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of total cellular protein from each sample were separated on 5-7.5% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. EGF-R and erbB-2 were detected by N-13 and 1917 polyclonal antisera, respectively, using 125I-labeled protein A as described (41Opresko L.K. Chang C.-P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The concentrations of and incubation times with 125I-labeled protein A were chosen to be in the linear range of the protein load of the gels. The blots were analyzed by storage phosphor plates using the Bio-Rad G250 Molecular Imager. The Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst package was used to quantify the amount of radioactivity associated with each band. In some cases, EGF-R levels were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (42Will B.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. Tissue Eng. 1995; 1: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this case, cells were extracted for 10 min at 0 °C in 20 mM CHAPS, 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 4 mM iodoacetate, and 100 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Standard curves were generated using extracts from B82 cells expressing a known level of EGF-R protein and using receptor-negative B82 cells as blanks. To determine the tyrosine phosphosphate content of erbB-2 protein, cells were lysed for 10 min at 0 °C in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 4 mM iodoacetate, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 0 °C, the 1917 anti-erbB-2 polyclonal antiserum was added (1:100) followed by rocking for 3 h followed by the addition of 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) for an additional hour. The beads were washed several times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer prior to gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose as detailed above. Phosphotyrosine was detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and erbB-2 protein was quantified in a parallel blot using 1917 antiserum. The Bio-Rad G250 Molecular Imager and the Molecular Analyst package was used to quantify the amount of radioactivity associated with each band. Total cellular RNA was isolated using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) following the manufacture's directions. cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and specific products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the Idaho Technology air cycler with the following primers and protocols; erbB2, 5′-AACTGCACCCACTCCTGTGT-3′ and 5′-CAGGGATCCAGATGCCCTTG-3′ at 63° C, annealing, 94° C polymerization for 15 s for 30 cycles. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAGCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCAC-3′ at 63° C annealing, 94° C polymerization for 15 s for 24 cycles. The number of cycles was chosen empirically to keep product amplification in the linear range. Reaction products were separated on 1.8% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips 48 h before the experiment. Cells treated either without or with EGF were fixed for 10 min with freshly prepared 3.6% paraformaldehyde and 0.024% saponin in Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 0.1% NaB3H4 for 10 min. Cells were incubated simultaneously with a mixture of anti-EGF-R monoclonals 528, 579, 225, and 13A9 (10 μg/ml each) and anti-erbB-2 C18 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 0.012% saponin for 45 min followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse and Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:100) for 45 min. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and viewed with a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a × 40 oil immersion objective. Images (512 × 512) were acquired using a Photometrics cooled CCD camera with a Macintosh workstation running OncorImage software. For confocal microscopy, samples were viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal imaging system attached to a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a × 60 objective. Excitation was achieved with a Krypton/Argon laser using the 488 and 568 nm lines. Paired images (384 × 512 pixels each) were individually scaled to 256 gray levels using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 on the Macintosh before output to a film recorder. Cells were removed from plates by a brief trypsinization, which did not alter the measurable number of either EGF-R or erbB-2 at the cell surface. Cells were fixed for 10 min at 22 °C in freshly prepared 3.6% paraformaldehyde, rinsed, and incubated for 1 h in either anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody 225 or anti-erbB-2 monoclonal antibody Ab5 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. Samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometry instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and the data analyzed using Cell Quest software. It is known that binding of EGF to its receptor leads to rapid internalization and reduction of EGF-R levels as a result of lysosomal targeting (43Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). It is also well established that activated EGF-R can form heterodimers with erbB-2, resulting in erbB-2 transactivation (44Wada T. Qian X.L. Greene M.I. Cell. 1990; 61: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Studies using a normal mouse mammary cell line, HC11, showed that EGF treatment resulted in a loss of erbB-2 cell surface expression due to accelerated degradation (32Kornilova E.S. Taverna D. Hoeck W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, however, using either Rat-1 cells (45Stern D.F. Heffernan P.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or transformed human cell lines showed that EGF had no affect on erbB-2 levels (40King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our first goal, therefore, was to determine whether erbB-2 expression or trafficking was affected by EGF in a non-transformed human mammary epithelial cell line, 184A1L5 (37Stampfer M.R. Pan C.H. Hosoda J. Bartholomew J. Mendelsohn J. Yaswen P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This line is mitogenically responsive to EGF and expresses both EGF-R and erbB-2. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 1 h at 37 °C. The levels of cell surface EGF-R and erbB-2 were then measured by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1, EGF treatment reduced the surface expression of EGF-R in 184A1L5 cells by approximately 50%. Although cell surface erbB-2 levels were not as high as EGF-R levels, EGF treatment resulted in an approximately 3-fold reduction in their levels. These data demonstrate that activation of the EGF-R in mammary epithelial cells not only down-regulates the EGF-R, but also reduces the surface levels of erbB-2. To determine whether the reduction of surface erbB-2 levels was accompanied by a reduction in total cellular erbB-2 mass, we treated cells with EGF for varying periods of time and then determined total erbB-2 levels by Western blot analysis. EGF-R levels were simultaneously measured by using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (42Will B.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. Tissue Eng. 1995; 1: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). EGF treatment resulted in a progressive loss of both proteins over a 24-h time period (Fig. 2, left panel). These data show that EGF can down-regulate erbB-2 levels in cells in a similar manner as the EGF-R, confirming results previously obtained with mouse mammary epithelial cells (32Kornilova E.S. Taverna D. Hoeck W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics and extent of loss of both proteins were remarkably similar, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be responsible. If this “transmodulation” of erbB-2 by the EGF-R requires a direct physical interaction between the two molecules, then it should be possible to define the responsible structural features of the EGF-R. To define the structural features of the EGF-R responsible for transmodulation of erbB-2, it is preferable to use a cell type which expressed normal levels of erbB-2, but does not have endogenous EGF-R. This allows the use of different mutant forms of the EGF-R introduced by gene transfection. A suitable cell type is the mouse B82 cell line which expresses the murine homolog of erbB-2, but lacks endogenous EGF-R (35Davies R.L. Grosse V.A. Kucherlapati R. Bothwell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4188-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether activated EGF-R could alter the levels of erbB-2 in this cell line, we added EGF to B82 cells expressing an introduced human EGF-R (36Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (right panel), EGF treatment caused an approximate 75% loss of both EGF-R and erbB-2 protein levels. Again, the kinetics and extent of erbB-2 loss paralleled that observed for the EGF-R. We conclude that the ability of the EGF-R to affect the cellular levels of erbB-2 in B82 cells appears similar to that observed in human mammary epithelial cells. The rapidity of the EGF-induced loss of erbB-2 implicates a degradative mechanism. It remained a formal possibility, however, that a reduction in erbB-2 mRNA levels could also be involved. To check for this possibility, both 184A1L5 and B82 cells were treated without or with 100 ng of EGF for 4 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted and the levels of erbB-2 mRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of either cell type with EGF had no discernible effect of erbB-2 mRNA levels. This result is consistent with a post-translational mechanism for the reduction of erbB-2 levels by EGF treatment. It is known that the decrease in EGF-R protein levels in response to EGF addition is due to enhanced lysosomal targeting. Because of the similar kinetics of the loss of both EGF-R and erbB-2, it seemed reasonable that the same mechanism could be responsible. Immunofluorescence visualization is a sensitive method for determining enhanced lysosomal targeting of EGF-R. Therefore, we visualized the distribution of both EGF-R and erbB-2 in B82 cells incubated either with or without EGF. As shown in Fig. 4A, EGF-R display a predominantly cell surface localization in the absence of EGF. Surprisingly, erbB-2 was primarily localized in small cytoplasmic vesicles, although some was found associated with the cell surface (Fig. 4B). There was little overlap between the EGF-R and erbB-2 staining pattern. The addition of peptide specific for the anti-erbB-2 antibody abolished the erbB-2 immunofluorescence, but had no effect on the EGF-R staining pattern (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating the observed localization was specific for erbB-2. The addition of EGF resulted in reduced levels of surface EGF-R and a corresponding increase in intracellular EGF-R, particularly in perinuclear and lysosomal structures (Fig. 4E). Significantly, EGF also caused a redistribution of erbB-2 into lysosomal structures (Fig. 4F). Although EGF treatment increased the overlap between intracellular EGF-R and erbB-2, there was still a large number of vesicles that contained either EGF-R or erbB-2, but not both. We conclude that EGF treatment accelerates lysosomal targeting of both the EGF-R and erbB-2, but that the normal cellular distribution of the two proteins is different. We were surprised at the predominant intracellular localization of erbB-2 because this receptor has previously been described as being cell surface-associated (45Stern D.F. Heffernan P.A. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine whether the intracellular localization of erbB-2 in B82 cells was atypical, we used confocal microscopy to examine the localization of erbB-2 in various cell lines (Fig. 5). In the case of both B82 cells and the nontransformed human mammary epithelial cell line HB2, there was a high level of intracellular erbB-2 (top and middle right panels), whereas the EGF-R displayed primarily a cell surface distribution (top and middle left panels). The human mammary epithelial cell line 184A1L5 also displayed significant levels of intracellular erbB-2 (data not shown). In contrast, the transformed cell line SKBR3 which overexpresses erbB-2, showed an almost exclusive cell surface localization (bottom panels). This distribution also corresponded to the location of the EGF-R (bottom left panel). We conclude that a significant fraction of erbB-2 can exist in an intracellular compartment in nontransformed cells and that in the absence of EGF, the distribution of EGF-R and erbB-2 is distinct. The cell surface distribution of erbB-2 previously described may either be a result of cell transformation or overexpression of erbB-2. Several models could explain the ability of activated EGF-R to target erbB-2 to lysosomes. One is that the EGF-R activates erbB-2 by direct tyrosine tra"
https://openalex.org/W2169088424,"Alterations to the highly conserved Asp549 of the retroviral ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain were evaluated in the heterodimeric (p66/p51) reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency and equine infectious anemia viruses. In addition to the polymerization-dependent and -independent modes of template hydrolysis, mutants were evaluated via their ability to select and extend the 3′ polypurine tract (PPT) primers of these two lentiviruses into (+) strand DNA. Concerted and two-step reactions were designed to evaluate (+) strand priming, the latter of which allows discrimination between selection end extension events. In contrast to enzyme mutated at the highly conserved Glu478, substitution of Asp549 with Asn or Ala reduces, rather than completely eliminates, RNase H activity. When the requirement for RNase H function becomes more stringent, differences in activity are readily evident, most notably in the cleavage events liberating the 5′ terminus of the PPT primer. PPT selection thus appears to represent a specialized form of RNase H activity that is more sensitive to minor structural alterations within this domain and may provide a novel therapeutic target."

This induction leads to the formation of high affinity IL-2 receptors when IL-2Rα is co-expressed with the β (IL-2Rβ) and γ (γc) chains of this receptor. We investigated the signaling pathways mediating IL-2-induced IL-2Rα mRNA expression using 32D myeloid progenitor cells stably transfected with either wild type IL-2Rβ or mutants of IL-2Rβ containing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions. Of the six cytoplasmic tyrosines in IL-2Rβ, we have found that only the two tyrosines that mediate Stat5 activation (Tyr-392 and Tyr-510) contribute to IL-2-induced IL-2Rα gene expression and that either tyrosine alone is sufficient for this process. Interestingly, the IL-7 receptor contains a tyrosine (Tyr-429)-based sequence resembling the motifs encompassing Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 of IL-2Rβ. Further paralleling the IL-2 system, IL-7 could activate Stat5 and drive expression of IL-2Rα mRNA in 32D cells transfected with the human IL-7R. However, IL-3 could not induce IL-2Rα mRNA in 32D cells, despite its ability to activate Stat5 via the endogenous IL-3 receptor.

To elucidate the role of these or other pathways in IL-2-induced expression of the IL-2Rα gene, we have examined multiple combinations of these tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions in IL-2Rβ. These experiments show that IL-2Rβ mutants possessing Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 alone can augment expression of the IL-2Rα gene, whereas no IL-2Rα induction occurs when both Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 are mutated. Although previous studies link these tyrosines to Stat5 activation, our data suggest that Stat5 activation is not sufficient for IL-2Rα induction and that the same tyrosines may couple to additional signaling pathway(s).DISCUSSIONUsing IL-2Rβ constructs containing various combinations of tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, we have demonstrated that in the context of full-length IL-2Rβ either Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 is sufficient to direct IL-2-mediated induction of the IL-2Rα gene. Based on these results, at least four different models potentially explain the proximal events in IL-2Rα gene induction following binding of IL-2 to its receptor. In the first model, STATs are activated after docking at phosphorylated Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 and by themselves are sufficient for IL-2Rα gene induction (Fig. 7A). However, the failure of IL-3 to promote IL-2Rα gene expression in 32D transfectants minimizes this possibility, as the same STAT proteins are activated by IL-2 and IL-3 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).Fig. 7Models of IL-2-mediated IL-2Rα gene induction. A, this model couples STAT activation to Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 and attributes IL-2Rα gene induction to STAT activation alone. B, this scheme links Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 to activation of an unknown factor X that is sufficient to drive expression of the IL-2Rα gene. The remaining two diagrams presented in C and D involve a combination of STAT activation and an unknown factor X. C, while STATs are activated via phosphorylated Tyr-392 or Tyr-510, factor X interacts in cis from a distinct portion of IL-2Rβ. D, the final model depicts the activation of both STATs and factor X from Tyr-392 or Tyr-510.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The remaining models therefore assume that STAT protein activation is not the sole pathway triggered by IL-2 in the induction of IL-2Rα mRNA. For example, the second model (Fig. 7B) portrays a direct interaction between an undefined “X” factor and Tyr-392 or Tyr-510, without the need for concomitant STAT activation. However, this paradigm is unlikely given the existence of consensus STAT binding sequences in the upstream region of the human and murine IL-2Rα promoters and the inability of IL-2 to induce IL-2Rα promoter activity when these binding sequences are mutated (14John S. Robbins C.M. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5627-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthesy P. Reichenbach P. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Incorporating these facts, the third model (Fig. 7C) depicts the interaction of STAT proteins activated at Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 with an unknown factor X bound to a different portion of IL-2Rβ. In this scheme, the requirement for these signaling molecules to functionally collaborate in cis accounts for the inability of IL-3 to rescue IL-2Rα gene induction when providing activated STATs in trans. Finally, the fourth model (Fig. 7D) links Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 to the activation of both STAT proteins and an additional signaling molecule (factor X). This scheme effectively couples both Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 to two separate pathways that cooperate in IL-2Rα gene induction. In turn, the “non-STAT” pathway may influence activation of other transcription factors required for IL-2Rα mRNA expression, consistent with the complex regulation of this gene (13John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.-X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14John S. Robbins C.M. Leonard W.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10743-10753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Although we favor the final model, the identity of the putative additional signaling molecule for IL-2-induced IL-2Rα gene expression is unknown. Examination of the IL-7 receptor system may provide some insights in view of its functional overlap with IL-2Rβ. For example, in addition to Stat5 activation (26Lin J.-X. Migone T.-S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J.A. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E.T. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), Tyr-429 of the IL-7R has been implicated in the activation of PI 3-kinase (37Venkitaraman A.R. Cowling R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Along these lines, one published report proposed a direct interaction between Tyr-392 of IL-2Rβ and PI 3-kinase based on phosphopeptide competition experiments (38Truitt K.E. Mills G.B. Turck C.W. Imboden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5937-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, because the same analysis failed to demonstrate any interaction between PI 3-kinase and Tyr-510 of IL-2Rβ (38Truitt K.E. Mills G.B. Turck C.W. Imboden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5937-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase is unlikely to represent the missing molecule depicted in Fig. 7D that must be capable of interacting with Tyr-510 as well asTyr-392. Further comparison of the IL-7 and IL-2 receptor systems reveals that both receptors employ Jak1 and Jak3. In contrast, IL-3 signaling involves Jak2. However, the use of Jak2 instead of Jak1 and Jak3 does not fully explain the inability of IL-3 to induce the IL-2Rα gene, as erythropoietin also activates Jak2 but can induce IL-2Rα mRNA in 32D cells transfected with the murine erythropoietin receptor (data not shown).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 play vital but redundant roles in IL-2Rα gene induction. Although more work is required to clarify the proximal events that culminate in IL-2-mediated expression of this gene, the evidence supports the existence of additional signaling molecule(s)/pathway(s) linked to Tyr-392 and Tyr-510. Defining the missing element(s) may reveal yet another IL-2-mediated signaling pathway and provide insight to critical processes regulating the immune response.

To elucidate the role of these or other pathways in IL-2-induced expression of the IL-2Rα gene, we have examined multiple combinations of these tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions in IL-2Rβ. These experiments show that IL-2Rβ mutants possessing Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 alone can augment expression of the IL-2Rα gene, whereas no IL-2Rα induction occurs when both Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 are mutated. Although previous studies link these tyrosines to Stat5 activation, our data suggest that Stat5 activation is not sufficient for IL-2Rα induction and that the same tyrosines may couple to additional signaling pathway(s).

Although previous studies link these tyrosines to Stat5 activation, our data suggest that Stat5 activation is not sufficient for IL-2Rα induction and that the same tyrosines may couple to additional signaling pathway(s). DISCUSSIONUsing IL-2Rβ constructs containing various combinations of tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, we have demonstrated that in the context of full-length IL-2Rβ either Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 is sufficient to direct IL-2-mediated induction of the IL-2Rα gene. Based on these results, at least four different models potentially explain the proximal events in IL-2Rα gene induction following binding of IL-2 to its receptor. In the first model, STATs are activated after docking at phosphorylated Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 and by themselves are sufficient for IL-2Rα gene induction (Fig. 7A). However, the failure of IL-3 to promote IL-2Rα gene expression in 32D transfectants minimizes this possibility, as the same STAT proteins are activated by IL-2 and IL-3 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5).The remaining models therefore assume that STAT protein activation is not the sole pathway triggered by IL-2 in the induction of IL-2Rα mRNA. For example, the second model (Fig. 7B) portrays a direct interaction between an undefined “X” factor and Tyr-392 or Tyr-510, without the need for concomitant STAT activation. However, this paradigm is unlikely given the existence of consensus STAT binding sequences in the upstream region of the human and murine IL-2Rα promoters and the inability of IL-2 to induce IL-2Rα promoter activity when these binding sequences are mutated (14John S. Robbins C.M. Leonard W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5627-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Sperisen P. Wang S.M. Soldaini E. Pla M. Rusterholz C. Bucher P. Corthesy P. Reichenbach P.

Incorporating these facts, the third model (Fig. 7C) depicts the interaction of STAT proteins activated at Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 with an unknown factor X bound to a different portion of IL-2Rβ. In this scheme, the requirement for these signaling molecules to functionally collaborate in cis accounts for the inability of IL-3 to rescue IL-2Rα gene induction when providing activated STATs in trans. Finally, the fourth model (Fig. 7D) links Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 to the activation of both STAT proteins and an additional signaling molecule (factor X). This scheme effectively couples both Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 to two separate pathways that cooperate in IL-2Rα gene induction. In turn, the “non-STAT” pathway may influence activation of other transcription factors required for IL-2Rα mRNA expression, consistent with the complex regulation of this gene (13John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.-X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14John S. Robbins C.M. Leonard W.J.

Examination of the IL-7 receptor system may provide some insights in view of its functional overlap with IL-2Rβ. For example, in addition to Stat5 activation (26Lin J.-X. Migone T.-S. Tsang M.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), Tyr-429 of the IL-7R has been implicated in the activation of PI 3-kinase (37Venkitaraman A.R. Cowling R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Along these lines, one published report proposed a direct interaction between Tyr-392 of IL-2Rβ and PI 3-kinase based on phosphopeptide competition experiments (38Truitt K.E. Mills G.B. Turck C.W. Imboden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5937-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, because the same analysis failed to demonstrate any interaction between PI 3-kinase and Tyr-510 of IL-2Rβ (38Truitt K.E. Mills G.B. Turck C.W. Imboden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5937-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase is unlikely to represent the missing molecule depicted in Fig. 7D that must be capable of interacting with Tyr-510 as well asTyr-392. Further comparison of the IL-7 and IL-2 receptor systems reveals that both receptors employ Jak1 and Jak3. In contrast, IL-3 signaling involves Jak2. However, the use of Jak2 instead of Jak1 and Jak3 does not fully explain the inability of IL-3 to induce the IL-2Rα gene, as erythropoietin also activates Jak2 but can induce IL-2Rα mRNA in 32D cells transfected with the murine erythropoietin receptor (data not shown).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 play vital but redundant roles in IL-2Rα gene induction. Although more work is required to clarify the proximal events that culminate in IL-2-mediated expression of this gene, the evidence supports the existence of additional signaling molecule(s)/pathway(s) linked to Tyr-392 and Tyr-510. Defining the missing element(s) may reveal yet another IL-2-mediated signaling pathway and provide insight to critical processes regulating the immune response. Using IL-2Rβ constructs containing various combinations of tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, we have demonstrated that in the context of full-length IL-2Rβ either Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 is sufficient to direct IL-2-mediated induction of the IL-2Rα gene.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Tyr-392 and Tyr-510 play vital but redundant roles in IL-2Rα gene induction. Although more work is required to clarify the proximal events that culminate in IL-2-mediated expression of this gene, the evidence supports the existence of additional signaling molecule(s)/pathway(s) linked to Tyr-392 and Tyr-510. Defining the missing element(s) may reveal yet another IL-2-mediated signaling pathway and provide insight to critical processes regulating the immune response. We thank Cetus Corp. as well as G.

https://openalex.org/W2116541356,"We examined previously unexplored aspects of the tetramerization and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding properties of native, precursor, and mutated forms of mitochondrial ssDNA-binding protein (mtSSB) from a mammalian organism (mouse). Tetramic forms of mtSSB reassemble spontaneously after thermal denaturation and undergo subunit exchange. Binding of mtSSB to ssDNA as a function of protein concentration is nonlinear, suggesting a concentration-dependent transition in intrinsic binding affinity and in the topology of the DNA-protein complex. The cleavable presequence at the amino terminus of the precursor form of mtSSB does not disrupt tetramer formation but has a specific inhibitory effect on DNA binding that is not seen in a fusion protein that substitutes a bulkier peptide moiety in this position. Mutated forms of mtSSB bearing amino acid substitutions at highly conserved amino acid positions exhibit subtle or severe defects in ssDNA binding activity and/or tetramerization, even when assembled into heterotetramers in combination with wild-type mtSSB monomers. These experiments provide new insights into structural and functional properties of mammalian mtSSB and have implications for the pathogenesis of human diseases resulting from defects in mtDNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2020109036,"The protein tyrosine kinase Syk is activated upon engagement of immune recognition receptors. We have focused on the identification of signaling elements immediately downstream to Syk in the pathway leading to T cell activation. To circumvent T cell receptor (TCR)·CD3 activation of Src family kinases, we constructed a signaling molecule with an extracellular single chain Fv of an anti-TNP antibody, attached via a transmembrane region to Syk (scFv-Syk). In a murine T cell hybridoma, direct aggregation of chimeric Syk with antigen culminates in interleukin-2 production and target cell lysis. Initially, it causes an increase in the association between scFv-Syk and the cytosolic protein Cbl and subsequently promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. Interestingly, although both Cbl and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) are phosphorylated in this hybridoma upon TCR·CD3 cross-linking, these two events are uncoupled in scFv-Syk-transfected cells, in which we were unable to detect antigen-driven PLC-γ phosphorylation. These results support a model in which Syk can initiate and directly activate the T cell's signaling machinery and position Cbl as a primary tyrosine kinase substrate in this pathway. Furthermore, for efficient PLC-γ phosphorylation to occur in these cells, the combined actions of different tyrosine kinase families may be required."

During the last 10 years, the use of site-specifically and stereospecifically modified oligonucleotides has played a major role not only in defining which DNA adducts are mutagenic but also in instructing us how different DNA polymerases interact at those sites. We have expanded these studies to use DNA lesions as a probe of polymerase structure and function. The decision to use HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency virusRTreverse transcriptaseSOstyrene oxide. RT as the polymerase of choice is warranted not only because the cocrystal structure is known for an intact enzyme/DNA complex (1Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) but also because of the tremendous biological significance of RT. Previously using this strategy, we demonstrated that the major groove DNA adducts, N6-adenine SO lesions, were readily bypassed by wild type RT, only to experience termination/pause sites 3-5 bases beyond the site of the lesion (2Latham G.J. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites of enhanced termination probabilities corresponded to the adduct being positioned in the template-primer duplex near the thumb subdomain of the polymerase, where the DNA is in close contact with an α-helix and is making the transition from A to B form DNA. Our results could be rationalized because in this bend, the minor groove is widened with a compensatory narrowing of the major groove. The presence of an adduct in the major groove at this position was hypothesized to be the likely source of the enhanced termination through alteration of the minor groove α-helix H contacts, 3-5 bases upstream of the 3′-OH. human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase styrene oxide. To further test whether DNA adducts can give insight into the structure and functioning of HIV-1 RT, we have carried out a study in which monocyclic, minor groove adducts known to cause no significant perturbation to the local DNA structure (3Zegar I.S. Setayesh F.R. DeCorte B.L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4334-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were used to probe DNA-protein contacts. This study was designed to accomplish the following: 1) determine the effects that these minor groove DNA lesions might have on HIV-1 RT replication, 2) monitor the movement of DNA at a distance from the catalytic site as it traverses through the polymerase, and 3) identify key amino acid residues important for adduct bypass when the adducts are positioned in the template-primer duplex. To accomplish these objectives, we chose to build site-specific and stereospecific SO N2-guanine minor groove adducts into 63-mer oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). The R enantiomer of SO is oriented in the 3′ direction relative to the template strand such that it is pointing toward the 3′-OH of the elongating primer (3Zegar I.S. Setayesh F.R. DeCorte B.L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4334-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The S enantiomer has the opposite orientation such that it is pointing in the same direction as DNA synthesis. Consequently, although both R and S adducts report specific interactions within the minor groove, the two enantiomers have nearly opposite spatial orientations. This stereospecificity in the SO lesions offers an opportunity to probe different polymerases-DNA contacts within the context of an otherwise identical template-primer. Also, throughout these studies, we used three forms of HIV-1 RT: the wild type heterodimer (i.e. p66/p51) and two mutant heterodimers, W266A and G262A, whose amino acid alterations are located in α-helix H of the thumb subdomain. Analysis of the cocrystal structure suggests that this α-helix H makes contact with the minor groove of the newly synthesized DNA as it undergoes a 45 ° bend and transition from A to B form DNA (Fig. 2). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has revealed that these two residues make important DNA contacts and that alanine substitution drastically elevates koff and reduces processivity and frameshift fidelity (4Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bebenek K. Beard W.A.

In contrast, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of α-helix I, which sits over the template phosphate backbone (Fig. 2), has suggested that these residues do not make critical DNA contacts (6Beard W.A.

Wild type HIV-1 RT and mutants were prepared as described previously (4Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 11-mer oligonucleotides adducted with R and S enantiomers of styrene oxide at the second position of codon 12 (N2-guanine) of N-ras were synthesized, purified, and supplied by Thomas and Connie Harris (Vanderbilt University) as described previously (7DeCorte B.L. Tsarouhtsis D. Kuchimanchi S. Cooper M.D. Horton P. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two 63-mer templates were constructed by enzymatic ligation (Fig. 1). The SO-adducted 11-mer was ligated to a 20-mer at the 3′ termini and to a 32-mer oligomer at the 5′ termini, in the presence of a 46-mer scaffold. A nonadducted, control 63-mer was also synthesized. Purification of the 63-mers was performed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The sequence of the 63-mer template was as follows, in which the underlined G is the site of adduction: 5′-GAATGTGCAAGATACTGTGGGCAGTGGTGAATGGTCTGGGCAATGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC-3′. The oligonucleotide primers, ranging in length from 17- to 21-mers, were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) using T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). A 12-fold excess of template over the labeled primer was annealed by heating the template-primer mix in the polymerization reaction buffer (33 mM Tris-OAc pH 7.5, 66 mM KOAc, 10 mM MgOAc) for 2 min at 65 °C, followed by slow cooling to <35 °C. Native polyacrylamide gels (10%) were run to confirm that greater than 90% of the primers were annealed to their respective templates. Deoxynucleotides were added to the template-primer mix to a final concentration of 500 μM in a reaction buffer, (33 mM Tris-OAc pH 7.5 at 37 °C, 66 mM KOAc, 10 mM MgOAc, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Wild type HIV-1 RT and the mutant polymerases were added to the reaction mix (10 μl of total volume) at concentrations unique for each enzyme. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. Extensions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol)/2.5 μl of reaction mixture. DNAs were separated through 15% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gels and were run at 2000 V for 3 h. The relative intensities of the termination sites were determined by PhosphorImager technologies. Using unadducted R and S styrene oxide-adducted 63-mers as templates, HIV-1 RT replication was initiated on the primers shown in Fig. 3. The primers are referred to by the position of the 3′-OH relative to the adduct site in the complementary strand, such that the −5 primer initiates synthesis five nucleotides 3′ to the adduct site, the 0 primer is located opposite the lesion, and all the positively numbered primers contain the adducted base within the template-primer duplex. Under replication conditions defining single hit encounters (i.e. conditions leaving most of the primer unextended, 20% utilization) between the polymerase and the primer, wild type HIV-1 RT was readily able to extend the −5 primer (Fig. 4) on unadducted templates to full-length products (Fig. 4, lane 1), whereas under these experimental conditions, there was no evidence that either the R- or S-SO lesions could be bypassed (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Addition of greater amounts of the polymerases revealed that all primers could be extended consistent with the ratio of template and primer being 10:1. The major pause site occurred 1 base prior to the lesion, with only slight incorporation opposite the lesion. However, using vast excesses of enzyme under multiple hit conditions allowed for modest levels of bypass of these lesions (8Latham, G. J., (1995) Replication Fate of DNA Adducted with Single Styrene Oxide Lesions. Ph.D. Thesis, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.Google Scholar). The reduced processivity of the W266A and G262A mutants replicating unadducted templates is apparent by numerous pause sites at positions less than full-length DNAs (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). These pause sites were generally in runs of template purines, and both of these mutants are sensitive to premature termination at the same sites. Similar to the wild type enzyme, under these experimental conditions, neither the W266A or G262A were able to replicate past the R or S adduct site but terminated predominantly 1 base 3′ to the lesion (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9, respectively). No major differences were noted in the extent or site of termination between the oppositely oriented R- or S-SO enantiomers. Because both the R and S enantiomers of SO blocked replication 3′ and opposite the lesion, this result prevented an analysis of the effects that these minor groove adducts might have as they translocate through the HIV-1 RT. To get around this problem, we designed oligonucleotide primers 0 to +2 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) to “mimic” synthesis opposite and beyond the template lesion. Lanes 1-9 of Fig. 5 show the results of replication reactions using reaction conditions consistent with multiple hit conditions with wild type enzyme on unadducted (U) and adducted templates (R-SO (R) and S-SO (S)), which were primed with +2, +1, and 0, respectively. For comparison purposes, single-hit conditions for the unadducted templates are shown in Fig. 4 and indicate processive synthesis by wild type enzyme. Because all of these primers are 17-mers, the length of the full-length products on the unadducted templates increases by 1 base each (Fig. 5, lanes 1, 4, and 7). In strong contrast to the data presented in Fig. 4, the replication beyond the R enantiomer shows dramatic termination at positions 4, 5, 6, and 7 beyond the lesion (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 5, and 8 for the +2, +1, and 0 primers, respectively). Under the reaction conditions used in these experiments, it is of interest to note that the R-SO-containing template could be readily extended using the 0 primer (Fig. 5, lane 9), whereas no synthesis on the S-SO-containing template was observed (Fig. 5, lane 8). It is also of interest to note that the insertion of the seventh base beyond the adduct always results in a very diffuse band, suggesting that different nucleotides can be incorporated at that site (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 5, and 8). Qualitatively similar results were obtained for extension of primers using S-SO-containing templates. However, the following significant differences were observed. Using the +2 and +1 primers, termination occurred primarily at 5 and 6 bases 3′ to the lesion with minor termination at the 4th base position. Additionally, no extension was observed 7 bases beyond the lesion as was seen with the R enantiomer, and the diffuse band was located 6 bases beyond the lesion rather than 7 bases beyond the lesion. The identical series of experiments was carried out using alanine mutants of HIV-1 RT, W266A (Fig. 5, lanes 10-18) and G262A (Fig. 5, lanes 19-27). Using the W266A mutant to replicate beyond the R-SO enantiomer, significant differences were observed relative to the wild type enzyme. Strong termination was observed only at 4, 5, and 6 bases beyond the lesion and the extent of primer utilization decreased significantly from the +2 to 0 primer, such that no synthesis could be observed using the 0 primer. Even more dramatic effects were observed with the templates containing the S enantiomer. Replication was observed only with the +2 primer with termination occurring 4, 5, and 6 bases beyond the lesion. With both the R and S enantiomers, a diffuse band was observed 6 bases beyond the lesion, indicating that replication was being differentially modulated by the alanine substitution at position 266. With the G262A mutant polymerase, termination sites were again qualitatively similar to W266A in that only the +2 primer was effectively utilized (Fig. 5, lanes 20, 21, and 23). No replication was ever observed beyond 6 bases past the lesion, and primer utilization decreased dramatically because the 3′-OH was positioned near the lesion (Fig. 5, lanes 24, 26, and 27). The data presented in Fig. 6 show the results that were obtained when primers were positioned at sites 3, 4, 5, and 6 bases beyond the unadducted site (U) or the R enantiomer (R) with the wild type enzyme. The 5′ ends of these primers were held constant relative to the +2 primer, and thus their lengths increased from 18 to 21 bases. The amount of enzyme and time of reaction were sufficient for the wild type polymerase to completely utilize all primers on unadducted templates and resulted in full-length products. However, using the identical reaction conditions, the +3 to +6 primers on the adducted templates were extended very poorly (Fig. 6, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). In most cases, a single base addition represents >95% of the synthesis that occurred. This result suggests that the polymerase is able to load onto the template-primer duplex but that translocation relative to the DNA did not occur. The exception to this trend was obtained using the +3 primer, in which synthesis was very poor overall, but when it was initiated, the termination sites were at 4, 5, 6, and 7 bases beyond the lesion (Fig. 6, lane 2), a result consistent with data obtained with the 0 to +2 primers. In the previous section, it was demonstrated that wild type HIV-1 RT only very poorly utilized primers in which a minor groove adduct was positioned within the template-primer stem 3-5 bases from the 3′-OH. To ascertain whether mutations in the α-helix that contact this bend might affect replication, we utilized the +3 and +4 primers on unadducted and R-SO enantiomer-containing templates, comparing wild type (1-h primer extension) (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2, +3 primer; lanes 3 and 4, +4 primer), W266A (5-min primer extension) (lanes 5 and 6, +3 primer; lanes 7 and 8, +4 primer), and W266A (1 h primer extension) (lanes 9 and 10, +3 primer; lanes 11 and 12 +4 primer). Under the multiple hit conditions used here, all unadducted templates were extended to completion with both sets of primers. In contrast to what was observed using the wild type enzyme, the +3 primer supported significant DNA synthesis at 5 min and 1 h by W266A (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and 8, respectively). Termination occurred at 4, 5, and 6 bases downstream of the lesion. Although extension of the +4 primer by W266A in 5 min was equal to the wild type after 1 h (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 8, respectively), the W266A mutant extended this primer efficiently after 1 h (lane 12). The overall processivity of the HIV-1 RT can be modulated by a number of factors including both the structure of the polymerase (4Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P.

Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or those that are located in the template-primer stem (10Abbotts J. Bebenek K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10324-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, it has been established that many of the pause sites often occur in homopolymeric runs and synthesis through these sites can lead to frameshift and base substitutions through a template-primer slippage intermediate (9Bebenek K.

Although the fidelity of these reactions was originally expected to be associated with the templating base at the catalytic site, these studies suggested that single nucleotide differences in the template-primer double-stranded region, which were as far away as 6 nucleotides, could influence fidelity (10Abbotts J.

The x-ray crystallographic structure of a RT-DNA complex suggests that α-helix H contacts the minor groove of the template-primer DNA ~4-6 base pairs from the catalytic site.

Ph.D. Thesis, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.Google Scholar). In these experiments, it was shown that termination probabilities were enhanced up to 6-fold at positions 3-5 base pairs beyond the site of the lesion. These data suggested that the presence of the lesions in the major groove modulated important polymerase contacts with the DNA. To gain understanding of the effects that specific minor groove base alterations might have on the polymerase processivity, we chose to monitor the effects that monocyclic adducts might have on termination and the previously described action at a distance. The data presented in Fig. 5 dramatically display the strong termination of wild type replication when the R and S adducts are positioned 4-7 and 4-6 base pairs downstream of the catalytic site, respectively. It is also obvious that these lesions affect the ability of the various primers to be used effectively for replication such that initiation of synthesis from the +2 primer was greater than the amount of replication observed with the +1 primer and decreased further with the 0 primer. This decreased primer utilization was further enhanced when either of the mutant forms of the polymerase (i.e. G262A and W266A) were used. There was no synthesis using the S-SO enantiomer template with either the +1 or 0 primer or the R-SO enantiomer-containing template with the 0 primer. These data suggest that alanine substitution perturbs important DNA contacts within the region where the bend in the DNA is observed to occur. The pertubations are probably residue-specific, because in one case the alanine substitution is increasing the size of the side chain (i.e. G262A) and in the other case dramatically reducing it (i.e. W266A). The exact identity of these two side chains is probably crucial because these residues are highly conserved within the retroviral reverse transcriptases (12Jacobo-Molina A. Arnold E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6351-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the roles of α-helix H may be to monitor the integrity of the newly replicated DNA by facilitating a conformational change in the DNA such that unmodified DNAs are sufficiently malleable to allow progression of processive synthesis, whereas modified DNAs are conformationally constrained to cause pausing and replication termination. For this model and consistent with our data, the presence of monocyclic minor groove adducts near or at the catalytic site are insufficient distortions to completely block the initiation of replication, but adducts near the active site, coupled with α-helix mutations, are sufficient to effectively prevent either initiation or elongation. The question arises whether specific contacts between specific residues in α-helix H and the various SO lesions can be inferred from these data. Careful inspection of the relative termination probabilities from the utilization of the +2 primer give insight into this issue. The percentage of termination for positions 4-7 were calculated for both the R- and S-SO templates for each of the polymerases used (Table I). The residue that gives the greatest differential change is Trp266, which when changed to alanine caused a 2-5 fold enhanced probability to terminate synthesis 4 base pairs beyond the catalytic site. In contrast the G262A mutant only displayed moderate differences in termination probabilities with the R-SO lesion, and those effects were manifested primarily 5 base pairs downstream of the catalytic site. These results are similar to the effect these mutations have on frameshift fidelity where the G262A mutant enhances slippage errors in longer homopolymeric runs than W266A (6Beard W.A. Minnick D.T.

The relative orientations of the R and S SO enantiomers on the template DNA were shown to be 3′ and 5′, respectively (3Zegar I.S. Setayesh F.R. DeCorte B.L. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Stone M.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4334-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This nonintercalative groove binding was solved on duplex DNA and thus in the majority of this study is likely to accurately represent the structure of the DNA prior to polymerase binding, using the +1 to +6 primers. The orientation of the adducts had their most prominent effect on the wild type enzyme in which the 3′-oriented R-SO enantiomer allowed a further progression of the polymerase up to 7 bases beyond the lesion, whereas the 5′-oriented S-SO enantiomer blocked synthesis consistently 1 base shorter (Fig. 4, lanes 1-9). This orientation difference is somewhat surprising because the distances between the lesion and the terminally incorporated nucleoside were significantly different for the two lesions. For example, the distance between the R-SO and the terminal nucleoside spans ~8 bases, whereas this distance is predicted to be only 5 bases on the S-SO lesion. Resolution of this unexpected finding will require the solving of the co-crystal structure of HIV-1 RT with each of these adduct-containing DNAs or solving the NMR solution structure of the complexes. Finally, we have consistently noted that the S-SO-containing templates support lower levels of overall synthesis relative to the R-SO or unadducted templates. Preliminary studies suggest that the kon rate is roughly equivalent but that the koff is distinctly different when the S-SO adduct is in the template-primer stem. 2E. Forgacs, G. Latham, W. A.

This suggests that these adducted oligonucleotides could potentially be used as competitive inhibitors of the action of HIV-1 RT. Thus, overall we conclude that it is possible that replication of a lesion-containing DNA can be used in conjunction with wild type and mutant polymerases to not only gain insight into the parameters that define the molecular interactions between the two macromolecules but also to understand the structure-function relationships of the HIV-1 RT.

INTRODUCTIONSite-specific recombination systems belonging to the integrase family mediate the joining and separation of a variety of replicons (reviewed in Refs. 1Craig N. Annu. Rev.

These fall into several classes, depending on their function, on the complexity of the DNA substrates, and on the number of proteins involved. The simpler systems, like those of phage P1 (3Sternberg N. Hamilton D. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1844-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), mediate recombination at specific short sequences through the action of a recombinase belonging to the integrase family (8Argos P. Landy A. Abremski K. Egan J.B. Haggard-Ljunquist E. Hoess R.H. Kahn M.L. Kalionis B. Narayana S.V.L. Pierson III, L.S. Sternberg N. Leong J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These systems regulate copy number, unlink daughter molecules, and resolve dimeric species to ensure accurate partitioning of the relevant element during cell division. More complex site-specific recombination systems are responsible for inserting and excising phage genomes from their cognate host chromosomes. At least one DNA substrate for these latter systems includes multiple protein binding sites (9Weisberg R.A. Landy A. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 211-250Google Scholar), and proteins other than the recombinase or integrase are required. At least some of these accessory proteins are provided by the host (10Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ball C.A. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This complexity most probably reflects the directionality of these systems; the protein requirements for integrative recombination do not promote the excision reaction and in fact inhibit it, while conditions allowing excisive recombination disfavor the integration reaction (12Landy A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar#x2013;14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 1-22Google Scholar).Work in this laboratory is aimed at understanding the mechanism and regulation of a complex site-specific recombination system derived from the temperate phage HP1 of Hemophilus influenzae Rd, a relative of the P2-186 family of phages (15Esposito D.

The integration and excision of HP1 conform in outline to the analogous reactions first analyzed in λ and its host Escherichia coli (9Weisberg R.A. Landy A. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 211-250Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1747-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates for integration are the 500-bp phage attachment site, attP (18Hauser M.A. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1990; 18: 5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and an 18-bp host site, attB (19Hauser M.A. Scocca J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6859-6864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the HP1 attB site coincides with the anticodon stem-loop sequence of a tRNA gene, and HP1 is one of a diverse group of integrating elements targeted to tRNA genes (20Pierson L.S. Kahn M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Reiter W.-D. Palm P. Yeats S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The integration reaction produces an integrated prophage flanked by the hybrid attachment sites attL and attR, which are the substrates for the excision reaction. Excisive recombination, like integration, requires HP1 integrase and IHF but also requires an additional HP1-encoded protein, HP1 Cox (22Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).HP1 Cox has two effects on site-specific recombination in vitro. It inhibits the integrative reaction of attP and attB, and it activates the excisive reaction of attR and attL (22Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In λ these two effects are mediated by the phage-encoded DNA-binding protein, Xis (23Abremski K. Gottesman S. J. Biol.

Xis controls directionality by altering the relative affinities of Int for two of its binding sites, increasing the affinity for one site (P2) and reducing its interaction with the P1 site; population of the P2 site by Int appears to be vital for λ excision to occur (27Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These changes result from cooperative protein-protein interactions and from changes in bending of the attachment site DNA (24Better M. Wickner S. Auerbach J. Echols H. Cell. 1983; 32: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Thompson J.F. Moitoso de Vargas L.M. Skinner S.E. Landy A. J. Mol.

HP1 Cox is, however, clearly similar to the Cox protein of P2 and the Apl protein of phage 186, which belong to the helix-turn-helix class of DNA-binding proteins (30Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Brennan R.G. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1903-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P2 Cox and 186 Apl have been implicated in directional control of recombination and in regulating the expression of early lytic functions (32Dodd I.B. Kalionis B. Egan J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Yu A.

A similar regulatory function for HP1 Cox has been identified recently. 2D. Esposito, J. Wilson, and J. J. Scocca, manuscript in preparation. To understand how HP1 Cox controls the direction of recombination, the protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity, and its physical properties have been characterized. The location on att site DNA where Cox binds has been identified and the affinity and stoichiometry of binding were determined. Competitive footprinting studies combined with the results of attachment site mutations provided evidence for the mechanism by which directionality is controlled in HP1.DISCUSSIONA fundamental property of complex site-specific recombination systems is the capacity to control the direction of reaction. Directional control prevents the products of one round of recombination from undergoing the reverse reaction under the same conditions. In HP1 recombination this control is mediated by HP1 Cox. As described here, Cox was readily purified to apparent homogeneity from a strain of E. coli overexpressing it. Physical measurements showed that native HP1 Cox has a molecular weight of 36,000 and consists of four protomers. At high concentrations, tetrameric Cox self-associated to form octamers; under the conditions optimal for site-specific recombination, the tetrameric form of HP1 Cox should predominate.HP1 Cox protected a specific region of attachment site DNA from attack by DNase I; this region contains two close direct repeated copies of 5′-GGTMAWWWWA; this consensus occurs nowhere else in the HP1 attachment site. The early promoter cluster contains three directly repeated copies of this consensus, and Cox appears to regulate early gene expression by interacting with this cluster.2 These are the only instances where a closely spaced pair of consensus sequences occur within the HP1 genome. Mutations in this consensus sequence in attachment site DNA prevented specific Cox binding and eliminated the effects of Cox on recombination.Gel retardation experiments showed that each consensus motif was bound by a single Cox tetramer. Binding to the paired sites was not cooperative, and it occurred in two steps. The appearance of the second shifted species as a diffuse doublet with a constant ratio of Cox to DNA suggests that this species may exist in different conformations. One likely candidate for this conformational change in the doubly bound species is the association of the two Cox tetramers into an octameric complex. The CS2 site appears to be bound more tightly than the CS1 site, implying that the residues where the two sites differ must contribute to the strength of the interaction. The presence of Cox at CS2 appeared to enhance the specific interaction of Cox with a mutated CS1 motif, since a second specifically shifted complex was formed on this fragment, albeit at considerably higher protein concentrations. This suggests that the unchanged residues in the mutated CS1 site may be sufficient to align a second Cox molecule properly despite the reduced affinity. The converse, enhancement of binding to a mutated CS2 by binding to the CS1 motif, was not detectable under the conditions tested. Studies on modified binding sites in which the spacing between motifs is varied, as well as measurements of Cox-induced bending of DNA, will be needed to clarify the various modes of Cox binding.The binding sites for HP1 Cox, P2 Cox, and 186 Apl all appear to have a center to center spacing of 10 or 11 base pairs. The CS1 and CS2 sites, written as GGTM-N6-7-GGTM, clearly present common features of each motif on the same face of the DNA helix; the putative sites for P2 Cox and 186 Apl are also arranged with the repeated motifs separated by approximately one helical turn (33Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Yu A. HaggÅrd-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This arrangement has been reported for other proteins with helix-turn-helix motifs, including the λ CII (48Ho Y.-S. Wulff D.L. Rosenberg M. Nature. 1983; 304: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and P22 C1 proteins. The P22 C1 protein is a tetramer of 10-kDa subunits with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.3, similar to that of HP1 Cox (49Ho Y.S. Pfarr D. Strickler J. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14388-14397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of binding of P22 C1 to DNA has not been determined, so it is not clear whether this protein shares the intriguing combination of characteristics exhibited by HP1 Cox, where the tetramer binds singly to an asymmetric DNA site.The DNA segment protected by Cox overlaps the footprint produced by HP1 integrase at one of its binding sites, the type II site 5 or IBS5. This overlap in footprints raised the possibility that Cox affected the interaction of HP1 integrase with this site. Competitive footprinting experiments showed that this was indeed the case. In the presence of increasing concentrations of Cox, the footprint produced by integrase at IBS5 was eliminated, while the footprints at the other integrase binding sites on this arm of the attachment site (IBS4 and IBS6) were unchanged.Since the only effect of Cox in these experiments was to reduce or eliminate integrase binding to IBS5, mutations were introduced at this site and at the Cox binding sites. These modified attachment sites were assayed to establish the mechanism of action of Cox on recombination. Inactivation of the IBS5 site completely abolished integrative recombination, indicating that this site is absolutely required for reaction in this direction. Elimination of this site from the attL substrate did not interfere with excision but rather produced a 20-fold increase in the rate of excision. Occupation of IBS5 by integrase is clearly not required for excision, and it most likely inhibits reaction in this direction. The binding of HP1 integrase to IBS5 must therefore act as the fundamental switch in determining whether integration or excision is possible. At the same time, it is clear that displacing integrase from IBS5 is not the sole function of Cox in controlling directionality, since Cox is absolutely required for excision even when IBS5 is removed from attL. Cox therefore must play a structural role in organizing the excision-competent nucleoprotein complex on attL. Furthermore, Cox must affect interactions between integrase and DNA when bound to its site, and not by directly interacting with free integrase.These conclusions clarify the mode of directional control in HP1 recombination and permit its comparison with the analogous processes operating in other phages. In the case of λ and its close relatives, directionality is mediated by the phage-encoded Xis protein. Xis, in combination with the host Fis protein, binds to specific sites within the attachment site (11Ball C.A. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Better M. Wickner S. Auerbach J. Echols H. Cell. 1983; 32: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Bushman W. Yin S. Thio L.L. Landy A. Cell. 1984; 39: 699-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This binding increases the binding of Int to a site immediately adjacent to the Xis site while reducing its interaction at a more distal site (27Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 513-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In essence, Xis binding reverses the relative affinities of Int for these two sites. These changes make the attP intasome incompetent for integrative recombination while activating the attR nucleoprotein for excision. Directional control in HP1 differs in important respects from this pattern. The chief difference is that HP1 Cox has only a negative effect on integrase binding, displacing the recombinase from a site where it is essential for integration and inhibitory for excision. No additional or novel binding sites for integrase are recruited by binding of Cox. At the same time, Cox does have a positive role in activating the excision reaction; these positive effects of Cox must be the direct consequence of its binding to attL. These results indicate that the excision reactions of HP1 and λ resemble each other less than the corresponding integration reactions do. This is not surprising, since the suite of proteins involved in HP1 integration are clearly related to their λ counterparts, while HP1 Cox is unrelated to Xis.Because the sequence and genetic organization of HP1 make it a member of the P2-186 family of phages, it is of interest to compare our results with what is known about directional control in this group. HP1 Cox is clearly related to P2 Cox and 186 Apl; these proteins possess helix-turn-helix motifs, and are multifunctional, since they regulate early transcription as well as prophage excision (33Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Yu A. HaggÅrd-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7848-7855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies in vitro showed that P2 Cox is similar to HP1 Cox in activating excision and inhibiting integration (35Yu A. HaggÅrd-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7848-7855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the P2 Cox footprint overlaps one binding site for P2 Int, it seems likely that P2 Cox interferes with Int binding at this neighboring site. HP1 Cox and P2 Cox may inhibit integration by the same mechanism, displacing integrase from a key binding site. The second effect of Cox on HP1 recombination, the activation of the excisive reaction, most probably involves a specific conformation of attL induced by Cox binding. This positive effect on recombination may involve mechanisms specific to the individual system. This is because the number and arrangement of binding motifs for the excision protein differ in the three systems, as do the structures of HP1 Cox and Apl. Six potential Cox binding sites arranged as two sets of three closely spaced 9-bp direct repeats are present in the P2 attachment region (50Saha S. Nordstrom K. HaggÅrd-Ljungquist E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3973-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), while Apl appears to bind to five directly repeated motifs in the 186 attachment region (51Shearwin K.E. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11525-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These more numerous sites produce more extensive footprints covering 70 (P2; Ref. 35Yu A. HaggÅrd-Ljungquist E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7848-7855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to 80 bp (186; Ref. 33Dodd I.B. Reed M.R. Egan J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in contrast to the 45-bp footprint produced by HP1 Cox on its two motifs. HP1 Cox and Apl also differ in their native structures. As shown here, HP1 Cox is a tetramer of identical subunits, while Apl is monomeric at all concentrations examined (51Shearwin K.E. Egan J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11525-11531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); the size of P2 Cox has not been reported. The more numerous motifs in the 186 site imply that several of these must be occupied to activate 186 excision. Presumably, each motif is occupied by a single Apl protomer, which contrasts with the presence of a tetramer of HP1 Cox on each of its motifs. It is possible that Apl might self-associate once bound to DNA to produce an arrangement resembling that produced by HP1 Cox. However, the available data indicate that distinctive DNA-protein interactions characterize each of these systems, suggesting that different nucleoprotein conformations produce excisive recombination in each case. It must be borne in mind that these excision-activating proteins also function as regulators of early transcription. Their structures and properties are presumably compromises reflecting the detailed requirements for discharging both functions, which must be integrated with the cellular processes of different bacterial hosts.Understanding the precise mechanism by which HP1 Cox activates excisive recombination will require a complete description of the effects of its binding on the conformation of attL DNA. While simple steric interference is sufficient to account for its effects in inhibiting integrative recombination, this aspect of HP1 Cox function may also be mediated by changes in the conformation of one arm of the attP intasome. Studies to address these questions are in progress. INTRODUCTIONSite-specific recombination systems belonging to the integrase family mediate the joining and separation of a variety of replicons (reviewed in Refs. 1Craig N. Annu. Rev.

These fall into several classes, depending on their function, on the complexity of the DNA substrates, and on the number of proteins involved. The simpler systems, like those of phage P1 (3Sternberg N. Hamilton D. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 487-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1844-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), mediate recombination at specific short sequences through the action of a recombinase belonging to the integrase family (8Argos P. Landy A. Abremski K. Egan J.B. Haggard-Ljunquist E. Hoess R.H. Kahn M.L. Kalionis B. Narayana S.V.L. Pierson III, L.S. Sternberg N. Leong J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These systems regulate copy number, unlink daughter molecules, and resolve dimeric species to ensure accurate partitioning of the relevant element during cell division. More complex site-specific recombination systems are responsible for inserting and excising phage genomes from their cognate host chromosomes. At least one DNA substrate for these latter systems includes multiple protein binding sites (9Weisberg R.A. Landy A. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 211-250Google Scholar), and proteins other than the recombinase or integrase are required. At least some of these accessory proteins are provided by the host (10Kikuchi Y. Nash H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7149-7157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ball C.A. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This complexity most probably reflects the directionality of these systems; the protein requirements for integrative recombination do not promote the excision reaction and in fact inhibit it, while conditions allowing excisive recombination disfavor the integration reaction (12Landy A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar#x2013;14Thompson J.F. Landy A. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 1-22Google Scholar).Work in this laboratory is aimed at understanding the mechanism and regulation of a complex site-specific recombination system derived from the temperate phage HP1 of Hemophilus influenzae Rd, a relative of the P2-186 family of phages (15Esposito D. Fitzmaurice W.P. Benjamin R.C. Goodman S.D. Waldman A.S. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2360-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The integration and excision of HP1 conform in outline to the analogous reactions first analyzed in λ and its host Escherichia coli (9Weisberg R.A. Landy A. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 211-250Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1747-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates for integration are the 500-bp phage attachment site, attP (18Hauser M.A. Scocca J.J. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1990; 18: 5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and an 18-bp host site, attB (19Hauser M.A. Scocca J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6859-6864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the HP1 attB site coincides with the anticodon stem-loop sequence of a tRNA gene, and HP1 is one of a diverse group of integrating elements targeted to tRNA genes (20Pierson L.S. Kahn M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Reiter W.-D. Palm P. Yeats S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The integration reaction produces an integrated prophage flanked by the hybrid attachment sites attL and attR, which are the substrates for the excision reaction. Excisive recombination, like integration, requires HP1 integrase and IHF but also requires an additional HP1-encoded protein, HP1 Cox (22Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).HP1 Cox has two effects on site-specific recombination in vitro. It inhibits the integrative reaction of attP and attB, and it activates the excisive reaction of attR and attL (22Esposito D. Scocca J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In λ these two effects are mediated by the phage-encoded DNA-binding protein, Xis (23Abremski K. Gottesman S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2064990384,"Recombination by the Flp recombinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to be inhibited by heterology of the overlap regions of the two recombining DNA targets (FRT sites). We have used topological analysis to show that Flp can promote two rounds of intramolecular recombination between heterologous FRT sites contained within the same supercoiled plasmid. The products are in parental nonrecombinant configuration. Thus, heterology may appear to “block” recombination by rendering the heteroduplex recombinant products unstable, thus favoring a second round of recombination to homoduplex (but parental) products. Hence, homology in the core region is not a requirement for the recombination reaction by Flp but for the formation of recombinant products.

An FRT site contains three 13-bp Flp binding sites, symmetry elements a, b, and c (Fig. 1). Two symmetry elements (b and c) lie in the same orientation, while symmetry element a lies in reverse orientation separated from symmetry element b by an 8-bp asymmetrical core. The deletion of symmetry element c has no detectable effect on recombination either in vivo or in vitro (6Jayaram M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Flp molecule that acts as the tyrosine donor is bound to a symmetry element across the core from the cleavage site (14Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. EMBO J. 1994; 131: 5346-5354Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two reciprocal strand exchanges generate a four-armed Holliday intermediate, which is then resolved by another pair of reciprocal strand exchanges to yield reciprocally recombinant products (15Meyer-Leon L.

A site-specific recombinase carries out strand exchange in a unique “sense.” This means that for a given reaction, the direction of the strand exchanges (clockwise or counterclockwise) in relation to the helical axis of the paired DNA targets is always the same rather than random. The topological products resulting from recombination of supercoiled substrates produced by the λ integrase or the Tn3 resolvase were found to have an invariant stereostructure: the nodes are positive in sign for the λ integrase and negative for the Tn3 resolvase (19Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Spengler S.J. Stasiak A. Cozzarelli N.R.

A. 1985; 82: 3124-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recombination of a relaxed excision substrate by the Flp recombinase produces only unlinked products rather than a mixture of linked and unlinked circles (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is consistent with recombination in a unique sense within a synapse of unique topology. It could also be due to recombination in either sense within synapses of opposite sign. It has been observed that although the core sequence can be changed (23Andrews B.J. McLeod M. Broach J. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 7: 2482-2489Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Umlauf S.W. Cox M.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), efficient recombination requires that the cores of the two recombining FRT sites be homologous to one another. Therefore, Flp, like other members of the integrase family (25Weisberg R.A. Enquist L.W. Foeller C. Landy A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 319-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), shows impaired recombination between two FRT sites whose core regions are not homologous. Why is homology in the core required for Flp-mediated recombination? One step in the Flp reaction where the homology of the cores might be sensed is during the synapsis stage. However, previous studies of Flp-mediated synaptic complexes ruled out a requirement for homology at this stage (26Amin A.A. Beatty L.G. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another stage where homology might be sensed is in the rejoining of the cleaved strands. Recent studies do point to the importance of homology of the base pair immediately adjacent to the site of cleavage for ligation by Flp (27Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4042-4052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Zhu X.-D. Pan G. Luetke K. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11646-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, core heterologies that are further removed from the sites of cleavage also block recombination but have no effect upon ligation efficiency (Ref. 23Andrews B.J. McLeod M. Broach J. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 7: 2482-2489Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar and this work). A third possibility is that the homology might be required to permit branch migration of the Holliday junction through the core region to the site of the resolution (29Nunes-Duby S.E. Lloyd M. Landy A. Cell. 1987; 50: 779-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Kitts P.A. Nash H.A. Nature. 1987; 329: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been shown that free mobility of the Holliday junction is not required by Flp and other integrases for the resolution of the Holliday intermediate (31Dixon J.E. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Nunes-Duby S.E. Azaro M.A. Landy A. Curr.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19086-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We were therefore led to consider other possible reasons for inhibition of recombination by heterologies between recombining FRT site cores. One such mechanism might be that the heterology could be inhibiting the appearance of recombination products but not recombination. By this hypothesis, recombination of FRT sites bearing heterologous cores would lead to the formation of mismatched recombinant products, but these would be unstable and quickly recombine again to give homoduplex (nonrecombinant) products (35Dixon J.E. Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). If recombination is assayed using linear substrates, the products of two rounds of recombination would be indistinguishable from the starting substrates. However, if the two recombining FRT sites are located on the same supercoiled molecule, topological analysis can be used to distinguish two rounds of recombination from simple reversal of the reaction. Flp recombines supercoiled substrates by a mechanism of “random collision” (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This means that during synapsis and subsequent recombination of the two FRT sites, random numbers of the interdomainal supercoils are trapped as nodes between the recombining sites (Ref. 22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Fig. 2). When the FRT sites are in inverse orientation, the initial products are knots that have odd numbers of nodes (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.). When the FRT sites are in direct orientation, the products are catenated circles bearing even numbers of nodes (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.). These products are in recombinant configuration. If the sense of the strand exchange by Flp is the same in each round (see above), when the products of the first round undergo a second round of recombination, the products are knots with odd numbers of nodes (for excision substrates) or knots with even numbers of nodes (for inversion substrates), respectively, and both are in a nonrecombinant configuration (Ref. 22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Fig. 2). We have used topological analysis to study recombination between two FRT sites that are heterologous at two positions, 4 bp from each of the Flp cleavage sites. As expected, these mismatches inhibited recombination. In confirmation of the above hypothesis, topological analysis showed that such substrates had undergone two rounds of recombination to yield nonrecombinant molecules of the expected topology. We did similar studies using a substrate where the heterology resided immediately adjacent to one of the cleavage sites. We found that the substrate had undergone two rounds of recombination to yield nonrecombinant products. Thus heterology between two FRT sites appears to block formation of recombinant products by promoting two sequential rounds of recombination.

The plasmids were constructed by using the complementary oligonucleotides 1, 2, 5, and 6 as above, and substituting oligonucleotides 7 and 8 for 3 and 4. The plasmids pTF1 and pTF2 are designated as “+/x”. The plasmid pNA5 (4.3 kb) contains a single mutated FRT site (TCTGAAAA) and was constructed by ligating the kinased and annealed pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8; Table I) into the unique HindIII site of plasmid pACYC184. The plasmid pNA6 (4.4 kb, Fig. 3b, ii) contains two homologous mutated FRT sites in inverse orientation and was constructed by introducing a second FRT site into the unique AvaI site of pNA5 by ligating the kinased and annealed pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (numbers 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The plasmid pNA6 was designated as “x/x”. The plasmid pNA7 (8.4 kb, Fig. 3a) contains one wild-type FRT site and one having a single mutation adjacent to the a cleavage site at position +4 (Fig. 1b, ii). It was constructed by ligating the 5′-phosphorylated and annealed pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, and 12) into HindIII-digested pBA104. The plasmid pNA8 (8.4 kb, Fig. 3a) is similar to plasmid pNA7 except that it has a mutation adjacent to the b cleavage site at position −4 (Fig. 1b, iii). It was constructed in a similar fashion using the complementary pairs of oligonucleotides 1, 2, 5, and 6 and substituting oligonucleotides 13 and 14 for 11 and 12, respectively. The plasmid pNA9 (8.4 kb) had mutations at both positions +4 and −4 and was created by substituting oligonucleotides 15 and 16 for 11 and 12 in pNA7 (Fig. 1b, iv). The plasmids pNA7, pNA8, and pNA9 are designated as “+/xa”, “+/xb” and “+/xc”, respectively. All plasmids are shown in Fig. 3. The mutations were confirmed using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Wild-type Flp protein (>90% pure) was a Sephacryl S-300 fraction, purified as described previously (38Pan H. Clary D. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11347-11354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). A standard Flp reaction (0.07 ml) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.6 pmol of substrate plasmid DNA, and 2-10 pmol of Flp. The reaction was preincubated at 30 °C and was initiated by the addition of Flp. The reaction was terminated after 20 min, and the DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and suspended in a small volume of TE buffer as described by Beatty et al. (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 20-min time was chosen because it was early in the reaction before the appearance of the site-specific topoisomerase activity of Flp that occurs late in the reaction (Ref. 22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; see “Discussion”). This activity would render the detection of knotted structures after DNase digestion problematical. Similar results were obtained at 14 min. The DNA was then subjected directly to electrophoresis, digested with DNase I to induce nicking, or digested with PstI to determine the extent of recombination. Nicking with pancreatic DNase I and reaction termination were carried out as described (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) except that the reaction mixture contained 15 ng of pancreatic DNase I and 0.2 mg/ml of ethidium bromide. For intermolecular recombination reactions, the plasmids pNA1, pNA7, pNA8, and pNA9 were digested with either BamHI or BstBI restriction enzyme, respectively, and the 0.41- and 5.1-kb fragments were isolated from agarose gels and used as the substrates. The 0.41-kb fragments were 3′-32P-labeled using reverse transcriptase and [α-32P]dATP. The substrates (0.41 and 5.1 kb) bearing identical FRT sites were incubated with 10 pmol of Flp at 30 °C for 50 min. The samples were run on a 0.8% agarose gel. Horizontal agarose gels (0.8%) in Tris-phosphate buffer were used to separate topoisomers, knots, or catenanes of different linking number (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gels were photographed on a Fotodyne model 3-3000 ultraviolet transilluminator using Polaroid type 55 film. An agarose gel track was excised after staining with ethidium bromide, digested with 900 units of PstI, and run in a second 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in TPE buffer essentially as described previously (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The DNA present in an agarose gel was transferred to Nylon membranes by the procedure described by Sambrook et al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 938-940Google Scholar). Hybridization with nick-translated 32P-labeled pNA1 DNA was performed as described (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Flp substrates that bear heterologous core regions fail to undergo Flp-mediated recombination as assayed both in vivo and in vitro (23Andrews B.J. McLeod M. Broach J. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 7: 2482-2489Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 41McLeod M. Craft S. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42Senecoff J.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7380-7386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to test the hypothesis that failure to observe recombination between FRT sites with heterologous core regions might be due to the use of assays that would not detect two rounds of recombination. Previous assays for recombination between heterologous FRT sites have involved at least one linear DNA partner, where the products of two rounds of recombination would have been indistinguishable from the starting parental substrates. To circumvent this difficulty, we used supercoiled plasmids containing homologous and heterologous FRT sites so that topological analysis could be used to detect two rounds of recombination if they were occurring. We first wished to confirm that heterology between two FRT sites inhibited the appearance of recombinant products generated via intramolecular recombination. We therefore subjected supercoiled plasmids bearing heterologous FRT sites that were in either direct or inverse orientation to treatment with Flp. Plasmids pNA1 and pNA2 carry two intact (wild-type) FRT sites in direct and inverse orientation, respectively (Fig. 3). Plasmids pTF1 and pTF2 are identical to pNA1 and pNA2 except that one of the two FRT sites in each plasmid has a mutated core region. Plasmid pNA1 (+/+) gave readily detectable bands indicative of efficient recombination after digestion with PstI (Fig. 4a, lane 5). In contrast, no such recombinant bands were evident for plasmid pTF1 (+/x; Fig. 4a, lane 6). Similar results were obtained with the inversion plasmids pNA2 (+/+) and pTF2 (+/x; Fig. 4a, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, heterology between recombining FRT sites appears to inhibit Flp-mediated recombination on supercoiled substrates just as it does on linear substrates. It has been shown that efficient recombination can occur between mutated FRT sites provided that they bear homologous cores. To show that the mutations introduced into the core region did not somehow render the mutated FRT site incapable of recombination, we constructed a plasmid, pNA6, containing the two mutated FRT sites in inverse orientation (Fig. 3). As can be seen in Fig. 4b, lane 3, efficient recombination was readily detected when both FRT sites contained identical mutations. Flp-mediated intramolecular recombination followed by StyI digestion resulted in recombination products of 2.4 and 1.9 kb (R), which are different from the parental nonrecombinant products (NR; 3.2 and 1.1 kb). Topological analysis of the products of intramolecular Flp-mediated recombination can reveal whether one or two rounds of recombination have occurred. When Flp catalyzes recombination between two FRT sites on a supercoiled molecule, interdomainal supercoils are trapped between the two sites to yield an array of products containing a spectrum of nodes (Fig. 2). After two rounds of recombination, an excision substrate should yield odd-noded knots instead of the even-noded catenanes that form with two homologous FRT sites. An inversion substrate would give even-noded knots instead of odd-noded knots. Plasmids pNA1 (+/+), pTF1 (+/x), pNA2 (+/+), and pTF2 (+/x) were incubated with Flp protein, and the products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. There was a noticeable decrease in the superhelical band and the appearance of a smear of material running faster than the supercoiled plasmid (data not shown). From previous studies we know that these smears consist of multiply linked supercoiled catenanes or knots of varying complexity, the individual species of which cannot be resolved by gel electrophoresis until they are nicked with DNase I. After DNase digestion, the interdomainal supercoils are trapped topologically as nodes, and the various species of nicked catenanes or knots can be resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Knots with greater numbers of topologically constrained nodes migrate more quickly during electrophoresis because of the increasingly compact structure. Accordingly, the products from the Flp reactions were nicked with DNase I and run on a high resolution agarose gel. The excision substrate (pNA1; +/+) gave a ladder of bands (Fig. 5, lane 2) that corresponded approximately to every band of a topoisomerase I-relaxed standard (also pNA1). Therefore, the number of nodes of each form varied by one. The bands (catenanes) occupying the even positions (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) were more intense than the bands in the odd-noded positions because the samples were taken relatively early in the reaction (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The former correspond to the recombinant products. However, the bands occupying the odd positions (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.) arise from a second round of recombination of catenanes and correspond to nonrecombinant knots. These results are the same as found previously (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When the inversion substrate pNA2 (+/+) was treated with Flp, nicked, and run on a high resolution agarose gel (Fig. 5, lane 5), a series of bands was obtained with a spacing that corresponded predominantly to the odd-numbered positions of the topoisomerase I-relaxed standard. These correspond to the recombinant products (knots) that arise from the first round of recombination. The bands occupying the even positions were very faint and result from two rounds of recombination. They therefore correspond to nonrecombinant knotted products. These results are in accordance with our previous findings (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these knot and catenane ladders provide an accurate standard with which to compare the topological products obtained with the heterologous substrates, pTF1 and pTF2. The excision substrate with one mutated FRT site (pTF1) gave a ladder of bands (Fig. 5, lane 3) that comigrated with bands occupying the odd positions (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.) of the Flp knot ladder standard (lane 5). Comparison with the products from plasmid pNA1 (lane 2) showed that these bands correspond to the odd-numbered positions (nonrecombinant) that arose as a result of a second round of recombination of catenanes. In contrast, the inversion substrate with one mutated FRT site and one wild-type FRT site (pTF2) gave a ladder of bands (Fig. 5, lane 4) corresponding to bands occupying the even positions (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) of the Flp-induced ladder (lane 2). These bands correspond to nonrecombinant knots that arose as a result of a second round of recombination of the Flp-induced knots. Inspection of predominant bands in lanes 3 and 4 shows that they are clearly interleaved with one another as well as with the predominant bands in the adjacent marker control ladders (lanes 2 and 5). To confirm the results of Fig. 4 indicating that the plasmids pTF1 and pTF2 did not yield even minute amounts of recombinant structures, we cut out the individual tracks from the gel shown in Fig. 5, digested the DNA in situ with PstI, and ran the digestion products in a second agarose gel. The results (not shown) confirmed that the odd-noded knots derived from the +/x excision substrate (pTF1) and the even-noded knots obtained from the +/x inversion substrate (pTF2) were in a parental, nonrecombinant configuration. The catenanes and knots from the two wild-type substrates gave the expected recombinant configuration. This result is consistent with the interpretation of the findings in Fig. 5, namely that the bands corresponding to knotted products arose from two rounds of recombination. It was important to be sure that the results shown in Fig. 5 were not the result of some aberrant topology peculiar to the mutated FRT site used. We therefore constructed a plasmid containing the two identical mutated FRT sites in inverse orientation. We show in Fig. 6 that Flp-mediated recombination under identical conditions to those in Fig. 5 led to an apparent decrease in the superhelical band (Fig. 6, lane 2) and the appearance of a smear running faster than the supercoiled plasmid. The Flp-treated DNA was nicked and run on a high resolution agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 6, lane 4, the nicking resulted in the appearance of a ladder of bands corresponding approximately to every other band of a topoisomerase I-relaxed standard (also pNA7, lane 3). These correspond to recombinant products. This result is totally in accordance with what we observed with pNA2, an inversion substrate with two wild-type FRT sites, and with previous studies (22Beatty L.G. Babineau-Clary D. Hogrefe C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 529-544Crossr"

This residue and Lys-259 were essential parts of the epitope recognized by these clones. Most of the clones expressed BV1S1A1 encoded β chains along with specific complementary determining region (CDR) 3β regions but diverse α chain sequences. Surprisingly, all T cell receptors were preferentially photoaffinity labeled on the α chain. For a representative T cell receptor, the photoaffinity labeled site was located in the Vα C-strand. Computer modeling suggested the presence of a hydrophobic pocket, which is formed by parts of the Vα/Jα C-, F-, and G-strands and adjacent CDR3α residues and structured to be able to avidly bind the photoreactive ligand side chain. We previously found that a T cell receptor specific for a PbCS peptide derivative containing this photoreactive side chain in position 259 similarly used a hydrophobic pocket located between the junctional CDR3 loops. We propose that this nonpolar domain in these locations allow T cell receptors to avidly and specifically bind epitopes containing non-peptidic side chains.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 65-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographical studies showed that some peptide side chains intrude into allele specific pockets of the MHC molecule, whereas others are surface exposed and may interact with TCR (2Fremont D.H.

Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Conversely, crystallographical studies on a BV8S2A1 encoded TCR β chain and an AV4S2 TCR α chain fragment confirmed that TCR are folded in an Ig-like manner but also indicated significant structural differences, such as different hinge structures and interstrand hydrogen bond formation (4Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1984-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5Fields B.A. Ober B. Malchiodi E.L. Lebedeva M.I. Braden B.C. Ysern X. Kim J.-K.

Based on theoretical considerations, it has been proposed that V-encoded complementary regions CDR1 and CDR2 primarily interact with the MHC molecule, such that the junctional CDR3 are located over the MHC peptide binding groove (6Davis M.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Support for this concept mainly derives from experiments indicating that CDR3 loops interact with residues of MHC bound peptides (7Danska J.S. Livingstone A.M. Paragas V. Ishihara T. Fathman C.G. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Engel I. Hedrick S.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 473-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). One study using immunization of single chain TCR transgenic mice with peptide variants suggested that CDR3α interacted with an N-terminal residue of an MHC class II bound peptide and CDR3β with a C-terminal one (9Jorgensen J.L. Esser U. de-St-Groth B.F. Reay P.A. Davis M.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A more recent study, using a similar strategy, showed that an N-terminal peptide residue interacted with CDR1α or CDR2α, while a C-terminal one interacted with CDR3β, implicating a diagonal orientation, e.g. about 30 °C rotated (10Sant'Angelo D.B.

In contrast, analysis of a Kb-restricted OVA-specific TCR indicated that the most C-terminal residue of this epitope interacted with CDR3α (11Kelly J.M. Sterry S.J. Cose S. Turner S.J. Fecondo J.

Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar), there are observations that are difficult to explain this way. For example, MHC class II-restricted tetanus toxin tt830-844 reactive T cells exhibited preferential BV2S1 usage but lacked junctional sequence conservation on both chains (12Boitel B. Ermonval M. Panina-Bordignon P. Mariuzza R.A. Lanzavecchia A. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an Ld-restricted arsonate-reactive CTL clone using the same AV3S1 sequence as an I-Ad-restricted arsonate-reactive one, but an unrelated CDR3α junction, also recognized this epitope, suggesting that in this system, CDR3 sequences may not be important (13Nalefski E.A. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3806-3816PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nalefski E.A. Kasibhatla S. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that a TCR specific for the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite PbCS peptide 252-260 (SYIPSAEKI) conjugated with 4-azidobenzoic acid (ABA) at Lys-259 bound the photoreactive ligand side chain with CDR3α and Vβ C′-strand/CDR2β residues (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this previous study, we modified the H-2Kd (Kd)-restricted PbCS 252-260 by replacing Ser-252 with photoreactive iodo-4-azidosalicylic acid (IASA) and by conjugating the TCR contact residue PbCS Lys-259 with ABA, to make IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I. CD8+ CTL clones were derived from mice immunized with this conjugate. These recognized IASA-YIPSAEK(ABA)I as well as YIPSAEK(ABA)I in a Kd-restricted manner, but not IASA-YIPSAEKI or the parental PbCS peptide. Selective photoactivation of the IASA group allowed covalent attachment of the conjugate to Kd molecules. Incubation of these complexes with cloned CTL and photoactivation of the ABA group resulted in TCR photoaffinity labeling (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike PbCS-specific CTL, these clones preferentially expressed BV1S1A1 encoded TCR β chains that were paired with JαTA28 encoded α chains (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequences encoded by these TCR gene elements formed a hydrophobic pocket, which was structured and located such that it could efficiently accommodate the photoreactive ligand side chain. In the present study, we replaced PbCS Pro-255 with K(ABA) and produced likewise peptide derivative-specific CTL clones. This residue was chosen because it is surface exposed and critical for T cell recognition (16Romero P. Eberl G. Casanova J.-L. Cordey A.-S. Widmann C. Luescher I.F. Corradin G. Maryanski J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1871-1878PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that these CTL clones were remarkably different from the ones described previously in terms of antigen recognition, TCR sequences, and binding of the photoreactive ligand side chain. For a representative TCR, we show a novel binding principle by which TCR can efficiently and specifically bind a chemically modified epitope. Reagents for chemical synthesis were obtained from Bachem Finechemicals (Bubendorf, Switzerland), Pierce, and Sigma. All synthetic and analytical procedures were performed essentially as described (17Luescher I.F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Biol.

In brief, peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem Instruments 431 peptide synthesizer (ABI, Foster City, CA) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) for transient protection. The deprotected peptides and peptide derivatives were purified by HPLC on a C-18 column (1 × 25 cm, Macherey Nagel, Oensingen, CH) using a Waters 600E HPLC system equipped with an in-line 1000 S diode array UV photo-spectrometer (Applied Biosystem Instruments). The column was eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile on 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, rising within 1 h from 0 to 75%. All compounds displayed the expected UV spectra (17Luescher I.F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5574-5582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Romero P. Casanova J.-L. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Luescher I.F. J. Exp.

ANBA-YIKSAEKI displayed UV absorption maxima at 214 and 280 nm, and the UV absorption at 350 nm was approximately 7% of the one at 280 nm. The mass of all purified compounds were verified by mass spectrometry on an LDI 7000 mass spectrometer (Linear Scientific, Reno, CA). Radiosynthesis of 125IASA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI and Dap(125ISA)-YIK(ABA)SAEKI was performed by radioiodination of ASA-Y(PO3H2)IK(ABA)SAEKI and Dap(ISA)-Y(PO3H2)IK(ABA)SAEKI, respectively, followed by enzymatic dephosphorylation. The HPLC-purified products were lyophilized and immediately used for photoaffinity labeling experiments. Soluble monomeric Kd-peptide derivative complexes were prepared by incubating purified Kd with 125IASA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI followed by UV irradiation at ≥350 nm and FPLC gel filtration as described by Luescher et al.(15, 17). For TCR photoaffinity labeling, 107 cpm of Kd-“125IASA”-YIK(ABA)SAEKI were incubated with 107 CTL, resuspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 20 mM HEPES, on ice for 3 h followed by UV irradiation at 312 ± 40 nm. For two-dimensional gel analysis and peptide mapping, peptide derivative-Kd cross-linking was prevented by using the monofunctional PbCS derivative Dap(ISA)-YIK(ABA)SAEKI as described previously (15Luescher I.F.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 1 mCi of Dap(125ISA)-YIK(ABA)SAEKI was incubated with 50 μg of Kd for 2 h at ambient temperature prior to addition of 4 × 107 cloned CTL in 2 ml of medium (see above) containing β-2 microglobulin (2.5 μg/ml). After 2-3 h of additional incubation at 0-4 °C, the incubations were UV irradiated at 312 ± 40 nm. The photoaffinity labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice in PBS (1 × 107 cells/ml) supplemented with 0.7% Nonidet P-40, HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and iodoacetamide as described (17Luescher I.F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5574-5582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation (3 min at 15,000 × g), the detergent-soluble fractions were membrane filtered and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-TCR Cβ mAb H57-597 or the anti-Kdα3 mAb SF1-1.1.1 as described (17Luescher I.F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5574-5582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gel analysis and peptide mapping, TCR were immunoprecipitated with H57-597 mAb on protein A-Sepharose as described (17Luescher I.F. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5574-5582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Romero P. Casanova J.-L. Cerottini J.-C. Maryanski J.L. Luescher I.F. J. Exp.

The washed and lyophilized Sepharose was resuspended in sample buffer for IEF, and after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were subjected to disc IEF followed by SDS-PAGE as described (21Samelson L.E. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2529-2535PubMed Google Scholar). All antibodies were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The photoaffinity labeled and immunoprecipitated W13 TCR was reduced and denatured in 200 μl of 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 8 M urea, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Nonidet P-40, at 37 °C for 1 h. To the supernatant, 400 μl of 500 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 100 mM iodoacetic acid were added. After incubation for 1 h at 20-24 °C, the samples were dialyzed at 4 °C in 25-kDa membrane tubings (Spectrapore) against 3 × 1 liter of distilled water. Following lyophilization, aliquots were reconstituted in 500 μl of either 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (for tryptic digests), or 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 (for V-8 digests), containing 1 M guanidine hydrochloride, both containing 10% acetonitrile, and subjected to tryptic or protease V-8 peptide mapping as described (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that a C-18 column was used for HPLC (4 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size, Vydac, Hisperia, CA). In brief, 10 μg aliquots of trypsin or protease V-8 (Boehringer Mannheim) were added in 12-h intervals, and after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the digests were subjected to HPLC. Radioactivity was monitored by γ counting of 1 ml fractions and chromatography by measuring the A214 nm of standards including NE-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)Lys (elution time 29.1 min), approximately YIPSAEKI (23.6 min), MAVDPIGHLY (26.7 min), ASNENMDAM (30.1 min), and oxidized insulin β chain (37.7 min) (Sigma). The maximal variation tolerated was ±1 min. For secondary peptide mapping, labeled digest fragments were reconstituted in 300 μl of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 μg of bovine γ-globulin and 10% acetonitrile. Endoprotease Pro-C (gift from Dr. J. Gagnon, Biologie Structurale, C.E.A. and C.N.R.S., URA 1333, Grenoble, France) was added in 10-μg aliquots in 12-h intervals, and after 36-48 h, the samples were subjected to HPLC. SDS-PAGE analysis of labeled digest fragments was performed as described (22Schagger A. Von Jagov G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Cloned CTLs were obtained as described previously (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Romero P. Eberl G. Casanova J.-L. Cordey A.-S. Widmann C. Luescher I.F. Corradin G. Maryanski J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1871-1878PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, (BALB/c × C57BL/6) F1 mice were immunized with ConA spleen blasts expressing covalent Kd-“ANBA”-YIK(ABA)SAEKI complexes. Cultures of peritoneal exudate lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro over two 7-day intervals. Viable cells were cloned 7 days after the second in vitro stimulation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD8+ cells into 96-well plates. The clones were stimulated weekly with 2 × 104γ-irradiated P815 pulsed before hand with 1 μM of ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI and 3 × 105γ-irradiated BALB/c splenocytes. All rapidly expanding cultures were tested as described below. The U, V, and W clones were derived from three different mice. The cytolytic activity of the CTL clones under study was assessed in a standard 51Cr release assay as described previously (16Romero P. Eberl G. Casanova J.-L. Cordey A.-S. Widmann C. Luescher I.F. Corradin G. Maryanski J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1871-1878PubMed Google Scholar, 23Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, 51Cr-labeled P815 cells or Kd transfected L cells (L-Kd) (2 × 103 cells/well) were incubated with a constant number of CTLs (6 × 103 cells/well) and serial dilutions of peptide derivative or peptide derivative variants in V-bottom microplates. The L-Kd and L-Kd mutants have been described previously (24Jaulin C. Casanova J.-L. Romero P. Luescher I. Cordey A.-S. Maryanski J.L. Kourilsky P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3990-3994PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the released 51Cr was measured, and the specific lysis was calculated in percent as 100 × (experimental-spontaneous release)/(total-spontaneous release). The relative antigenic activities were calculated by dividing the concentration of ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI required for half-maximal lysis by that required for the peptide derivative variants. The Kd competitor activity, expressing the ability of a peptide derivative to bind to Kd, was assessed in a recognition-based competition assay as described (23Romero P. Corradin G. Luescher I.F. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, 51Cr-labeled P815 cells were incubated with three-fold dilutions of the test peptide derivatives prior to addition of the antigenic HLA-Cw3 peptide 170-179 (RYLKNGKETL) and Cw3-specific cloned CW3/1.1 CTL. After 4 h of incubation, the 51Cr release was measured. The Kd competitor activity of each compound was calculated relative to the one of ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI, which was defined as 1. For the sake of comparison, the relative antigenic activities of the different peptide variants were normalized by dividing the relative antigenic activity by the corresponding relative Kd competitor activities. Total RNA extraction was performed using the isothiocyanate acid-phenol method. cDNA synthesis was carried out on total RNA with AMV reverse transcripts following the supplier instructions (Boehringer Mannheim, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Screening of junctional regions of α and β chains was performed by PCR using primers as described in Ref. 25Casanova J.-L. Romero P. Widmann C. Kourilsky P. Maryanski J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1371-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar. Purified PCR products were sequenced with Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemicals, Cleaveland, OH) and α [35S]dATP following the supplier instructions. For sequencing of the Vα of W13 and U4, the primers W135′ (GACCGAATTCAGATGACACTAAAGATGGAC) and W133′ (CAACGTGGATCCACAGGGAACGTCTGAACTGG) were used. Models of the W13 TCR and Kd-ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI complex were built using the ICM software (26Abagyan R. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). For the β chain, we used as template the crystal coordinates of a BV8S2A1 encoded β chain (4Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1984-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A crude model of the W13 Vβ chain was obtained using the ProMod package (27Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and was subjected to a standard energy minimization with X-PLOR and followed by a regularization of the geometry with ICM (the RMSD between the initial and the regularized structures was 0.49 Å for non-hydrogen atoms). Similarly, the model of the W13 TCR Vα chain was obtained by homology modeling using the x-ray structure of AV4S2 (5Fields B.A. Ober B. Malchiodi E.L. Lebedeva M.I. Braden B.C. Ysern X. Kim J.-K. Shao X. Ward E.S. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting Vα model (RMSD between the template and the modeled structure was 1.0 Å for 106 Cα atoms) was associated with the Vβ model to form a Vα-Vβ complex, starting with the geometry of an Ig VH/VL domain. After minimization of the complex, possible conformations of the CDR3 loops were searched using a local deformation Monte-Carlo procedure. The Kd-ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI complex was modeled on the basis of the x-ray structure of H-2Kb as described before (15Luescher I.F. Anjuère F. Peitsch M.C. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.-C. Romero P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 51-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As the PbCS peptide derivative contains non-canonical amino acids, namely K(ABA) and ANBA, models for these residues were generated using the molecular editor of the HyperChem package. Atom charges were calculated using the CNDO/2 method. The files containing the resulting coordinates and charges were imported and processed by ICM to produce ICM library entries used in subsequent modeling. The structure of the trimolecular complex, consisting of W13 Vα-Vβ docked to the Kd-peptide complex, was obtained by several cycles of the following procedures and guided by the experimental data derived from the mapping of the photoaffinity labeled site and the effects of mutations in Kd: 1) local deformation Monte-Carlo search of an optimal conformation for Vα-Vβ CDR loops within the field of the Kd-peptide surface; 2) Monte-Carlo search of the optimal position of the side chains of all residues of the interface between TCR and ligand; 3) a constrained Brownian-like “walk” of the ligand around the TCR; and 4) exhaustive minimization of the whole structure. The resulting structure was checked visually as well as by calculation of the local electrostatic interactions in the K(ABA) binding pocket. To produce a new family of “photoprobe”-specific CTL clones, we prepared a photoreactive derivative of the PbCS peptide 252-260 by replacing Pro-255 with K(ABA). To cross-link the peptide derivative to Kd, Ser-252 was replaced with IASA to make IASA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI. As assessed in a recognition-based competition assay, this derivative bound to Kd nearly 100-fold less efficiently than the parental PbCS peptide, but replacement of IASA with ANBA, Nβ-IASA-2,3-L-diaminopropionic acid (Dap(IASA)), or Nβ-(iodo-salicyloyl)-2,3-L-diaminopropionic acid (Dap(ISA)) restored efficient Kd binding (2-3-fold less than the PbCS peptide). However, since ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI was not available in radioactive form and Dap(IASA)-YIK(ABA)SAEKI very inefficiently photoaffinity labeled Kd, 125IASA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI was used for radioactive photoaffinity labeling experiments. From 14 independent CTL clones derived from mice immunized with ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI, seven that exhibited efficient TCR photoaffinity labeling were selected for further studies. As shown for a representative experiment in Table I, the concentration of ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI required for half-maximal lysis of P815 target cells was in the range of 0.5 (V8 clone) to 150 pM (U3 clone), which is comparable with other Kd-restricted CTL clones (15Luescher I.F.

Open table in a new tab All clones efficiently recognized the derivative lacking the N-terminal photoreactive group (YIK(ABA)SAEKI), but none detectably recognized the derivative lacking ABA (YIKSAEKI) except for a very inefficient recognition by the V17 clone (Table I). Interestingly, all clones recognized, though some inefficiently, the variant containing acetyl in place of ABA (YIK(Ac)SAEKI), suggesting that the Nγ amide bond of K(ABA) may participate in TCR-ligand binding. Moreover, the derivatives containing alanine or K(Ac) in place of Lys-259 (YIK(ABA) SAEAI or YIK(ABA)SAEK(Ac)I) were not detectably recognized by all clones (Table I and data not shown). Shortening of K(ABA) by one methylene group (YIOrn(ABA)SAEKI) abolished recognition by all except the U3 and V19 clones, which inefficiently recognized this derivative. Similarly, shortening of Lys-259 (YIK(ABA)SAEOrnI) abolished the recognition by all but the U3 and V13 clones, which recognized this variant 3- and 100-fold, respectively, less efficiently (Table I). These results demonstrate that K(ABA) and Lys-259, but not the N-terminal photoreactive group, were essential parts of the epitope recognized by these clones and that generally the full spacer length of these side chains was required for efficient antigen recognition. To obtain information on TCR-Kd contacts, we assessed the ability of the CTL clones to recognize ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI on L cells expressing mutant Kd molecules. The mutations were single alanine substitutions of surface exposed residues in the middle parts of the α1 and α2 helices (e.g. Glu-62, Gln-65, Ser-69, Gln-72, Gln-149, Glu-154, Tyr-155, and Glu-163). As shown for a representative experiment in Fig. 1, the recognition of ANBA-YIK(ABA)SAEKI by all clones, except the V17 clone, was impaired or abolished by at least one of the Kdα1 mutations E62A, S69A, or Q72A. In contrast, of the Kdα2 mutations, only Y155A dramatically affected the recognition by all clones. This effect, however, is explained in part by reduced peptide derivative binding by this Kd mutant (24Jaulin C. Casanova J.-L. Romero P. Luescher I. Cordey A.-S. Maryanski J.L. Kourilsky P. J.

Cloning of glutamate receptor subunit cDNAs has revealed that the molecular diversity of the gene families encoding the various receptor subunits is responsible for the pharmacological and functional heterogeneity of glutamate receptors in the brain (3Hollman M.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) is encoded by the gene grik5 (lutamate eceptor onotropic ainate), which has been mapped to chromosomes 1, 7, and 19 in rat, mouse, and human, respectively (6Szpirer C. Molne M. Antonacci R. Jenkins N.A. Finelli P. Szpirer J. Riviere M. Rocchi M. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Gallo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1991; 351: 741-744Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar), displaying 68% identity in amino acid sequence. Like KA1, KA2 does not form functional homomeric ion channels but interacts with GluR5 and GluR6 to form heteromeric, agonist-sensitive channels (5Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The grik5 gene is widely expressed in the adult brain and is especially abundant in the cerebral cortex, pyriform cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampal complex, medial habenula, and granule cell layer of the cerebellum (5Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 8Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3582-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the function and physiological role of the KA2 subunit, or how the grik5 gene is regulated during brain development. Analysis of the 5′-untranslated region revealed that grik5 is a TATA-less gene, whose transcription can initiate at several sites within a 500-bp region flanking the receptor subunit coding sequence (9Molne M. Huang F. Scherer S. Gallo V. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 52Google Scholar). The DNA elements required for tissue-specific expression of grik5 in vitro and in vivo reside within 2 kb of the 5′-flanking region (9Molne M. Huang F. Scherer S. Gallo V. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 52Google Scholar). We have now isolated the entire grik5 gene, determined its exon-intron organization, and identified a negative regulatory region within the first intron, which inhibits reporter gene expression driven by the 5′-flanking region of grik5. We also established that, within this negative regulatory region, nuclear proteins bind to a 24-nucleotide sequence. The negative regulatory element within the first intron exerts its inhibitory effect in a distance- and orientation-independent manner and therefore displays features of a silencer. A Harlan Sprague Dawley rat genomic library in λDASH (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened for kainate receptor subunit grik5 gene sequences, using restriction fragments of the rat KA2 cDNA as probes (5Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kb SmaI/ClaI restriction fragment (cDNA positions +1 to +647) was used to identify the 5′-region. Two restriction fragments, 1.2-kb ClaI/SmaI and 0.9-kb SmaI (cDNA positions +648 to +1837 and +1838 to +2736, respectively), derived from middle portions of KA2 cDNA, were used to isolate recombinant phage carrying exons for the middle region and the transmembrane regions. Recombinant phage covering the 3′-end part of the grik5 gene were isolated using a 1.0-kb EcoRI fragment (cDNA position +2677 to +3662) derived from the 3′-end coding and noncoding sequences of KA2 cDNA. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Overlap of clones was determined by Southern blot analysis of λ DNA. Single or combinatorial BamHI, EcoRI, and SmaI digests were blotted onto Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and hybridized with the probes used for the phage isolation. Restriction fragments of genomic clones were subcloned in pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) and sequenced using a Sequenase II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Some of the sequencing was performed by Lark Sequencing Technologies, Inc. (Houston, TX). Cells of the rat glial cell line CG-4 were cultured as described previously (10Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 11Patneau D.K. Wright P.W. Winters C. Mayer M.L. Gallo V. Neuron. 1994; 12: 357-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and plated on poly-D-ornithine-coated plates (0.1 mg/ml). HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Life Technologies, Inc.). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Differentiated PC12 cells were grown on collagen-coated plates and treated with nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) every other day for 5 days. All expression plasmid DNAs used for transfections were purified with the Qiagen DNA purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). A LacZ gene driven by the RNA polymerase II gene promoter (pPolIIplacF.βgal) was simultaneously transfected with all the grik5-CAT constructs, to correct for possible variations in transfection efficiency. CAT constructs (10 μg) and pPolIIplacF.βgal (2 μg) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were transfected for 8 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then returned to serum-containing medium except for PC12 cells, which were transfected for 20 h in Opti-MEM I medium (Life Technologies). All cells were harvested 38 h after transfection and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activities as described (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Levels of CAT activity were determined on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). All transfection experiments were repeated 3-6 times, and averages (± S.E.) of the results are presented. All restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The 2-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the grik5 gene was first cloned into pBluescriptSK− by inserting the 2-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment from the 5′-end of λ5 into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pBluescriptSK−. The 2-kb fragment was then excised by HindIII and XbaI digestion and cloned into the HindIII/XbaI site of pCAT-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The 4.3-kb BamHI DNA fragment of grik5 5′-flanking sequence was isolated from the genomic λA11 clone (Fig. 1A) and subcloned into pBluescript SK−. A clone with a 3′→ 5′ orientation was selected, and the DNA was digested with HindIII/XbaI. The resulting 4.3-kb fragment (HindIII site at the 5′-end and XbaI site at 3′-end) was cloned into the pCAT-basic vector to form the 4.3-CAT construct. This construct contains 2 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and the 3.4-kb first intron of grik5. It was prepared from two genomic fragments joined by multiple subcloning steps. First, a 2.3-kb XbaI/HindIII fragment from λA11 was subcloned into LITMUS-28 vector (New England Biolabs) to form LITMUS-2.3 kb. A 3.1-kb HindIII/MvnI λA11 fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK− at HindIII/SmaI sites and excised by HindIII/SpeI digestion. This 3.1-kb HindIII/SpeI fragment with a SpeI site at its 3′ end was then ligated with LITMUS-2.3 kb plasmid DNA at HindIII/SpeI sites to obtain a 5.4-kb fragment linked by HindIII resulting in the LITMUS-5.4 kb construct. Finally, the 5.4-kb grik5 fragment was isolated by SalI and SpeI digestion and cloned into SalI/XbaI sites of the pCAT-basic vector to generate the 5.4-CAT construct. This construct containing 4.3 kb of grik5 5′-flanking sequences and the 3.4-kb first intron was prepared similarly to the 5.4-CAT construct. A 4.6-kb XbaI/HindIII genomic DNA fragment was subcloned into the LITMUS-28 vector and then digested by HindIII/SpeI and ligated with a 3.1-kb HindIII/SpeI fragment to form LITMUS-7.7 kb construct. This 7.7-kb fragment was isolated by SalI/SpeI digestion and cloned into pCAT-basic vector at SalI/XbaI sites to generate the 7.7-CAT construct. A 494-bp HindIII DNA fragment containing the chicken β-actin promoter region was cloned into the HindIII site of the pCAT-basic vector to form the β-actin-CAT construct. To clone intron 1 downstream of the β-actin promoter in the CAT vector, the 3.4-kb SpeI DNA fragment of intron 1 was cloned into the XbaI site of β-actin CAT to generate the β-actin-I-CAT. grik5 intron 1 was cloned downstream of the SV40-CAT transcriptional unit (p-CAT control vector; Promega), containing SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences. The 3.4-kb SpeI DNA fragment of grik5 intron 1 was cloned in the XbaI site of p-CAT control, 3′ of the SV40 enhancer. A clone with a 5′→ 3′ orientation of the intron was selected to generate the pSV-CAT-intron construct. The 5.4-CAT plasmid was used to make all intron deletion constructs (Fig. 4). Plasmids ΔSacI-CAT and 2-I-R-SacI-CAT were made by digesting 5.4-CAT with SacI, religating, and selecting clones with the 2.0-kb SacI fragment deleted (ΔSacI-CAT) or reversed (2-I-R-SacI-CAT). BglII/SacI deletions were obtained by complete digestion of 5.4-CAT DNA with BglII and partial digestion with SacI and then blunt-ended with Klenow and ligated. The ΔBglII/SacI-CAT has a 1.3-kb deletion, whereas ΔSacI/BglII-CAT has a 0.7-kb deletion. To construct plasmid ΔHindIII/SacI, the plasmid ΔSacI-CAT DNA was digested with HindIII and SacI. Two of the three resulting DNA fragments (SacI/HindIII, 4.3 kb; HindIII, 2.3 kb) were isolated, blunt-ended with Klenow, and ligated. The clone with the correct orientation was selected. This plasmid was designed to delete intron 1 except for the splicing sites. The HindIII/AccI deletion was made by digestion of ΔAccI-CAT with AccI and EcoR V. The AccI/EcoRV fragment was isolated, blunt-ended, and ligated with the blunt-ended HindIII fragment. The other deletion constructs were generated by digestion with selected restriction enzymes, blunt-ending with Klenow, and religating the ends. The resulting plasmids have corresponding restriction enzyme fragment deletions (Fig. 4). All deletion junctions were analyzed by sequencing to confirm that correct deletions were obtained. A promoterless LacZ vector, galscript-ES4, containing the nuclear localization signal, was used to construct LacZ expression plasmids (Fig. 3C). 2-LacZ and 4.3-LacZ constructs were prepared by separately cloning the 2-kb NotI/BamHI and 4.3-kb BamHI fragments, both excised from the 5′-flanking region of grik5 λA11, into a galscript-ES4 vector. 5.4-LacZ and 7.7-LacZ constructs were obtained as follows: LITMUS-5.4 kb and LITMUS-7.7 kb plasmids were digested with NotI and SpeI, and the 5.4- and 7.7-kb DNA fragments were isolated. The galscript-ES4 vector DNA was digested with NotI/XbaI and ligated with 5.4- or 7.7-kb NotI/SpeI DNA fragments to form 5.4-LacZ or 7.7-LacZ constructs, respectively. Plasmids pCAT-basic, 2-CAT, 4.3-CAT, 5.4-CAT, and 7.7-CAT were used to transfect CG-4 cells as described above. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells by RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). For each RT reaction, 2 μg of total RNA isolated as outlined above, was combined with 100 pmol of random hexamers (Life Technologies) and denatured at 80 °C for 10 min. The reactions were then assembled by adding 1 × PCR buffer, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 333 μM each dNTP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml acetylated BSA, 1 unit/ml RNasin, and 200 units of Superscript II RT in a volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 50 min. After heat inactivation, 30 units of RNase H was added, and incubation continued at 37 °C for 20 min. For PCR reactions, 10 μl of each RT reaction was added to a tube containing 1 × PCR buffer, 50 pmol of sense primer (5′-TTGCTTTTCCACCTGTCC-3′, located at the 3′-end of the 5′ noncoding region of grik5), 50 pmol of either one of the two antisense primers (located in the SV40 small T antigen coding region; Fig. 3) AS1 (5′-CAGCTTTTTCCTTTGTGGTG-3′) or AS2 (5′-ATGTTTCAGGTTCAGGGGG-3′), 200 μM each dNTP, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq in a volume of 100 μl. The PCR cycling profile was as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with a 5-s time extension added per cycle and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The 1.3-kb BglII/SacI DNA fragment from grik5 intron 1 was subcloned into LITMUS-28 vector. The resulting plasmid was grown in a methylase-deficient E. coli strain GM2163 (dam-, dcm-; New England Biolabs). The 1.3-kb BglII/SacI DNA fragment was purified and digested with Sau3AI. The resulting restriction fragments of the Sau3AI digestion are shown in Fig. 6A. Fragments were purified and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment. Nuclear protein extracts from CG-4 and HeLa cells were prepared according to Dignam et al. (13Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). The labeled probes were used in gel shift assays with or without nuclear protein extracts. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl of a binding buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 60 min and directly loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE: 90 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 3-4 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried and autoradiographed on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer). Oligonucleotides ON1 (5′-CGGCGTCTTTACTTTTGCGG-3′), ON2 (5′-GTCAGATACTTTTTCTTTTCCTTCCGTT-3′), and ON3 (5′-CCTGTCCTTTCTGTGGCCTCTGACCTTTCCTTGTTCCAGA-3′) are derived from different regions of intron 1, corresponding to nucleotide positions 2779-2798, 2805-2832, and 3202-3241, respectively (Fig. 8A). The complementary oligonucleotide pairs were annealed and labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN). The double-stranded oligonucleotides were then gel-purified and used for gel shift assays, as described above. Four pairs of primers were made to PCR-amplify four overlapping DNA fragments (153-220-bp size range) spanning the entire Sau3AI/SacI region of intron 1, corresponding to nucleotide positions 2660-2879, 2778-2963, 2938-3090, and 3040-3244, respectively (Fig. 7A). The PCR products were cloned into pCR™ 2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), excised by cutting with HindIII/XbaI (these sites flank the BamHI-EcoRV insertion sites), and treated with CIP. The fragments were then labeled at both ends using [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). A singly end-labeled probe was then generated by digesting the label off one end with EcoRV (upper strand labeled), or with BamHI (lower strand labeled). The labeled probes were gel-purified. For DNase I footprinting, nuclear extracts (5-20 μg) were incubated on ice for 15 min in 50 μl, containing 25 mM HEPES, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 40 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), pH 7.5. The singly 32P-end-labeled probes were then added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Fifty microliters of Ca2+/Mg2+ solution (5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, at room temperature) were added to the reactions. Diluted RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) was added to the samples at 0.25 units/reaction and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 90 μl of prewarmed (37 °C) stop solution (200 mM NaCl, 30 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA) and extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. The reaction products were precipitated and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. Dideoxy sequencing reactions were performed with a specific upper strand primer (initiating at the HindIII site) and a specific lower strand primer (initiating at the XbaI site) to serve as size standards. Four different rat KA2 cDNA restriction fragments were used as probes to screen a rat λDASH genomic library (see “Experimental Procedures”). Six overlapping recombinant λ clones were isolated, which contained the entire grik5 gene (Fig. 1A). The restriction map of each DNA insert was determined by electrophoretic analysis of restriction fragments (Fig. 1A). To determine the exon-intron organization, the size, and exact location of the grik5 gene introns, Southern blot analysis was performed on the clones to identify restriction fragments containing coding sequence. These were subcloned into pBluescript SK− and sequenced. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis indicated that grik5 is distributed over 54 kb of genomic sequence. As shown in Fig. 1B, the gene is composed of 19 translated exons and one untranslated exon, ranging in size from 54 bp (exon 7) to 944 bp (exon 20). The size of introns varies between 0.1 and 12 kb. All of the exon-intron boundaries were determined by DNA sequencing and conform to consensus splice donor/splice acceptor sequences (Fig. 1C; Ref. 14Mount S.M. Nucleic Acid Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). Exon 20 (944 bp) of grik5 contains 423 bp of coding and 521 bp of 3′-untranslated region (a TGA translational stop codon is present 424 nucleotides downstream of the intron-exon boundary). The total length of the grik5 coding region (3.78 kb) deduced from the genomic sequence is consistent with the 4-kb mRNA identified by Northern blot analysis of tissue and cultured neural cell poly(A+) RNAs (Ref. 9Molne M. Huang F. Scherer S. Gallo V. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 52Google Scholar; data not shown). Based on the previously cloned rat cDNA sequence (5Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), polyadenylation of grik5 mRNA occurs 23 nucleotides downstream of a canonical signal sequence (AATAAA) in exon 20 (nucleotides 917-922 from the 5′-end of exon 20). grik5 is a TATA-less gene, whose transcription can initiate at several sites within 500 bp upstream of the exon1/intron 1 boundary (9Molne M. Huang F. Scherer S. Gallo V. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 52Google Scholar). It was previously found that 2 kb of grik5 5′-flanking region confers tissue-specific expression on the CAT reporter gene both in vitro and in vivo (9Molne M. Huang F. Scherer S. Gallo V. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 52Google Scholar). grik5-CAT reporter gene constructs were tested by transient transfection assays in neural (CG-4 and PC12) and nonneural (HeLa and NIH3T3) cells. Either 2 or 4.3 kb of grik5 5′-flanking region were able to selectively direct CAT gene expression in neural cells (Fig. 2, B-D). In nonneural cells, CAT activity of both grik5 gene constructs was below that of promoterless pCAT-basic. As shown in Fig. 1B, 3.4-kb intron 1 interrupts the grik5 5′-untranslated region. To examine if the presence of intron 1 altered the expression of the CAT gene driven by the 5′-flanking region of grik5, we tested reporter gene constructs that contained the two different segments of grik5 5′-flanking region, either with the intron (5.4-CAT and 7.7-CAT) or without it (2-CAT and 4.3-CAT) (Fig. 2A). The results showed that in CG-4 and PC12 cells the activities of the constructs containing intron 1 (5.4-CAT and 7.7-CAT) were reduced approximately 3-fold when compared with the activities of the constructs without the intron (2-CAT and 4.3-CAT) (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, the presence of intron 1 inhibited expression of the CAT reporter gene driven by the grik5 promoter. To exclude the possibility that grik5 promoter activity was diminished by intron 1 as a result of aberrant splicing (15Huang M.T.F. Gorman C.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1805-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), two sets of experiments were performed. First, RNA was isolated from CG-4 cells transfected with different grik5-CAT constructs. RT-PCR was carried out with two different sets of specific primers corresponding to sequences in the grik5 2-kb 5′-flanking region (sense, S primer) and in the SV40 small T antigen sequence (antisense, AS primers; Fig. 3A). If aberrant splicing occurred, a different size of RT-PCR products would be observed in cells transfected with grik5 constructs containing intron 1 than with constructs that did not contain it. On the other hand, if intron 1 were spliced out of transcripts properly, the length of RT-PCR products would be independent of its presence in the DNA constructs. Fig. 3B shows that single bands with the expected sizes of 1.4 and 1.7 kb were produced with primers S and AS1 and primers S and AS2, respectively. Identical results were obtained from RNAs of cells transfected by grik5 constructs with or without intron 1 (compare 5.4-CAT with 2-CAT and 7.7-CAT with 4.3-CAT), indicating that aberrant splicing likely did not occur. This conclusion is further supported by transient transfection experiments performed with the 5.4-CAT ΔHindIII/SacI construct (Fig. 4A), which only contained the 5′ splice donor and 3′ splice acceptor sequences of intron 1 and displayed reporter gene activity identical to 2-CAT (Fig. 4B). In a second set of experiments, the same DNA fragments from grik5 were subcloned into a different promoterless vector, galscript-ES4, to form LacZ reporter gene constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results in Fig. 3C indicate that intron 1 inhibited the β-galactosidase expression by a factor of 3 when 2-LacZ and 4.3-LacZ were compared with 5.4-LacZ and 7.7-LacZ, respectively. Since intron 1 conferred inhibition independent of the sequence of the transcriptional unit (i.e. CAT versus LacZ), we conclude that aberrant splicing does not contribute to the inhibition of reporter gene expression observed in grik5 constructs containing intron 1. If the inhibitory effect of intron 1 on grik5 reporter expression was due to the presence of a negative cis-acting element, elimination of this element should abolish the inhibitory effect. To explore this possibility, a series of intron 1 deletion constructs were made in order to define the essential negative regulatory region. All constructs were generated by internal deletions of intron 1 in the 5.4-CAT construct (Fig. 4A). Both the 5′ splice donor and 3′ splice acceptor sequences were maintained in all constructs (Fig. 4A), which were tested by transient transfection assays in CG-4 cells. The activity of 2-CAT was defined as 100%. Deletion of 2,936 nucleotides within intron 1 (construct ΔHindIII/SacI) completely eliminated the inhibition on reporter gene activity (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, when a 2-kb SacI fragment was deleted from intron 1 in the 5.4-CAT construct (ΔSacI), reporter gene activity was completely recovered (97% of 2-CAT level; Fig. 4B). This result indicated that the inhibitory region resides within the SacI fragment. The position of the inhibitory region was further defined by deletion mapping of the SacI fragment (Fig. 4A). The activities of constructs containing deletions in the 5′ portion of intron 1 (ΔHindIII/BglII, ΔSacI/BglII, and ΔKpnI/BglII) were still significantly inhibited. On the other hand, a deletion in the 3′-end region of intron 1 (ΔBglII/SacI) relieved the inhibition (83% of 2-CAT). Finally, deletion of the smaller BglII/AccI or AccI fragments did not modify the inhibitory activity of intron 1. Therefore, we concluded that one or more negative regulatory elements are located at the 3′-end of intron 1, within the AccI/SacI fragment (nucleotides 2625-3245 of intron 1). To further support this conclusion, in a construct that only contained the AccI/SacI region of intron 1 (ΔHindIII/AccI; Fig. 4A), CAT activity was reduced to the same extent as if the the entire intron were present (Fig. 4B). Deletion analysis indicated that the negative regulatory region of intron 1 is located within the SacI fragment (Fig. 4). To test if the inhibitory effect of intron 1 was orientation-dependent, we made constructs with the SacI fragment in a reverse (3′→ 5′) orientation (Fig. 5A). Results obtained from transiently transfected CG-4 cells showed that there was no significant difference in CAT activities between the constructs containing the SacI fragment cloned in a reverse (2-I-R-SacI-CAT) or forward orientation (2-I-F-CAT; Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of intron 1 is independent of its orientation relative to the site of transcription initiation. To test if the inhibitory effect of intron 1 was position-dependent, we also made constructs in which intr"

Two polypeptides are present on SDS-gels of the 8 M urea eluent with apparent molecular mass of ~210 and 47 kDa. In the absence of dithiothreitol, the two polypeptides migrate as one protein band with an apparent molecular mass of ~550 kDa. “Piglet,” as this molecule is tentatively named, is present in retinal pigment epithelial and endothelial cells of several species, but could not be detected in the nonepithelial cells we examined. Immunofluorescent localization using an antibody to the 210-kDa polypeptide revealed a filamentous network in the cytoplasm of cultured cells. This antibody was used to identify a cDNA for piglet in a bovine aortic endothelial cell expression library. Sequence data indicate a high degree of identity with non-muscle myosin II heavy chain. We subsequently found that piglet had an actin-activated ATPase activity, colocalized with actin in cells, and reacted on Western blots with a pan-non-muscle myosin II heavy chain antiserum. The protein was also recognized by antibodies specific for myosin heavy chain isoform A, but did not react with anti-isoform B antibodies. Although piglet has several features in common with known forms of non-muscle myosin II, the distinctly unconventional features it displays suggest that it is a novel myosin.

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPEretinal pigment epitheliumNMMHCnon-muscle myosin II heavy chainECendothelial cellUTRuntranslated region. is composed of a population of cuboidal to low columnar cells sandwiched between the neural retina and the highly vascularized choroid layer of the eye. Although RPE cells are normally nonproliferative and nonmigratory, they are highly active in other respects. They are indespensible for the function and survival of their immediate neighbors, the rods and cones, and malfunctions in the RPE form the basis for a variety of blinding disorders. retinal pigment epithelium non-muscle myosin II heavy chain endothelial cell untranslated region. The RPE cell feature that is perhaps most directly related to vision is the presence of dense pigment granules in their cytoplasm. These granules absorb light that has passed through the neural layers of the retina, preventing backscatter and unwanted reflection. The RPE also performs a variety of metabolic functions in support of the neural retina. By means of tight junctions, they create the blood-ocular barrier that regulates the passage of molecules between the retina and choroidal capillaries (1Flannery J.G. O'Day W. Pfeffer B.A. Horwitz J. Bok D. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They are, therefore, primary determinants of the photoreceptor microenvironment. The RPE is also responsible for phagocytosis and disposal of shed photoreceptor outer segments (2Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). In the absence of this function, degeneration of the neural retina ensues. Moreover, RPE are essential for production of the visual pigment rhodopsin (3Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). During the visual cycle, the 11-cis-retinaldehyde chromophore of rhodopsin present in photoreceptor cells is reduced to all-trans-retinol. To regenerate rhodopsin, the spent product is transferred to the RPE where it is isomerized to the 11-cis form once again. Directly and indirectly, therefore, the RPE is essential for vision. As in all cellular systems, carbohydrate recognition molecules are thought to figure prominently in RPE physiology (and pathophysiology). For example, a mannose receptor present in the RPE plasma membrane has been shown to mediate phagocytosis of rod outer segments (4Boyle D. Tien L. Cooper N. Shepard V. McLaughlin B.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1464-1470PubMed Google Scholar). Also, changes in the expression of specific carbohydrate moieties accompanying retinal pathology have been demonstrated in lectin binding studies (5Clark V. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 327-335PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tien L. McLaughlin B.J. Cooper N.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 319-325PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of endogenous retinal lectins and delineation of the specific roles they play have been elusive. In the case of galactose-binding proteins, a useful method of isolation from cell homogenates is affinity chromatography on unconjugated Sepharose 4B (for examples, see Vasta and Marchalonis (7Vasta G.R. Marchalonis J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9182-9186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Alliegro et al. (8Alliegro M.C. Burdsal C.A. McClay D.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Sepharose, being a trade name for agarose, is a linear polymer of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose. We have used this approach to identify and isolate carbohydrate binding molecules from mammalian RPE, and this report describes the isolation and initial characterization of one such protein, called piglet (for pigment epithelial lectin). Piglet is a high Mr oligomeric protein that binds avidly to Sepharose and displays several hallmark features of cytoplasmic myosin. Our data suggest that piglet is a new member of the growing myosin superfamily. Reagents for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and Sigma. Cells were cultured under routine conditions in minimal essential medium plus 15% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin + 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MEM-15). All cell types not purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were isolated using methods described previously (9Fenselau A. Mello R.J. Cancer Res. 1976; 32: 3269-3273Google Scholar), except D407 RPE cells (10Davis A.A. Bernstein P.S. Bok D. Turner J. Nachtigal M. Hunt R.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 955-964PubMed Google Scholar), which were generously provided by Dr. Alberta Davis. Cells were harvested mechanically from Nunc (Milwaukee, WI) Delta-Square culture trays or T175 flasks after two or three rinses in ice-cold PBS. They were washed three additional times by centrifugation and resuspension in cold PBS, transfered to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted for 2 min at maximum speed, decanted, and frozen until approximately 8 ml of packed cells were accumulated. The thawed cells were pooled, homogenized, and sonicated in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 7 mM EDTA, and 1% Me2SO. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min, and the supernatant was applied to a 1.5 × 2-cm column of Sepharose 4B at 4 °C. For convenience and maximum yield, the sample was usually cycled on the column overnight. To reduce the chances of nonspecific binding or precipitation within the column, the sample volume was doubled with homogenization buffer prior to affinity chromatography (halving overall protein concentration), and the column itself was preequilibrated with homogenization buffer. Following sample application the column was washed with at least 25 volumes of 50 mM Tris, 1% Triton, pH 7.5, then 50 volumes of 50 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, and eluted with 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris. For ATPase assays, fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, to remove urea. Samples were then concentrated by acetone or trichloroacetic acid precipitation, lyophilized, and resuspended in assay buffer. ATPase activity was determined in the presence of 4 mM MgCl2 using methods described by Heinonen and Lahti (11Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The phenol-sulfuric acid assay was used for estimation of carbohydrate (12Ashwell G. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 85-95Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation experiments using neuraminidase, and O- and N-glycosidases alone and in combination were carried out as described by Matherly et al. (13Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. Czajkowski C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23253-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosidases were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Routine SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed according to the methods of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gradient gels were prepared using the manufacturer's suggestions accompanying Hoeffer (San Francisco, CA) gradient makers. Mr estimates under nonreducing conditions were made using the buffer system of Davies and Stark (15Davies G. Stark G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Dimethyl suberimidate cross-linked standards for estimation of high Mr proteins were purchased from Sigma. For antibody production, purified piglet was resolved into α and β subunits on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The α subunit was excised, periodate-treated to disrupt carbohydrate epitopes (16Woodward M.P. Young W.W. Bloodgood R.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 78: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), and used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbits. Antibodies to platelet myosin and isoform-specific antibodies to non-muscle myosin II heavy chain (NMMHC) were gifts of Dr. Robert Adelstein. Anti-actin was purchased from Sigma. Western blot techniques were performed as described by Towbin et al. (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells grown on sterile coverslips were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by 3 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 and 8 min in methanol at −20 °C. We found that antigenicity was greatly reduced using formaldehyde or gluteraldehyde fixatives. Primary antiserum was used at a dilution of 1/500 to 1/1000 in PBS plus 1.5% normal goat serum. Labeled specimens were viewed with a Leica (Heidelberg, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope. A bovine endothelial cell (EC) cDNA library in λ;-zap was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and screened with α-piglet antibodies according to standard methodologies (18Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; Google Scholar). Nested, unidirectional deletions were prepared from cesium chloride-purified plasmid DNA using the Promega (Madison, WI) Erase-a-Base sytem. Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) was used in cDNA sequencing. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using IBI (New Haven, CT) MacVector software. Sequence data base inquiries were made using the BLAST E-mail server (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Following extensive detergent and high salt washes, RPE protein retained on the Sepharose column was eluted with 8 M urea in a single, symmetrical peak. Recovery approximated 1 mg/8 ml packed cells. This yield seems to decrease with increasing passage of cells. When peak fractions were analyzed on Coomassie blue-stained SDS-gels, two polypeptides were observed (Fig. 1) migrating with apparent molecular mass of 210 and 47 kDa. 2A third polypeptide in these preparations, found in trace quantities and observable only on silver-stained gels, has been described in another report (38Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both polypeptides aggregated at the stack/running gel interface in the absence of reducing agents. Gradient and low percentage acrylamide gel formats were used to resolve the aggregate as a single band with a molecular mass of 500-550 kDa, suggesting that the two polypeptides observed on reducing gels are subunits of one larger protein. Given the size of the individual subunits and their relative molar ratios estimated from gels, it is likely that the disulfide-bonded holoprotein is composed of two α (210 kDa) and two β (47 kDa) subunits. Results of phenol-sulfuric acid assays yielded variable estimates for carbohydrate associated with the protein, ranging from 5 to 20%. However, we found that exhaustive glycosidase treatment did not alter migration in SDS-gels, so carbohydrate detected in the above assays may not be covalently bound. The protein has been tentatively named “piglet” for pigment epithelial lectin, but monosaccharide specificity has not yet been determined. Piglet was also isolated in similar quantities from bovine aortic EC. An additional polypeptide of 55 kDa was present in these preparations, which did not aggregate with oligomeric piglet in the absence of reducing agents. The two polyclonal antibodies generated against the α subunit of RPE piglet recognized EC piglet. The one antibody generated against EC piglet also recognized the RPE protein with equal avidity. These antibodies were used to survey a panel of other cell types for piglet expression (Fig. 2). Although present in RPE and EC from several species, immunoreactivity was not readily detected in any of the mesenchymal cell types examined (human and rabbit fibroblasts, human astrocytes, human glioma, and mouse myeloma). In a nonsystematic survey of available tissues, α-piglet was identified by Western blot in cat spleen, lung, and liver; bovine eye and kidney; mouse spleen, lung, eye, kidney, brain, and liver; and rat spleen, lung, eye, and placenta. Piglet was not detected in rat liver. Piglet immunoreactivity was greatly affected by fixation and histological preparation. Consistent labeling of cultured cells was obtained with relatively mild paraformaldehyde fixation followed by Triton and methanol permeabilization, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Under these conditions, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed a cytoplasmic, filamentous pattern of staining (Fig. 3). In human RPE the filaments appeared fine and highly woven. In EC the filaments were more prominent, resembling stress fibers. Filaments were most pronounced in the transformed RPE cell line, D407, and often exhibited a banded pattern (see Fig. 5). Regardless of cell type, method of detection, or precise dimensions, filaments were the common theme. Identical patterns were observed with all three anti-piglet antibodies in double label immunofluorescence.Fig. 5Colocalization of piglet with actin in D407 (human RPE) cells. A, confocal immunofluorescent micrograph showing piglet distribution; B, actin distribution. Arrows highlight actin-containing filopodia that are devoid of anti-piglet staining. Bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Concurrent with these findings, we obtained a partial sequence of 1142 base pairs on piglet from a bovine cDNA clone (α-piglet 1.3) identified with our anti-piglet antibodies. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 4. The sequence shows 92% identity with the C terminus of human NMMHC. A five-amino acid (ARAAE) extension is present on the predicted C terminus of piglet. Interestingly, piglet exhibits a 67-nucleotide domain in the presumptive 3′-UTR with 65% identity to rat Munc-18, a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-18 gene (20Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 21Hosono R. Hekimi S. Kamiya Y. Sassa T. Murakami S. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Taketo A. Kodaira K.I. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Unc-18 (for “uncoordinated”) mutations lead to a paralytic phenotype, presumably due to a failure in acetylcholine release. The 3′-UTR for certain proteins, such as actin, are thought to be important for subcellular localization of message (as well as determining message stability). Functional implications for this similarity between the piglet and Munc-18 3′-UTRs would be purely speculative at this point. The observed sequence identity with NMMHC was congruent with the subcellular localization just described, but other features of piglet were clearly at odds with characteristics thought typical of myosins. We therefore tested the notion that piglet is a myosin using several approaches. We first posed the question of whether piglet is co-distributed in cells with the actin cytoskeleton. Using the transformed human RPE cell line, D407, and polyclonal anti-mammalian actin antibodies, we found that this was indeed the case (Fig. 5). Actin was found, as expected, in prominent stress fibers, extending into filopodia, and in a diffuse cytoplasmic pool. Anti-piglet labeled RPE with an identical pattern, with the exception that a subpopulation of fine actin-containing filopodia seemed to be devoid of piglet immunoreactivity. We next determined that purified piglet contains an actin-activated ATPase activity, a hallmark of myosin. We used commercially available skeletal muscle myosin as a positive control in a colorimetric phosphomolybdate assay for inorganic orthophosphate (11Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as ΔA495 nm of 0.001/min. Specific activity varied greatly between preparations, but our consistent finding was that piglet exhibited at least as much activity as the myosin control: 215 ± 80.5 units/mg piglet versus 103 ± 32.7 units/mg for the myosin control. This considerable activity relative to the myosin control hedges against the possibility that the ATPase activity in our piglet preparations was due to contaminating trace quantities of a conventional RPE myosin. Addition of actin (0.825 μg/μl) increased the piglet activity by 3.3-fold; myosin activity was increased by 2-fold. These figures are comparable to the levels of actin activation reported previously in the literature for a variety of myosin isoforms (for examples, see Refs. 22Espinolda F.S. Espreafico E.M. Coelho M.V. Martins A.R. Costa F. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Burridge K. Bray D. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Li D. Chantler P.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The quantities of purified protein available did not permit a more extensive characterization of the piglet ATPase activity, particularly with regard to cation dependence. NMMHC has been shown to exist in A and B isoforms (25Takahashi M. Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17864-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Conrad A.H. Jaffredo T. Conrad G.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Katsuragawa Y. Yanagisawa M. Inoue A. Masaki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). While often found in the same cell, these isoforms are transcribed by separate genes and may exhibit distinct subcellular localization patterns (29Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Sachiyo K. Katsutoshi Y. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 531-539Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 30Murakami N. Mehta P. Elzinga M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isoform-specific antibodies have been generated by several laboratories and used in the analysis of NMMHC from a variety of species. In addition to its recognition by broad-specificity antibodies generated against platelet-derived NMMHC (Fig. 6, lane 2), we have found that piglet reacts avidly with antibodies to NMMHC-A isoform. The antibody used in lane 3 of Fig. 6 is a polyclonal antibody generated against a 12-amino acid cassette found specifically in NMMHC-A. Piglet did not react with isotype B-specific antibodies, nor with antibodies to myosins V, VIIa, and IXb. The latter three are widely expressed “unconventional” myosins and comparable in molecular mass to piglet (190, 240, and 230 kDa, respectively) (31Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that myosin VIIa is expressed in mammalian RPE (32Hasson T. Heintzelman M.B. Santos-Sacchi J. Corey D.P. Mooseker M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9815-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Lastly, it should be noted that anti-piglet antibodies reacted poorly or not at all with NMMHC-A in rabbit (not shown) or human fibroblasts (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-4; also see Fig. 2). The first molecular motor to be discovered was conventional, two-headed myosin II. Because of its quantity and easy recognition in muscle cells and its importance in cellular contraction, myosin II has been extensively studied and well characterized at the molecular and biophysical levels. Not long after the finding that myosins II were present in non-muscle cells, Acanthamoeba myosin-I was identified as the first “unconventional” myosin. Since then, and particularly in the last few years, the field has blossomed with the discovery of approximately two score of unconventional myosins and the realization that even “conventional” myosin II comes in a variety of flavors. It has also become apparent that multiple classes of myosin may be expressed in a single cell type. Bement et al. (33Bement W.M. Hasson T. Wirth J.A. Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6549-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), for example, used a polymerase chain reaction approach to amplify 11 separate myosins in the human epithelial cell line Caco2BBe. A nomenclature system is just now beginning to take shape. The “myosin superfamily” is currently divided into 11 classes, some with several subclasses (31Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although no sequence data are available for at least two of the newly identified myosins (24Li D. Chantler P.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34D'Andrea L. Danon M.A. Sgourdas G.P. Bonder E.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2081-2094PubMed Google Scholar) and full sequence is available for only a limited number, several consensuses have emerged. All of these molecules include a relatively conserved N-terminal head domain within which lies the motor activity. There are possible exceptions, such as the Drosophila class III myosin, ninaC (31Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The neck region of all known myosins contain a variable number of ~23-amino acid repeats known as the IQ motif. This domain is the putative site of light chain binding. Following the neck domain is the carboxyl-terminal tail region, which is generally the site of highest variability between myosin classes. In myosins II, the tail region consists primarily of coiled coil α-helix thought to permit dimer and filament formation. In other myosin classes the tail may be truncated and unsuitable for dimerization, or contain sites for membrane binding or signal transduction. Our initial conception of RPE piglet was as a disulfide-bonded, oligomeric, carbohydrate-binding glycoprotein. We were mildly surprised to find the protein distributed intracellularly as a filamentous network, and sequence homology with myosin II was thoroughly unexpected. We therefore carefully reviewed and confirmed our existing data reflecting the distinctly “unmyosin-like” characteristics of piglet. First, we repeatedly found that piglet bound to Sepharose 4B and withstood extensive detergent and high salt washes. We subsequently learned that a significant portion of the bound protein withstood even 8 M urea. This was determined by binding radioiodinated piglet to Sepharose in small batch preparations, eluting with 8 M urea, and then boiling the Sepharose resin prior to SDS-gel electrophoresis. More than 50% of the bound protein was recovered in the last step. In contrast, conventional myosin is often sieved through large preparative Sepharose 4B columns as a final separation from actin (see Refs. 22Espinolda F.S. Espreafico E.M. Coelho M.V. Martins A.R. Costa F. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Burridge K. Bray D. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, and 35Sellers J.R. Soboeiro M.S. Faust K. Bengur A.R. Harvey E.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar for examples). Second, on SDS-gels in the absence of reducing agents, piglet seems to migrate as a heterotetramer with 210- and 47-kDa subunits. 3After identifying piglet as a myosin, we examined the possibility that the 47-kDa “β subunit” was co-isolated actin. However, the 47-kDa band did not react on Western blots with broad specificity anti-actin. The same antibody used to co-localize piglet with actin by immunohistochemistry was used for these blots. We were not aware of any myosins known to participate in disulfide bond formation. Third, piglet tested positive for carbohydrate in our phenol-sulfuric acid assays. Neither were we aware of any glycoprotein myosins. However, as mentioned earlier, two observations serve to qualify the notion of covalently bound carbohydrate; the variable results we obtained suggesting that piglet was anywhere from 5% to >20% carbohydrate by mass, and our inability to change the relative migration of piglet in SDS-gels following extensive glycosidase treatment. Since mobility of the α subunit alone was monitored (by Western blot), it is still possible that the 47-kDa subunit contains a carbohydrate moiety. Regardless of piglet's status as a glycoprotein, the first two “unmyosin-like” features described above were enough to prompt further analyses along these lines. We therefore directed our subsequent studies at determining if piglet exhibited other features that were diagnostic of myosin. We found that piglet was co-distributed in cells with actin filaments, and that the molecule exhibited actin-enhanced ATPase activity and reacted avidly with antibodies to platelet myosin as well as the isoform-specific C-terminal domain of NMMHC-A. In the latter case, it should be noted that NMMHC-A is reportedly 15 kDa smaller than piglet and is expressed in fibroblasts (28Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas piglet is not. These observations suggest to us that piglet is a new, unconventional myosin. Like so many of the newly discovered myosins, piglet's function in RPE cell behavior is not yet known. There is, in fact, much to be uncovered concerning the cytoskeletal organization of RPE in general. For example, an intermediate filament network composed of cytokeratins 8 and 18 is thought to be diagnostic of RPE among other retinal cells, but vimentin is known to be expressed in the RPE of at least two vertebrate species thus far (chicken and cow) (36Owaribe K. Kartenbeck J. Rungger-Brändle E. Franke W.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The desmosomal and zonulae adherens protein, plakoglobin, has been identified in RPE of all species examined. However, desmoplakin and desmoglein are not expressed in chicken or rat RPE (36Owaribe K. Kartenbeck J. Rungger-Brändle E. Franke W.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether these differences represent diversity of function or conserved function accomplished by different but related molecules is not clear. Of the unconventional myosins, VIIa is known to be expressed in the RPE (31Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A defective myosin VIIa gene is thought to be responsible for Usher syndrome, characterized by hearing impairment and retinitis pigmentosa (32Hasson T. Heintzelman M.B. Santos-Sacchi J. Corey D.P. Mooseker M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9815-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 37Weil D. Blanchard S. Kaplan J. Guilford P. Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A.

Nature. 1995; 374: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate a crucial role for at least one myosin isoform in RPE function, most likely in rod outer segment phagocytosis. A great deal remains to be learned about the molecular scaffolding and motors involved in phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments, retinaldehyde transport, and pigment granule organization, to mention just a few vital RPE functions. As we discover more about the component proteins of the RPE cytoskeleton, these processes are likely to be detailed in the near future. We thank Dr. Robert Adelstein (National Institutes of Health) and Dr. Mark Mooseker (Yale University) for extremely helpful discussion and the use of their myosin antibodies. Dr. Tama Hasson (Yale) processed our anti-myosin V, VIIa, and IXb Western blots. Assistance from Mary Anne Alliegro with this project is also greatly appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2092235144,"Abstract Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L23 was derivatized with [3H]2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene both at the N terminus and at internal lysines. Dinitrophenyl-L23 (DNP-L23) was taken up into 50 S subunits from a reconstitution mixture containing rRNA and total 50 S protein depleted in L23. Unmodified L23 competed with DNP-L23 for uptake, indicating that each protein form bound in an identical or similar position within the subunit. Modified L23, incorporated at a level of 0.7 or 0.4 DNP groups per 50 S, was localized by electron microscopy of subunits complexed with antibodies to dinitrophenol. Antibodies were seen at two major sites with almost equal frequency. One site is beside the central protuberance, in a region previously identified as the peptidyltransferase center. The second location is at the base of the subunit, in the area of the exit site from which the growing peptide leaves the ribosome. Models derived from image reconstruction show hollows or canyons in the subunit and a tunnel that links the transferase and exit sites. Our results indicate that L23 is at the subunit interior, with separate elements of the protein at the subunit surface at or near both ends of this tunnel."
