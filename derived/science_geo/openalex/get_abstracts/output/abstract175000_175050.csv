https://openalex.org/W2033191061,"Plant steroid hormones, known as brassinosteroids (BRs), signal through a plasma membrane localized receptor kinase BRI1. We identified bes1, a semidominant suppressor of bri1, which exhibits constitutive BR response phenotypes including long and bending petioles, curly leaves, accelerated senescence, and constitutive expression of BR-response genes. BES1 accumulates in the nucleus in response to BRs. BES1 is phosphorylated and appears to be destabilized by the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) BIN2, a negative regulator of the BR pathway. These results establish a signaling cascade for BRs with similarities to the Wnt pathway, in which signaling through cell surface receptors leads to inactivation of a GSK-3 allowing accumulation of a nuclear protein that regulates target gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2094150528,"In the fruit fly, Drosophila, olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given receptor project to spatially invariant loci in the antennal lobe to create a topographic map of receptor activation. We have asked how the map in the antennal lobe is represented in higher sensory centers in the brain. Random labeling of individual projection neurons using the FLP-out technique reveals that projection neurons that innervate the same glomerulus exhibit strikingly similar axonal topography, whereas neurons from different glomeruli display very different patterns of projection in the protocerebrum. These results demonstrate that a topographic map of olfactory information is retained in higher brain centers, but the character of the map differs from that of the antennal lobe, affording an opportunity for integration of olfactory sensory input."

https://openalex.org/W2148579087,"We explored how the odor map in the Drosophila antennal lobe is represented in higher olfactory centers, the mushroom body and lateral horn. Systematic single-cell tracing of projection neurons (PNs) that send dendrites to specific glomeruli in the antennal lobe revealed their stereotypical axon branching patterns and terminal fields in the lateral horn. PNs with similar axon terminal fields tend to receive input from neighboring glomeruli. The glomerular classes of individual PNs could be accurately predicted based solely on their axon projection patterns. The sum of these patterns defines an ""axon map"" in higher olfactory centers reflecting which olfactory receptors provide input. This map is characterized by spatial convergence and divergence of PN axons, allowing integration of olfactory information."
https://openalex.org/W2036588212,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is characterized by cyst formation in the kidney and other organs and results from mutations of PKD1 or PKD2. Previous studies suggest that their gene products have an important role in growth regulation. We now show that expression of polycystin-1 activates the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby upregulating p21(waf1) and inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. This process requires polycystin-2, a channel protein, as an essential cofactor. Mutations that disrupt polycystin-1/2 binding prevent activation of the pathway. Mouse embryos lacking Pkd1 have defective STAT1 phosphorylation and p21(waf1) induction. These results suggest that one function of the polycystin-1/2 complex is to regulate the JAK/STAT pathway and explain how mutations of either gene can result in dysregulated growth."

In this study, subjecting rat islets to oxidative stress activates JNK, p38 MAPK, and protein kinase C, preceding the decrease of insulin gene expression. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of dominant-negative type (DN) JNK, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 nor the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X, protected insulin gene expression and secretion from oxidative stress. Moreover, wild type JNK overexpression suppressed both insulin gene expression and secretion. These results were correlated with changes in the binding of the important transcription factor PDX-1 to the insulin promoter; adenoviral overexpression of DN-JNK preserved PDX-1 DNA binding activity in the face of oxidative stress, whereas wild type JNK overexpression decreased PDX-1 DNA binding activity. Furthermore, to examine whether suppression of the JNK pathway can protect β-cells from the toxic effects of hyperglycemia, rat islets were infected with DN-JNK expressing adenovirus or control adenovirus and transplanted under renal capsules of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nude mice. In mice receiving DN-JNK overexpressing islets, insulin gene expression in islet grafts was preserved, and hyperglycemia was ameliorated compared with control mice. In conclusion, activation of JNK is involved in the reduction of insulin gene expression by oxidative stress, and suppression of the JNK pathway protects β-cells from oxidative stress.

Thus, it is likely that oxidative stress mediates some of the toxic effects of hyperglycemia upon β-cells. In this study, we examined the mechanism for oxidative stress-mediated suppression of insulin gene expression. We have shown that in isolated rat islets several pathways (JNK, p38 MAPK, and PKC) are activated by oxidative stress, preceding suppression of insulin gene expression (Figs. 1 and2). Furthermore, oxidative stress-mediated suppression of insulin gene expression and secretion was prevented by overexpression of DN-JNK (FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5), suggesting that JNK is involved in oxidative stress-mediated suppression of insulin gene expression and secretion found in diabetes.Suppression of insulin gene expression by JNK overexpression was accompanied by a decrease of PDX-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 6), which may explain at least part of the suppression of insulin gene expression.

Thus, it is likely that JNK-mediated suppression of PDX-1 DNA binding activity accounts for some of the suppression of insulin gene transcription and of β-cell function, which fits with reports that PDX-1 expression of DNA binding activity is decreased in association with reduction of insulin gene transcription after chronic exposure to a high glucose concentration (3Sharma A.

Thus, we postulate that activation of JNK pathway leads to decreased PDX-1 activity and subsequent suppression of insulin gene transcription in the diabetic state. Although not examined in this study, there are several possible mechanisms for suppression of PDX-1 DNA binding activity by the JNK pathway. One possibility is that activation of the JNK pathway influences nuclear accumulation of PDX-1, as has been shown for NFAT4, a member of the REL domain family transcription factors that are important mediators of immune response (58Chow C.-W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Another is that JNK activation changes the phosphorylation state of PDX-1 (59Elrick L.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which could influence the PDX-1 DNA binding activity. As discussed later, we do not propose that suppression of insulin gene expression by oxidative stress is exclusively mediated through lowering of PDX-1; c-Jun, c-Myc, and other factors are likely to make contributions.To examine the potential therapeutic application for islet transplantation, we transplanted DN-JNK overexpressing islets under kidney capsules of STZ diabetic nude mice and found that DN-JNK provides some protection for β-cells, thus ameliorating hyperglycemia (Fig. 7). Under hyperglycemic conditions oxidative stress is provoked in β-cells (26Ihara Y. Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Odaka H. Tanaka T. Ikeda H. Hiai H. Seino Y. Yamada Y.

Motor pools can be delineated by transcription factor expression, but cell surface proteins that distinguish motor pools in a systematic manner have not been identified. We show that the developmentally regulated expression of type II cadherins defines specific motor pools. Expression of one type II cadherin, MN-cadherin, regulates the segregation of motor pools that are normally distinguished by expression of this protein. Type II cadherins are also expressed by proprioceptive sensory neurons, raising the possibility that cadherins regulate additional steps in the development of sensory-motor circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2165096694,"A fundamental feature of development in the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis is the switch from medial to asymmetric division. The switch is brought about by a change in the location of the cytokinetic Z ring, which is composed of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, from the cell middle to the poles during sporulation. We report that the medial Z ring is replaced by a spiral-like filament of FtsZ that grows along the long axis of the cell. We propose that the filament mediates the switch by redeploying FtsZ to the poles. Spiral formation and the switch to polar Z rings are largely caused by a sporulation-specific increase in transcription of the gene for FtsZ and activation of the gene for the FtsZ-associated protein SpoIIE."

https://openalex.org/W2058955390,"The transcriptional regulatory protein RfaH controls expression of several operons that encode extracytoplasmic components in bacteria. Regulation by RfaH occurs during transcript elongation and depends on a 5'-proximal, transcribed nucleic acid sequence called ops that induces transcriptional pausing in vitro and in vivo. We report that RfaH recognizes RNA polymerase transcribing RfaH-regulated operons by interacting with the ops sequence in the exposed nontemplate DNA strand of ops-paused transcription complexes. Although RfaH delays escape from the ops pause, once escape occurs, RfaH enhances elongation by suppressing pausing and rho-dependent termination without apparent involvement of other accessory proteins. This activity predicts a cumulative antitermination model for RfaH's regulation of ops-containing operons in vivo."

EGFR1 and IGF-IR can both provide powerful mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals in a wide variety of cell types but activate distinct downstream signaling pathways. The EGFR family consists of four members, EGFR (ErbB1, HER1), ErbB2 (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4) (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor by ligand binding results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, providing docking sites for a number of SH2 domain containing signaling proteins, such as the Grb2/mSOS complex, and phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase (PI3K) (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-bound IGF-IR interacts with specific adaptor molecules, insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2, which in turn become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and recruit SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules (3White M.F.

The central position of BAD between multiple growth factor signaling pathways and apoptosis raises the possibility of its potential as a therapeutic target. Most therapies for solid tumors utilize DNA-damaging agents, inducing apoptosis of cancer cells and thereby reducing tumor mass (20Dive C. Hickman J.A. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 21Hickman, J. A. (1992) Cancer Metastasis Rev., 121–139Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and ATM, encode molecules that integrate DNA damage with apoptosis (22Symonds H. Krall L. Remington L. Saenz-Robles M. Lowe S. Jacks T. Van Dyke T.

Inactivation of these genes are frequently found in cancer, thus decreasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and limiting the usefulness of these therapeutic approaches (24Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Despite this, cancer cells still maintain the potential to undergo apoptosis, and scope therefore exists for therapies that induce cell death via different pathways (25Ishizaki Y. Cheng L. Mudge A.W.

Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22068) Google Scholar). The EGFR family, and EGFR and Erb2 in particular, have been strongly implicated in tumor progression, including tumors of breast, lung, head, neck, bladder, and ovary, where receptor overexpression is associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis (29Salomon D.S.

Herceptin, a recently developed humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody inhibits ErbB2 activity and cell proliferation and is effective in treating a subset of breast cancers that overexpress ErbB2 (31Cobleigh M.A. Vogel C.L.

Other growth factor receptors may prove to be effective therapeutic targets, and a number of drugs are now undergoing development (32Mendelsohn J. Clin.

In this paper we have examined whether inhibitors of growth factor receptors can be used to induce activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). It is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (35Baselga J. Averbuch S.D. Drugs. 2000; 60: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In vitro andin vivo studies have shown ZD1839 to inhibit the mitogenic effect of EGFR activation or overexpression (36Chan K.C. Knox W.F. Gandhi A. Slamon D.J. Potten C.S. Bundred N.J. Br. J. Surg. 2001; 88: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that ZD1839 potently induces apoptosis in normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. We show that ZD1839 inhibits mammary epithelial cell survival through its effects on EGFR-dependent MAPK signaling and BAD phosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that IGF-1 induces phosphorylation of BAD and epithelial cell survival and that this occurs through both PI3K- and MAPK-dependent pathways. By using ZD1839, we demonstrate that in mammary epithelial cells, IGF-IR-mediated activation of MAPK occurs through transactivation of the EGFR. Our results suggest that regulation of BAD and apoptosis in response to diverse growth factors is dependent upon EGFR activation and that this can be manipulated therapeutically. Moreover, our results suggest that by targeting pathways independent of DNA damage, ZD1839 may have significant potential as an anticancer agent in tumors that are resistant to conventional therapies. Primary mouse mammary epithelial cells, isolated from pregnant ICR mice, BAD −/− mice, or wild type littermates (37Pullan S. Streuli C.H. Harris A. Epithelial Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996: 97-121Google Scholar), and FSK-7 cells (38Kittrell F.S. Oborn C.J. Medina D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1924-1932PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 5 ng/ml EGF, and 880 nm insulin. Freshly isolated pleural effusion cells were obtained with consent from a 62 year-old female patient with an estrogen receptor-positive primary invasive ductal carcinoma. The cells were kindly donated by Prof. Charles Coombes (Department of Cancer Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK). The patient was lymph node-positive at primary surgery and had relapsed with metastatic disease at multiple sites within 4 years, after successive rounds of anti-estrogen therapy (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, including taxane and vinca alkaloid treatment. The malignant cells were separated from the reactive mesothelial cells in the effusion by a 2-h attachment in tissue culture medium, which removed the latter as a result of their rapid adhesion to the substratum. The purified malignant breast carcinoma cells were then assayed for ZD1839 sensitivity. For all of the growth factor experiments, the cells were starved of serum and growth factors for 4 h before stimulating with either EGF (5 ng/ml) or IGF (10 μm) for 15 min. PP2, AG1478, LY-294002, PD-98059 (all from Calbiochem), and ZD1839 were added to cells 30 min prior to growth factor stimulation. To quantify apoptosis, both the detached cells and the remaining adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization and pooled. The cells were cytospun onto polysine slides (Merck) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The nuclear morphology was examined after staining cells with 4 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 (Molecular Probes). The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors), and the insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation. The samples were normalized for protein content and either immunoprecipitated using protein A-Sepharose or separated by SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with antibodies from the following sources: caspase 3 and MAPK (Santa Cruz); EGFR and phosphotyrosine (PY-20, BD Transduction Laboratories); phospho-MAPK and Ser(P)112 and Ser(P)136 BAD (New England Biolabs); BAD (R and D systems); and IRS-1 and p85 PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The cells were transfected with up to 1 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). pIRES-hrGFP and pEBG-BAD were from Stratagene and New England Biolabs, respectively. Other plasmids were generously donated by the following people: pEH-Hm-Raf and pCDNA3-p110CAAX were from Julian Downward (ICRF, London, UK), pEGFP-Bax was from Richard Youle (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and pMT2-myrRsk-1 was from John Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). FSK-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pEBG.BAD and grown for 18 h post-transfection. The cells were starved for 4 h before stimulating with either EGF or IGF for 15 min. Inhibitors were added to cells 30 min prior to stimulation with growth factor. The cells were lysed by scraping into radioimmune precipitation buffer, followed by centrifugation. GST-BAD was precipitated on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting using antibodies specific for Ser(P)112 and Ser(P)136 BAD. IGFs have previously been shown to be survival factors for mammary epithelial cells (39Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We tested whether EGF also regulates survival in primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells. High levels of spontaneous apoptosis occur in primary cells plated on tissue culture plastic or collagen I (40Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 631-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but EGF, as well as fetal calf serum and IGF, suppresses apoptosis (Fig.1 a). To confirm a survival role for EGF, we treated primary mammary cells with ZD1839 and observed a time-dependent suppression of EGF-mediated survival (Fig.1 a). The data were similar in a mammary epithelial cell line, FSK-7, isolated from luminal epithelial cells (38Kittrell F.S. Oborn C.J. Medina D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1924-1932PubMed Google Scholar), although the cell line exhibits lower spontaneous apoptosis than primary cells both in the absence of growth factors or with fetal calf serum, EGF, or IGF (Fig. 1 b). FSK-7 cells also underwent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner when treated with varying concentrations of ZD1839 (Fig. 1 c). Together, these data indicate that ZD1839 blocks EGF- and IGF-mediated survival of mammary epithelial cells. ZD1839 is in phase III clinical trials for lung cancer (35Baselga J. Averbuch S.D. Drugs. 2000; 60: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), but it is not yet known whether it will be effective for other types of human cancer. Our results with primary cultures of mouse mammary cells and with mammary epithelial cell lines suggest that ZD1839 might also be a valuable therapy for breast cancer. We therefore assessed whether the drug induced apoptosis in a primary culture isolate of a pleural effusion from a malignant breast tumor. These cells were from a patient whose tumor had failed radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and they show low spontaneous apoptosis when cultured without growth factors (not shown) or with EGF (Fig. 1 d). ZD1839 induces a dramatic apoptotic response in these cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that ZD1839 is successful in inducing apoptosis of primary breast carcinoma cells. EGF induces cytoplasmic signal transduction through the MAPK pathway (2Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One target of the MAPK pathway is the pro-apoptotic protein, BAD. Phosphorylation of BAD inhibits BAD-induced apoptosis (7Fang X., Yu, S. Eder A. Mao M. Bast R.C., Jr. Boyd D. Mills G.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells, EGF potently activates MAPK phosphorylation, whereas ZD1839 inhibits the phosphorylation of both MAPK and EGFR (Fig.2 a). In the same cultures EGF modulates the phosphorylation status of endogenous BAD. BAD is visible by SDS-PAGE as a discrete 23-kDa protein, but additional more slowly migrating isoforms can be detected that represent the phosphorylated form of the protein (16Zha J.P. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). These slower migrating phosphorylated isoforms of BAD can be detected in the presence of EGF, both in FSK-7 cells (Fig. 2 a) and in primary cultures of mammary cells (Fig. 2 b). ZD1839 inhibits the appearance of the additional forms of BAD in response to EGF (Fig. 2,a and b). To test for the specificity of ZD1839 inhibition of EGFR signaling, FSK-7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ZD1839 before stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of EGF-dependent activation of MAPK is consistent with the IC50 of ZD1839 for EGFR (0.08 μm). 1 μm ZD1839 completely inhibits MAPK and BAD phosphorylation (Fig. 2 c). FSK-7 cells were treated with AG1478, another well characterized EGFR antagonist (41Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). AG1478 also inhibits EGF-dependent MAPK and BAD phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 d). In contrast to these results, PP2, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that does not reportedly affect EGFR, does not block EGF-mediated phosphorylation of MAPK or BAD (Fig. 2 e). Thus, ZD1839 prevents EGF-dependent MAPK activation and BAD phosphorylation, correlating with its inhibition of mammary cell survival (Fig. 1). One of the EGFR-regulated forms of BAD is phosphorylated on Ser112 (BAD-S112), and this can be detected using a phospho-specific antibody after transfecting cells with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vector expressing GST-BAD (Fig.2 f). BAD-S112 is known to be phosphorylated downstream of MAPK (7Fang X., Yu, S. Eder A. Mao M. Bast R.C., Jr. Boyd D. Mills G.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 42Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In mammary cells, the phosphorylation of this residue is inhibited by either ZD1839 or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.2 f). This suggests that BAD phosphorylation by EGF occurs through the MAPK pathway. To confirm this, the cells were transfected with vectors encoding constitutively active Raf or p90Rsk-1together with GST-BAD. Raf is upstream of MAPK, whereas p90Rsk-1 is downstream and has been shown to phosphorylate BAD (8Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 43Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins bypass the inhibition of EGF-mediated BAD-S112 phosphorylation that occurs with ZD1839 (Fig.2 g). These results demonstrate that EGF induces BAD phosphorylation through a MAPK pathway involving p90Rsk-1. To determine whether BAD is directly involved in the apoptotic response to ZD1839, we overexpressed BAD in mammary epithelial cells and asked whether this sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by ZD1839. In cells overexpressing BAD, the endogenous factors that suppress its pro-apoptotic function may be sequestered, and apoptosis ensues even in the presence of survival factors such as EGF (Fig.3 a). These cells are therefore sensitized for apoptosis, and significantly more death occurs after blocking EGFR signaling by ZD1839 (p = 0.05). In contrast, ZD1839 does not potentiate apoptosis in cells overexpressing another pro-apoptotic protein, Bax. Furthermore in cells sensitized by BAD overexpression, apoptosis (in the absence of ZD1839) is enhanced by the removal of EGF (Fig. 3 b). Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of BAD −/− mammary epithelial cells to ZD1839. Mammary epithelial cells isolated from BAD −/− or wild type mice were cultured in the presence of EGF with or without ZD1839. Whereas apoptosis increased in wild type cells following treatment, the BAD −/− cells were less sensitive, showing no increase in apoptosis over controls without drug at 5 h (Fig. 3 c). Interestingly, we also observed that the rate of spontaneous apoptosis was higher in the wild type cells compared with the BAD −/− cells (data not shown). Thus, BAD is a mediator of apoptosis that becomes activated after blocking EGF signaling, either by removing ligand or by inhibiting EGFR with ZD1839. Together these data show that ZD1839 is a potent inhibitor of mammary epithelial cell survival through its effects on MAPK signaling and BAD activation. IGF-I activates a separate pathway leading to BAD phosphorylation. This is mediated by PI3K and results in phosphorylation of BAD on a different serine residue, Ser136 (44Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S., Fu, H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar, 45delPeso L. GonzalezGarcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells, IGF activates the IGF-IR, thus phosphorylating IRS-1 and causing it to associate with the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K (46Lee Y.J. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ZD1839 does not inhibit the kinase activity of IGF-IR receptor in vitro (47Wakeling A.E. Barker A.J. Davies D.H. Brown D.S. Green L.R. Cartlidge S.A. Woodburn J.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or block IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3K association in mammary cells (Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, ZD1839 does not prevent BAD-S136 phosphorylation in response to either IGF-1 (Fig. 4 b) or the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K (Fig. 4 c). In contrast, EGF fails to activate the IRS-1 pathway and BAD phosphorylation on residue Ser136 (Fig. 4,a and b). These results point to the specificity of ZD1839 in inhibiting EGFR but not IGF-IR activation. We noted above that ZD1839 does partially reverse the IGF suppression of apoptosis in primary mammary epithelial cultures (Fig.1 a). This suggests that IGFs regulate mammary cell survival through an additional, IRS-1-independent pathway. We therefore examined the possibility that IGF-1 might contribute to survival through a MAPK pathway and phosphorylation of BAD-S112 (Fig. 4, b,d, and e). IGF-I has been shown to activate EGFR signaling indirectly through heparin-binding EGF (48Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), suggesting that the MAPK pathway might also be activated through cross-talk with EGFR in mammary cells. Indeed, IGF-1 induces phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig.4 e), and ZD1839 inhibits both this as well as the phosphorylation of MAPK and BAD-S112 (Fig. 4, b,d, and e). We confirmed that IGF mediates BAD-S112 phosphorylation independently of PI3K, because expression of the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K does not prevent inhibition of BAD-S112 phosphorylation by ZD1839 (Fig. 4 d,left panel). Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 fails to block IGF-induced phosphorylation of BAD-S112, whereas PD98059 does (Fig. 4 d, right panel). Similarly, IGF activation of MAPK was inhibited by ZD1839 and PD98059 but not LY29402 (Fig. 4 f). These data indicate that IGF signaling occurs partially through EGFR and that this is independent of IGF-IR-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway. Our results demonstrate that both the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways lead to phosphorylation of BAD in mammary epithelial cells. To determine which of these pathways is critical for EGF-mediated survival, we transfected mammary epithelial cells with vectors encoding activated signaling enzymes and then assessed cell survival in the presence or absence of ZD1839. In cells transfected with only the control vector, pLacZ, ZD1839 induces significant apoptosis (Fig.5). Activation of both Raf and p90Rsk-1 bypasses ZD1839-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5) and BAD-S112 phosphorylation (Fig 2 g), confirming the role of MAPK signaling in EGF-dependent survival. PI3K also has a role in survival that is independent of EGFR signaling, because the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K circumvents the apoptotic effect of ZD1839 (Fig. 5) and maintains phosphorylation of BAD-S136 in the presence of ZD1839 (Fig. 4 c). Thus, EGF signaling results in BAD-S112 phosphorylation through MAPK, whereas IGF activates PI3K leading to BAD-S136 phosphorylation, and both of these pathways contribute to mammary cell survival (Fig.6). Furthermore, IGF can additionally transactivate EGFR resulting in phosphorylation of BAD-S112, and this can be inhibited by ZD1839. Through this mechanism ZD1839 may have the potential to target survival mediated by a wide range of ligands whose signaling converges on the EGFR (48Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D.

Deletion of the GSH1 gene (strain Δgsh1) encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glutathione biosynthesis leads to growth arrest, which can be relieved by either glutathione or reducing agents such as dithiothreitol. Because defects in the biosynthesis of cellular iron-sulfur (Fe/S) proteins are associated with increases in glutathione levels, we examined the consequences of glutathione depletion on this essential process. No significant defects were detected in the amounts, activities, and maturation of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins in glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells. On the contrary, the maturation of extra-mitochondrial Fe/S proteins was decreased substantially. The defect was rectified neither by addition of dithiothreitol nor under anaerobic conditions excluding oxidative damage of Fe/S clusters. A double mutant in GSH1 andATM1 encoding a mitochondrial ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation is nonviable even in the presence of dithiothreitol. Similar toatm1 and other mutants defective in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation, mitochondria from glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells accumulated high amounts of iron.

Fe/S proteins fulfil a wide variety of biological functions including electron transport, catalysis, and environmental sensing (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar).

In higher eukaryotes, iron uptake and storage is regulated by an Fe/S protein that senses the cytosolic iron concentration (3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, this process is carried out by two sets of proteins. One set termed iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery (5Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is composed of conserved proteins that can be found in most eubacteria and eukaryotes. This suggests the existence of a similar mechanism of Fe/S cluster formation in these organisms (6Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol.

The two chaperone homologues HscA and HscB interact with IscU leading to increased ATPase activity of HscA, but their detailed functions have not been elucidated yet (7Schilke B. Voisine C.

The release of the assembled Fe/S cluster from IscU is mediated by the addition of reducing agents leading to the assumption that in vivo the input of electrons occurs via the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin Fdx (9Yuvaniyama P.

The eukaryotic ISC assembly proteins play a role not only in the maturation of mitochondrial but also of cytosolic Fe/S proteins (5Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the latter process an additional set of components specifically participates, namely the inner membrane protein Atm1p and Erv1p of the intermembrane space (15Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R.

The human ABC7 and theArabidopsis thaliana Sta1 ABC transporters are orthologues of yeast Atm1p and have been shown to complement the phenotypic consequences of the deletion of the yeast protein (18Csere P.

The crucial character of this process may explain why mitochondria are indispensable organelles and emphasizes the central role of Fe/S proteins in the eukaryotic cell. Another characteristic feature associated with defects in Fe/S cluster biogenesis is the severe effect on cellular iron homeostasis with an approximately 20-fold increase in the mitochondrial iron content and a concomitant depletion of cytosolic iron (4Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial iron accumulation was also induced by the inactivation of ATM1(15Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) or ERV1 (16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Because both gene products participate exclusively in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins, the inactivation of an extra-mitochondrial Fe/S protein may be responsible for this characteristic phenotype. Glutathione, the tripeptide γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine, makes up the major free thiol pool present in millimolar concentrations in aerobic cells (22Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of glutathione requires γ-glutamyl cysteine synthase (termed Gsh1p), glutathione synthase (Gsh2p), and ATP (23Inoue K. Kuramitsu S. Aki K. Watanabe Y. Takagi T. Nishigai M. Ikai A. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Glutathione is essential for viability of yeast but not of bacteria such as E. coli (24Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Gsh1p (strain Δgsh1) are able to survive in the presence of an external source of glutathione (25Wu A.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Without glutathione these cells stop growing after 3 days, although at this stage some residual amount of cellular glutathione can still be detected (26Penninckx M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Interestingly, growth of Δgsh1 mutant cells also can be restored by addition of dithiothreitol, a membrane-permeable sulfhydryl reagent (27Grant C.M. Maciver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the central function of glutathione in the protection against oxidative stress. Upon glutathione depletion, yeast cells develop an increased sensitivity against H2O2 and ionizing irradiation. Furthermore, these cells display characteristics of apoptosis, i.e. condensation and fragmentation of chromatin and phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (28Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Even though glutathione plays a number of additional roles, the strongly decreased reducing capacity upon glutathione depletion is thought to be the reason for the loss of viability. Glutathione protects cells against xenobiotics and heavy metal toxicity (29Penninckx M.J. Elskens M.T. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1993; 34: 239-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Li Z.S. Szczypka M., Lu, Y.P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 31Li Z.S., Lu, Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D. Rea P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Xenobiotics can be conjugated with glutathione followed by excretion from the cell or transport into the lysosomes with the help of ABC transporters (32Commandeur J.N. Stijntjes G.J. Vermeulen N.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 271-330PubMed Google Scholar). Heavy metals are chelated by glutathione derivatives (i.e.(γ-Glu-Cys)2–11-Gly oligopeptides), which can be efficiently transported into the vacuole by the ABC transporter Hmt1p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe (33Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The metal is stored thereafter in the vacuole as a non-toxic glutathione- and sulfide-containing complex. We previously noted a more than 2-fold increase of glutathione in cells lacking functional Atm1p (15Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Jain A. Martensson J. Stole E. Auld P.A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Therefore, we addressed the question of whether glutathione may participate in cellular Fe/S cluster biogenesis. The followingSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains were used: YPH 500 (MAT a, ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1–63 his3–200 leu2–1). The GSH1 deletion strain (termed Δgsh1) was generated by a one-step PCR-based gene replacement using the HIS3 gene (35Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Gal-ATM1 and Δgsh1/Gal-ATM1 cells were generated by integrating the GAL10 promoter in front ofATM1 in the YPH500 and in Δgsh1 cells (36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in “rich medium” (YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose). For selective growth, cells were cultivated in “minimal medium” (MMD: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) (37Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The composition of the “iron-poor medium” is essentially identical to MMD, with the exception that iron chloride was omitted. Published methods were used for the manipulation of DNA (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), transformation of yeast cells (39Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), isolation of mitochondria from yeast (40Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for breaking the cells with glass beads (41Woontner M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8979-8982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, aconitase, alcohol dehydrogenase (42Kispal G. Rosenkrantz M. Guarente L. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11145-11149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), isopropylmalate isomerase (43Kohlhaw G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), succinate dehydrogenase (44Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Guck A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial iron content (45Tangeras A. Flatmark T. Bäckström D. Ehrenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were measured as described previously. Fe/S cluster biosynthesis was measured using cells grown in iron-poor medium (36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin-tagged Rli1p was performed by monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody coupled to agarose beads and Bio2p and Leu1p were precipitated using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits (36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Bio2p and the hemagglutinin-tagged Rli1p were expressed from the multicopy plasmid pRS424-GPD (16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Experiments under anaerobic conditions were performed in a Coy anaerobic chamber. Standard methods were used for protein determination (Bio-Rad), SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting, and immunostaining of the blotted proteins. Cells lacking γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthase Gsh1p (Δgsh1 cells) require glutathione supplementation for normal growth in minimal medium. In the absence of glutathione Δgsh1 cells are still able to undergo approximately 10 cell divisions before growth arrest (not shown). For our studies we used Δgsh1 cells that were grown for only eight generations without glutathione to ensure that the cells examined were still viable. These cells contained a highly reduced amount of glutathione (0.03 μmol/g of cells) as compared with the wild-type value of 3.8 μmol/g. Their generation time increased to 4.1 h compared with 1.9 h observed in wild-type cells. Addition of dithiothreitol restored the ability of Δgsh1 cells to grow without glutathione supplementation (27Grant C.M. Maciver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 5). We first addressed the question of whether mitochondrial Fe/S protein formation and activity were affected by glutathione depletion. Mitochondria were isolated from Δgsh1 cells grown in minimal medium without glutathione supplementation. The amount of several mitochondrial proteins including aconitase was found to be the same as in wild-type cells as determined by immunostaining analysis (Fig. 1A). The enzyme activities of two Fe/S proteins, aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, in Δgsh1 mitochondria were comparable with wild-type values indicating the presence of the Fe/S cofactor (Fig. 1B). The unchanged activities of two other mitochondrial enzymes, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, gave further proof of the integrity of the organelle. We next measured the de novo incorporation of55Fe into the Fe/S protein Bio2p (biotin synthase) of the mitochondrial matrix (46Marquet A. Bui B.T. Florentin D. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 51-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. Gerber, unpublished data. Wild-type and Δgsh1 cells overexpressing Bio2p were grown in the presence or absence of glutathione and were then radiolabeled for 1 h with 55Fe in the presence of ascorbate. A cell lysate was prepared, and the maturation of Bio2p was measured by immunoprecipitation using a Bio2p-specific antibody. The radioactivity detected in the immunoprecipitate served as a direct measure of Fe/S cluster incorporation into the apoprotein (16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The incorporation of 55Fe into Bio2p increased 2-fold upon glutathione depletion of Δgsh1 cells as compared with wild-type cells (Fig.2A). Upon supplementation of the medium with glutathione the iron incorporation into Bio2p of Δgsh1 cells was similar to that observed in wild-type cells. Finally, the amount of 55Fe imported into the yeast cells was measured. Glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells contained a slightly higher amount of iron as compared with wild-type cells or Δgsh1 cells grown in the presence of glutathione (Fig. 2B). Apparently, glutathione depletion did not impair the ability of cells to efficiently import iron and transfer it to mitochondria. Taken together, these results demonstrate that glutathione is not required for maturation of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins. The maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins was examined by employing the immunoprecipitation assay described above. As marker proteins we used Leu1p, an isopropylmalate isomerase required for leucine biosynthesis in yeast (43Kohlhaw G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and Rli1p, the function of which is not yet known (15Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The incorporation of radioactive iron into both proteins decreased significantly in glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells (Fig.3A). Upon supplementation of glutathione to the medium, the maturation of these proteins was comparable with that observed in wild-type cells. The glutathione requirement of cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation was further supported by determination of the enzyme activity of isopropylmalate isomerase Leu1p in an extract of Δgsh1 cells. The activity of Leu1p decreased strongly upon glutathione depletion, whereas that of alcohol dehydrogenase was unaffected (Fig.3B). The strong decrease in Fe/S protein maturation in the cytosol may be due to a specific requirement of glutathione during biosynthesis of the cytosolic Fe/S proteins or due to oxidative damage of the Fe/S clusters before or after incorporation into the apoproteins. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the maturation of Rli1p was tested using Δgsh1 cells that were grown in the presence of dithiothreitol. This reducing agent can restore growth of Δgsh1 cells and is therefore believed to replace glutathione in its central function in maintaining the intracellular redox potential (27Grant C.M. Maciver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). No significant improvement of the defective maturation of Rli1p in glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells was observed upon addition of up to 1 mm dithiothreitol (Fig.4A). As an additional control to rule out oxidative damage of cytosolic Fe/S clusters we performed the 55Fe incorporation experiment under anaerobic conditions. Even in the absence of oxygen the de novo formation of the Fe/S cluster in Rli1p was largely defective (Fig. 4B). The experiment under anaerobic conditions demonstrated that the defective maturation of the cytosolic Fe/S proteins is a consequence of an impaired biogenesis of the Fe/S protein rather than its destruction by oxygen. Taken together, these results indicate that the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins specifically requires glutathione. It cannot be replaced by other reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, despite their ability to adjust the cellular redox levels. To obtain further evidence for a function of glutathione in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation, we took into account that close homologues of the ABC transporter Atm1p are involved in the transport of metals bound to glutathione derivatives into vacuoles (33Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the connection between Atm1p and glutathione by examining a possible genetic interaction betweenATM1 and GSH1. To this end, a double mutant was created in which the ATM1 gene was placed under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter in Δgsh1 cells. The resulting Δgsh1/Gal-ATM1 cells and the single mutant strains, Gal-ATM1 (36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and Δgsh1, were cultivated on glucose-containing medium in the presence or absence of glutathione and dithiothreitol (Fig.5). In agreement with previous findings, growth of the Gal-ATM1 cells is not affected under glucose repression, even though the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins decreases to 15% of wild-type levels upon depletion of Atm1p (36Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). As demonstrated before Δgsh1 cells required either glutathione or dithiothreitol for growth (27Grant C.M. Maciver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, Δgsh1/Gal-ATM1 mutants did not show any growth even after addition of dithiothreitol providing genetic evidence for a connection between the functions of Atm1p and glutathione. The synthetic lethality may be taken as an indication for a function of glutathione and Atm1p in the same pathway, namely cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation. Specific defects in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation, for example, by inactivation of Atm1p or Erv1p, have been shown to result in a drastic accumulation of free (i.e.non-heme, non-Fe/S) iron in mitochondria (15Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To examine whether the impairment of cytosolic Fe/S protein formation during depletion of glutathione is accompanied by a similar mitochondrial iron accumulation, we isolated mitochondria from Δgsh1 cells that were grown in the absence of glutathione and measured their iron content by the bathophenanthroline method (45Tangeras A. Flatmark T. Bäckström D. Ehrenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These organelles contained an ∼20-fold higher amount of free iron as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 6). Restoration of the cellular redox potential by the addition of dithiothreitol to the culture medium did not prevent the mitochondrial iron accumulation in the glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells. In conclusion, glutathione-deficient Δgsh1 cells both exhibit specific defects in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation and display a drastic iron accumulation within mitochondria. Hence, these cells behave similarly to cells lacking functional Atm1p or Erv1p. Glutathione, the metabolite present at high concentrations in aerobic bacteria and eukaryotes, performs a wide variety of biological functions including the thoroughly studied detoxification of xenobiotics and the protection against oxidative stress (22Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Penninckx M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined whether glutathione plays any role in cellular Fe/S protein biogenesis. Glutathione depletion was achieved by cultivating Δgsh1 cells in glutathione-free medium. Under these conditions, the Δgsh1 cells contain a more than 100-fold lower amount of glutathione compared with wild-type cells. Glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells were able to efficiently transport iron from the medium to the cytosol. The amount of free iron accumulated in mitochondria was drastically increased showing that physiological levels of glutathione are not required as a readily accessible reducing agent for the delivery of iron to mitochondria. Glutathione was also not necessary for the maintenance of the activity of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins and for their maturation. These findings demonstrate that the ISC assembly machinery can assemble and insert Fe/S clusters into mitochondrial apoproteins without the help of this metabolite. Similarly, bacterial Fe/S cluster biogenesis performed by a homologous machinery seems to occur independently of glutathione. TheE. coli strain gshA, which lacks γ-glutamyl cysteine synthase and therefore is glutathione-deficient, preserves 75% of the aconitase activity even under aerobic conditions (24Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence, glutathione does not appear to be a necessary cofactor of thede novo assembly of Fe/S clusters and their insertion into mitochondrial or bacterial apoproteins. Upon growth arrest Δgsh1 cells contain a low but significant amount of glutathione (this study and Ref. 26Penninckx M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that these low residual levels of glutathione may be of importance for cellular iron import, transfer of absorbed iron into mitochondria, and/or biogenesis of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins. Nevertheless, our data amply demonstrate that these processes do not require the substantial amounts needed for maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. In contrast to mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, the activity and maturation of extra-mitochondrial proteins were strongly decreased upon glutathione depletion. This was evident from the low enzyme activity of Leu1p in glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells and from the impairedde novo Fe/S cluster assembly into both Leu1p and Rli1p. In addition to Atm1p and Erv1p glutathione is the third component for which a specific function in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins was shown. A strong indication that glutathione might function in the vicinity of Atm1p comes from the genetic interaction betweenGSH1 and ATM1. Without added glutathione the double mutant Δgsh1/Gal-ATM1 strain was unable to grow even in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol, which restores growth of Δgsh1 cells. These findings raise the question of what function glutathione might perform in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. In principle, glutathione may play a role in the protection of cytosolic Fe/S proteins against oxidative damage or it may participate in their biogenesis. Our results demonstrate a function of glutathione in Fe/S cluster biogenesis rather than in maintenance. First, glutathione was shown here to be necessary for the de novo incorporation of iron into cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Second, the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol could not restore normal maturation of the extra-mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, although it allowed growth and alleviated the oxidative stress in the Δgsh1 cells. These findings also indicate that the absence of bulk-reducing capacity is the major reason for lethality under these conditions. Third, the defect in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins could not be cured by removal of oxygen. Finally, the activity of mitochondrial Fe/S proteins was fully preserved even though this organelle, after accumulation of free iron, may likely be the major site of free radical formation under these conditions. Therefore, glutathione appears to be a novel component that is specifically required for the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. This notion is consistent with the fact that mitochondria derived from glutathione-depleted Δgsh1 cells, like organelles of cells lacking other components with a specific function in cytosolic Fe/S protein maturation (Atm1p or Erv1p), accumulate high amounts of free iron (16Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,18Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At which step in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins may glutathione perform its crucial function? At present, our knowledge about the mechanism of the biogenesis of cytosolic Fe/S proteins is still scarce. Components participating in this process are the ISC assembly proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, the ABC transporter Atm1p of the inner membrane, and Erv1p of the intermembrane space. The latter two proteins are believed to participate in the export of a component that is synthesized within the matrix and needs to be transferred to the cytosol for Fe/S protein maturation (6Lill R. Diekert K. Kaut A. Lange H. Pelzer W. Prohl C. Kispal G. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). According to a current working model, the transported compound may be related to an Fe/S cluster or a precursor thereof (4Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Glutathione may be involved in facilitating the transport of such a component to the cytosol, possibly mediated by Atm1p. In that respect, it is interesting to note that the close homologue of Atm1p, the vacuolar ABC transporter Hmt1p of S. pombe, transports heavy metals chelated by phytochelatins, a glutathione derivative (33Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. McCue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). One attractive hypothesis therefore is that an Fe/S cluster is chelated by glutathione or derivatives thereof and thus stabilized for and during transport. An alternative function of glutathione may be in the transfer or insertion of the Fe/S cluster into the cytosolic apoprotein and/or in the protection of the free cysteine residues of the apoprotein from disulfide bond formation (30Li Z.S. Szczypka M., Lu, Y.P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 31Li Z.S., Lu, Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D. Rea P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Defining the precise role of glutathione in one or more of these steps will require a better understanding of this crucial process and may depend on,e.g. the identification of cytosolic components mediating these reactions.

https://openalex.org/W2025129596,"The physiological role of anosmin-1, defective in the X chromosome-linked form of Kallmann syndrome, is not yet known. Here, we show that anti-anosmin-1 antibodies block the formation of the collateral branches of rat olfactory bulb output neurons (mitral and tufted cells) in organotypic cultures. Moreover, anosmin-1 greatly enhances axonal branching of these dissociated neurons in culture. In addition, coculture experiments with either piriform cortex or anosmin-1-producing CHO cells demonstrate that anosmin-1 is a chemoattractant for the axons of these neurons, suggesting that this protein, which is expressed in the piriform cortex, attracts their collateral branches in vivo. We conclude that anosmin-1 has a dual branch-promoting and guidance activity, which plays an essential role in the patterning of mitral and tufted cell axon collaterals to the olfactory cortex."

In this study, we demonstrate that vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 regulates thioredoxin in conditions of biomechanical or oxidative stress and critically regulates cardiomyocyte viability. Expression of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 but not of thioredoxin in rat cardiomyocytes was rapidly suppressed by biomechanical strain or hydrogen peroxide at both mRNA and protein levels. Mechanical suppression of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 gene expression was blocked by N-acetylcysteine. The half-life of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 transcripts in cardiomyocytes was only 1.1 h and remained unchanged after mechanical stimulation, suggesting that rapid responses in vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 gene expression occur through transcriptional control. Vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 down-regulation by strain or hydrogen peroxide led to increased thioredoxin activity, whereas adenovirus-mediated overexpression of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 suppressed thioredoxin activity. Overexpression of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 but not of thioredoxin induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 sensitized cells to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of thioredoxin protected against injury. These data identify vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 as a key stress-responsive inhibitory switch of thioredoxin activity in cardiomyocytes and demonstrate that the vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1/thioredoxin axis has an important role in the preservation of cellular viability. The protein-disulfide reductase thioredoxin is critical for redox signaling during apoptosis and growth. In this study, we demonstrate that vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 regulates thioredoxin in conditions of biomechanical or oxidative stress and critically regulates cardiomyocyte viability.

These data identify vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1 as a key stress-responsive inhibitory switch of thioredoxin activity in cardiomyocytes and demonstrate that the vitamin D3-up-regulated protein-1/thioredoxin axis has an important role in the preservation of cellular viability. reactive oxygen species thioredoxin vitamin D3-up-regulated protein neonatal rat ventricular myocytes green fluorescent protein multiplicity of infection terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling fluorescence-activated cell sorter Biomechanical strain, hypoxia, and other types of stress induce hypertrophy, apoptosis, contractile failure, and other myocardial changes that directly or indirectly predispose to cardiac failure.

In this study, we demonstrate that VDUP1 is a biomechanical and oxidative stress-responsive gene and that the VDUP1 gene product controls cardiomyocyte survival through regulation of TRX activity. We describe the following: (i) biomechanical and oxidative stress down-regulate VDUP1 mRNA and protein expression while increasing TRX activity, (ii) overexpression of VDUP1 inhibits TRX activity, and (iii) overexpression of VDUP1 induces apoptosis and sensitizes cells to oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Based on these data, we conclude that VDUP1 acts as a crucial, environmental stress-mediated regulator of cardiomyocyte viability through TRX.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we focused on VDUP1, an intrinsic TRX inhibitory protein, as a stress-responsive gene in cardiomyocytes that regulates cell viability. We found that biomechanical strain and oxidative stress rapidly down-regulated VDUP1 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Given the known interactions between VDUP1 and TRX (9Yamanaka H. Maehira F.

TRX is a major ubiquitous disulfide reductase that controls rapid thiol-disulfide exchange reactions of structural or catalytic SH groups of many proteins. TRX has many biological activities, including protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of apoptosis (7Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar, 8Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In this study, inhibition of endogenous TRX by VDUP1 induced apoptosis even in the absence of imposed oxidative stress. TRX is thus more than a defense system in cardiomyocytes against exogenous oxidative stress and may be a critical regulator of cell viability in non-oxidative conditions. These conditions likely include biomechanical overload, as suggested by our observation that mechanical deformation induced VDUP1 down-regulation and activation of TRX. Intriguingly, mechanical deformation of cardiomyocytes has been reported previously to induce functionally relevant changes in the cardiac muscle redox state (12Yamamoto K. Dang Q.N. Kennedy S.P.

TRX may, however, promote survival by other mechanisms, including the modulation of nuclear factor κB activity, a stress-related survival-related transcription factor in cardiomyocytes and other cell types (18Hirota K.

It is important to consider this protective mechanism within the context of potential pro-apoptotic effects of mechanical strain and oxidative stress. We and others have found that very large deformations (25% or greater) can promote apoptosis (16Pimentel D.R. Amin J.K. Xiao L. Miller T. Viereck J. Oliver-Krasinski J. Baliga R. Wang J. Siwik D.A.

Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, we have found this pro-apoptotic effect only in association with obvious partial cell detachment from the culture substrate; we have not observed an increase in cardiac myocyte apoptosis by any measure with the smaller deformations that regulate gene expression that were used in this study. In addition, our data suggest that overexpression of TRX and an increase in TRX activity can partially protect against oxidative stress, but this protection is not complete. Thus, we would anticipate that even with complete absence of VDUP1, extreme conditions of oxidative stress could exceed the beneficial effects of increased TRX activity.This study argues for a role of the VDUP1/TRX pathway in myocardial remodeling, and previous reports further suggest a role of TRX in cardiac disease (21Aota M.

The present study demonstrates that the earliest regulatory event in the recruitment of TRX may be stress-induced down-regulation of its inhibitory partner VDUP1 rather than increased expression of TRX. Delayed or deficient down-regulation of VDUP1 may result in incomplete adaptation in the early phases of cardiac disease and further alter disease progression.

Consistent with previous reports (9Yamanaka H. Maehira F. Oshiro M. Asato T. Yanagawa Y. Takei H. Nakashima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol.

J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), overexpression of VDUP1 inhibited TRX activity. TRX is a major ubiquitous disulfide reductase that controls rapid thiol-disulfide exchange reactions of structural or catalytic SH groups of many proteins. TRX has many biological activities, including protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of apoptosis (7Arner E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar, 8Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). In this study, inhibition of endogenous TRX by VDUP1 induced apoptosis even in the absence of imposed oxidative stress. TRX is thus more than a defense system in cardiomyocytes against exogenous oxidative stress and may be a critical regulator of cell viability in non-oxidative conditions. These conditions likely include biomechanical overload, as suggested by our observation that mechanical deformation induced VDUP1 down-regulation and activation of TRX. Intriguingly, mechanical deformation of cardiomyocytes has been reported previously to induce functionally relevant changes in the cardiac muscle redox state (12Yamamoto K. Dang Q.N. Kennedy S.P.

The mechanisms through which TRX acts as an anti-apoptotic regulator are still under investigation, but recent reports have shown that TRX inhibits ASK-1, a mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that delivers apoptotic signals by activating c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 pathways (11Junn E. Han S.H., Im, J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W., Um, H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W. Han P.L. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 17Saitoh M. Nishitoh H.

Han S.H., Im, J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W., Um, H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W. Han P.L. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). TRX may, however, promote survival by other mechanisms, including the modulation of nuclear factor κB activity, a stress-related survival-related transcription factor in cardiomyocytes and other cell types (18Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin A.S., Jr. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the regulation of VDUP1 may participate in protection against apoptosis from mechanical overload or oxidative stress. It is important to consider this protective mechanism within the context of potential pro-apoptotic effects of mechanical strain and oxidative stress. We and others have found that very large deformations (25% or greater) can promote apoptosis (16Pimentel D.R. Amin J.K. Xiao L. Miller T. Viereck J. Oliver-Krasinski J. Baliga R. Wang J. Siwik D.A. Singh K. Pagano P. Colucci W.S. Sawyer D.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, we have found this pro-apoptotic effect only in association with obvious partial cell detachment from the culture substrate; we have not observed an increase in cardiac myocyte apoptosis by any measure with the smaller deformations that regulate gene expression that were used in this study. In addition, our data suggest that overexpression of TRX and an increase in TRX activity can partially protect against oxidative stress, but this protection is not complete. Thus, we would anticipate that even with complete absence of VDUP1, extreme conditions of oxidative stress could exceed the beneficial effects of increased TRX activity. This study argues for a role of the VDUP1/TRX pathway in myocardial remodeling, and previous reports further suggest a role of TRX in cardiac disease (21Aota M. Matsuda K. Isowa N. Wada H. Yodoi J. Ban T. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Kishimoto C. Shioji K. Nakamura H. Nakayama Y. Yodoi J. Sasayama S. Jpn. Circ.

Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the earliest regulatory event in the recruitment of TRX may be stress-induced down-regulation of its inhibitory partner VDUP1 rather than increased expression of TRX. Delayed or deficient down-regulation of VDUP1 may result in incomplete adaptation in the early phases of cardiac disease and further alter disease progression."

In this study, we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the behavior of rafts in supported lipid bilayers. We show that bilayers composed of equimolar dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin spontaneously form rafts, which are detectable as raised features. A comparison of the extents of protrusion of the rafts in monolayers and bilayers indicates that the rafts in the two leaflets of the bilayer coincide. The rafts were observed both in the absence and presence of cholesterol (33 mol %). Cholesterol reduced raft protrusion presumably by increasing the thickness of the non-raft bilayer.

J. 2001; 81: 1486-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The possibility that these rafts are present in biological membranes remains controversial, although evidence for their existence is growing (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For example, the treatment of membranes with non-ionic detergents leads to the production of detergent-resistant membrane fragments that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and that are believed to represent the biochemical equivalents of rafts (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 7Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The observation that the detergent-resistant membranes also contain particular proteins has led to the proposal that rafts are involved in processes such as cellular signaling and protein trafficking (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).In mixed lipid bilayers, sphingomyelin/cholesterol-enriched rafts are thought to exist in a liquid-ordered state in which the lipid molecules are tightly packed but still able to diffuse laterally (1Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). These liquid-ordered phase domains are surrounded by a liquid-disordered phase (composed principally of phospholipids with unsaturated and, therefore, kinked fatty acyl chains), which allows for a greater degree of lateral diffusion. The kinked structure of the fatty acyl chains of phospholipids also results in a shorter molecular length relative to the straight sphingomyelin molecules. For instance, the thickness of a bilayer composed of C18:1 phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 is 35 Å, whereas a bilayer composed of C18:0 sphingomyelin is 46-Å thick (5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Additionally, cholesterol is known to increase the length of the PC molecule so that the thickness of a C18:1 PC bilayer increases to 40 Å (5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In contrast, cholesterol does not affect the molecular length of sphingomyelin.In this study, we have examined the sorting of the protein placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) between the raft and non-raft phases of supported lipid bilayers using atomic force microscopy (AFM), a technique that provides high resolution imaging under physiological conditions (8Ellis D.J. Dryden D.T.F. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Berge T. Ellis D.J. Dryden D.T.F. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PLAP is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is known to be enriched in detergent-resistant membrane fragments of biological membranes (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 10Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We show that PLAP is efficiently targeted to rafts in vitro.RESULTSWe began our experiments by imaging lipid monolayers composed of an equimolar mixture of DOPC (C18:1) and sphingomyelin (C18:0). The monolayers were formed on the surface of a Langmuir-Blodgett trough and then transferred to mica. This procedure results in supported monolayers with the polar headgroups of the lipids attached to the mica. A typical image of a supported monolayer obtained using tapping-mode AFM in air is shown in Fig.1a. Rafts of approximate diameter of 200 nm can be seen protruding from the background monolayer. Sections through the monolayers reveal a mean step in height between the two phases of 5.5 ± 0.1 Å (mean ± S.E.,n = 25), which is the expected difference in length between DOPC and sphingomyelin molecules. We next used tapping-mode AFM under fluid to image a bilayer composed of the same lipid mixture prepared by allowing liposomes to attach and then collapse onto the mica support. Protruding rafts were again seen (Fig. 1b), and the height of the steps was significantly greater than that in the monolayers (mean value 8.9 ± 0.1 Å, n = 25,p < 0.0001). This result indicates that transbilayer coupling between the sphingomyelin rafts is occurring as has been reported previously (14Rinia H.A. Snel M.M.E. van der Eerden J.P.J.M. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The observation that the height of the rafts in bilayers is somewhat less than double their height in monolayers probably reflects the fact that monolayers were imaged in air, whereas the bilayers were imaged under fluid. In other words, we are comparing the dimensions of dehydrated and hydrated lipids. In addition, there is probably an interdigitation among the tails of the sphingomyelin molecules in the bilayers that will tend to reduce the observed raft height. When cholesterol was added to the lipid mixture (equimolar DOPC/cholesterol/sphingomyelin), the supported bilayers again contained rafts (Fig. 1c), but the step in height between the two domains was now smaller (6.6 ± 0.1 Å, n = 25,p < 0.0001) as predicted from the ability of cholesterol to cause an extension of the DOPC molecule. Occasional imperfections in the bilayer were seen, and sections through these features (for example, see Fig. 1d) gave values for the bilayer thickness of 57 ± 1 Å (n = 25) in the absence of cholesterol and 58 ± 2 Å (n = 25) in the presence of cholesterol. These values are larger than the expected bilayer thickness of around 46 Å (as described above). The presence of a 10-Å hydration layer between a bilayer and its support has been reported previously (15Tamm L.K. McConnell H.M. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 16Mou J. Yang J. Shao Z. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Such a hydration layer would account for the discrepancy between expected and observed bilayer thickness in our experiments and might also contribute to the relatively large errors in the values of these parameters (compared with the errors on the values for raft heights), which mask the change in thickness that would be expected to occur upon the addition of cholesterol.The principal aim of this study was to test whether PLAP, a GPI-anchored protein that is enriched in detergent-resistant fragments of biological membranes (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 10Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), is targeted to rafts in supported lipid bilayers. PLAP was obtained commercially and purified until only a single band was seen on a silver-stained gel (Fig.2a). When PLAP was run on a linear (5–15%) sucrose gradient, it migrated at a slightly lower size than the 150-kDa protein alcohol dehydrogenase (Fig. 2b). This result is consistent with previous reports that PLAP in solution exists as a dimer of 70-kDa subunits (17Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Ménez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When PLAP in solution was allowed to attach to a mica support and then imaged by AFM under fluid, a reasonably homogeneous spread of particles was observed (Fig.2c). Sections through PLAP particles were used to calculate a molecular volume of 405 ± 36 nm3 (n= 25). This is somewhat larger than the volume of 260 nm3that is expected of a protein with a molecular mass of 140 kDa and may indicate a degree of aggregation of the protein.Figure 2Purification and molecular properties of PLAP. a, purified PLAP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining.

To confirm that the liposomes contained PLAP, they were floated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (buffer, 50% sucrose, 60% sucrose). It was found that 10% of the total PLAP floated with the DOPC/sphingomyelin liposomes above the 50% sucrose layer. This percentage was slightly greater (14%) for the DOPC/cholesterol/sphingomyelin liposomes (Fig.3a). Hence, the efficiency of association of PLAP with liposomes was not significantly affected by the presence of cholesterol. When the proteoliposomes were allowed to collapse onto mica supports, PLAP activity could be recovered from the mica, demonstrating that the protein had attached to the support along with the lipids and also that its activity persists after extensive dialysis (Fig. 3b). The supported lipid bilayers clearly showed the presence of rafts. Protein-free bilayers composed of DOPC/sphingomyelin showed only occasional large raised features, which may represent lipid vesicles that had not fused with the bilayer (Fig.3c). In contrast, the same bilayers containing PLAP showed a population of smaller protruding particles (Fig. 3d). It was immediately apparent that the vast majority of these particles was associated with rafts. An analysis of the distribution of 433 particles present in six separate images gave a value of 89% for the degree of raft association. A similar pattern emerged when bilayers composed of DOPC/cholesterol/sphingomyelin were used. Protein-free bilayers showed the occasional large particle (Fig. 3e), whereas PLAP-containing bilayers were decorated with smaller particles that were predominantly (92% (n = 394) from two separate images) in rafts (Fig. 3f). The calculated molecular volume of the particles was 261 ± 29 nm3 (n= 25), almost identical to the expected value (260 nm3) for a PLAP dimer.Figure 3PLAP is efficiently targeted to rafts in lipid bilayers. a, liposomes composed of either DOPC/sphingomyelin (D/S) or DOPC/cholesterol/sphingomyelin (D/C/S) and containing PLAP were floated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient.

The fluorescence studies have typically reported raft sizes on the micrometer scale,i.e. considerably larger than the raft size reported here (∼200 nm), which is similar to the size believed to occur in cell membranes (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Contrasting effects of manipulation of cholesterol content have also been seen. For instance, rafts were found to disappear from monolayers in response to cholesterol depletion (18Dietrich C. Volovyk Z.N. Levi M. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10642-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), although both phase separation and detergent insolubility of PLAP persisted in cholesterol-free sphingomyelin/PC liposomes (20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 21Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Rafts in bilayers were also reported to disappear after the addition of cholesterol at 33 mol % (19Milhiet P.E. Giocondi M.-C. Le Grimellec C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 875-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although others have shown that phase separation persists under these conditions (20Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that rafts in bilayers remained clearly visible either in the absence or presence of cholesterol (also at 33 mol %). One potential problem with fluorescence-based assays in contrast to detection by AFM is that the resolution achieved might not be sufficient to discriminate between raft disappearance and reduction in size; however, it should be noted that in our study, we found no significant change in raft size with changing cholesterol content.Several GPI-anchored proteins including PLAP (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 7Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Thy-1 (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar), and GP-2 (22Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are recovered from detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Here, we found that PLAP was almost exclusively localized in rafts both in the presence and absence of cholesterol, thus ruling out the requirement not only for interactions with other proteins but also for cholesterol. Like PLAP, Thy-1 has recently been found to be enriched in rafts in supported lipid monolayers, although the targeting efficiency was lower than that for PLAP (18Dietrich C. Volovyk Z.N. Levi M. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10642-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The difference in efficiency of targeting of PLAP and Thy-1 to rafts might relate to the use of lipid bilayers and monolayers in the respective assays. Furthermore, the oligomerization state of the two proteins, known to be an important determinant of raft association (23Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 24Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), might be different. In our assay, PLAP was shown to dimeric, but the oligomerization state of Thy-1 in the previous study (18Dietrich C. Volovyk Z.N. Levi M. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10642-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) was not determined. Finally, there might be genuine differences in the efficiency of targeting of the various GPI-linked proteins to rafts. In support of this suggestion, it has been shown previously that a number of GPI-linked proteins present in the kidney microvillar membrane showed significant differences in the extent of their detergent insolubility (25Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that PLAP might be especially well targeted to rafts. For instance, PLAP at the plasma membrane was found to be 95% detergent-insoluble (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar), and its insolubility after reconstitution into liposomes was also very high (21Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar).We suggest that the use of AFM imaging of protein-containing supported lipid bilayers could shed considerable light on the processes underlying the control of the distribution of proteins within the plane of a biological membrane. It is well known that different lipids tend to coalesce in model membranes to form microdomains or “rafts” (1Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 2Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys.

J. 2001; 81: 1486-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The possibility that these rafts are present in biological membranes remains controversial, although evidence for their existence is growing (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For example, the treatment of membranes with non-ionic detergents leads to the production of detergent-resistant membrane fragments that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and that are believed to represent the biochemical equivalents of rafts (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 7Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The observation that the detergent-resistant membranes also contain particular proteins has led to the proposal that rafts are involved in processes such as cellular signaling and protein trafficking (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In mixed lipid bilayers, sphingomyelin/cholesterol-enriched rafts are thought to exist in a liquid-ordered state in which the lipid molecules are tightly packed but still able to diffuse laterally (1Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). These liquid-ordered phase domains are surrounded by a liquid-disordered phase (composed principally of phospholipids with unsaturated and, therefore, kinked fatty acyl chains), which allows for a greater degree of lateral diffusion. The kinked structure of the fatty acyl chains of phospholipids also results in a shorter molecular length relative to the straight sphingomyelin molecules. For instance, the thickness of a bilayer composed of C18:1 phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 is 35 Å, whereas a bilayer composed of C18:0 sphingomyelin is 46-Å thick (5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Additionally, cholesterol is known to increase the length of the PC molecule so that the thickness of a C18:1 PC bilayer increases to 40 Å (5Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In contrast, cholesterol does not affect the molecular length of sphingomyelin. In this study, we have examined the sorting of the protein placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) between the raft and non-raft phases of supported lipid bilayers using atomic force microscopy (AFM), a technique that provides high resolution imaging under physiological conditions (8Ellis D.J. Dryden D.T.F. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 15-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Berge T. Ellis D.J. Dryden D.T.F. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PLAP is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that is known to be enriched in detergent-resistant membrane fragments of biological membranes (6Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 10Hanada K. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6254-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We show that PLAP is efficiently targeted to rafts in vitro. RESULTSWe began our experiments by imaging lipid monolayers composed of an equimolar mixture of DOPC (C18:1) and sphingomyelin (C18:0). The monolayers were formed on the surface of a Langmuir-Blodgett trough and then transferred to mica. This procedure results in supported monolayers with the polar headgroups of the lipids attached to the mica. A typical image of a supported monolayer obtained using tapping-mode AFM in air is shown in Fig.1a. Rafts of approximate diameter of 200 nm can be seen protruding from the backg"

This could support an uncoupling (proton transport) activity of UCP2 in the inner mitochondrial membranein vivo. We used mitochondria from lung or spleen, the two organs expressing the highest level of UCP2, to compare the proton leak of the mitochondrial inner membrane of wild-type andUcp2(−/−) mice. No difference was observed under basal conditions. Previous reports have concluded that retinoic acid and superoxide activate proton transport by UCP2. Spleen mitochondria showed a higher sensitivity to retinoic acid than liver mitochondria, but this was not caused by UCP2. In contrast with a previous report, superoxide failed to increase the proton leak rate in kidney mitochondria, where no UCP2 expression was detected, and also in spleen mitochondria, which does not support stimulation of UCP2 uncoupling activity by superoxide. Finally, no increase in the ATP/ADP ratio was observed in spleen or lung of Ucp2(−/−) mice. Therefore, no evidence could be gathered for the uncoupling activity of the UCP2 present in spleen or lung mitochondria. Although this may be explained by difficulties with isolated mitochondria, it may also indicate that UCP2 has another physiological significance in spleen and lung.

This passive proton conductance catalyzed by UCP1 dramatically increases respiration and heat production in this thermogenic organ of mammals. UCP1 is tightly regulated. On the one hand, its activity is inhibited upon binding of nucleotides, and on the other hand, proton transport is activated by free fatty acids. Since 1997, several homologs of UCP1 have been identified (for review, see Refs. 3Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 4Boss O. Hagen T.

Two of them, referred to as UCP2 and UCP3, share 55–60% similarities with UCP1. Accordingly, it has been postulated that they have a similar activity, i.e. proton transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These novel UCPs could influence energy expenditure and probably also cellular production of reactive oxygen species (8Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 9Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), which concern the control of body weight as well as aging and degenerative processes. This explains the present interest in UCPs. UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 share similarities with a large family of anion carriers of the inner mitochondrial membrane, able to exchange various solutes across the inner membrane but in an energy-conservative way.Recently, using the reconstitution scheme developed for UCP1, it was shown that UCP2 and UCP3 share essentially the same functional characteristics. All promote a passive proton conductance in the presence of fatty acids which is inhibited by GDP or other nucleotides (10Jaburek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P.

Recombinant expression and reconstitution experiments allow a description of the potential biochemical activities of these proteins but cannot indicate which are physiologically relevant. The use of gene inactivation procedures in mice was expected to clarify the physiological significance of these mitochondrial proteins. Disruption of the Ucp1 gene produced mice unable to maintain their body temperature upon cold exposure (21Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), which demonstrated the role of UCP1 in adaptive thermogenesis. However, this phenotype was abolished by heterosis, although no compensation occurred at the level of brown adipocyte mitochondria (22Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

A decrease in the proton leak was observed in muscle mitochondria ofUcp3(−/−) mice (26Gong D.W. Monemdjou S. Gavrilova O. Leon L.R. Marcus-Samuels B. Chou C.J. Everett C. Kozak L.P., Li, C. Deng C.

Greater oxidative damage to the mitochondrial enzyme aconitase was also observed in the mitochondria of muscle of Ucp3(−/−) mice (25Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y.

This tallies with the hypothesis that a moderate uncoupling of respiration, mediated through UCP3 in muscle, would decrease the production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria in state 4 (8Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 100-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). An increase in reactive oxygen species production was observed in macrophages ofUcp2(−/−) mice (23Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.-C.

These modifications are consistent with a higher membrane potential in vivo of mitochondria from Ucp2(−/−) mice in comparison with controls, something well in line with a physiologically relevant protonophoric activity of UCP2. Finally, in a recent report it was shown that superoxide is another required activator of proton transport by UCP2 and UCP3 and that it can also activate UCP1 (27Echtay K.S. Roussel D., St.- Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). This further strengthened the link between UCPs and the biochemistry of reactive oxygen species.The present study deals with the comparison of bioenergetic properties of mitochondria from control (Ucp2(+/+)) andUcp2(−/−) mice, using mitochondria from spleen and lung because these two organs express the highest UCP2 level in mice (28Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Gelly C. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol.

Because kidney mitochondria have been used to evaluate the regulation of UCP2 by superoxide (27Echtay K.S. Roussel D., St.- Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J.

Finally, there are also reports indicating that there is no consistent correlation between UCP2 or UCP3 expression and increase in energy expenditure (38Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Samec S. Seydoux J.

Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and that recombinant expression systems are prone to artifacts leading to nonspecific uncoupling of mitochondria (39Stuart J.A.

Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar); however, the protein has been reliably detected only in a limited number of organs, those with the highest mRNA levels (28Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Gelly C. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the organs where the expression is highest, spleen and lung, the amount of UCP2 in mitochondria is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria (28Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Gelly C. Lévi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This prompted us to study spleen and lung mitochondria. Liver mitochondria were used as controls.We could not record any decrease in the permeability to protons of the inner mitochondrial membrane of Ucp2(−/−) mice under all of the conditions explored so far. As we said before, other reports using Ucp2(−/−) mice were in fact consistent with an increased mitochondrial membrane potential in macrophages and pancreatic β cells of the Ucp2(−/−) mice compared with controls. This is consistent with a protonophoric activity of UCP2 but could also be explained by other mechanisms. It is interesting to note that in Ucp3(−/−) mice the titration curves of membrane potential versus respiration rate shift toward a higher membrane potential for an almost identical state 4 rate (26Gong D.W. Monemdjou S. Gavrilova O. Leon L.R. Marcus-Samuels B. Chou C.J. Everett C. Kozak L.P., Li, C. Deng C. Harper M.E. Reitman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The termuncoupling is synonymous with a loss of respiratory control, which means that the rate of oxidation of the substrate is less/not controlled by the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. If this is caused by a moderate increase in the proton permeability of the inner membrane, this would result in a higher respiratory rate in state 4 with little decrease in membrane potential and not in a lower membrane potential with an almost identical state 4 rate as could be deduced from the comparison of the curves with Ucp3(−/−) mice (26Gong D.W. Monemdjou S. Gavrilova O. Leon L.R. Marcus-Samuels B. Chou C.J. Everett C. Kozak L.P., Li, C. Deng C. Harper M.E. Reitman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16251-16257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), or when UCP2/UCP3 activity is supposed to be induced (27Echtay K.S. Roussel D., St.- Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar).A common assumption is that the presence of an uncoupling protein would result in a decrease in ATP production efficiency and lead to a lower ATP/ADP ratio in cells. No increase in the ATP/ADP ratio was observed in lung or spleen of Ucp2(−/−) mice. This is an argument against a significant uncoupling activity in vivo of the UCP2 present in the mitochondria of these organs. This result contrasts with the observation made in pancreatic islets ofUcp2(−/−) mice where the absence of UCP2 was accompanied by an increased ATP level and a higher insulin secretion (24Zhang C. Baffy G. Perret P. Krauss S. Peroni O. Grujic D. Hagen T. Vidal-Puig A.J. Boss O. Kim Y. Zheng X.X. Wheeler M.B. Shulman G.I. Chan C.B. Lowell B.B. Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar).Therefore this first report on the bioenergetics of mitochondria comparing the Ucp2(+/+) and Ucp2(−/−) genotypes does not support the hypothesis that UCP2 acts as an uncoupling proteinin vivo. Basically two main hypotheses are to be considered. According to the first hypothesis, UCP2 is an anion carrier of the mitochondrial inner membrane acting in an energy-conservative wayin vivo. The second hypothesis is that for some reason the proton transport activity of UCP2 could not be evidenced in this study with isolated mitochondria. The first hypothesis calls for screening for substrates other than protons and of physiological relevance transported by UCP2, a quest that is outside the scope of the present article. The second hypothesis deserves here a more in-depth discussion because a mounting body of evidence supports the uncoupling activity of UCP2 and UCP3 in certain circumstances (10Jaburek M. Varecha M.

Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In fact, the most striking evidence for the actual participation of UCP2 in the determination of the proton leakage rate of the mitochondrial inner membrane in vivo has been produced in a recent report using thymocytes (43Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this study the respiration rate of thymocytes is sensitive to retinoids, as shown with isolated yeast mitochondria (17Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), a sensitivity that is lost in the thymocytes of Ucp2(−/−) mice. This therefore points to an important discrepancy between our studies with isolated mitochondria and these experiments with living cells. Several explanations can be proposed.One possibility would be that a compensatory mechanism appeared in spleen and lung of Ucp2(−/−) mice. The experiment with LPS renders this unlikely. It could be anticipated that if the purpose of the UCP2 increase observed in Ucp2(+/+) mice was to increase proton leakage, this would have led to observable changes in the proton conductance of the inner membrane in lung mitochondria after LPS induction in the Ucp2(+/+) mice, and if the compensatory mechanism took place, also in the Ucp2(−/−) mice.Another possibility would be that the protonophoric activity of UCP2 is masked by other proton leakage pathways during these tests in vitro. In fact, it is widely accepted that many, if not all, anion carriers of the mitochondrial inner membrane are able to catalyze a net proton transport leading to partial uncoupling as soon as a process called the fatty acid cycle can occur (44Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 45Schonfeld P. Jezek P. Belyaeva E.A. Borecky J. Slyshenkov V.S. Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Eur. J.

Acta. 1997; 1319: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This uncoupling induced by hydrophobic acidic compounds shows some specificity (Ref. 47Schonfeld P. Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and Fig. 5), but its physiological relevance remains uncertain (48Wojtczak L. Schonfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These other proton leakage pathways constitute alternatives for proton conductance operating in vitro, possibly hiding the physiologically relevant ones. They also reduce the need for a specific uncoupling pathway (UCP2) in vivo and provide a multiplicity of putative compensatory mechanisms. It is interesting to remember that the effect of thyroid hormones on mitochondrial bioenergetics has been ascribed to the ADP/ATP carrier in liver (47Schonfeld P. Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and to UCP3 in muscle (49de Lange P. Lanni A. Beneduce L. Moreno M. Lombardi A. Silvestri E. Goglia F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3414-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that without the use of Ucp2(−/−) mice one would have noticed a correlation between proton leak rate or retinoic acid sensitivity and increasing amount of UCP2 (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). The influence of a given mitochondrial carrier (protein) on the inner membrane proton permeability is probably largely proportional to its expression level. The thermogenic uncoupling protein UCP1 follows this rule in brown adipocytes because it can represent up to several percent of the protein content of the mitochondrial inner membrane. In spleen and lung mitochondria, UCP2 is in fact expressed at a level that is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue (28Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.-C. Gelly C.

However, this value probably underestimated the real ratio between the UCP2 and the proton pumping machinery (respiratory chain) because mitochondrial preparations from spleen showed lower respiratory activity per mg of protein (Figs. 1, 6, and 7). Recombinant expression studies showed that under standard conditions the protonophoric activities of UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 are close (11Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 17Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 18Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Mootha V.K. Slieker L.J. Lowell B.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The amount of UCP1 is largely sufficient to lead to complete uncoupling of brown adipose tissue mitochondria, but when activators (fatty acids) are absent its activity is dramatically decreased, and when inhibitors (nucleotides) are present a complete inhibition of proton transport is observed. Therefore, given the amount of UCP2 present in spleen or lung mitochondria, one may suspect that its activity could not induce an increase of respiratory rate higher than few percent of the maximal (uncoupled) respiratory activity. Because of respiratory control this maximal activity is 3–5 times higher than the state 4 rates shown in Figs. 2, 6, and 7. Accordingly, the UCP2 activity would represent few nmol of oxygen/min/mg of protein, not much greater than error bars, and of marginal importance with respect to the other pathways that allowed the establishment of state 4 rates (40Stuart J.A.

However, putative nuclear modifier gene(s) have been proposed to regulate the phenotypic expression of this mutation. In yeast, the mutant alleles of MTO1, encoding a mitochondrial protein, manifest respiratory-deficient phenotype only when coupled with the mitochondrial 15 S rRNA PR454 mutation corresponding to human A1555G mutation. This suggests that the MTO1-like modifier gene may influence the phenotypic expression of human A1555G mutation. Here we report the identification of full-length cDNA and elucidation of genomic organization of the human MTO1 homolog. Human Mto1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that implicates a role in the mitochondrial tRNA modification. Functional conservation of this protein is supported by the observation that isolated humanMTO1 cDNA can complement the respiratory deficient phenotype of yeast mto1 cells carrying PR454 mutation. MTO1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, but with a markedly elevated expression in tissues of high metabolic rates including cochlea. These observations suggest that human MTO1 is a structural and functional homolog of yeast MTO1.

However, the nuclear background influences the phenotypic expression of pathogenic mtDNA mutations associated with human diseases. The first example is that the different nuclear backgrounds confer a marked advantage to either the A3242 mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene or the wild type mitochondrial genome (4Dunbar D.R.

The other example is that the nuclear background plays a determining role in biochemical phenotype of the deafness-associated A1555G mutation (6Guan M.X. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Attardi G. Hum. Mol.

With the aim of identifying nuclear modifier genes, the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model organism to isolate the nuclear mutations that are involved in the phenotypic manifestation of the A1555G mutation. Interestingly, it was reported that the null mutations in MSS1 or MTO1, encoding highly conserved mitochondrial proteins, express their respiratory-deficient phenotypes only when their mtDNA carry the PR454 mutation corresponding to the deafness-associated A1555G mutation. In the PR454 background, mss1 ormto1 mutants fail to synthesize subunit 1 of cytochromec oxidase (COX1), thereby leading to a respiratory-deficient phenotype (23Colby G., Wu, M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27945-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These observations strongly indicate that Mss1p or Mto1p affects the phenotypic expression of the PR454 mutation, by interacting with the region of the PR454 in mitochondrial 15 S rRNA. InE. coli, products of mnmE (homolog ofMSS1) and gidA (homolog of MTO1) have been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified nucleoside 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U34) (25Brégeon D.

This modified nucleotide, found in the wobble position of several bacterial tRNAs specific for glutamate, lysine, arginine, leucine, and glutamine, has a pivotal role in the structure and function of tRNAs, including structural stabilization, aminoacylation, and codon recognition at the decoding site of small ribosomal RNA (25Brégeon D.

On the basis of the above evidence, we have proposed that human homologMTO1 has a similar function to yeast MTO1, thereby playing a role in the phenotypic expression of deafness associated with the A1555G mutation. Thus, the isolation and characterization of the human homolog of MTO1 will be helpful to understand the pathogenic mechanism of the A1555G mutation. In the present study, we have identified and characterized the human homolog of yeast MTO1. First, we searched the NCBI human EST database to identify potential ESTs that were homologous to the yeast Mto1p. Based on the two EST sequences, we have cloned the humanMTO1 cDNA and elucidated the genomic structure of this gene. Human MTO1 has been characterized by examining the gene expression in different tissues, subcellular location, and functional complementation of yeast mto1 mutants carrying the mitochondrial PR454 allele. Human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 was used for the extraction of RNA. Human osteosarcoma cell line 143BTK− (27King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar) was used for the subcellular location experiment. Both 143BTK− and HepG2 cells were grown in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Total RNA was isolated from the human HepG2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's direction. Peptide sequence of S. cerevisiae MTO1 was subjected to a BLAST search of GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data bases and two human EST clones (GenBankTM accession no. AI074147 (np 914–1822) andBE735271 (np 308–1029)) were identified with a significant homology to yeast MTO1 open reading frame. For the amplification of 5′-terminal cDNA fragment, we used an antisense primer AGGGAGGCTTGCGACTGACCCGAAGACTG (np 1374–1402), whereas a sense primer CAGTCTTCGGGTCAGTCGCAAGCCTCCCT at same position was used for the determination of 3′ end cDNA region. The 5′ and 3′ regions of cDNA were obtained by RT-PCR. First-strand cDNA for the use as a PCR template was generated from this RNA using SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), Touch PCR was performed with Advantage-GC 2 PCR (CLONTECH). To obtain the full-length coding region of MTO1 cDNA, RT-PCR was performed by using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells as template, with primers with HindIII site: 5′-CCCAAGTGTCAGCTTCAAAGTCAGATAG-3′ (np 55–76) and 5′-CCCAAGAATTCCAGGTTCAGTTTTAGGTTC-3′ (np 2431–2453). The predominant PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently cloned into a PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing was done using a Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI PRISMTM 3700 genetic analyzer. The resultant plasmid carrying the full-length coding region of humanMTO1 cDNA was designed as pHMTO1. The Blast homology searches were performed with web-based programs available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). DNA and protein sequence alignments were carried out using the seqweb program GAP (GCG). The percentage of identical and similar amino acids was calculated. The working draft sequences from BACs AC025535 and AC068247 were assembled into a complete contiguous genomic sequence by using the Blast program to compare these sequences with each other and with the MTO1cDNA and the genomic sequences we had compiled. We closed the remaining gaps in the sequence by making PCR primers that generated products across the gaps and sequencing these products. The splice donor and acceptor site sequence of human MTO1 genomic DNA was determined as described previously (29Schneider T.D. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 189: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 30Rogan P.K. Faux B.M. Schneider T.D. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 153-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A human 8-line multiple tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane was used for this study. The pHMTO1 containing 2398-bp MTO1 cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotide at positions 55–2453 was random primer-labeled with [32P]dATP and hybridized with the RNA blots according to the manufacturer's instruction. Membranes were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 40 min. As an internal control, the human RNA blots were stripped and re-hybridized with a [32P]dATP-labeled fragment containing human actin β subunit cDNA (CLONTECH). To determine whether the MTO1 is expressed in the cochlea, PCR amplification of MTO1 cDNA was performed by using a human cochlear cDNA library (31Clark-Walker G.D. Miklos G.L.G. Genet. Res. 1974; 24: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and HepG2 cDNA as template and using primers: 5′-TGTCAGCTTCAAAGTCAGATAG-3′ (np55–76) and 5′-GGATTCTCTTTCAGCCAGCTCTCTAC-3′ (np1814–1833). The resulting PCR products were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and nucleotide sequence determination. The S. cerevisiae wild type strain used for this study was W301–1B (α,ade2-1, trp1-1, his 3-11,15,leu2-3,112, ura3-1). The mto1 strain used in this study was E39/U1 (α, ura3-1,mto1-1) (23Colby G., Wu, M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27945-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The W301–1B ρo strain was isolated by a margin of growth technique using ethidium bromide (31Clark-Walker G.D. Miklos G.L.G. Genet. Res. 1974; 24: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All yeast strains were grown in GYP medium (0.5% yeast extract (Difco; Y), 1% Bacto-Peptone (Difco; P), and 2% glucose) and GlyYP medium (0.5% yeast extract (Difco; Y), 1% Bacto-Peptone (Difco; P), and 2% glycerol). Minimal medium contains 0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base (YNB) without amino acids. This medium was supplemented with amino acids at 50 μg/ml or base at 25 μg/ml to complement auxotrophic requirements. pDB20 was used for the expression of human MTO1 in S. cerevisiae. pDB20 is a URA3 and ADH1promoter-based yeast expression vector (32Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). pDB20-HMTO1 was constructed to by inserting full-length coding region of humanMTO1 cDNA (pHMTO1) at HindIII site of pDB20. To determine whether the N-terminal targeting sequence is essential for the function, a human cDNA lacking the N-terminal sequence was obtained by PCR amplification using the pHMTO1 as the template. For this purpose, the antisense primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTCAGATGTCATGTAATCCTTC-3′ (np 309–329) and sense primer 5′-CCCAAGAATTCCAGGTTCAGTTTTAGGTTC-3′ (np 2431–2453) were designed for PCR amplification. The PCR product (2114 bp) was cloned into a PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequence determination, the insert was subsequently subcloned into pDB20 to generate pDB20-HMTO1–2. These constructs were transformed into themto1 strain of S. cerevisiae E39/U1 by the method of Schestl and Gietz (33Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The Ura3+ transformants were selected at 30 °C on minimal glucose medium. The transformants were then replica-plated on GYP and GlyYP plates, which were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. Colonies growing on GlyYP medium were subjected to further analysis. A humanMTO1 cDNA lacking its natural stop codon was obtained by PCR using the pHMTO1 as template. The antisense primer 5′-CCCAAGTGTCAGCTTCAAAGTCAGATAG-3′ (np 55–76) with aHindIII site and sense primer 5′-GGATTCTCTTTCAGCCAGCTCTCTAC-3′ (np 1814–1833) with an engineered HindIII site immediately upstream of the natural stop code were used for the PCR amplification. The PCR products were firstly cloned into PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequence determination, the insert was subsequently subcloned into the expression vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The resultant constructs were transfected into 143B cells using SuperFectTM transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 h. The chamber slides were then washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X-100 plus PBS for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with mouse anti-human COX1, Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (10 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) and rabbit anti-GFP, IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (4 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) in 5% normal goat serum plus PBS at 37 °C for 2 h. The chamber slides were then viewed under a Zeiss confocal fluorescence microscope. S. cerevisiae Mto1p sequence was subjected to a BLAST search of the NCBI/GenBankTM human EST data base. Two ESTs derived from human kidney (GenBankTM accession no.AI074147) and placenta (GenBankTM accession no. BE735271) were identified with significant homology to the N and C termini ofS. cerevisiae MTO1 open reading frame (Fig.2A), respectively. Based on the sequence of the cDNA identified by a search of the human EST data base, we designed primers to isolate and characterize the full-length coding region of human MTO1 and also examine the noncoding 5′ and 3′ region of the mRNA. Using total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells as the template, a cDNA that containing an open reading frame of 1,856 bp has been identified. This cDNA encodes a protein of 692 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 77,293 daltons. To investigate the 5′ sequence of the humanMTO1 transcript, we performed 5′-RACE amplification of cDNA ends using total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells. Through 5′-RACE amplification of cDNA ends, four clones with identical sequences were obtained. The cDNA fragment contains seven ATG codons. Assuming the first ATG to be the initiation codon, the 5′-untranslated region consists of 90 bp (Fig. 2B). However, through 3′-RACE amplification of cDNA ends, five different clones with various lengths were obtained. Four of these clones share identical 3′ untranslated region, whereas the 3′-untranslated region of clone 5 extends additional 356 bp. Using the primers homologous to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA, a full-length MTO1 cDNA with 2,537 bp has been isolated and deposited in GenBankTM(accession no. AF319422). As shown in Fig. 2B, four other transcripts, which are likely splice variants with 2,612 bp (isoform II), 2,627 bp (isoform III), 2,246 bp (isoform IV), and 2,961 bp (isoform V), have been obtained, and their cDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBankTM (accession nos. AY078985, AF469111,AF469110, and AY078986, respectively). We used the humanMTO1 cDNA sequence as a query to search available EMBO/GenBankTM High Throughout Genome data base. This search has led to the identification of working draft sequences of two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (AC025535 and AC068247), each containing partial genomic MTO1 sequence (Fig.3B). To define the actual intron-exon genomic organization of the human MTO1 gene, we used single site PCR to obtain and sequence genomic fragments spanning the predicted exon-intron junctions, used long range genomic PCR to estimate the size of each intron, and subsequently sequenced the PCR products. We have used these BAC sequence data in conjunction with our sequence data to assemble a 41-kb genomic sequence from theMTO1 region of chromosome 6. Fig. 3A revealed that the MTO1 gene is composed of 12 exons, which range from 118 to 522 bp in size, and 11 introns varying from 92 bp (intron 5) to 9,614 bp (intron 9). Additionally, a putative polyadenylation signal (AATTAAA; np 2510–2516) and a poly(A) were observed. The intron-exon junctions and polyadenylation signals are shown in TableI. The complete nucleotide sequence ofMTO1 gene has been deposited in GenBankTM(accession no. AF442963). Furthermore, we have assembled the sequence of other four transcripts. As shown in Fig. 3C, these transcripts are caused by the alternative splicing. The insertion exon 6A (75 bp) of isoforms II and V produces a protein product of 717 amino acids, whereas isoform V contains exon 12A. The isoform IV skipping the exon 4 resulted in a protein of 595 amino acids, whereas the retention of intron 5 led to a shorting protein with 312 amino acids in isoform III. The genomic organization of these MTO1 transcripts derived from these data is summarized in Fig. 3C. Isoforms II, IV, and V may be of special interest, as they comprise in-frame insertion or deletion.Table ISplice donor, splice acceptor, and poly(A) site for human MTO1 transcriptView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The protein alignments of humanMTO1 with other identified MTO1 homologs, including Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, S. cerevisiae (23Colby G., Wu, M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27945-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and E. coli (34Walker J.E. Gay N.J. Saraste M. Eberle A.N. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 799-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), revealed an extensive conservation of amino acid sequences (Fig. 4). In particular, the identity of the overall predicated amino acid sequences of human Mto1 with homologs of S. cerevisiae, M. musculus, C. elegans, S. pombe, and E. coli is 49, 87, 53, 46, and 49%, respectively, whereas the similarity is 59, 90, 61, 55, and 58%, respectively. Like the yeast homolog, the human MTO1 protein contains the typical features of mitochondrial target sequence with regularly spaced basic, hydroxylated, and hydrophobic residues (35Hartl F.U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The Mitoprot program (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/medgen/mitop) predicts with a high probability that human MTO1 protein localizes to mitochondrion. This protein belongs to the GIDA family, which has been shown to be involved in tRNA modification (25Brégeon D. Colot V. Miroslav M. Radman M. Taddei F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Björk G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low B.K. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 861-886Google Scholar). From these data, the high sequence conservation between the human and S. cerevisiae suggests that they appear to be structural homologs and leads us to test in yeast whether the human protein can complement the characterized function of yeast protein. To examine the functional conservation of the humanMTO1, we tested its ability to complement the respiratory defect of the yeast mto1 mutant carrying the PR454 allele of mitochondrial 15 S rRNA gene. First, the entire coding region of human MTO1 cDNA was cloned into an expression vector pDB20, designed as pDB20-HMTO1. To test whether the putative mitochondrial targeting sequence is essential for the function of MTO1, we also constructed a plasmid pDB20-HMTO1–2 containing a 2.1-kb human MTO1 cDNA lacking N-terminal sequence. These constructs were then transformed into a yeast mto1 strain E39/U1 carrying the mitochondrial PR454 allele, and resultant transformants were tested for their growth on glycerol-rich medium. As illustrated in Fig.5, the growth defect of themto1 mutant on glycerol medium was restored by the entire coding region of human MTO1 cDNA (pDB20-HMTO1) but not by the cDNA lacking N-terminal sequence (pDB20-HMTO1–2). These data suggest that human MTO1 is able to functionally complement the yeast mto1 mutation and N-terminal targeting sequence is essential for the function of MTO1. These results strongly indicated that human MTO1 is the functional homolog of yeast MTO1. We investigated the tissue-specific expression of MTO1 in a number of human tissues. The32P-labeled MTO1 probe detected an mRNA of ∼2.6 kb, in good agreement with the length of the cDNA (2537 bp).MTO1 is ubiquitously expressed, but there are significant variations in steady-state MTO1 mRNA levels among tissues (Fig. 6). In particular, the expression in the brain and lung appears low compared with other tissues with high metabolic rates such as liver and skeletal muscle, kidney, and heart. In addition, an mRNA with ∼4.0 kb appears in the liver and skeletal muscle, indicating that this RNA may be additional isoform of MTO1 in these tissues. To examine if the human MTO1 gene is expressed in the cochlea, we performed the PCR amplification of MTO1 cDNA using the human cochlear cDNA library (36Skvorak A.B. Weng Z. Yee A.J. Robertson N.G. Morton C.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as template. As shown in Fig.6C, the size of PCR fragment derived from cochlear cDNA library is identical to that amplified from HepG2 RNA. The nucleotide sequence analysis of these fragments confirmed that this PCR product is indeed MTO1 cDNA, suggesting that the"

It represents a family of enzymes, including the histo blood group A and B transferases, that catalyze retaining glycosyltransfer reactions of unknown mechanism. An initial study of α3GT in a crystal form with limited resolution and considerable disorder suggested the possible formation of a β-galactosyl-enzyme covalent intermediate (Gastinel, L. N., Bignon, C., Misra, A. K., Hindsgaul, O., Shaper, J. H., and Joziasse, D. H. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 638–649). Highly ordered structures are described for complexes of α3GT with donor substrate, UDP-galactose, UDP- glucose, and two acceptor substrates, lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, at resolutions up to 1.46 Å. Structural and calorimetric binding studies suggest an obligatory ordered binding of donor and acceptor substrates, linked to a donor substrate-induced conformational change, and the direct participation of UDP in acceptor binding. The monosaccharide-UDP bond is cleaved in the structures containing UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, producing non-covalent complexes containing buried β-galactose and α-glucose. The location of these monosaccharides and molecular modeling suggest that binding of a distorted conformation of UDP-galactose may be important in the catalytic mechanism of α3GT.

Their importance is highlighted by the recognition that several genes that control developmental processes encode glycosyltransferases (GTs)1that catalyze steps in glycoconjugate processing (1Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although GTs catalyze chemically similar reactions in which a monosaccharide is transferred from an activated derivative, such as a UDP-sugar, to an acceptor, few are significantly similar in primary structure. Nevertheless, families of homologous GTs have been identified that are related in sequence and catalyze analogous reactions (2Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); these appear to merge into larger groups that have similar three-dimensional structures and share conserved sequence motifs (2Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Two major subgroups of GTs are those that catalyze reactions in which the anomeric configuration of the transferred monosaccharide is inverted and those in which the configuration is retained. Previously, the three-dimensional structures of four eukaryotic glycosyltransferases from different families have been determined: three inverting transferases, UDP-galactose β-N-acetylglucosaminide β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (4Gastinel L.N.

This enzyme is expressed in many mammalian species, including most primates and New World monkeys, but is absent from humans, apes, and Old World monkeys (10Galili U. Shohet S.B. Kobrin E. Stults C.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17755-17762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because of the mutational inactivation of the gene (11Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Humans do not have galactosyl α-1,3-galactosyl β-OR structures (here R is a glycoconjugate of variable structure) on glycoconjugates and produce large amounts of antibody to this structure, the α-Gal epitope, amounting to about 1% of the circulating IgG. The production of this endogenous antibody results from exposure to intestinal bacteria and other antigens (12Galili U. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1993; 15: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). α3GT is of medical interest because immune responses to selected cellular targets are enhanced when they are decorated with galactosyl α-1,3-galactosyl structures and retroviruses become sensitive to human serum when produced by cells expressing α3GT (13Takeuchi Y.

Structurally and mechanistically α3GT is a model for several homologous glycosyltransferases that differ in donor and acceptor substrate specificity, including the histo blood group A and B glycosyltransferases (17Yamamoto F.-I.

Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of α3GT in complex with UMP and Hg·UDP-galactose at 2.3- and 2.5-Å resolution, respectively, in a tetragonal space group (form I) were published initially by Gastinel and co-workers (8Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas we have recently reported the structure of a UDP complex in a different crystal form (monoclinic space group, form II) at 1.53-Å resolution (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The higher resolution structure exhibits a distinct and highly ordered conformation for the C-terminal region of the molecule that mutational studies show to be important for catalysis (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we describe the structures of α3GT complexed with Mn2+/UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), Mn2+/UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), as well as with both Mn2+/UDP and the acceptor substrates lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, all in the monoclinic crystal form (form II), see Table I. Although the two UDP-sugars are cleaved in the enzyme complex, both monosaccharides remain bound in a solvent-inaccessible location in the active site. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis shows that Mn2+ is required for binding donor substrate analogues and that UDP is required for binding acceptor substrate, indicating that donor and acceptor substrates bind in an obligatory ordered manner to the enzyme. This is supported by the present structures of α3GT complexes containing acceptors. The implications of these results and docking studies with different conformations of UDP-galactose are discussed in relation to the mechanism of the retaining reaction catalyzed by α3GT.Table IStatistics for data collection and refinementLigand N-Acetyl-lactosamineLactoseUDP-galactoseUDP-glucoseCocrystallization conditions10 mm UDP10 mm UDP10 mm UDP-Gal10 mm UDPSoaking conditions50 mm for 24 h100 mm for 3 weeks20 mm for 6 h50 mm for 2 daysWavelength used for data collection (Å)0.871.4881.4881.488Resolution range (Å)40.0–1.4639.0–2.524.0–1.820.0–1.8Space groupP21 (2 mol/a.u.)P21 (2 mol/a.u.)P21 (2 mol/a.u.)P21 (2 mol/a.u.)Cell dimensions (Å) a = 45.63, b = 95.24, c = 95.64, β = 99.09° a = 45.02, b = 93.98, c = 94.68, β = 99.05° a = 45.06, b = 94.28, c = 94.36, β = 99.09° a = 45.16, b = 94.37, c = 94.76, β = 99.4°Number of observations479,90182,283280,613236,674Number of unique reflections132,38227,03672,09865,613Completeness (%)94.8 (71.7)1-aOutermost shell is 1.51–1.46 Å.95.3 (86.7)1-bOutermost shell is 2.59–2.5 Å.95.9 (88.8)1-cOutermost shell is 1.86–1.80 Å.90.5 (84.8)1-cOutermost shell is 1.86–1.80 Å.

Open table in a new tab The catalytic domain of bovine α3GT (residues 80–368) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6) in 50% glycerol. Crystals were grown at 16 °C by the vapor diffusion, hanging drop method as described previously (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by mixing 2 μl of the protein at 5 mg/ml in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, containing 10 mm UDP and 0.1 mm MnCl2, with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 5% PEG 6000 and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Single crystals appeared after 1–3 days. The α3GT-N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc), lactose (Lac), and UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) complexes were obtained by soaking the native crystals prior to data collection with a 50–100 mmsolution in the crystallization buffer as detailed below in Table I. Co-crystals of the α3GT-UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) complex were obtained by growing the crystals in the presence of UDP-Gal. In these experiments the protein was diluted in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, containing 10 mm UDP-Gal and 0.1 mm MnCl2 and mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization buffer containing 5% PEG 6000 and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Single crystals belonging to the P21 monoclinic space group (isomorphous with the native crystals) appeared after 3 days. Before data collection, all crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K in a cryoprotectant containing 10% PEG 6000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, and appropriate ligands. High resolution data sets (space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit) for the four complexes, LacNAc (1.46 Å), Lac (2.5 Å), UDP-Gal (1.8 Å), and UDP-Glc (1.8 Å), were collected at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury, UK (station PX9.6, using an Area Detector Systems Corp. detector system for Lac, UDP-Gal, and UDP-Glc complexes and for the LacNAc complex station PX 14.1 with an MAR 345 image plate system). Raw data images were indexed and scaled using the DENZO and SCALEPACK modules of the HKL suite (Ref. 21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar, see Table I). Because the cell dimensions for all the complex data sets were isomorphous with the previously determined α3GT·UDP structure (form II (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank entry 1K4V) (Table I), these coordinates were used as a starting model. Crystallographic refinement was performed using the program package CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Several rounds of bulk solvent correction, energy minimization, individual B-factor refinement, simulated annealing, and model building using the “O” program (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) were performed until the R freevalue could not be improved. Water molecules were gradually included into the model at positions corresponding to peaks in the ‖F o ‖ − ‖F c ‖ electron density map with heights greater than 3ς and at H-bond distance from appropriate atoms. Waters with a temperature factor higher than 65 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement steps. For the LacNAc complex structure at 1.46 Å, further refinement was carried out using SHELXL-97 (24Shedrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Initial conjugate gradient least squares refinement in SHELXL was carried out restraining all the 1,2- and 1,3-distances with the Engh and Huber (25Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) restraints. Initially all the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) were kept isotropic. The R free value after isotropic refinement of the ADPs was 0.24, and R crystcould not be refined beyond 0.23. The data to parameter ratio, >2, enabled us to carry out anisotropic refinement on ADPs that reduced both R-factors by at least 4.5% thereby justifying the use of this method of refinement. All the alternate conformations were added after initial anisotropic refinement. Any new atoms added to the molecule were isotropically refined for at least two cycles before they were refined anisotropically. The multiple conformation site occupation factors were refined constraining their sum to be unity. The average anisotropy value of 0.38 is between accepted values for structure refined at 1.5 Å and at borderline between isotropic and anisotropic refinement. Analysis of the Ramachandran (ϕ-ψ) plot showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions for all the refined structures. The final refinement statistics are included in TableI. The thermodynamics of binding of inhibitors and substrates to α3GT and mutants were characterized using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc.) at 30 °C. The enzyme was dialyzed extensively against 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 10% glycerol and degassed prior to use. Enzyme solution (1.4 ml, 25–40 μm) was titrated with 25–30 additions of ligand (8 μl each). For the titrations with UDP (2 mm each) and UDP-glucose (5 mm), 2 mm MnCl2 was included in the enzyme and ligand solutions, and for titrations with lactose (100 mm) or N-acetyllactosamine (10 mm), 2 mm MnCl2 was present in the enzyme solution with or without UDP (2 mm). Each injection of ligand lasted 16 s with 120-s intervals between successive injections. During the titration, the enzyme was stirred continuously at 200 rpm. Heats of binding were determined by integrating the signal from the calorimeter. The heat of dilution of the ligand was measured separately in a similar experiment in which the solution in the calorimeter cell was devoid of enzyme. The binding isotherm was generated by plotting the corrected heats of binding against the ratio of ligand to enzyme. Software supplied by the manufacturer (Origin version 5.0 from Microcal Inc.) was used to calculate dissociation constants (K d ), enthalpies of binding (ΔH), stoichiometry (N), and entropy of binding (ΔS). The UDP-Gal·enzyme complex was prepared by co-crystallization, and the UDP-Glc complex was prepared by soaking crystals initially grown in the presence of UDP with UDP-Glc, yet the structures are closely similar to each other and to the α3GT·Mn2+·UDP complex. The refined structures of both complexes show clearly that the UDP-sugar bond has been cleaved. It appears that a β-linked OH group attached to C1 of the pyranose ring of galactose and an α-linked OH group is present on the glucose. A composite structure of α3GT showing the locations of the bound UDP and galactose together with the metal co-factor and acceptor is shown in Fig. 1. Fig.2 (E–H) shows the electron density maps and interactions of β-galactose and α-glucose. The quality of the electron density maps for β-galactose and α-glucose is poor. In both cases given the high resolution (1.8 Å) suggests disordered binding and/or partial occupancy for the sugars. This disorder may be caused by the presence of more than one conformation for these sugars. However, in the present analysis we have attempted to fit the predominant conformation as seen in the 2‖F o ‖ − ‖F c ‖ electron density omit maps. In each complex, the UDP moiety is bound very similarly to that in the previously described enzyme·Mn2+·UDP complex (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), i.e. through direct interactions of the uracil with Phe134 and Val136 at the C terminus of the β2 strand, stacking interactions with Tyr139 and through direct and Mn2+-mediated interactions of the Asp225-Val-Asp227 motif, located between strands β5 and β6, with the ribose and both phosphates. Lys359 and Tyr361 of the flexible C terminus also interact with the β-phosphate, whereas Arg365 of this region and Tyr139 at the N terminus of helix α3 also interact with the α-phosphate. The galactose is bound through H-bonds with backbone and side-chain groups of the enzyme, and hydrophobic interactions with protein groups and UDP (TableII). Glucose forms more H-bonds with solvent molecules (four versus one) and with UDP (threeversus one) than galactose but has a similar number of hydrophobic contacts.Figure 2A, C, E, andG: diagrams of the ‖F o ‖ − ‖F c ‖ electron density omit map, contoured at 3.0-ς level, of LacNAc (1.46 Å), Lac (2.5 Å), β-Gal (1.8 Å), and α-Glc (1.8 Å), respectively.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows that the UDP and β-galactose are essentially inaccessible to solvent in their complex with α3GT; this is also the case for UDP and α-glucose. We have generated a model for the ligand-free form of α3GT from the structure of the UDP complex (9Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by molecular dynamics and energy minimization. This shows little change in the structure of the main body of the enzyme, but the C-terminal region (residues 358–368) has undergone a major rearrangement to a structure in which it projects into the solvent. This model suggests that the binding of UDP stabilizes a conformational change in the C terminus through interactions with Lys359, Tyr361, and Arg365 to produce the solvent-inaccessible binding site. The form I structure reported by Gastinel and co-workers (8Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) indicates that the binding site is only partially structured in the presence of UMP and that the more ordered structure in the form II conformation depends on interactions between the C terminus and the second phosphate. The LacNAc complex is at the highest resolution of any currently known α3GT structure (1.46 Å); the complex with lactose has a lower resolution (Fig. 2, A–D). The structures of the bound forms of the two acceptor substrates are essentially superimposable, but for the presence of an acetamido group on C2′ of LacNAc, in place of the hydroxyl of lactose, which packs against Trp250 (Fig. 4). Both acceptors are bound through interactions that are similar to those observed in previously described protein·carbohydrate complexes (26Drickamer K. Structure. 1997; 5: 465-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All hydroxyl groups of the two pyranose rings of the acceptors engage in H-bonds with side-chain groups of the enzyme or with solvent molecules (Table III) while several aromatic side-chains form H-bonds and non-polar interactions. Tryptophans 249, 250, 314, and 356 (also Tyr278) make the majority of non-polar van der Waals contacts (stacking interactions) with the two pyranose rings, particularly the primed monosaccharide. UDP also interacts with the unprimed monosaccharide, forming an H-bond with the 3-hydroxyl group (to which the α-galactosyl moiety is transferred during catalysis) and non-polar contacts with both acceptors. In contrast to the binding site for the donor substrate, the acceptor binding site is largely solvent-accessible (Fig. 3) as reflected in the considerable number of H-bonding interactions with water molecules (Table III).Table IIIHydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions in α3GT acceptor complexesHydrogen bond ligand atom, LacNAcInteracting atomsDistanceLigand atom, LacInteracting atomsDistance Å ÅO2Wat1482.72O2Wat112.95O2Wat453.13O2Wat132.83O3Wat2962.39O3Wat1873.29O3UDP O2 PB2.64O3UDP O2 PB2.71O3Wat452.89O3Wat112.85O3Wat3353.22O3UDP O1 PB3.30O4Gln 247 Nε23.01O4Gln247 Nε22.78O4Glu 317 Oε12.75O4Glu317 Oε12.69O4Wat2962.87O5Gln247Nε23.10O5Gln247 Nε23.03O6Wat1692.51O6Wat692.79O6Thr259 Oγ12.93O6Thr259Oγ12.86O6Trp314 Nγ13.20O1′Wat6452.78O1′Wat192.73O1′Wat6423.26O3′Trp250Nε13.04O3′Trp250 Nε12.94O3′Wat1692.90O3′Wat693.29O5′Wat7773.19O5′Wat6423.28O6′Wat3362.51O6′Wat2002.68O6′Wat7773.01O6′Wat6533.08O7′Wat4762.88Hydrophobic interactions3-aThese residues have several atoms that are between 3.0 and 4.1 Å from the ligand atoms.Gln2478 contactsGln2479 contactsTrp249>10 contactsTrp24910 contactsTrp2509 contactsTrp2507 contactsThr2593 contactsThr2593 contactsTyr2782 contactsTyr2782 contactsHis2803 contactsTrp314>10 contactsTrp314>10 contactsGlu3175 contactsGlu3173 contactsTrp3566 contactsTrp3567 contactsLys3592 contactsLys3592 contactsUDP (PB)3 contactsUDP (PB)2 contacts3-a These residues have several atoms that are between 3.0 and 4.1 Å from the ligand atoms.

https://openalex.org/W2039682099,"Nectins form a family of integral molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Their ectodomain is made of three Ig-like domains (V, C, C). This family comprises at least five members, namely nectin1, -2, -3, -4, and poliovirus receptor (PVR), that are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. (i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or α-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca2+-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomaintrans-interactions. We have described a nectintrans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the differenttrans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that theKD of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas theKD of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 μm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4trans-hetero-interactions were mediated throughtrans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding. Finally, using chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors where PVR V domain β-strands were substituted with the corresponding regions of nectin1, the nectin3 and nectin4 minimal binding region on nectin1 V domain was mapped to the C-C′-C“-D β-strands. Nectins form a family of integral molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Their ectodomain is made of three Ig-like domains (V, C, C). This family comprises at least five members, namely nectin1, -2, -3, -4, and poliovirus receptor (PVR), that are involved in different physiological and pathological processes. (i) Nectins are adhesion molecules localized at adherens junctions in epithelial cells. (ii) Some nectins act as poliovirus or α-herpesvirus receptors (nectin1). (iii) Nectin1 mutations are involved in orofacial developmental abnormalities in humans. Adhesion properties of nectins are mediated by Ca2+-independent homophilic and heterophilic processes through ectodomaintrans-interactions. We have described a nectintrans-hetero-interaction network: nectin3 binds to nectin1, nectin2, and PVR; nectin1 also binds to nectin4. In the present study we compared the affinities of the differenttrans-interactions mediated by nectin1. We found that theKD of nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas theKD of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 μm. We show that nectin1/nectin3 and nectin1/nectin4trans-hetero-interactions were mediated throughtrans V to V domain interactions, whereas C domains contributed to increase the affinity of the interaction. Nectin3 and nectin4 share a common binding region in the nectin1 V domain: (i) nectin3 strongly competed with nectin4 binding, (ii) nectin3 and nectin4 binding to nectin1 was reduced by a number of monoclonal antibodies directed against the nectin1 V domain, and (iii) the glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus-1 that binds to the V domain of nectin1 reduced nectin3 and nectin4 binding. Finally, using chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors where PVR V domain β-strands were substituted with the corresponding regions of nectin1, the nectin3 and nectin4 minimal binding region on nectin1 V domain was mapped to the C-C′-C“-D β-strands. poliovirus receptor poliovirus receptor-related herpes simplex virus monoclonal antibody glycoprotein D Madin-Darby canine kidney fluorescence-activated cell sorting fluorescence level intensity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2,2′- azinobis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt Adhesion molecules play a fundamental role in regulating a number of physiological processes that govern cellular functions and tissue organization. They act by mediating cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions via their extracellular domains. They are usually anchored to the plasma membrane through tight interactions with components of the cytoskeletal architecture and of cellular signaling. Recently a new family of adhesion molecules, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is related to the poliovirus receptor (PVR),1 has emerged and has been named nectin/PRR (poliovirus receptor-related). This family comprises at least five different members identified both in humans and rodents: nectin/PRR1, -2, -3, -4, and PVR (1Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R.

Members of the nectin family carry an ectodomain made of three immunoglobulin-like domains of V, C, C types that share identities ranging from 30 to 55%. Alternative splicing originates different isoforms with long, short, or no cytoplasmic tail (for review, see Refs. 11Campadelli-Fiume G. Cocchi F. Menotti L. Lopez M. Rev. Med.

Nectin1 (also named herpes immunoglobulin-like receptor (β isoform) or herpesvirus entry mediator C (α isoform)) represents the major HSV receptor because it serves as receptor for all the HSV1 and -2 strains tested, and beyond its role for entry of free virions, it enables cell to cell spread of virus (14Cocchi F.

Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which nectins are stabilized at adherens junctions remain unclear. Nectins interact with the scaffold molecule afadin (4Reymond N. Borg J.P. Lecocq E. Adelaide J.

In turn, afadin binds F-actin and thus links nectin to F-actin. However, this interaction does not seem to be the only prerequisite for nectin localization as some nectin isoforms (nectin1β and PVRα) that lack the C-terminal motif still localize at adherens junctions (22Ohka S. Ohno H. Tohyama K. Nomoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2N. Reymond, unpublished results. As exemplified by PVRα, the μ1B subunit of the adaptor complex AP-1B binds a tyrosine-based motif located in the cytosolic domain of the molecule and promotes the basolateral sorting of the molecule (22Ohka S. Ohno H. Tohyama K. Nomoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Different reports demonstrate that nectins are Ca2+-independent homophilic adhesion molecules and that this property contributes in part to their specific localization at cell to cell adherens junctions (5Reymond N.

Altogether these data point to multiple mechanisms that contribute to nectin localization and hence to their functions. Recently a new feature in nectintrans-interactions has emerged: nectins display heterophilic adhesion properties and bind in trans with other members of the family. These trans-hetero-interactions have been described between nectin3 and nectin1 and also between nectin3 and nectin2 both in murine and in human cells (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M.

Thetrans-hetero-interactions appear to also involve other members of the nectin family, described as a nectintrans-hetero-interaction network. Nectin1, nectin2, and PVR ectodomains interact with nectin3 ectodomain. Nectin4 ectodomain interacts with nectin1 ectodomain (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Nectin1trans-interactions are mediated by its V domain inasmuch as a soluble nectin1 V domain lacking the two C domains readily binds nectin4 and nectin3. The distal V domain of nectin1 plays a central role not only in homophilic and heterophilic trans-interactions but also in the interaction with the envelope glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV, pseudorabies virus, and bovine herpes virus-1 (25Cocchi F.

Recent studies based on monoclonal antibody (mAb) competition or chimeric nectin1/PVR molecules identified the C-C′-C“ β-strands and intervening loops of the nectin1 V domain as the gD binding site. The A, B, D, E, F, and G β-strands do not appear to play any role in HSV entry (27Krummenacher C. Baribaud I. Ponce de Leon M. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7987-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which nectin1 mediates heterophilic interactions with nectin3 and nectin4 andtrans-homophilic interactions with nectin1. Using different approaches, we found the following. (i) The KD of nectin3/nectin1 and nectin4/nectin1 interactions is 1 and 100 nm, respectively, whereas the KD of the nectin1-mediated homophilic interaction is 1 μm. (ii) Nectin3 and nectin4 bound to a similar conformational region on nectin1 V domain, formed by C-C′-C”-D β-strands. (iii) In turn, nectin3 and nectin4 bound nectin1 through their V domains. (iv) The C domains of nectin3 and nectin4 contributed to increase the binding affinity of thetrans-interaction with nectin1. (v) A soluble recombinant form of gD that binds to the C-C′-C“ β-strands interfered with the binding of nectin3 and nectin4 to nectin1. Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells (MDCKII cells) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were cultivated in an air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at constant humidity. Cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Chimeric primers overlapping the nectin1 and PVR sequences to be joined were synthesized both as sense and antisense. They were used separately with appropriate 5′ and 3′ primers to generate two fragments, one N-terminal and one C-terminal. The N-terminal and the C-terminal fragments were then mixed in equimolar amounts and joined through a polymerization reaction (20–25 cycles of denaturation-annealing-extension), which exploited the complementarity of the chimeric primer and the ability of the fragments to act both as primer and template for each other. The chimeras were cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced for accuracy. Primer sequences were listed in a previous report (28Cocchi F. Lopez M. Dubreuil P. Campadelli Fiume G. Menotti L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7987-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) except for the N1-(77–102) chimera that was produced especially for this study. The N-terminal fragment was amplified with primer PVR5Nhe (GATT GCTA GCAT GGCC CGAG CCAT GGCC GCCG CGTG) and primer Mut10rev (CCTC AGCG AGGC ATTC CGCA GCTC GGGC CGCA GGAA TTCC ACAC GCTC). The C-terminal fragment was obtained with primer Mut10forw (antisense from Mut10rev) and primer PVR3Hind (ATTA AAGC TTCA CCTT GTGC CCTC TGTC TGTG G). The final product was obtained with primer PVR5Nhe and PVR3Hind. MDCKII cells (2 × 105) were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes. After 12 h of incubation, cells were transfected with 2 μg of the appropriate cDNA expression plasmids by using FuGENETM 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were cultivated for 1 day, and the medium was replaced. Cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 to establish stable transfectants and sorted to get cells expressing an equal amount of receptor at the cell surface. The nectin1, -1V, -2, -3, -3V, -4, -4V, and PVR ectodomains were fused to the Fc fragment of the human IgG1. Most of these constructions and productions have already been described (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The V domain of nectin3 (residues 1–167) was amplified with primer SB53.5 (CAAG AATT CATG GCGC GGAC CCTG CGGC CGTC CCCG) and primer SBR3V.3 (CTTG GTAC CTAA CACA GTTA CAGT TGTG AGGG). The V domain of nectin4 (residues 1–141) was amplified with primer R4S (GCGA ATTC ATGC CCCT GTCC CTGG GAGC CGAG ATG) and primer SBR4V.AS (GCGG TACC CACT CGGA GCCG CAGC CGCG CCTG G). Both PCR products were cloned inEcoRI/KpnI sites of the COS Fc Link (CFL) vector (SmithKline Beecham) and transfected in COS cells with FuGENETM 6. The proteins were purified from supernatants on Affi-Gel protein A. Purification was controlled by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). CD28-Fc and TNF-R2-Fc (TR2-Fc) proteins were used as negative controls (SmithKline Beecham). The mAbs R1.302, CK6, and CK8 directed to the V domain of hNectin1 were described previously (25Cocchi F.

Ponce de Leon M. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10863-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The anti-PVR antibody PV.404 was described previously (28Cocchi F. Lopez M. Dubreuil P. Campadelli Fiume G. Menotti L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7987-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The anti-nectin4 mAbs were obtained by immunization of mice with soluble nectin4-Fc. Two positive clones (N4.40 and N4.61) were isolated by screening hybridoma supernatants on nectin4-expressing MDCKII cells. Cell surface expression was measured on different MDCKII transfectants using saturating concentration of mAbs R1.302, PV.404, N4.40, and N4.61 revealed by incubation with a phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Immunotech). Analysis of soluble nectin-Fc binding (4 × 10−7m) on MDCK cells was carried out at +4 °C for 60 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum, and specific binding was revealed after incubation with a phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-human IgG Fc fragment antibody (Immunotech). In blocking experiments with either mAbs or nectin-Fc, biotinylated nectin-Fc was used, and binding was revealed with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (Immunotech). In Fig. 7, we calculated the binding of the nectin-Fc relative to the cell surface expression level of the target nectin: Binding factor = (MFI Nectin-Fc − MFI TR2-Fc)/(MFI mAb R1.302 − MFI IgG1), where MFI is mean fluorescence intensity. Interaction between denatured forms of nectin1-Fc and mAbs or nectin3-Fc and nectin4-Fc was done as follows. 10 ng of nectin-Fc was heated in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, semidry-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Boston, MA), probed with a 1 μg/ml concentration of the indicated nectin-Fc or antibodies, and visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to define the region of nectin4 recognized by the anti-nectin4 mAbs N4.40 and N4.61. Ninety-six-well trays were coated with an antibody against the human Fc fragment (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml. After saturation of wells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 10−9m nectin4-Fc or nectin4V-Fc was incubated with 2.5 μg/ml biotinylated mAbs followed by streptavidin-peroxidase and One Step ABTS (Pierce). Optical density was read at 405 nm. Nectins were first described as homophilic adhesion molecules both in human and murine cells (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J.

Ectopic expression of nectin1, -2, -3, and -4 leads to a specific localization at cell to cell junctions and to cell aggregation in vitro. In a recent report we characterized the nectin trans-hetero-interaction network between all the known nectins (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We described nectin3/nectin2, nectin3/PVR, nectin3/nectin1, and nectin4/nectin1trans-hetero-interactions (5Reymond N. Fabre S. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43205-43215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the affinity of trans-hetero-interactions between nectin3/nectin1 and nectin4/nectin1 as compared with the affinity of nectin1/nectin1 and gD/nectin1 interactions. For this purpose we used different forms of soluble nectins fused to the Fc fragment of the human IgG1 and produced as dimers. Soluble dimeric nectins are thought to mimiccis-dimerization, which is a common characteristic in nectin physiology. The soluble receptors were purified by affinity chromatography to protein A, and their purity was checked by electrophoresis under reducing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Binding of serial dilutions of nectin3-Fc and nectin4-Fc to nectin1-expressing MDCKII (MDCK-N1) cells showed a marked difference (Fig. 2). Binding of nectin3-Fc was saturable at a concentration of 7 nm, whereas in the case of nectin4-Fc saturation was achieved at a higher concentration (250 nm). The apparent affinity, based on half-maximal binding, was higher for nectin3 binding to nectin1 (KD = 1 nm) as compared with nectin4 binding to nectin1 (KD = 100 nm). Under the same conditions, binding of gD(Δ290–299t) to nectin1 was saturable at 40 nm with KD = 3 nm (Fig. 2). These results are in accordance with previously described gD/nectin1 affinity (saturation at 70 nm and KD = 3 nm, Ref. 29Krummenacher C. Nicola A.V. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Hou W. Lambris J.D. Geraghty R.J. Spear P.G. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) determined by ELISA. In addition we determined the apparent affinity for nectin1 homophilic interaction and found that KD = 1 μm. These results highlight important differences between nectintrans-interaction affinities: we demonstrate here that homophilic interaction affinity is low. We observed that nectin3/nectin1 affinity was higher than that of nectin4/nectin1. This prompted us to carry out competitive experiments between nectin3-Fc and nectin4-Fc binding to MDCK-N1 cells. Whereas both nectins readily bound to MDCK-N1 cells (Fig. 3), preincubation of nectin3-Fc with MDCK-N1 cells inhibited by 79% the binding of nectin4-Fc (Fig. 3, right). Preincubation of nectin4-Fc did not inhibit nectin3-Fc binding to nectin1 (Fig. 3, left). Under these conditions, we controlled the level of cell surface-bound nectin4-Fc after nectin3-Fc binding. We observed a 70% reduction in nectin4-Fc level, suggesting that nectin3-Fc binding indeed displaced the cell-bound nectin4 (data not shown).Figure 3Reciprocal inhibition of nectin3-Fc and nectin4-Fc binding to MDCK-N1 cells. Biotinylated nectin3-Fc (10 nm) (left) or nectin4-Fc (500 nm) (right) binding was performed by FACS in the presence (black line) or absence (gray line) of nectin4-Fc (left) or nectin3-Fc (right), respectively.

To further characterize nectin3 and nectin4 binding regions on nectin1, we carried out blocking experiments with a panel of anti-nectin1 mAbs (R1.302, CK6, and CK8) whose epitopes were previously mapped to the V domain (25Cocchi F. Lopez M. Menotti L. Aoubala M. Dubreuil P. Campadelli-Fiume G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15700-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Krummenacher C. Baribaud I. Ponce de Leon M. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10863-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). First we further refined the nectin1 region recognized by these mAbs. For this purpose, we used chimeric nectin1/PVR receptors in which groups of β-strands and intervening loops of nectin1 V domain replace the corresponding regions in the PVRα V domain. The constructs were described in a previous study (28Cocchi F. Lopez M. Dubreuil P. Campadelli Fiume G. Menotti L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7987-7994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (except N1-(77–102)) and are presented in Fig. 4A for convenience. They are named as N1 (nectin1) followed by numerals that define the nectin1 region present in the chimera. The different constructs were stably expressed in the MDCKII epithelial cell line. To ascertain that transfected MDCKII cells expressed comparable levels of each chimeric receptor, we performed FACS analysis using either the anti-nectin1 mAb R1.302 or the anti-PVR mAb PV.404 depending on the chimera tested (Fig. 5, Expression column). mAb R1.302 bound to the chimeras N1-(1–143), N1-(64–116), N1-(64–102), and N1-(77–102) but not to N1-(64–94), N1-(83–116), and N1-(77–94) (Fig. 4A). These results confirm previous data and define the C′-C“-D β-strands and the intervening loops (between residues 77 and 102) as the mAb R1.302 epitope. mAbs CK6 and CK8 recognized all the chimeras, thus making it possible to narrow the epitope to residues 83–94, which are predicted to encode the C” β-strand (Fig. 4A), in accordance with the report of Krummenacher et al. (27Krummenacher C. Baribaud I. Ponce de Leon M. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10863-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When preincubated with MDCK-N1 cells, all three mAbs inhibited nectin3 or nectin4 binding but at different levels (Fig. 4B). mAbs CK6 and CK8 gave similar results; they partially inhibited nectin3 and nectin4 binding (23 and 46% inhibition, respectively, with CK6), whereas mAb R1.302 was a powerful inhibitor of nectin3/nectin1 and of nectin4/nectin1 interactions (94 and 100% inhibition, respectively) (Fig. 4B). We also checked that mAbs were not displaced by nectin-Fc binding (data not shown). According to the results obtained with mAb R1.302, we infer that the C′-C“-D β-strands of the nectin1 V are part of the nectin3 and nectin4 binding site. The partial inhibitions observed with mAbs CK6 and CK8 may indicate that the C” β-strand of the nectin1 V domain does not carry full binding activity.Figure 5Nectin3 or nectin4 binding to MDCKII cells expressing nectin1/PVR chimeras.

Previously, we demonstrated that forced expression of DCC induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (Chen, Y. Q., Hsieh, J. T., Yao, F., Fang, B., Pong, R. C., Cipriano, S. C. & Krepulat, F. (1999) Oncogene 18, 2747–2754). To delineate the DCC-induced apoptotic pathway, we have identified a protein, DIP13α, which interacts with DCC. The DIP13α protein has a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding domain. It interacts with a region on the DCC cytoplasmic domain that is required for the induction of apoptosis. Although ectopic expression of DIP13α alone causes only a slight increase in apoptosis, co-expression of DCC and DIP13αresults in an ∼5-fold increase in apoptosis. Removal of the DCC-interacting domain on DIP13α abolishes its ability to enhance DCC-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of endogenous DIP13αexpression by small interfering RNA blocks DCC-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that DIP13α is a mediator of the DCC apoptotic pathway.

Cho K.R. Nigro J.M. Kern S.E. Simons J.W. Ruppert J.M. Hamilton S.R. Preisinger A.C. Thomas G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 247: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Since that time, loss of heterozygosity at the DCC locus and loss ofDCC expression have been shown in many other tumor types (2Fearon E.R. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996; 1288: M17-M23PubMed Google Scholar) including prostate carcinomas (3Gao X. Honn K.V. Grignon D. Sakr W. Chen Y.Q. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2723-2727PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of DCCexpression has therefore been associated with tumor progression. Although the known tumor suppressor gene MADH4/DPC4/Smad4 is mapped in close proximity to the DCC locus (4Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 490-494PubMed Google Scholar), re-evaluation of loss of heterozygosity at 18q in colon tumor samples indicated that DCC, but not Smad4, was the most frequently altered gene on chromosome 18q13.3–21.3 (6Thiagalingam S.

In a study of 115 pancreatic and 14 biliary cancers for homozygous deletions ofDCC exons and flanking 18q regions, seven homozygous deletions were seen in the region that includes the DCCgene. In fact, DCC was the only known gene affected by all seven deletions. In two tumors, the deletions inactivate DCCbut not Smad4 (7Hilgers W. Song J.J. Haye M. Hruban R.R. Kern S.E. Fearon E.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 27: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These loss of heterozygosity and mutational data support the hypothesis that DCC acts as a tumor suppressor. DCC encodes a type I membrane protein that falls into a subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily (8Cho K.R. Oliner J.D. Simons J.W. Hedrick L. Fearon E.R. Preisinger A.C. Hedge P. Silverman G.A. Vogelstein B. Genomics. 1994; 19: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that DCC may exert its tumor-suppression function through induction of apoptosis (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F.

DCC and its orthologs,UNC-40 in Caenorhabditis elegans andfrazzled in Drosophila, have been established as receptors for netrin-1 and play an important role in axon outgrowth and cell migration in the developing nervous system (11Keino-Masu K.

It has been shown that induction of apoptosis by DCC can be blocked by netrin-1 (10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Expression of DCC colocalizes with areas of apoptotic precerebellar neurons in netrin-1−/− mice, whereas apoptosis is absent in the same DCC-expressing areas in wild-type mice (15Llambi F. Causeret F. Bloch-Gallego E. Mehlen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Therefore DCC may induce cell death in settings where ligand is unavailable. Consistent with this view, netrin-1knockout mice grow fewer cells particularly in the developing brainstem (16Bloch-Gallego E. Ezan F. Tessier-Lavigne M. Sotelo C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4407-4420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yee K.T. Simon H.H. Tessier-Lavigne M. O'Leary D.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 607-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the apoptotic signaling of DCC. Unlike the other well characterized receptors such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor, no apparent death domain can be identified in the DCC cytoplasmic region. Expression ofbcl-2 does not abrogate DCC-induced apoptosis (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that apoptosis induced by DCC is different from that by death receptor/caspase-8 pathway or the mitochondria-dependent pathway (18Forcet C., Ye, X. Granger L. Corset V. Shin H. Bredesen D.E. Mehlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of DCC-interacting protein 13α (DIP13α) and present evidence showing that this DCC partner may serve as an adaptor mediating the DCC apoptotic signal. Colon adenocarcinoma cell line DLD1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. All chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The LexA-based system (19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was used in our experiment. Because of a strong self-activation of the LexA-DCC cytoplasmic domain (1124–1447) bait, we deleted the last 44 amino acids of the DCC C terminus, which contains an acidic domain. This deletion eliminated its activation activity. We used this DCC bait to screen a cDNA library constructed from HeLa cells. We also used B42-DCC cytoplasmic domain (1124–1447) prey to screen a collection of 576 known bait proteins. For mapping analysis, series of deletion mutants were constructed using either convenient restriction sites or PCR with appropriate primers. These mutants were assayed in the yeast system for interaction. A 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen) was used to clone the additional 5′ sequence. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from a total RNA sample prepared from HeLa cells using a gene-specific primer (5′-TGCGATTCTGTCATACGAAAGATGTTAT-3′). Another gene-specific primer (5′-GAACCAAGGAATCGGACAATAAATA-3′) was used in RACE PCR together with anchor primer obtained from the manufacturer. The 5′-RACE product was sequenced. An open reading frame was identified and translated into its corresponding protein using Lasergene software (DNA* Inc.). Protein features were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST service (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the GCG Molecular Sequence Analysis Package (Accelrys Inc.). Intron-exon junctions were mapped by aligning cDNA sequence with its corresponding genomic sequences in the Human Genome Project data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/). All cDNA fragments were generated by PCR using high fidelity polymerases (Invitrogen) and cloned into an entry vector using the gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). Internal deletion of DIP13α (DIP13αΔ428–530) was generated by digesting DIP13 ORF withBamHI and XmaI, blunting the ends, and ligating. Expression vectors used were pDEST-TO-HisFlag (N-His-Flag tag), pDEST26 (N-His tag) and pDEST27 (N-GST tag). Transient transfection of DLD1 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Anti-DCC, anti-HA, and anti-Flag antibody was purchased from PharMingen, CLONTECH and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Rabbit anti-DIP13α was made commercially using two peptides located at its C terminus and linked by 3 glycines (SSRPNQASSEggg- SQSEESDLGE). Two days after transfection, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mmPipes, pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. For Western blotting, protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Target proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescent method. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads and washed with lysis buffer before being resolved on SDS-PAGE. Plasmid DNA was transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, floating and attached cells were collected and enumerated by the trypan blue exclusion method. The results obtained from this method correlate well with other standard apoptosis assays used previously (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). siRNA for DIP13α andDIP13β (as a specificity control) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. The siRNA duplexes for alpha and beta, respectively, are as follows (Sequences 1 and 2). GUG CAG CAA CAC ACC UGACdTdTdTdT CAC GUC GUU GUG UGG ACUGSEQUENCE1.Alpha duplex.GCA GCA CCU CUC CUC CCUUdTdTdTdT CGU CGU GGA GAG GAG GGAASEQUENCE2.Beta duplex.Cells were transfected with RNA duplex and DCC expression vector using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were recovered for Western blotting or cell death analysis 48 h post-transfection. Plasmid DNA and siRNA were injected into the nucleus of HeLa cells using an Eppendorf microinjector. Injections were performed with each plasmid at a concentration of 125 ng/ml. Duplex siRNA oligos were injected at a concentration of 400 pm, resulting in an estimated delivery of 5–20 molecules/cell. An average of 200 cells was injected per condition. To quantify cell death, healthy living fluorescent cells were counted 1–2 h after microinjection, and the percent survival was determined ∼24 h post-injection. We have previously shown that the DCC cytoplasmic domain is required for the induction of apoptosis (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify potential DCC signaling mediators, we used the DCC cytoplasmic domain (1124–1447) as bait to isolate interacting proteins with the yeast two-hybrid system. Because the LexA-DCC bait protein has strong activation activity, we deleted the last 44 amino acids of the DCC C terminus, which contains an acidic domain. This deletion eliminated its activation activity. We used this DCC bait to screen a cDNA library constructed from HeLa cells. From this screening, we identified the human sina-1,sina-2, proteasome subunit p40, and six novel genes that we named DIPs (DCC-interactingproteins). In addition, the DCC cytoplasmic domain (1124–1447) fused with the transcriptional activator B42 was used as prey to screen a collection of 576 known proteins. From this screening, we identified several proteins that interact with the DCC cytoplasmic domain in yeast, among them the Drosophila seven-in-absentia (Sina) and human FKBP12 protein. In total, 13 DCC-interacting proteins were identified. Fig. 1 shows the specific interaction of the DCC cytoplasmic domain with several selected DIPs. We mapped the interacting domain on the DCC cytoplasmic region for all 13 DIPs by serial deletion and yeast two-hybrid analysis. The DIP13α-interacting domain of DCC (amino acids 1240–1273) coincided with the region (amino acids 1243–1264) that is required for DCC to induce apoptosis (10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, our subsequent studies were focused on DIP13α. The DCC-interacting domain on the DIP13α was also mapped. This fragment (amino acid 454–646) contains a phosphotyrosine binding domain (Fig. 2 B). To validate the results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid system, DCC-DIP13α interaction was confirmed in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation. Human colon adenocarcinoma DLD1 cells were transiently transfected withDCC and DIP13α, and cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection. When DIP13α was immunoprecipitated from the lysates by affinity-purified antibody to DIP13α, a protein of ∼190 kDa was co-precipitated and recognized by an antibody specific to DCC on immunoblot (Fig. 3). Reciprocally, anti-HA antibody was able to immunoprecipitate HA-DCC and co-precipitate full-length DIP13α (Fig. 3). The DIP13α cDNA obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening was considered partial because the AUG codon was not in a Kozak consensus context. A BLAST search of the human EST data base also predicted a longer gene for DIP13α. An additional 1.6-kb 5′ sequence was subsequently cloned via a 5′-RACE experiment, which identified a start codon in a good Kozak consensus context. Altogether, a 3042-base contiguous cDNA sequence was obtained, which encodes a protein of 709 amino acid residues (GenBankTM accession number AF424738). The DIP13α protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (20Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (21Margolis B. Borg J.P. Straight S. Meyer D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Margolis B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 262-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and a coiled-coil domain (23Burkhard P. Strelkov S.V. Stetefeld J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) that partially overlaps with the PTB domain (Fig. 2 B). The DIP13α cDNA is identical to the AKT2-interacting gene,APPL (24Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), with the exception of a shorter 3′-untranslated region. Alignment of the cDNA sequence with the corresponding genomic sequence in the Human Genome Project data base predicted that the DIP13α gene has 22 exons spanning an ∼36-kb genomic sequences. All intron-exon junctions conform to the GT-AG rule. To explore the functional relevance of DIP13α to the DCC apoptotic pathway, we transiently expressed the full-length DIP13α in DLD1 and 293T cells. We have previously shown that expression of DCCinduces apoptosis in DLD1 as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, expression of DCC doubled the apoptotic population compared with vector control. This ratio of cell death was consistent with the results obtained with 293T cells (10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 18Forcet C., Ye, X. Granger L. Corset V. Shin H. Bredesen D.E. Mehlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Expression of DIP13α alone slightly increased the number of dead cells. Co-expression of DCC and DIP13α, however, increased the apoptotic population to almost twice as much as that caused by DCC alone and five times that of vector control (Fig.4 A). Nuclear fragmentation was seen in those dead cells (data not shown). To determine whether the interaction of DIP13α with DCC is required for the increased cell death, we constructed a DIP13α deletion mutant (DIP13αΔ428–530) that lacks its DCC-interacting domain. This mutant lost its ability to enhance DCC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). Previously, it has been shown that the DCC ligand, netrin-1, can block the ability of DCC to induce apoptosis (10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of netrin-1 with DCC andDIP13α reduced the population of apoptotic cells to a level lower than that in DIP13αΔ-(428–530) and DCC co-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, co-expression of the DCC-interacting domain of DIP13α (DIP13-(454–646)) either with the full-length DCC or with the DIP13α-interacting domain of DCC (DCC-(1240–1273)) also induced apoptosis but to a lesser degree than that in full-length DIP13α and DCC-expressing cells (Fig.4 B). Expression of the DIP13α-interacting domain of DCC (DCC-(1240–1273)) with the full-length DIP13αinduced a level of apoptotic cells similar to that in full-lengthDCC and the DIP13α-expressing population (Fig. 4 B). To demonstrate that endogenous DIP13α can mediate DCC-induced apoptosis, an RNA interference method was used to down-regulate DIP13α expression. DLD1 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA for DIP13α or DIP13β, another member of the adaptor protein family. DIP13α siRNA reduced the expression of alpha without affecting that of beta, and DIP13β siRNA selectively reduced the expression of beta (Fig.5 A). Similar to previous experiments, transfection of DCC doubled the apoptotic population compared with vector control. DCC together with DIP13α siRNA, however, reduced the apoptotic population to a level similar to that of the vector control (Fig. 5 B). Because the transfection condition was optimized for small oligos but not for plasmid DNA in this experiment, we confirmed our observation by a microinjection method. Injection of DCC vector alone resulted in ∼50% survival relative to the control vector-injected cell population. However, co-injection of DCC vector with DIP13α siRNA blocked DCC-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 C). Although DCC was cloned in 1990, its function is still largely unknown. Recently, we and others have shown that DCCexpression induces apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest (9Chen Y.Q. Hsieh J.T. Yao F. Fang B. Pong R.C. Cipriano S.C. Krepulat F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To delineate the signaling mechanism of DCC-induced apoptosis, we identified several known and novel molecules that interact specifically with the DCC cytoplasmic domain. The known molecules includeDrosophila sina, human Sina-1 (Siah-1), Sina-2 (Siah-2), proteasome subunit p40, and FKBP12 protein. Siah-1 has been shown to regulate DCC protein level via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L., Xu, T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is possible that Siah-2 and proteasome subunit p40 have a similar effect on DCC, whereas the consequence of FKBP12-DCC interaction is unclear. Among the 13 DCC-interacting molecules identified, only DIP13α interacts with the region of DCC that is required to induce apoptosis. In the present study, we have shown that DIP13α interacts specifically with DCC in yeast and mammalian cells, that expression of DIP13α enhances DCC-induced apoptosis, that removal of the DCC-interacting domain of DIP13α abolishes DIP13α's ability to enhance DCC-induced apoptosis, and that reduction of endogenous DIP13α expression blocks DCC-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that DIP13α is a mediator of the DCC apoptotic signal. It is noteworthy that we observed the interaction between exogenous DCC (transfection with an expression vector) and exogenous DIP13α or exogenous DCC and endogenous DIP13α in DLD-1 and 293 mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation-Western blot. However, we were not able to perform an endogenous DCC and endogenous DIP13α interaction experiment due to the fact that most of cell lines do not express endogenous DCC. Interestingly, the neuroblastoma cell line, IMR32, expresses a high level of endogenous DCC but fails to undergo apoptosis. We were not able to detect DCC-DIP13α interaction by immunoprecipitation-Western blot in IMR32 cells under our experimental conditions. The lack of DCC-DIP13α interaction may explain why DCC does not induce apoptosis in IMR32 cells. Recently a gene named APPL, which interacts with AKT2, has been identified (24Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S.W. Sonoda G. Tanno S. Golemis E.A. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4891-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). DIP13α is identical to theAPPL gene. AKT is a serine/threonine kinase that can inhibit apoptosis (26Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3161) Google Scholar). Because DIP13α/APPL can interact with AKT, we wondered whether DCC-induced apoptosis is mediated by DIP13α through the interference of the AKT function. Although AKT1, -2, and -3 proteins were detected in DLD1 cells, AKT1 was more prominent than the other two (data not shown). We did not detect any changes in the total amount of AKT protein nor the phosphorylation status of threonine 308 and serine 473 of AKT in DLD1 and 293 cells expressingDIP13α and DCC (data not shown). Therefore, the role of AKT in DCC-induced apoptosis remains elusive. Interestingly, Forcet et al. (18Forcet C., Ye, X. Granger L. Corset V. Shin H. Bredesen D.E. Mehlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) reported thatDCC induces cell death independently of either the mitochondria-dependent pathway or the death receptor/caspase-8 pathway. Moreover, DCC interacts with both caspase-3 and caspase-9 and drives the activation of caspase-3 through caspase-9 without a requirement for cytochrome c or Apaf-1. Combined with our data, this suggests that DCC, DIP13α, and caspase-9 may coordinate DCC-induced apoptosis. It was shown that amino acids 1243–1264 on DCC were required and sufficient for DCC to induce apoptosis (10Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. Snipas S.J. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Bredesen D.E. Nature. 1998; 395: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It appeared that DCC-(1243–1264) was also required for interaction with caspase-9 (18Forcet C., Ye, X. Granger L. Corset V. Shin H. Bredesen D.E. Mehlen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3416-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and for interaction with DIP13α (the present study). Our data further indicated that the DCC-interacting domain of DIP13α (DIP13-(454–646)) was necessary for DCC to induce apoptosis. The DIP13-(454–646) fragment can have a significant effect on apoptosis when co-expressed with either full-length DCC or DCC-(1240–1273) (Fig. 4 B). Deletion of the DCC-interacting domain on DIP13α (DIP13αΔ428–530) abolished its ability to enhance DCC-induced apoptosis. Namely, expression of DCC and DIP13αΔ428–530 induced the same level of apoptosis as DCC alone (Fig. 4, A and B). The apoptosis that occurs in cells expressing DCC alone was most likely caused by DCC interaction with the endogenous DIP13α in DLD1 cells. Indeed, reduction of endogenous DIP13α expression blocked DCC-induced apoptosis. Experiments are under way to determine the relationship between DIP13α and caspase-9 in DCC-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W1972149030,"The ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu3 has been suggested to play essential roles in regulation of cell surface functions because of its major localization in the plasma membrane and strict substrate preference for gangliosides involved in signal transduction. Here we show that human Neu3 sialidase is enriched in caveolae microdomains and closely associates with caveolin like other caveolin-binding signaling molecules. Using HeLa cells and Neu3-transfected COS-1 cells, endogenous and exogenous Neu3 was found to co-concentrate caveolin-1 in low density Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fractions on sucrose density gradients of the respective cell extracts, as assessed by enzyme activity assays and immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to human Neu3. The presence of a putative caveolin-binding motif within Neu3 prompted us to determine whether Neu3 binds to caveolin-1. In transfectants expressing a polyhistidine-tagged form of Neu3, caveolin-1 co-eluted with Neu3 on affinity column chromatography. A mutation with a single amino acid change in the caveolin-binding motif led to inhibition of recruitment of the sialidase to the microdomain, accompanied by reduction of the enzyme activity. Neu3 also failed to associate with caveolin-enriched microdomains by cholesterol depletion with β-cyclodextrin (with concomitant decrease of the sialidase activity), whereas Neu3 was activated by increased caveolin-1 expression. The tight association of Neu3 with caveolin-1 was supported further by co-immunoprecipitation of Neu3 by anti-caveolin-1 antibody. These results strongly suggest that Neu3 functions as a caveolin-related signaling molecule within caveolin-rich microdomains.

Mammalian forms have been demonstrated to differ from microbial sialidases in various aspects, especially in the presence of multiple types (even in a single cell and in strict substrate specificity), suggesting participation not only in lysosomal degradation but also in many cellular processes (1Schauer R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Pilatte Y. Bignon J. Lambré C.R.

Gakushin Publisher, Osaka, Japan1999: 197-205Google Scholar). Three mammalian sialidases that are classified based on subcellular localization have been cloned so far; these are lysosomal, cytosolic, and plasma membrane sialidases, abbreviated to Neu1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although the functional roles of these sialidases are not fully understood, recent progress in sialidase gene cloning has allowed partial clarification. Among the sialidases, plasma membrane sialidase (Neu3) is a key enzyme for ganglioside hydrolysis because of its strict substrate preference to gangliosides. To obtain functional evidence regarding Neu3, we previously cloned and characterized the sialidase cDNAs of mammalian origin (4Miyagi T. Wada T. Iwamatsu A. Hata K. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Sawada M.

Commun. 1999; 261: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in the present study. Gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, are present in surface membranes of cells and are thought to play important functional roles in regulating a wide range of biological processes including cell surface interactions, cell differentiation, and transmembrane signaling (8Hakomori S. Yamamura S. Handa K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Yates A.J. Rampersaud A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Sci. 1998; 845: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu3 thus may play important roles in cell surface events through modulation of gangliosides. All of the observations on ganglioside function, however, have been performed using microbial sialidases and exogenous gangliosides to mimic ganglioside expression. To understand better the physiological function of gangliosides, it is necessary to pay attention to the endogenous sialidase, Neu3, responsible for ganglioside hydrolysis inside of the cells. Accumulating evidence suggests functional importance for plasma membrane-attached vesicular organelles called detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs) or lipid rafts (11Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 12Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 13Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

DIGs are closely related to caveolae, 50–100-nm invaginations of the plasma membrane, in lipid composition and resistance to detergent solubilization. A major structural protein of caveolae is caveolin, which is known to act as a scaffold for various signaling molecules (15Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 16Couet J., Li, S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that caveolin recruits transducer molecules into caveolae and regulates their functions by direct interaction with these proteins including G protein α-subunits, H-Ras, Src family tyrosine kinases, MAP kinase,1 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which recognize a short cytosolic domain derived from the N-terminal region of caveolin-1 (the caveolin scaffolding domain) by caveolin-binding common motifs present within their molecules (14Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In addition, interaction of the caveolin scaffolding domain with caveolin-binding motifs of epidermal growth factor receptor (18Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (19Oka N. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ohno S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) is known to inhibit kinase activity. We now present evidence that Neu3 is closely associated with caveolin-1 within caveolae microdomains and probably acts as a transducer molecule. In this context it is of interest that in the course of the present study, a study (20Kalka D. von Reitzenstein C. Kopitz J. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was published that described ganglioside sialidase activity co-fractionating with rafts from a neuroblastoma cell line. HeLa cells and COS-1 cells were obtained from The Cell Bank of Tohoku University and RIKEN Cell Bank, respectively, and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2. To observe the effects of cholesterol depletion on caveolae, cells were incubated with 10–20 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) for 50 min before harvesting. Sialidase expression vectors were constructed by subcloning a cDNA fragment containing the open reading frame (ORF) of human membrane-associated ganglioside sialidase (human Neu3) or the mutated DNA into theEcoRI site of pME18S, a eukaryote expression vector under control of the SRα promoter, a generous gift from Dr. T. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University). Introduction of mutations on human Neu3 cDNA was performed by recombination PCR (21Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar) with the following mutation primers: for the Y181A mutation, 5′-GCGTATACCGCGTACATCCCTTCCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGATGTACGCGGT ATACGCAGGGATG-3′; for the F187R mutation, 5′-CCTTCCTGGCGCTTTT GCTTCCAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-AAGCAAAAGCG CCAGGAAGGGATGTAG-3′. PCR reactions were carried out using primers, a plasmid containing the wild type human Neu3 ORF (pME-hmSD) as a template, and LA-Taqpolymerase (Takara Shuzo, Otsu, Japan) at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. Mutated DNAs, with sequences confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method using an AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences), finally were subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pME18S vector. As a control, a cytosolic sialidase expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning a cDNA fragment covering the ORF into pME18S and was used for transfection. A caveolin-1 expression vector was constructed by subcloning the ORF of human caveolin-1 cDNA (22Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) into pCEP4 (Invitrogen). COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation using the procedures described previously (4Miyagi T. Wada T. Iwamatsu A. Hata K. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Sawada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5004-5011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For transfection of caveolin-1 to HeLa cells, Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen) were used as recommended by the supplier. After 48 h of transfection, cells were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. To correct for transfection efficiency, a luciferase expression plasmid was co-transfected with the sialidase plasmid, and the sialidase activity was then normalized to the luciferase activity as detailed earlier (23Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Shimada Y. Zhao X. Miyagi T Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Low density Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains were isolated from cultured cells using the method described (24Czarny M. Lavie Y. Fiucci G. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2717-2724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cultured cells (∼3 × 107) were collected in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. After homogenization, the cell lysate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 1 ml of the above lysis buffer without Triton X-100 containing 80% sucrose. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30%) in the buffer without Triton X-100 was layered over the lysate and centrifuged at 190,000 × g (39,000 rpm) for 16–20 h at 4 °C in an SW 41 rotor. Ten fractions were collected as 1-ml aliquots. The polyhistidine tag was incorporated into the C terminus of the wild type and Y181A mutants of the human Neu3 cDNA, respectively, using the PCR primers and pME-hmSD as a template. The final construction was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pME18S vector and used for transient expression in COS-1 cells. The transfectants were homogenized in the lysis buffer described above, assayed for sialidase activity, and dialyzed against the start buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 3 h at 4 °C. The dialyzed fraction was applied to 1 ml of affinity column for histidine-tagged proteins (HiTrap column, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the start buffer. After washing with 20 ml of the buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of the elution buffer (20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). Washes and eluates then were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The cell lysate and the fractions from the sucrose density gradient were used routinely for sialidase assays with gangliosides as the substrate. The reaction mixture contained 50 nmol of substrate as bound sialic acid, 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μmol of sodium acetate (pH 4.6), and 0.2 mg of Triton X-100 in 200 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–60 min, released sialic acid was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method after passing through an AG1X-2 mini-column as described elsewhere (7Hasegawa T. Carnero C.F. Wada T. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad). One unit of sialidase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 nmol of sialic acid/h. The foot pads of 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected every week with 2 mg of protein of the particulate fraction of human Neu3-transfected COS cells emulsified with incomplete adjuvant. After five successive injections followed by a booster injection, spleens and bilateral inguinal and parietal abdominal lymph nodes of immunized mice were harvested, and B cells were fused with the mouse myeloma X63 Ag8.653 (The Cancer Cell Repository, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) in 50% polyethylene glycol 1000 (Wako). Screening of hybridomas was carried out by examining the specific immunoreactivity of the supernatant of their culture medium in enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay system (Zymed Laboratories) and by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For this, the polystylene microtiter plates precoated with homogenates of the Neu3 transfectants were incubated with the supernatants of hybridomas at 37 °C for 1–2 h and with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-IgG and then were detected by color development. To avoid the problems related to extraction procedures for antigen, including partial disruption of antigenic determinants, the hybridomas also were tested by incubation with the Neu3 transfectants in the presence of 0.5% saponin followed by anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments of IgG conjugated with fluorescein for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The homogenates from vehicle-transfected COS cells were used to exclude false positives caused by reactions with parent COS cell proteins. The positive clones were screened by dilution to obtain single specific clones. The subclass of monoclonal antibody (mAb) was determined to be IgG1 with a mouse isotyping kit. Cell lysates, sucrose density gradient fractions, or fractions from HiTrap affinity columns were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (10%) under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted with antibodies specific to respective proteins. The individual bands were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG (Promega), and development was achieved with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL Plus Western blotting reagent, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-human Neu3 antibody, and the precipitates after washing were applied to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Quantification of the protein bands was determined by NIH image analysis. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin-1 (mAb 2297, BD Transduction Laboratories) and anti-caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-cSrc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-MAP kinase (New England Biolabs); anti-14–3-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To examine whether endogenous ganglioside-specific sialidase is associated with caveolin-enriched microdomains, we used HeLa cells having relatively high sialidase activity. Cell lysates were fractionated on a sucrose density gradient, and the fractions were analyzed for protein concentration, caveolin-1 immunoreactivity, and sialidase activity with gangliosides as substrates. Fig.1 a shows ganglioside sialidase activity co-fractionating in low density fractions 4–6 with caveolin-1 and cSrc (a signal transducer) as assessed by immunoblot analysis, whereas greater than 90% of the total protein loaded on the gradient was recovered in high density fractions 9–10. To obtain evidence that Neu3 protein is present in the caveolin-rich fraction, we prepared mAb specific to human Neu3 and observed the protein distribution by immunoblotting. The antibody was evaluated to be reactive only with Neu3 (48-kDa protein) from HeLa cells (in the experiments with homogenates in Fig. 1 b) as well as from Neu3-transfected COS-1 cells. Upon sucrose gradient Neu3 protein from HeLa cells was detected mainly in fractions 5–6, in parallel with sialidase activity together with caveolin-1. We then examined COS-1 cells transiently transfected with human Neu3 cDNA. More than 70% of the ganglioside-specific sialidase activity was found in fractions 4–6, rich in caveolin-1, and ∼30% of the activity remained in fractions 9–10 (Fig. 2 a). The activity detected in the high density fractions was not caused by overloading because reloading on the gradient resulted in recovery of the activity in the same fractions. Neu3 proteins were detected in the fractions having high activity in a manner similar to the case of HeLa cells. On the other hand, when we tested cytosolic sialidase (Neu2)-transfected COS-1 cells by measuring sialidase activity at pH 6.0 with 4MU-NeuAc (4-methylumbelliferyl-neuraminic acid), most of the sialidase was found in the high density fractions (Fig. 2 b). In addition, endogenous lysosomal sialidase (Neu1) in COS-1 cells, assayed with 4MU-NeuAc as substrate at pH 4.6, showed a pattern nearly identical to that of the exogenously expressed cytosolic sialidase (data not shown). These results indicate human Neu3 indeed to be localized in the caveolin-rich microdomains, in contrast to Neu2 and Neu1 sialidases.Figure 2Localization of human Neu3 expressed in COS-1 cells in caveolin-rich fractions. The fractions on a sucrose density gradient were assayed for ganglioside sialidase activity and immunoblotted for Neu3 and caveolin proteins with mAb anti-human Neu3 and anti-caveolin-1, respectively (a). As a control, cytosolic sialidase expressed in COS-1 cells was assayed for activity using 4MU-NeuAc as a substrate (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Neu3 is specifically associated with caveolin in the microdomain, we searched for a functional binding site for caveolin-1 in the Neu3 molecule. Caveolin-binding motifs were recently deduced (φXφXXXXφ and φXXXXφXXφ, in which φ is aromatic residue W, F, or Y) (17Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). These motifs are present in most caveolae-associated proteins including protein kinase Cα, MAP kinase, and epidermal growth factor receptor. In the human Neu3, we identified a possible region (YTYYIPSW, 179–186 residues) within the hydrophobic stretch of the putative transmembrane domain sequence (4Miyagi T. Wada T. Iwamatsu A. Hata K. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Sawada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5004-5011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding site in Neu3 is functional, the following strategies were employed: introduction of mutations into Neu3, affinity purification of His-tagged Neu3 forms, and immunoprecipitation with antibody to either caveolin-1 or Neu3. Two mutants were expressed, and the cell lysates were analyzed by fractionation on a sucrose density gradient (Fig.3). Mutant F187R with one amino acid change next to the motif sequence demonstrated reduction of ganglioside sialidase activity in the cell lysate to only 45% of the wild type level, and mutant Y181A with a single amino acid change within the motif almost lost the sialidase activity, although Neu3 protein level was similar to the wild type (Fig. 3 a). Upon sucrose gradient fractionation, mutant F187R exhibited only a low amount of Neu3 protein in fraction 5 with low sialidase activity, much more protein, and activity being evident in fractions 9–10. In mutant Y181A, Neu3 protein was hardly recovered in the fractions 4–6 where caveolin was still concentrated. In contradiction to the high density fractions of F187R retaining some sialidase activity, those of Y181A hardly showed sialidase activity. This partly may concern the conformational changes of the latter protein. These results suggest that the predicted caveolin-binding motif in Neu3 may be involved in binding to caveolin-1 and loss of the binding ability possibly leading to failure of recruitment to caveolae and subsequently to reduction of the enzyme activity. To obtain further evidence for specific binding to caveolin-1, we next used His-tagged forms of Neu3 constructed by introducing the His tag epitope into the C terminus (Fig. 4,a and b). Upon transient expression in COS-1 cells, the His-tagged form could be purified by Ni2+ion-charged HiTrap chelating column chromatography, the bound proteins being specifically eluted by affinity elution with imidazole (25Janknecht T. de Martynoff G. Lou J. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8972-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As a control for nonspecific binding, human Neu3 without the tag epitope was also expressed. Both Neu3 forms showed sialidase activity at the same level. After affinity purification on HiTrap column, fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to human Neu3 and caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 a). His-tagged Neu3 was specifically eluted by affinity elution with imidazole, whereas no binding to the column was observed with Neu3 lacking the His tag. Under these conditions endogenous caveolin-1 and MAP kinase co-eluted with His-tagged Neu3, but co-eluted with 14–3-3 protein in the washing effluents. When the cell lysates from mutant Y181A with the His tag epitope were applied on a HiTrap column, most of caveolin-1 protein was detected in the washings, even though all of the Neu3 protein was detected in the affinity eluates (Fig. 4 b). We further evaluated specific association of Neu3 with caveolin-1 by immunoprecipitating with antibody to either caveolin-1 or Neu3 (Fig. 4 c). Under the conditions in which an almost equal amount of endogenous caveolin-1 was applied for immunoprecipitation (lower panel), wild type Neu3 was co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin-1 by anti-caveolin-1 antibody, whereas much less mutant Neu3 protein was recovered compared with wild type level (upper panel), the protein level relative to wild type in the immunoprecipitates being 67 and 15% in mutants of F187R and Y181A, respectively. Caveolin-1 was not detected in anti-Neu3 immunoprecipitates, possibly because of the epitope of the antibody near caveolin-binding motif. To understand the physiological significance of the tight association between Neu3 and caveolin, we first tested whether Neu3 sialidase activity is altered by treatment with 10 mm β-cyclodextrin, known to disrupt caveolae by cholesterol depletion (26Parpal S. Karlsson M. Thorn H. Stralfors P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9670-9678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The treatment of Neu3-transfected COS cells caused dissociation of Neu3 from caveolae fractions and significant decrease in the sialidase activity (Fig.5 a), although caveolin-1 still remained in low density fractions at the concentration of β-cyclodextrin. Secondly, we examined the effects of caveolin-1 expression on Neu3 activity by transient transfection of sense and antisense caveolin-1 expression plasmid. HeLa cells transfected with the sense cDNA showed higher endogenous Neu3 activity in proportion to the caveolin level, and in contrast the cells with the antisense cDNA had lower sialidase activity than the vehicle-transfected cells, without a change of Neu3 protein level (Fig. 5 b), when endogenous Neu1 sialidase activity was not altered (data not shown). These data together indicate that Neu3 is associated with caveolin-1, probably through the predicted caveolin-binding motif sequence, and that Neu3 activity is down-regulated by dissociation from caveolae and also by decreased expression of caveolin-1.Figure 5Alterations of Neu3 sialidase activity by β-cyclodextrin treatment and by caveolin transfection. Cells were treated with 10 mmβ-cyclodextrin for 50 min at 37 °C, and the lysates of collected cells were assayed for sialidase activity (a) and fractionated on a sucrose density gradient for detection of Neu3 activity and the protein (b). Caveolin-1 expression plasmid was transiently transfected to HeLa cells, and the endogenous sialidase activity and caveolin-1 protein were determined (c);left panel, sense DNA; right panel, antisense DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ganglioside-specific sialidase Neu3 is a unique glycosidase in its localization within the plasma membrane and the strict substrate specificity. Unlike lysosomes, the membranes do not contain a set of glycosidases to degradate glycoproteins and glycolipids (27Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that Neu3 is involved in cell surface events other than catabolism of glycoconjugates. In fact, there are several observations suggesting important functional roles of sialidase in processes like cell differentiation (6Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J.

Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, no clear evidence for the physiological functions of Neu3 has been presented hitherto in molecular basis. Here we show for the first time that this sialidase is closely associated with caveolin-1 and that its activity is likely to be regulated by caveolin-mediated recruitment to caveolae microdomains. Neu3 has been expected to participate in cell signaling at cell surface through modulation of gangliosides. In addition to this ganglioside-mediated action, present observations suggest another mode of Neu3 action through binding to signal-related molecules including caveolin-1. Although clear evidence for direct interaction of Neu3 with caveolin has not been provided, direct involvement of Neu3 in caveolin-mediated signaling appears plausible. Many caveolin-associated proteins are now known to contain caveolin-binding motifs, and this is considered to be a general mechanism for caveolin-mediated sequestration and subsequent inactivation within caveolae. In the case of Neu3, mutation of the putative caveolin-binding site led to blocking of the recruitment to caveolae. The possibility cannot be excluded that suppression of the sialidase activity in the mutants is primarily caused by the conformational changes but that separation of Neu3 from caveolin in microdomains by cholesterol depletion causes the similar activity change. Reduced expression of caveolin with the antisense DNA also caused down-regulation of the sialidase activity. This suggests that Neu3 is a unique member of caveolin-associated proteins, which is activated rather than inactivated by caveolin-mediated sequestration, similar to the case of the insulin receptor promoting IRS-1 phosphorylation (34Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers M.G., Jr. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms underlying caveolin-mediated regulation of Neu3 activity have not been elucidated, one possible explanation for caveolin-mediated sequestration may be the following. To activate Neu3 in vitro, detergents such as Triton X-100 are required (4Miyagi T. Wada T. Iwamatsu A. Hata K. Yoshikawa Y. Tokuyama S. Sawada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5004-5011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There is no presently known endogenous activator located in the plasma membrane that can be replaced by the detergent. Because we have observed that phospholipids can stimulate the Neu3 sialidase activity, 2T. Wada and T. Miyagi, manuscript in preparation.it is most feasible that phospholipids constituting caveolae may activate Neu3 after recruitment. Our present observations indicate that Neu3 and caveolin-1 are closely associated in microdomains and that Neu3 activity probably is regulated by complex formation with caveolin within caveolae, suggesting that Neu3 may play important roles as a signal molecule through cross-talk with other signal transducers.

Apoptosis is an energy-dependent process characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage, whereas oncosis is a form of cell death induced by energy depletion and initially characterized by cell swelling. We demonstrate in HeLa cells but not in normal diploid fibroblasts that modest increases in the expression level of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) leads to a rapid and dramatic fall in mitochondrial membrane potential and to a reduction of mitochondrial NADH and intracellular ATP. In HeLa cells, increased UCP-2 expression leads to a form of cell death that is not inhibited by the anti-apoptotic gene product Bcl-2 and that morphologically resembles cellular oncosis. We further describe the creation of a dominant interfering mutant of UCP-2 whose expression increases resting mitochondrial membrane potential and selectively increases the resistance to cell death following oncotic but not apoptotic stimuli. These results suggest that distinct genetic programs may regulate the cellular response to either apoptotic or oncotic stimuli. Cell death can proceed through at least two distinct pathways.

In apoptosis, the signaling proteins such as Bax and the orphan nuclear receptor TR3 localize to the mitochondria and regulate its function, culminating in lowered mitochondrial membrane potential, increased membrane permeability, and the release of a mixture of death effectors including the procaspases cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO (1Green D.G. Reed J.C Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar, 3Li H. Kolluri S.K., Gu, J. Dawson X.C.

In oncosis, cellular energy depletion following metabolic insults such as severe ischemia produces dramatic reductions in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, resulting in a loss of ionic homeostasis and cellular swelling (4Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). Because the mitochondrial generation of ATP requires the presence of an electrochemical gradient, a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΨM) may precede the morphologic changes seen in apoptotic and oncotic cell death (5Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively detailed knowledge accrued concerning the mitochondrial control of apoptosis, surprisingly little is known regarding the controlling mechanisms in oncotic cell death. Oncosis has long been confused with necrosis, but similar to apoptosis, it refers to a process leading to cell death, whereas necrosis refers to those processes of cellular degradation that follow cell death (4Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). Oncosis has typically been regarded as passive, occurring after only severe tissue injury brought about by ischemia or heat (6Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. Chang S.H. Phelps P.C. Toxicol. Pathol. 1997; 25: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), but more recently oncotic cells have been observed coincident with apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions of vessel endothelium (7Crisby M.K. Kallin B. Thyberg J. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Kostulas V. Nilsson J. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 130: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), pancreatic dysfunction (8Andersson R. Wang X. Pancreas. 1998; 17: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and infarcted myocardial tissue (9Elasser A. Suzuki K. Lorenz-Meyer S. Bode C. Schaper J. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that oncosis in mammalian cells may be regulated in part by cell surface receptors (10Ma F. Zhang C. Prasad K.V. Freeman G.J. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9778-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in plants, oncosis may function like apoptosis in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (11Jones A. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report indicates that oncotic cells, similar to their apoptotic counterparts, expose phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane surface, an event required for the engulfment of dying cells by phagocytes and necessary for the prevention of necrotic tissue damage and inflammation (12Lecoeur H. Prevost M.C. Gougeon M.L. Cytometry. 2001; 44: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In animals, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1)1 is highly expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocytes and regulates mitochondrial membrane potential by allowing the re-entry of protons that have been pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix during aerobic respiration (13Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Riquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proton leak reduces net cellular ATP production in exchange for the generation of heat, a property that is essential for the function of UCP-1 in mediating cold-induced thermogenesis. The biochemical analysis of UCP-1 has revealed that the rate of proton transport is highly dependent on fatty acids, purine nucleotides, and intracellular pH, although the exact mechanisms of proton translocation remain controversial (15Rial E. Gonzales-Barroso M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of UCP-1 homologues have been described. The expression of UCP-3 is restricted predominantly to skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue mitochondria, whereas UCP-2 has a much wider tissue distribution (16Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 3-10Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Given their high degree of structural similarity, it is widely believed that the recently described UCP family members may also regulate proton leak and hence ΨM in tissues besides brown fat. Although UCP-2 has recently been extensively examined for its potential role in diabetes, its overall metabolism, and as a mediator of obesity (17Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S.

Cell. 2001; 105: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), controversy exists as to whether the protein truly acts to uncouple mitochondria and whether or not UCP-2 regulates mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular energetics (19Esterbauer H. Schneitler C. Oberkofler H. Ebenbichler C. Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Ladurner G. Hell E. Strosberg A.D. Patsch J.R. Krempler F. Patsch W. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to further understand the role of UCP-2 in mitochondrial function and its role in mammalian cell death pathways. For transient transfections, full-length human UCP-2 cDNA (a generous gift of C. H. Warden) was subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) into HeLa cells along with a nuclear localizing green fluorescent protein construct pCMV-GFPnuc (Invitrogen). The expression plasmid for adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT-2) was obtained by PCR amplification of a human heart library, and its sequence was confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing. Site-directed mutants of UCP-2 were created by substitution at position 28 (Asp-Asn), position 185 (Arg-Gln), or position 212 (Asp-Asn). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and expression was confirmed using an in-frame epitope expression tag. A virus encoding full-length human UCP-2 and a G418 selection marker was constructed using the retroviral vector pLNCX (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral stocks were prepared following transfection in 10-cm2 dishes (15 μg/5 × 105 cells) of the producer cell line PT-67 per manufacturer's recommendations by the (CLONTECH). Control human diploid fibroblasts at an approximate population doubling time of 20–25 were obtained following infection with a retrovirus encoding for only neomycin resistance. Following selection in G418 (500 μg/ml for 7 days), the control and UCP-2-infected cells were replated at similar densities. For growth rate, cells were seeded at 4 × 104/well in 6-well plates, and population doubling was determined as follows: [log (number of cells harvested/number of cells seeded)]/log2. One day after transfection, whole cell protein lysates were prepared from mock-transfected and UCP-2-transfected HeLa cells (5 mg of protein lysate/lane) and probed with rabbit anti-UCP-2 (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) or mouse anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Similarly, the levels of Bcl-2 expression were assessed using an anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For cytochrome oxidase 2 (COX-2) immunofluorescence, cells were co-transfected with empty vector or UCP-2 along with nuclear localizing green fluorescent protein (GFPnuc) and fixed 24 h after transfection in 3% paraformaldehyde. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using an anti-COX-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1.0 mg/ml, Molecular Probes) followed by an anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Transfected cells as evidenced by GFP fluorescence were subsequently visualized with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-510). HeLa cells were grown on 2-well coverglass chamber slides. Twenty four hours after transfection, mitochondrial potentiometric dyes (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) and Mitotracker Red (CMXRos), Molecular Probes) were diluted separately in medium (final concentration of 25 nm) and then added to wells in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed twice with Hanks' solution (pH 7.4) and immediately imaged on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert LSM-510 laser scanning confocal microscope. For TMRM experiments after the initial incubation, cells were washed and maintained in Hanks' solution containing 2.5 nm TMRM. For all of the experiments, either pCDNA-UCP-2 or the corresponding empty vector DNA was transfected at a 4:1 molar ratio with pCMV-GFPnuc. For CMXRos, relative fluorescence in each transfection group was determined by assessing the ratio in random fields of the level of mitochondrial CMXRos fluorescence in GFP-positive cells versus neighboring cells that were GFP-negative. Relative TMRM fluorescence and millivolt membrane potentials in each transfection group were also determined ratiometrically by comparing mitochondrial to nuclear fluorescence in GFP-positive cells and subtracting extracellular background fluorescence using an IDL-based (Boulder, CO) program. Quantitative results are from four separate experiments for CMXRos and from two separate experiments using TMRM, measuring ∼15–25 GFP-positive cells/experiment. The membrane potentials were similarly determined in non-transfected cells following treatments with chemical uncouplers dinitrophenol (DNP, Sigma), carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, Sigma), and oligomycin (Sigma). To determine whether transfected genes altered mitochondrial mass, cells were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) using the non-potentiometric dye Mitotracker Green (50 nm, Molecular Probes) under the same conditions employed for CMXRos. To assess the ability of the UCP-2 site-directed mutants to alter mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were transiently transfected with a GFP expression plasmid and either a UCP-2 mutant or empty vector. Two days after transfection, CMXRos uptake in GFP-positive cells was assessed by FACS. Mitochondrial NADH autofluorescence was monitored by confocal microscopy as described previously (20Combs C.A. Balaban R.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2018-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The images were processed using LSM-510 image analysis software. Images shown are representative field images of 8–10 independent experiments performed in duplicate. For ATP determinations, cells were transfected with UCP-2/GFP-actin (CLONTECH) or pCDNA3.1/GFP-actin, and 48 h later, cells were sorted for green fluorescence. In duplicate experiments, approximately one million GFP-positive cells in each group were divided into four aliquots, and a luciferase-based ATP measurement kit (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions with values normalized for total protein. ATP levels were similarly determined in cells treated with dinitrophenol. To assess the effects of UCP-2 on cell viability, G418 selection was performed on cells transfected with a neomycin-resistant plasmid and a UCP-2 expression vector or the corresponding empty vector in a 1:10 ratio. Two days following transfection, cells were switched to medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Ten days after initiation of antibiotic selection, cells were fixed, and viable colonies were stained with methyl violet. For the assessment of viability following transient transfection, cells were co-transfected with GFP-actin along with either a UCP-2 expression vector or with the corresponding empty vector (1:4 ratio). Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and analyzed on a FACS. GFP-positive cells from the UCP-2-transfected or control-transfected population were collected and subsequently analyzed for viability by trypan blue exclusion (0.2%, 5 min). Using the same conditions, similar studies were performed on a stable HeLa cell line expressing Bcl-2 generated by transfection of an expression vector encoding Bcl-2 (a generous gift of S. Korsmeyer) followed by G418 selection. As a control, a clonal HeLa cell line expressing G418 resistance alone was generated in parallel. Viability data reflect one representative experiment of at least two similar experiments each performed in quadruplicate. For determination of the effects of the mutant UCP-2D212N on cell survival, cells were transfected with either the UCP-2 mutant or empty vector, and after 24 h, cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α/cycloheximide (10 and 1 mg/ml, 4 or 8 h), staurosporine (1.0 mm, 4 or 8 h), sodium azide (1.5 mm, 15 or 24 h), or hypoxia (15 and 24 h). Cells were made hypoxic using a humidified hypoxia chamber (Billups and Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) and were flushed of ambient air for 20 min with 95% N2, 5% CO2prior to incubation at 37 °C. After the various treatments, viable cells were determined by assessing the number of trypan blue-negative cells remaining. For morphological determinations, the control and UCP-2-transfected cells were sorted for GFP fluorescence using FACS, collected on ice and fixed in glutaraldehyde buffer, and subsequently processed for electron microscopy. Thin sections were analyzed with a JEOL 100 CX transmission electron microscope. In an effort to more fully understand the function of UCP-2 in mammalian cells, we employed laser scanning confocal microscopy along with two different fluorescent indicators of mitochondrial membrane potential, CMXRos and TMRM. HeLa cells were assessed 24 h after co-transfection with expression plasmids encoding UCP-2 and a GFPnuc as a marker of transfection. Using the densitometric ratio of UCP-2 to tubulin expression and calculating the overall transfection efficiency as assessed by GFP positivity, we determined that in transfected cells the levels of UCP-2 increased ∼3-fold (Fig.1). However, this relatively modest increase in UCP-2 protein levels was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. As evidenced in Fig.2A in control HeLa cells transfected with empty vector and GFPnuc, the levels of CMXRos fluorescence were similar in transfected cells when compared with non-transfected neighboring cells. In contrast, cells expressing UCP-2 had a dramatic reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential as determined by CMXRos fluorescence (Fig. 2, B andC). A quantitative assessment for mitochondrial membrane potential 24 h after transfection demonstrated that in contrast to control-transfected cells expressing GFPnuc alone, the expression of UCP-2 resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in CMXRos uptake (Fig. 2D). To further confirm the specificity of the observed effects of UCP-2 on membrane potential, we also overexpressed the mitochondrial carrier protein, ANT-2. As observed in Fig.2D, in contrast to UCP-2, ANT-2 expression did not alter CMXRos fluorescence. Because all of the fluorescent probes of mitochondrial membrane potential have limitations including sensitivity to plasma membrane potential, we extended our initial observations using TMRM, which at low concentrations is insensitive to plasma membrane potential (14Riquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to what we observed with CMXRos, UCP-2 also significantly reduced TMRM fluorescence ratios (Fig.2E). Although individual mitochondria exhibited a significant range of membrane potentials, millivolt potentials in non-UCP-2-expressing cells were calculated to range from −99 to −120 mV. In marked contrast, millivolt potentials in UCP-2-transfected cells ranged from −35 to −116 mV. We further verified the membrane potential determinations in our system by assessing CMXRos uptake after treatment with either the chemical uncouplers DNP or CCCP or following exposure to the F1 ATPase inhibitor oligomycin. As expected, each of these agents significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 2F). Finally, to verify that reductions in dye uptake were not simply a function of reduced mitochondrial mass, we immunostained transfected cells with an antibody directed at the mitochondrial protein COX-2. As seen in Fig. 2,G and H, UCP-2 expression did not grossly alter mitochondrial distribution or number. Similar results were obtained in control or UCP-2-transfected cells analyzed by FACS. As demonstrated in Fig. 2I following transient transfection with UCP-2, a population of cells with lower membrane potential develops as evidenced by reduced CMXRos uptake. In contrast, the uptake of Mitotracker Green, a mitochondrial dye whose uptake is proportional to mitochondrial mass but not potential, was similar in control- and UCP-2-transfected cells (Fig. 2J).Figure 2UCP-2 regulates mitochondrial membrane potential.

Compared with cells transfected with GFPnuc alone (Fig. 3, A andB), HeLa cells expressing UCP-2 (Fig. 3, C andD) had reduced levels of NADH. A quantitative assessment demonstrated that UCP-2 resulted in an approximate 30% reduction in NADH levels (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the effects on mitochondrial NADH, the direct measurement of cellular ATP levels 24 h after transfection revealed that total ATP stores fell ∼40% in UCP-2-expressing HeLa cells (Fig. 3F). In an effort to pursue these observations, we next attempted to obtain stable cell lines that overexpressed UCP-2. Repeated attempts to obtain such stable cell lines in HeLa cells were unsuccessful. To evaluate these observations further, we compared the number of G418-resistant colonies in the presence or absence of UCP-2 transfection. As demonstrated in Fig.4A, UCP-2 had a dramatic reduction in growth and/or survival of HeLa cells following neomycin selection. A similar decrease in cell survival was noted in cells transiently expressing UCP-2 (Fig. 4B). Again, the expression of UCP-2 led to a significant reduction in cell viability with ∼75% UCP-2-expressing cells becoming non-viable after 48 h following transfection. A microscopic analysis of UCP-2-transfected cells demonstrated that although some cells exhibited a morphological appearance consistent with apoptosis, a significantly larger number of cells appeared enlarged and swollen. Fig. 4C represents an example of UCP-2-transfected cells stained with toluidine blue with oncotic cells demonstrating reduced dye uptake. In control cells, the number of similarly enlarged lightly stained cells was significantly less (data not shown). The electron micrographs of the UCP-2-expressing cells demonstrated a mode of cell death consistent with oncosis. In particular, as demonstrated in Fig. 4D, there is evidence of cell and organelle swelling along with lysosomal accumulation. Similarly, as opposed to apoptosis, there is an absence of nuclear condensation. In addition, the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene product Bcl-2 had no effect on the loss of cell viability following transient UCP-2 expression (Fig. 4E). These results are consistent with the observed effects on energy depletion seen in Fig. 3and suggest that UCP-2 induces a form of cell death that morphologically resembles oncosis. To compare the differential effects of UCP-2-mediated uncoupling on transformed and normal cells, we overexpressed UCP-2 in human fibroblasts using a retroviral vector. As seen in Fig. 5A, retroviral overexpression resulted in an approximate 3-fold increase in UCP-2 protein expression compared with control-infected cells, a level similar to that observed in transfected HeLa cells. Interestingly, UCP-2 overexpression did not significantly alter the growth and viability of these fibroblast cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that fibroblast and HeLa cells have differential susceptibilities to uncoupling or that the regulation of overexpression of UCP-2 is different in each cell type. To begin to address these two possibilities, we compared the effects of chemical uncoupling on mitochondrial energetics in the two cell types using DNP. DNP (250 μm) produced similar reductions in membrane potential in fibroblasts and HeLa cells following 6- and 24-h treatments (Fig.5C). In contrast, as seen in Fig. 5D, the fibroblasts displayed a much greater capacity to maintain intracellular NADH levels following DNP treatment. Consistent with NADH determinations, after a 24-h DNP treatment, HeLa ATP levels decreased ∼85% compared with only 51% in fibroblasts (Fig. 5D). The preservation of energy substrates in fibroblasts may be a result of different glycolytic capacity in these two cell types. After DNP exposure, lactate production (micromoles/milligrams of protein/24 h) in fibroblasts increased from 11.5 ± 0.9 to 16.5 ± 1.3, whereas a similar treatment in HeLa cells resulted in a slight reduction of lactate production from 6.7 ± 0.2 to 6.2 ± 0.2. These differences in energetics seen with chemical uncoupling were reflected in a difference in cell survival. After 48 h of DNP exposure, ∼87% of DNP-treated fibroblasts remained viable compared with only 36% HeLa cells (Fig. 5E). Thus, the effects of protein or chemical uncoupling on mitochondrial energetics and viability appear cell type-specific.Figure 5Comparison of effects of uncoupling in normal diploid fibroblasts and HeLa cells.

Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Winkler E. Huang S.G. Int. J. Obesity. 1999; 23: S24-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, a number of specific residues have been implicated in proton binding and transport. We reasoned that the analogous mutations in UCP-2 should result in a protein with reduced activity, and given the dimeric form of the protein, such mutations should act in a dominant interfering fashion. Given that basal uncoupling rates are in the range of 25% (22Porter R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we predicted that any putative dominant negative UCP-2 mutant should raise basal mitochondrial membrane potential. We tested a series of site-directed mutants of UCP-2 at amino acid positions D28N, R185G, and D212N, because the corresponding mutations in UCP-1 (position 28, 183, and 210) have been shown to alter nucleotide binding, proton transport, or pH sensing (21Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Bienengraeber M. Winkler E. Huang S.G. Int. J. Obesity. 1999; 23: S24-S29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following transfection with these mutant UCP-2 constructs, cells were assessed for CMXRos uptake. FACS analysis of UCP-2 mutants at position 27 and 185 revealed no appreciable change in resting membrane potential when compared with control-transfected cells. 2E. M. Mills and T. Finkel, unpublished observations. In contrast, the cells that expressed UCP-2D212N had a significant increase in the resting mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig.6, A–C). However, the uptake of the non-potentiometric dye Mitotracker Green was unaffected by UCP-2D212N expression (Fig. 6D). The UCP-2 dominant interfering mutant allowed us to further explore the physiological role of uncoupling in cell death. As such, we next subjected control-transfected or cells that expressed UCP-2D212N to either a primarily apoptotic or oncotic stimulus. As seen in Fig. 7A, the expression of UCP-2D212N did not significantly alter the response to staurosporine, a rapid inducer of apoptosis in HeLa cells. A similar lack of effect was noted with tumor necrosis factor and cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the expression of UCP-2D212N afforded significant protection to cells exposed to the primarily oncotic stimuli of metabolic inhibition using sodium azide (Fig. 7C) or chronic hypoxia (Fig.7D). Taken together, our results suggest that UCP-2 can regulate cellular energetics and specifically alters the response to oncotic stimuli.Figure 7The dominant interfering mutant UCP-2D212N selectively protects cells from oncotic cell death.

Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and evidence suggests that this uncoupling might be useful in limiting the chronic exposure to harmful reactive oxygen species generated in the mitochondria (24Arsenijevic D. Onuma H. Pecqueur C. Raimbault S. Manning B.S. Miroux B. Couplan E. Alves-Guerra M.C. Goubern M. Surwit R. Bouillaud F. Richard D. Collins S. Ricquier D. Nat.

Although clearly useful under normal conditions or under severe or chronic metabolic stress such as hypoxia or anoxia, the inefficiency inherent with uncoupling may provide a significant disadvantage in cellular survival. Accordingly, our data show that even modestly increased levels of UCP-2 protein reduces cell survival in certain cells. Consistent with this conclusion is the observation that mice with fatty livers and subsequent elevated levels of hepatic UCP-2 appear more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion stress than control mice (26Chavin K.D. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Chatham J. Chacko V.P. Hoek J.B. Walajtys-Rode E. Rashid A. Chen C.H. Huang C.C., Wu, T.C. Lane M.D. Diehl A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5692-5700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Similarly, recent studies using oxygen injection microcalorimetry have demonstrated that the level of uncoupled respirations is reduced when intracellular oxygen concentrations fall (27Gnaiger E. Mendez G. Hand S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11080-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that uncoupling activity is physiologically regulated during hypoxic stress, and as we have demonstrated here, cells with reduced levels of uncoupling may have a survival advantage during prolonged ischemia. UCP-1 that is overexpressed in yeast and mammalian cells retains its native fatty acid-dependent uncoupling and thermogenic activities, but it remains controversial despite their high degree of structural similarity whether or not the functions and regulation of UCP-2 and UCP-3 are identical to UCP-1 (28Cadenas S. Echtay K.S. Harper J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Buckingham J.A. Grau E. Abuin A. Chapman H. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2773-2778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from UCP-2 knock-out animals supports the notion that UCP-2 functions in vivo as a regulator of mitochondrial coupling and membrane potential (29Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that sufficient overexpression of any inner membrane mitochondrial proteins may result in nonspecific uncoupling (30Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Brindle K.M. Jekabsons M.B. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18633-18639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although this may be true for massive overexpression in experimental models in yeast, we found that in contrast to UCP-2, ANT-2 overexpression in HeLa cells did not alter membrane potential or cell viability. Similarly, overexpression of the UCP-2D212N mutant not only failed to reduce membrane potential but in fact raised membrane potential. These results strongly suggest that the effects we observed on mitochondrial membrane potential following wild type UCP-2 overexpression in HeLa cells resulted from the specific action of UCP-2 and not from mitochondrial protein overloading. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the molecular and biochemical events that regulate apoptosis. These studies have demonstrated that the mitochondria play a pivotal role in the coordination, initiation, and execution of apoptotic cell death. Despite its common misinterpretation as necrosis (4Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar), it has long been recognized that oncosis represents a morphologically distinct mode of cell death, yet the molecular basis underlying oncosis has received little attention. Our results demonstrate that the expression of UCP-2 is sufficient to induce oncosis in certain transformed cells, whereas transient inhibition of UCP-2 can selectively protect these cells from oncotic but not apoptotic stress. As such, these data suggest a central role for mitochondria in regulating oncotic cell death and add to the evidence that oncotic cell death may also be subjected to molecular regulation and may play a homeostatic role in the overall tissue response to acute metabolic stress. Finally, our results also raise the possibility that other gene products in addition to UCP-2 may be identified that will selectively modulate the cellular response to oncotic stimuli without affecting the overall cellular threshold to apoptosis. Such an analysis should provide a more detailed molecular basis to distinguish what until now has been a purely morphological distinction between these two contrasting forms of cell death. In addition, further studies of oncosis will provide a deeper understanding of this important biological process and provide the framework for new therapies directed at protecting tissues and organs from severe metabolic and ischemic insults.

Using normal rat kidney cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src, we examined the role of the Raf/MEK/ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and Rho pathways in morphological transformation and cytoskeletal changes induced by v-Src. Activation of v-Src elicited a loss of actin stress fibers and focal contacts. A decrease in the phosphorylation level of cofilin was detected upon v-Src activation, which is indicative of attenuated Rho function. Inhibition of MEK using U0126 prevented v-Src-induced disruption of the cytoskeleton as well as dephosphorylation of cofilin, whereas treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor had no protective effect. In normal rat kidney cells stably transformed by v-Src, we found that the chronic activation of MEK induces down-regulation of ROCK expression, thereby uncoupling Rho from stress fiber formation. Taken together, these results establish MEK as an effector of v-Src-induced cytoskeleton disruption, participating in v-Src-induced antagonism of the cellular function of Rho.

Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Among them, Rho regulates the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal contacts, through activation of the downstream effectors mDia and the closely related kinases ROCKI and ROCKII (2Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumyia S. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Activation of ROCK by Rho is implicated in stress fiber and focal contact formation (2Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROCK increases the phosphorylation of myosin light chains by directly phosphorylating myosin light chains and negatively regulating myosin phosphatase and thus increases actomyosin-based contractility (5Kureishi Y.

Kaibuchi K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 32-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The resulting contractile forces are thought to contribute to the formation of stress fibers and focal contacts (7Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 8Helfman D.M. Levy E.T. Berthier C. Shtutman M. Riveline D. Grosheva I. Lachish-Zalait A. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3097-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). ROCK also activates LIMK,1 which subsequently phosphorylates cofilin and thereby inhibits its actin-depolymerizing activity, thus contributing to actin stress fiber stabilization (9Yang N. Higuchi O.

In cells transformed by the product of the Rous sarcoma virus, the v-Src tyrosine kinase, the shape and cytoskeletal architecture are dramatically altered, with a disruption of actin stress fibers and focal contacts and the formation of dot-like actin-associated adhesions called podosomes. This disruption of the cytoskeleton is believed to contribute to several aspects of the transformed phenotype, including adhesion-independent cell growth and increased migration abilities (12Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which v-Src disrupts actin stress fibers and focal contacts is not clear. Stimulation of a Rho-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity was reported upon v-Src activation in chicken embryo fibroblasts (13Fincham V.J. Chudleidgh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that v-Src-induced cytoskeleton disruption is linked to inhibition of Rho activity. In addition, an active mutant form of Rho was shown to restore stress fibers and adhesion plaques in v-Src-transformed fibroblasts (14Mayer T. Meyer M. Janning A. Shiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite these experiments, the relationship between Rho-mediated stress fiber assembly and v-Src-induced morphological transformation, as well as the signaling pathways mediating v-Src effects on the cytoskeleton, have not been clearly identified. Expression of v-Src results in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous substrates and simultaneous activation of several signaling pathways, including the Ras/MEK and PI3K pathways (15Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Both pathways have been implicated in cytoskeleton regulation in normal cells. Activation of PI3K is necessary for Rac- and Rho-mediated rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton induced by platelet-derived growth factor and other growth factors (16Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Nobes C. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK activity has been implicated in cell migration and was shown to directly phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase, suggesting a role for ERK in the regulation of cytoskeleton and focal contact dynamics (18Klemke R.L.

In v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts, both ERK and PI3K are translocated to focal adhesions upon v-Src activation (20Fincham V.J. Brunton V.J. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6518-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2911-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that both pathways participate in cellular adhesion dynamic during transformation. We report here that activation of MEK, but not PI3K, is required for the morphological changes and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by v-Src expression in rat fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that v-Src-induced cytoskeleton disruption results from inactivation of Rho-mediated stress fiber assembly, and we provide evidence that MEK contributes to this inactivation.

Oregon Green-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated, and all tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies. Normal NRK cells were from ATCC (NRK ATCC CRL 1570). NRK/4.435 are Rous sarcoma virus-transformed NRK cells (22Matsumura F. Lin J.J.-C. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Thomas G.P. Topp W.C. J. Biol.

All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cultures of tsNRK/src cells were started at 37 °C for 24 h before transfer to the experimental temperature of 40 or 33 °C for restrictive or permissive growth, respectively. U0126 (25 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), and LY294002 (10 μm) (all from Calbiochem) resuspended in Me2SO or Me2SO alone as a control were used to pretreat tsNRK/src cells for 1 h before transferring from restrictive to permissive temperature or directly added to NRK or NRK/4.435 cells. After various times, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence or lysed for Western blotting. Constitutively active RhoV14 was described previously (8Helfman D.M. Levy E.T. Berthier C. Shtutman M.

The pEF-Bos-Myc-Rho-kinase/CAT construct, encoding Myc-tagged activated Rho-kinase, and the pCAG-Myc-160-ROCK construct, encoding wild-type ROCK, were kindly provided by K. Kaibuchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan) and S. Narumyia (Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Wild-type LIMK1 (GFP-LIMK) and constitutively active LIMK1 (GFP-LIMK-KL) constructs were a generous gift of O. Bernard (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia). Cells plated onto glass coverslips were transfected with a total of 2 μg of expression plasmid per well, using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were harvested 24 h post-transfection and processed for immunofluorescence. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Incubations with primary antibodies against vinculin (1:400), hemagglutinin tag (1:800), or Myc tag (1:500) were conducted at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) for 45 min. To stain actin, fixed cells were incubated with Oregon Green- or Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. Cells were finally stained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and coverslips were mounted using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Samples were examined, and pictures were acquired on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Photometrics SenSys cooled CCD camera using Image 2.0.5 software (Oncor). All photographs were taken at the same magnification. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate before direct extraction in 2% SDS Laemmli sample buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), and protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After incubation with primary antibodies, followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of GTP-bound Rho was performed using the Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the RhoA-binding domain of rhotekin expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was used to affinity-precipitate GTP-bound Rho from cells lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Precipitated Rho-GTP was then detected by immunoblot analysis, using a polyclonal anti-Rho (-A, -B, -C) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). NRK cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src (tsNRK/src cells) (23Atkinson M.M. Menko A.S. Johnson R.G. Sheppard J.R. Sheridan J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were used to study the modifications in cytoskeleton organization that occur during transformation of fibroblasts by the v-Src oncogene. Cells were shifted from the restrictive temperature of 40 °C to the permissive temperature, 33 °C, at which the v-Src protein is stabilized and activated, and their morphology was examined after 24 h by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.1A). tsNRK/src cells maintained at 40 °C exhibited a characteristic fibroblastic morphology, with well developed actin stress fibers and vinculin-containing focal adhesions (Fig. 1A). A striking loss of these structures was observed upon v-Src activation, 24 h after the shift at 33 °C. Actin filaments accumulated in patches at the cell periphery, whereas vinculin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Stress fiber formation is under the control of the Rho family of small GTPases. More specifically, activation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway leads to stress fiber assembly by both activation of actomyosin contractility and suppression of the actin-severing activity of cofilin (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). A Rho-GTP pull-down assay was performed to measure the activity of endogenous Rho. There was little difference between Rho-GTP levels in tsNRK/src cells maintained at 40 °C, versus cells shifted at 33 °C (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the loss of stress fibers induced by v-Src was not associated with a direct down-regulation of Rho activity. Next, we assessed the activation status of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway, by measuring the level of phosphorylation of cofilin, which is the terminal effector of this cascade (10Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Using a phosphospecific antibody, we found that cofilin phosphorylation decreased in a time-dependent manner in cells shifted to 33 °C, compared with cells maintained at 40 °C (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results suggest that activity of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway was decreased upon v-Src activation, downstream of Rho. To further address whether cytoskeleton disruption induced by v-Src involves inactivation of Rho-mediated stress fiber assembly, we transiently transfected tsNRK/src cells with constitutively active mutants of Rho, ROCK and LIMK. All of these constructs further increased stress fiber assembly in cells maintained at 40 °C (not shown). In cells transformed by v-Src (i.e. shifted to 33 °C), expression of these mutants overcame the effects of v-Src on the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2). RhoV14 induced a thin network of actin filaments, whereas cells transfected with Rho-kinase/CAT (2Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) exhibited well developed stress fibers and were hypercontractile, probably reflecting enhanced actomyosin contractility. Active LIMK (24Zebda N. Bernard O. Bailly M. Welti S. Lawrence D.S. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which acts downstream of ROCK to cause actin remodeling through inactivation of the actin-severing activity of cofilin (9Yang N.

Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), produced thick actin fibers. Thus, in addition to the previously described effects of RhoV14 (13Fincham V.J. Chudleidgh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data provide the first demonstration that expression of active mutants of ROCK and LIMK suppresses v-Src-induced loss of stress fibers. Taken together, these results indicate that in NRK cells, the activated v-Src tyrosine kinase antagonizes the activity of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway and perturbs the actin assembly/disassembly cycle as a consequence. Activation of v-Src induces several signaling pathways, among which are the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. To determine whether these pathways were implicated in v-Src-induced morphological transformation, tsNRK/src cells were shifted from the restrictive temperature of 40 °C to the permissive temperature, 33 °C, in the presence of 25 μm U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), 10 μm LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), or Me2SO alone as a control. Upon shifting to 33 °C, both ERK and Akt were phosphorylated, demonstrating that the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways were activated in tsNRK/src cells (Fig.3A). In the presence of U0126, ERK phosphorylation was inhibited, whereas Akt activation was unaffected. Conversely, treatment with LY294002 led to a complete inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, whereas the ERK pathway remained activated. As shown in Fig. 3A, neither the level of expression of v-Src nor its activation, as assessed by Western blotting with an antiserum specific for the autophosphorylated Tyr416 of v-Src, were significantly altered by U0126 or LY294002. These results demonstrate that U0126 and LY294002 can be used to specifically inhibit the MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways, respectively, without any major effects on v-Src expression or activity. Morphology of the cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence after 24 h of treatment with the different inhibitors. As described for Fig. 1A, tsNRK/src cells maintained at 40 °C exhibited well developed actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas cells shifted at 33 °C were devoid of these structures (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of MEK by U0126, before and throughout the shift to permissive temperature, prevented the disruption of stress fibers and focal contacts (Fig. 3B). To eliminate the possibility that U0126 may protect actin stress fibers and focal contacts by acting on MKK5 rather than MEK1/2, we used the structurally unrelated MEK inhibitor PD098059, which was shown to have no inhibitory effects toward MKK5 below 100 μm (26Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effects being MEK-dependent, treatment of tsNRK/src cells with 50 μm PD098059 led to effects similar to those of U0126 (data not shown). Both compounds were used throughout this study, and only the results obtained with U0126 will be described hereafter. By contrast, inhibition of PI3K by a 10 μm concentration of the LY294002 compound had no protective effect, and cells still exhibited a transformed morphology (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicated that morphological transformation induced by v-Src is mediated by a MEK-dependent pathway but does not require activation of PI3K. The data presented in Fig. 3A demonstrated that the MEK inhibitor did not inactivate the v-Src protein itself and rather suggested that it interfered with a v-Src-induced signaling pathway, leading to cytoskeleton disruption. Therefore, we tested whether MEK was implicated in v-Src-induced inactivation of Rho-dependent signaling. The level of cofilin phosphorylation was measured in cells shifted to 33 °C in the presence of U0126. Dephosphorylation of cofilin was significantly prevented by treatment with U0126 (Fig.4), suggesting that the ability of this compound to prevent the loss of stress fibers is correlated with its ability to prevent inactivation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway upon v-Src activation. Similar results were obtained with an established v-Src-transformed cell line (NRK/4.435), when the inhibitors were added after transformation had become established. Immunofluorescence labeling showed that the punctated actin staining characteristic of NRK/4.435 cells was reorganized into thick bundles of actin stress fibers, associated with vinculin-containing focal contacts, upon treatment with 25 μm U0126 (Fig.5A). By contrast, cells incubated with 20 μm LY294002 still exhibited a disrupted actin cytoskeleton, despite some accumulation of actin at the cell-cell boundaries. Restoration of the actin cytoskeleton upon MEK inhibition was correlated with induction of cofilin phosphorylation (Fig.5B), suggesting that the ROCK-LIMK-cofilin pathway was functionally restored. Taken together, these results establish MEK as an effector of v-Src-induced morphological transformation, participating in v-Src-mediated inactivation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway. To determine how MEK participates in Rho signaling inactivation upon v-Src induction, we assessed the level of expression of the different components of the cascade by Western blot. We found that expression of both ROCKI and ROCKII was greatly decreased in the established NRK/4.435 cells compared with untransformed NRK cells (Fig.6), thus interrupting the Rho-ROCK-LIMK signaling cascade. Upon treatment with U0126, ROCK expression returned to a level similar to that seen in parental NRK cells (Fig. 6), consistent with the ability of this compound to induce cofilin phosphorylation and to restore stress fiber assembly (Fig. 5). To demonstrate the requirement for ROCK activity in the MEK inhibitor effects, we treated NRK/4.435 cells with U0126 in the presence of Y27632, an inhibitor of ROCK. Under these conditions, treatment with U0126 failed to restore stress fibers, thus demonstrating that its effects are mediated by the ROCK pathway (not shown). These results demonstrate that chronic activation of the MEK pathway in v-Src-transformed cells uncouples Rho from stress fiber formation by down-regulating expression of ROCK, a downstream component of the cascade. In tsNRK/src cells, no significant differences were detected in the levels of expression of the different effectors of Rho, between cells maintained at 40 °C or shifted to 33 °C for 24h or 48h (not shown). However, we found that overexpression of wild-type ROCK or wild-type LIMK led to stress fiber formation in cells maintained at 40 °C as well as in cells shifted to 33 °C (Fig.7). In addition to the results presented in Fig. 1, this experiment further shows that Rho is still active in the v-Src-transformed cells (i.e. at 33 °C) but uncoupled from its downstream effectors.Figure 7Expression of wild-type ROCK or LIMK induces stress fiber assembly. tsNRK/src cells maintained at 40 °C or shifted to 33 °C for 24 h were transiently transfected with expressing constructs encoding Myc-tagged wild-type ROCK or GFP-tagged wild-type LIMK. Coverslips were harvested 24 h post-transfection and stained for actin using phalloidin. Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence or 9E10 mAb to the Myc tag, followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The v-Src oncoprotein severely perturbs the dynamic assembly and disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. The regulation of stress fiber and focal adhesion formation is of particular interest due to the putative role of these structures in the regulation of cell growth (12Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27Hunter T. Cell. 1997; 88: 333-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The conditional temperature-sensitive mutants of v-Src are therefore useful tools to study the early events associated with disruption of the organized actin cytoskeleton. The findings reported here indicate that activation of the MEK pathway, together with inactivation of Rho-dependent signaling, is required for the loss of stress fibers and dissolution of focal contacts induced by v-Src. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activated MEK mediates inactivation of Rho-dependent signaling. MEK/ERK are targeted to focal adhesions upon v-Src activation (21Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2911-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and are therefore likely mediators of v-Src effects on the actin cytoskeleton. In fact, we found that upon v-Src activation, MEK inhibitor-treated tsNRK/src cells did not undergo the complete reorganization of actin filaments characteristic of v-Src-transformed cells. They retained stress fibers and focal contacts and did not form the numerous dotlike podosomes seen in control cells shifted to 33 °C in the absence of inhibitors. In this study, we also demonstrate that after inhibition of MEK in NRK cells already transformed by v-Src (NRK/4.435), cells undergo a phenotypic reversion, during which the focal adhesion-associated protein vinculin relocated from cytoplasm to cell-extracellular matrix contacts, whereas actin was assembled into bundles of stress fibers. These results show that MEK is implicated in both induction of the v-Src-transformed phenotype and maintenance of this phenotype once transformation is established. Our results contrast with what has been observed in chicken embryo fibroblasts, in which morphological transformation by v-Src was not blocked by inhibition of either PI3K or Ras/ERK activity (28Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the phase-contrast morphology of the cells. Similarly, little change was observed in tsNRK/src cells by phase contrast. 2G. Pawlak and D. M. Helfman, unpublished results. However, while the authors concluded that inhibition of Ras did not block morphological transformation by v-Src (28Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), our indirect immunofluorescence analysis reveal more profound modifications in cell morphology and cytoskeleton organization and demonstrate implication of MEK in this process. Modifications in cytoskeleton organization are often indicative of altered Rho function, and in fact, inactivation of the cellular function of Rho has been previously suggested as a mechanism leading to cytoskeleton disorganization upon v-Src expression (13Fincham V.J. Chudleidgh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mayer T. Meyer M. Janning A. Shiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transfections with an active mutant of Rho was shown to restore stress fiber assembly in v-Src-transformed cells (14Mayer T. Meyer M. Janning A. Shiedel A.C. Barnekow A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Rho protein acts downstream of v-Src. Rho effects on the actin cytoskeleton are mediated by several effectors, among which are mDia and ROCK (3Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumyia S. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Even if the involvement of mDia cannot be excluded, our transfection experiments clearly demonstrate that activation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway is sufficient to restore stress fiber assembly in v-Src-transformed cells, since expression of active mutants of ROCK or LIMK suppresses v-Src-induced loss of stress fibers (Fig. 3). To assess the activation status of the Rho pathway, we measured the level of phosphorylation of cofilin. Activation of ROCK by Rho leads to activation of the kinase activity of LIMK and thereby phosphorylation of cofilin (9Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 11Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The severing activity of cofilin is then inhibited by phosphorylation (29Nagaoka R. Abe H. Obinata T. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our Western blot analysis of the cofilin phosphorylation level therefore provides a relevant measure of the activation status of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway and demonstrates inactivation of Rho-dependent signaling upon v-Src expression in NRK cells. At the same time, no decrease in the level of Rho-GTP was found in cells transformed by v-Src (i.e. at 33 °C), thus demonstrating that the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway was interrupted downstream of Rho. Taken together, these results demonstrate that v-Src-induced inactivation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway is required for cytoskeleton disruption in NRK cells. Direct phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins could also be a mechanism for v-Src-induced cytoskeleton disruption. Indeed, several proteins localized in focal contacts are tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells, including vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (30Rohrschneider L. Reynolds S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 11: 3097-3107Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that MEK inhibitors are able to prevent the alterations of the cytoskeleton induced by v-Src without affecting the kinase activity of v-Src (Fig. 3A). From these data, we reasoned that the morphological changes induced by v-Src were more likely to be mediated by the Rho pathway and that inhibition of MEK was interrupting the signal from v-Src to Rho. Indeed, we demonstrated that MEK participates in v-Src-induced inactivation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway, since inhibition of MEK during v-Src activation prevented dephosphorylation of cofilin, consistent with the ability of this compound to prevent the loss of stress fibers. In cells stably transformed by v-Src (NRK/4.435), we identified the mechanism by which MEK mediates v-Src-induced inactivation of Rho signaling. We found that constitutive activation of MEK leads to down-regulation of both ROCKI and ROCKII expression, thus interrupting the Rho-ROCK-LIMK cascade. We have previously shown that the very same mechanism leads to cytoskeleton disruption in response to oncogenic Ras (32Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). But it is likely that the decreased expression of ROCK is the result of a selection in response to high levels of ERK signaling, during the establishment of the cell lines, since the level of expression of ROCK did not change during acute transformation of tsNRK/src cells. However, transfection of wild-type ROCK induced stress fiber formation in tsNRK/src cells, even at 33 °C, suggesting that Rho is uncoupled from its downstream effector, even if the level of expression of ROCK did not change. This result raises the possibility that the endogenous ROCK may have been relocated upon v-Src activation, thereby becoming inaccessible to Rho. Such a mechanism has been recently demonstrated in Ras-transformed fibroblasts (33Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these results establish MEK as an effector of v-Src-induced morphological transformation, participating in v-Src-mediated inactivation of the Rho-ROCK-LIMK pathway. This work, together with other studies (32Pawlak G. Helfman D.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Sahai E. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), demonstrates that two functionally different oncogenes, namely the small GTPase Ras and the tyrosine kinase v-Src, use the same signaling pathway to achieve morphological transformation of fibroblasts, i.e.inactivation of Rho-mediated stress fiber assembly through activation of MEK (Fig. 8). Further characterization of the pathway linking MEK to Rho-dependent signaling is therefore a crucial step toward understanding the morphological effects of these oncogenes, and experiments are in progress to elucidate this link, both in Ras-transformed and v-Src-transformed cells.

When the regulatory sites of troponin do not have bound Ca2+, tropomyosin is located on the actin outer domain. In this position tropomyosin sterically interferes with much more of the myosin-binding site than it does in the presence of Ca2+, and therefore contraction is inhibited at low Ca2+ concentrations. This regulatory scheme is supported by three-dimensional helical reconstructions of thin filaments examined by electron microscopy with negative staining (1Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P.

J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how troponin affects the position of tropomyosin on actin, and more generally the inhibitory action of troponin is not well understood at a structural level, as opposed to better understandings of tropomyosin.Troponin consists of a relatively globular domain (including TnI1 and TnC) and an elongated tail region, the NH2 terminus of TnT (6Flicker P.F.

Phillips G.N., Jr. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The inhibitory actions of troponin have long been attributed to the TnI subunit. Skeletal muscle TnI inhibits the actin-myosin ATPase rate in the absence of the other troponin subunits TnC and TnT (8Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2125-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and this effect requires lower TnI concentrations in the presence rather than in the absence of tropomyosin (11Perry S.V. Cole H.A. Head J.F. Wilson F.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 251-262Crossref Google Scholar). Cardiac TnI has similar properties, although the inhibition is less effective (12Guo X.

The inhibitory effects of skeletal muscle TnI can be mimicked by the so-called inhibitory peptide, residues 96–116 (10Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), or identically by the corresponding cardiac peptide (14Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reversal of inhibition is related to Ca2+-dependent TnI-TnC interactions, elucidated in part at the atomic level (16Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An additional TnI region, approximately 130–150 residues, has also been implicated in inhibition (17Luo Y., Wu, J.L., Li, B. Langsetmo K. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Rarick H.M., Tu, X.H. Martin A.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These and other data are consistent with an inhibitory mechanism consisting primarily of a TnI-actin interaction that is reversed by Ca2+, i.e. a localized actin-troponin interaction tethers the much longer tropomyosin on the actin outer domain in the absence, but not in the presence, of Ca2+. Indeed, our own electron microscope results show that Ca2+ causes a decrease in troponin density in contact with actin (20Lehman W. Rosol M. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, no high resolution data exists for these interactions, or for the assembled thin filament, and it remains possible that other mechanisms are also important for regulation and for determining the shifting positions of tropomyosin on the actin surface.This report describes new and unexpected attributes of the troponin tail, i.e. the NH2 terminus of TnT. In the absence of all other portions of troponin, including TnI, cardiac TnT-(1–153) inhibited the interaction of myosin with actin-tropomyosin filaments. Helical reconstruction of filaments indicated that the isolated troponin tail caused tropomyosin to bind preferentially to the actin outer domain, a position in which tropomyosin sterically interferes with strong myosin binding to actin. The results indicate that the troponin tail contributes directly to the inhibition of muscle contraction that occurs in the absence of calcium.DISCUSSIONA principal observation in this report is that, in the presence of tropomyosin, the TnT NH2 terminus inhibits the interactions between myosin and the thin filament, suppressing strong myosin-actin binding, the maximal actomyosin ATPase rate, and the rate of filament sliding. Previous studies have clearly indicated that the inhibitory properties of troponin involve the globular, TnI-containing region of the troponin complex (for review, see Refs. 49Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar and 58Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). However, the current results indicate that striking inhibition is produced independently by another region of the extended troponin molecule: the troponin tail fragment TnT-(1–153) examined in this report. This unexpected result has implications both for the function of the troponin tail region, and for the overall mechanism of thin filament-mediated regulation.The first functional characterizations of the troponin tail region employed rabbit fast skeletal muscle TnT chymotryptic fragment TnT-(1) (59Ohtsuki I.

TnT-(1) does not interact with TnC or TnI, and extends away from the globular region of troponin to form an elongated structure that binds to a long segment of tropomyosin (62Cabral-Lilly D. Tobacman L.S. Mehegan J.P. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1996; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TnT-(1) increases the cooperativity with which myosin S1 converts actin-tropomyosin filaments to the M- or active state (63Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In a new report by Maytum and colleagues, (84Maytum, R., Geeves, M. A., and Lehrer, S. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar) TnT-(1) was found to be inhibitory to myosin S1, similar to the actions of the cardiac construct TnT-(1–153) examined in the present article. Similarly, Ohtsuki and co-workers (65Nakamura S. Yamamoto K. Hashimoto K. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 1639-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 66Onoyama Y. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found that TnT-(1) inhibited both superprecipitation and actomyosin ATPase rates in the presence of tropomyosin, TnI, and TnC. This agreement supports the generality of our findings that the troponin tail, in the absence of the troponin I-containing globular domain, has substantial inhibitory effects.On the other hand, the detailed studies of Maytum et al.(84Maytum, R., Geeves, M. A., and Lehrer, S. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar) suggest that TnT-(1) stabilizes the C-state of the thin filament, rather than the B-state now observed with the cardiac troponin tail fragment. Thus, the two troponin tail fragments appear to act by different mechanisms. One possible explanation is that selected experimental methods differ in the two studies: TnT-(1) has not been examined by electron microscopy, nor have the effects of TnT-(1–153) on S1-thin filament binding kinetics been determined. These methods generally agree, but not always (57Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the most likely explanation for the discrepancy is that structural differences between the peptides result in different behavior. TnT-(1–153) of the current study shares high homology to skeletal TnT-(1) only in one region: cardiac TnT residues 74–153 are 80% homologous to skeletal muscle TnT residues 54–133. The more NH2-terminal parts of the peptides are not homologous, and TnT-(1) contains 31 conserved residues at its COOH terminus that are not included in TnT-(1–153). These dissimilarities may explain why the cardiac TnT fragment inhibits myosin S1 ATPase activity more than does skeletal muscle TnT-(1), and also why the cardiac fragment stabilizes the B-state rather than the C-state. (Note that these two functional differences are distinct; the degree of ATPase inhibition does not always correlate with the presence of the B-state (33Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 55Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20788-20794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).) Unfortunately, a cardiac TnT fragment similar to skeletal muscle TnT-(1) has poor solubility (22Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), making the importance of the additional COOH-terminal residues in skeletal muscle TnT-(1) difficult to test.Subtle differences in the amino acid sequence of either tropomyosin or actin can lead to a change in the equilibrium position of tropomyosin on actin (57Lehman W. Hatch V. Korman V.L. Rosol M. Thomas L.T. Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Van Eyk J.E. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that different fragments of TnT in either the presence or the absence of S1 may perturb M-state to C-state to B-state equilibria to different extents. Interestingly, very different properties were reported for an NH2-terminal fragment of skeletal muscle TnT that is still longer than TnT-(1), by 27 conserved residues. Unlike the results with both cardiac TnT-(1–153) and skeletal TnT-(1), skeletal fragment TnT-(1–191) causes a modest increase in the myosin-actin-tropomyosin ATPase rate (68Malnic B. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), similar to findings with holo-TnT (69Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J.

Although the regulatory effects of TnT-(1–191) (and holo-TnT) were not examined in detail, the available data suggest that different regions of the troponin tail have distinct effects on the thin filament, and sometimes opposite effects on myosin-thin filament interactions. The same conclusions can be inferred from more indirect approaches to these issues: deletional (71Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 44: C200-C207Crossref Google Scholar) analyses of the TnT NH2 terminus. However, interpretation of some of the earlier data is complicated by the high likelihood of a non-native structure for the TnT COOH terminus in the absence of TnI and TnC (78Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 170aAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Also, despite the near-native folding implied by the tight and specific binding of TnT-(1–153) to the thin filament, it is possible that the troponin tail peptide properties are affected by non-native structure. These several considerations, and the complex nature of thin filament activation, require that interpretations be made with caution.Nevertheless, when considered in sum the current and previous reports suggest that the troponin tail produces specific interactions that stabilize tropomyosin binding to actin in the B-state position, and separate interactions that stabilize the C-state. When studied as an isolated peptide, this can result in an equilibrium favoring one or the other state, depending on the construct. This conclusion advances understanding of the regulatory mechanism when it is combined with previous results, which have shown that when Ca2+ binds to troponin, selected TnI sites move further from actin (79Tao T. Gong B.J. Leavis P.C. Science. 1990; 247: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 80Miki M. Kobayashi T. Kimura H. Hagiwara A. Hai H. Maeda Y. J. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and there is decreased troponin density near actin (20Lehman W. Rosol M. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ca2+-mediated detachment of part of TnI from actin has been generally viewed as critical for the switching of the thin filament out of the B-state. The current work does not refute this viewpoint, but rather shows that it is incomplete; it is now clear that Ca2+ must also reverse other interactions that strongly stabilize the B-state, interactions involving TnT-(1–153).Because both TnT-(1–153) and the inhibitory peptide of TnI promote formation of the B-state, it is unclear how the thin filament switches to the more activated C-state in the presence of Ca2+. We have suggested previously (48Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the B to C transition includes an active process, and involves more than a passive release of TnI from actin. TnT may contribute to this (48Dahiya R. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as also proposed by Potter et al. (69Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The present work supports the more detailed conclusion that the C-state is stabilized by Ca2+-triggerred actions of portions of troponin other than TnT-(1–153). In analogy to the quaternary structure behavior of allosteric systems in general, the tropomyosin-troponin tail complex presumably interacts broadly with alternative sites on actin, as the complex shifts its position on the actin surface. The stabilization of the B-state by the cardiac troponin tail, in the absence of TnI, suggests significant gaps in our understanding of thin filament activation, and reinforces the importance of further work on the structure of the actin-troponin-tropomyosin complex.Finally, it is notable that the properties of tropomyosin-TnT-(1–153) on the MgATPase rate V max, sliding speed, and the cooperativity of myosin S1 binding to actin in each case exaggerate similar effects produced by tropomyosin alone. The simplest explanation, as stated above, is that these effects are because of greater stabilization of the B-state when TnT-(1–153) is present. However, this need not be the only mechanism, and there may be several functional differences between tropomyosin alone and tropomyosin in complex with the troponin tail. For example, TnT and tropomyosin have extended regions of contact with each other when co-crystallized (62Cabral-Lilly D. Tobacman L.S. Mehegan J.P. Cohen C. Biophys. J. 1996; 73: 1763-1770Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that when tropomyosin binds to the troponin tail, the resultant complex may be less flexible than is implied by studies of tropomyosin alone (83Brown J.H. Greenfield N.J. Dominguez R. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A full understanding of regulation will require the explication of the cooperative transitions among the several states of the thin filament, active and inactive. The flexibility of the tropomyosin-troponin strand is a critical aspect of regulation because of its potential to alter the cooperativity of these transitions,i.e. the longitudinal propagation of conformational change along the thin filament (28Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27587-27593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 64Smith D.A. J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 2001; 34: 4507-4523Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We predict that the troponin tail region will prove important for this cooperative aspect of thin filament function. Calcium binding to the thin filament protein troponin is required for cardiac and skeletal muscles to contract, and several studies indicate that this regulation involves shifting the tropomyosin position on the actin filament. When the regulatory sites of troponin do not have bound Ca2+, tropomyosin is located on the actin outer domain. In this position tropomyosin sterically interferes with much more of the myosin-binding site than it does in the presence of Ca2+, and therefore contraction is inhibited at low Ca2+ concentrations. This regulatory scheme is supported by three-dimensional helical reconstructions of thin filaments examined by electron microscopy with negative staining (1Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 2Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol.

J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sPubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is consistent with the solution kinetics of myosin S1-thin filament binding in the absence of ATP (5McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how troponin affects the position of tropomyosin on actin, and more generally the inhibitory action of troponin is not well understood at a structural level, as opposed to better understandings of tropomyosin. Troponin consists of a relatively globular domain (including TnI1 and TnC) and an elongated tail region, the NH2 terminus of TnT (6Flicker P.F. Phillips G.N., Jr. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips G.N., Jr. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The inhibitory actions of troponin have long been attributed to the TnI subunit. Skeletal muscle TnI inhibits the actin-myosin ATPase rate in the absence of the other troponin subunits TnC and TnT (8Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2125-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and this effect requires lower TnI concentrations in the presence rather than in the absence of tropomyosin (11Perry S.V. Cole H.A. Head J.F. Wilson F.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 251-262Crossref Google Scholar). Cardiac TnI has similar properties, although the inhibition is less effective (12Guo X.

The inhibitory effects of skeletal muscle TnI can be mimicked by the so-called inhibitory peptide, residues 96–116 (10Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J.A. Nature. 1978; 271: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), or identically by the corresponding cardiac peptide (14Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reversal of inhibition is related to Ca2+-dependent TnI-TnC interactions, elucidated in part at the atomic level (16Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An additional TnI region, approximately 130–150 residues, has also been implicated in inhibition (17Luo Y., Wu, J.L., Li, B. Langsetmo K. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Rarick H.M., Tu, X.H. Martin A.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These and other data are consistent with an inhibitory mechanism consisting primarily of a TnI-actin interaction that is reversed by Ca2+, i.e. a localized actin-troponin interaction tethers the much longer tropomyosin on the actin outer domain in the absence, but not in the presence, of Ca2+. Indeed, our own electron microscope results show that Ca2+ causes a decrease in troponin density in contact with actin (20Lehman W. Rosol M. Tobacman L.S. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, no high resolution data exists for these interactions, or for the assembled thin filament, and it remains possible that other mechanisms are also important for regulation and for determining the shifting positions of tropomyosin on the actin surface. This report describes new and unexpected attributes of the troponin tail, i.e. the NH2 terminus of TnT. In the absence of all other portions of troponin, including TnI, cardiac TnT-(1–153) inhibited the interaction of myosin with actin-tropomyosin filaments. Helical reconstruction of filaments indicated that the isolated troponin tail caused tropomyosin to bind preferentially to the actin outer domain, a position in which tropomyosin sterically interferes with strong myosin binding to actin. The results indicate that the troponin tail contributes directly to the inhibition of muscle contraction that occurs in the absen"

We investigated how integrin-associated Ca2+signaling might be coupled to focal adhesion (FA) dynamics by visualizing the effects of Ca2+ spikes on FAs using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FAK and FRNK. We report that Ca2+ spikes are temporally correlated with movement and disassembly of FAs, but not their formation. FRNK transfection did not affect generation of Ca2+ spikes, although cell morphology was altered, with fewer FAs of larger size and having a more peripheral localization being observed. Larger sized FAs in FRNK-transfected cells were not disassembled by Ca2+ spikes, providing a possible explanation for impaired Ca2+-dependent migration in these cells. Stress fiber end movements initiated by Ca2+ spikes were visualized using GFP-tagged myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Ca2+-associated movements of stress fiber ends and FAs had similar kinetics, suggesting that stress fibers and FAs move in a coordinated fashion. This indicates that increases in Ca2+ likely trigger disassembly of adhesive structures that involves disruption of integrin-extracellular matrix interactions, supporting a key role for Ca2+-sensitive inside-out signaling in cell migration.

Adhesive sites are dynamic membrane structures that vary in size and composition during migration. Integrins, actin stress fibers (SFs)1 and other structural proteins, and regulatory signaling molecules cluster at focal adhesions (2Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions (FAs) serve as points of traction for contractile forces underlying forward cell movement and their dynamics are finely regulated. For example, FAs are highly motile in stationary fibroblasts but are largely stationary in migrating fibroblasts, thereby transducing contractile forces into movement (3Smilenov L.B. Mikhailov A. Pelham R.J. Marcantonio E.E. Gundersen G.G. Science. 1999; 286: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of a molecular clutch that couples cytoskeleton-mediated traction and cell contraction. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated and localized at FAs upon cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM; Refs. 4Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin.

FAK-related non-Kinase (FRNK), the non-catalytic C-terminal portion of FAK containing the FA targeting sequence, is also expressed as a separate dominant negative protein (7Richardson A. Parsons T.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The differential expression of FAK and FRNK is transcriptionally regulated, each of these proteins having distinct promoters within the FAK gene (8Nolan K. Lacoste J. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

When overexpressed in cells, FRNK acts as a negative regulator of FAK activity, inhibiting phosphorylation of FAK and different FAK-related processes, including cell cycle progression (9Zhao J.H.

This suggests that the inhibitory effects of FRNK in migration might arise from altered FAK localization and phosphorylation. We and others reported that migration is dependent on Ca2+signaling in astrocytoma (14Rondé P. Giannone G. Gerasymova I. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Haiech J. Biochim. Biophys.

These data indicate that Ca2+ signaling may be a component of the molecular clutch regulating transitions between stationary and non-stationary FAs. To test whether Ca2+ signaling affects FA organization, confocal microscopy was used to visualize simultaneously Ca2+ levels and dynamics of FAs or actin SFs in U87 cells expressing FA (FAK, FNRK) or cytoskeletal (MLCK) proteins tagged with GFP. We report that Ca2+ spikes trigger movement and disassembly of FAs. Although FRNK expression did not suppress Ca2+-dependent FA disassembly, more Ca2+-insensitive FAs having a larger surface were observed in FRNK cells. Our results provide an explanation linking FA disassembly to a temporally accurate cellular signal. Cell culture media (EMEM), fetal calf serum, HEPES, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and trypsin-EDTA were from Invitrogen; Fura Red-AM, BAPTA-AM, and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes; Matrigel and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) against FAK kinase domain were from Interchim; phalloidin-TRITC, mAb against the FAK C-terminal region (amino acids 1039–1052), and anti-MLCK mAb were from Sigma; the anti-Tyr397-phosphorylated FAK Ab was from BIOSOURCE; secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Abs were from Promega; the FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse (GAM-FITC) Ab was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The human astrocytoma U87 cell line was obtained from the ATCC. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 in air on type I collagen (0.06 mg/ml)-coated plastic dishes in EMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.6 mg/ml glutamine, 200 IU/ml penicillin, 200 IU/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin. Fluorescent FA-targeted protein was made by fusion of FAK (human T lymphocyte pCDM8-FAK plasmid; Ref.40Whitney G.S. Chan P.Y. Blake J. Cosand W.L. Neubauer M.G. Aruffo A. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) next to the 3′ end of “yellow Cameleon-2” (pcDNA3-Ycam2 plasmid; Ref. 22Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). To allow fusion of FAK in continuity with the Ycam2 reading frame, the stop codon next to EYFP was replaced by a tyrosine codon (QuikChange, Stratagene). FAK cDNA was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer containing a MfeI site and a 3′ primer containing a NheI site. The FAK PCR product was digested with MfeI and NheI and cloned in the corresponding compatible sites, EcoRI and XbaI, located in the multiple cloning site of the newly mutated pcDNA3-YCam2 vector, adjacent to EYFP, to give FAK-Ycam. To create FRNK-Ycam, the FRNK domain was amplified by PCR using pCDM8-FAK as template, a forward primer with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end of the glutamic acid codon 681 relative to the FAK start codon, and the same reverse primer as for FAK amplification, adding a NheI site. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI andNheI and cloned in-frame with the EYFP coding sequence in the EcoRI/XbaI compatible sites of the mutated pcDNA3-Ycam2 vector. The MLCK-210-GFP construct (24Kudryashov S.K. Chibalina M.V. Birukov K.G. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was in pEGFP vector (CLONTECH). All constructs were verified by sequencing. The plasmids were isolated (JetStar, Genomed) before transfection by electroporation. Cells (5 × 106) were resuspended at 108 cell/ml in EP buffer (in mm: 50 K2HPO4, 20 CH3CO2K, 20 KOH, pH 7.4). Plasmidic DNA (2 μg of construct-encoding plasmid, 8 μg of pBluescript) was diluted in 100 μl of EP buffer; 4 μl of 1m MgSO4 were added and incubated with 50 μl of cell suspension for 20 min at room temperature. The cell/DNA mixture was electroporated in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser; 500 microfarads, 240 V). Cells were then placed in 10 ml of EMEM with 10% fetal calf serum in 80-mm2 dishes. Cells were selected 24 h later using 800 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) and maintained with 400 μg/ml G418. Cells were sorted to obtain >80% expressing cells using a flow cytometer (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson) before use. A wound-healing migration model was used, as described previously (15Scherberich A. Campos-Toimil M. Rondé P. Takeda K. Beretz A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 653-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAK-Ycam or FRNK-Ycam cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were grown to confluence in Matrigel-coated (178 μg/ml) Petri dishes. After 24-h serum starvation, a rectangular lesion was made, cells were rinsed and incubated with medium with or without the tested compound. After 24 h of migration, three fields at the lesion border were acquired using a CCD camera (Panasonic) on an inverted microscope (Olympus IMT2, 10× phase objective). In each field, migration distance for the 10 most mobile cells was measured using Image Tool software (available by FTP from maxrad6.uthscsa.edu). For BAPTA experiments, cells were first loaded (45 min) with 20 μm BAPTA-AM in the incubator prior to creation of lesions. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured using Fura Red by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad 1024, krypton-argon laser 488 nm; Nikon Eclipse TE300, 40× oil-immersion CFI Plan-Fluor n.a. 1.3 objective) alone or simultaneously with FA or SF dynamics. Cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) expressing FAK-Ycam, FRNK-Ycam, or MLCK-GFP were grown to subconfluence on Matrigel in Petri dishes in which a 2-cm diameter hole had been cut in the base and replaced by a thin (0.07 mm) coverslip (41Lynch J. Soares Lemos V. Bucher B. Stoclet J.C. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8226-8233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 or 72 h, cells in culture medium were loaded with 10 μmFura Red-AM and 0.03% pluronic acid (45 min) in the incubator and then washed two times with Ringer solution (in mm: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 11 glucose, pH 7.4). Imaging of single cells in Ringer solution was done at 30 °C, at 585 ± 10 nm for Ca2+ alone, at 1-s intervals, usually for 15 min. For simultaneous measurements of Ca2+(at 585 nm) and FA (Ycam constructs) or SF (MLCK-GFP) dynamics, images at 522 ± 16 nm were acquired simultaneously every 10 s (EYFP) and 15 s (EGFP), usually for 30 min. Images were taken at the bottom cell surface. NIH Image software was used to assess FA surface areas and the dynamics of FAs and SFs. For FA size distributions, FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam cells having similar expression levels were used. Fluorescent FAs were selected by thresholding using NIH Image. The same threshold was applied to all cells, corresponding FA pixel areas were calculated and converted to μm2. This analysis was done to determine the size of both immobile and motile, Ca2+-sensitive FAs. FA movement and disassembly triggered by a Ca2+ spike were visualized using a color overlay representation of three sequential images (3Smilenov L.B. Mikhailov A. Pelham R.J. Marcantonio E.E. Gundersen G.G. Science. 1999; 286: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). FAK-Ycam, FRNK-Ycam, or MLCK-GFP cells were plated at low density on Matrigel for 2 days and then treated or not with 1 μm thapsigargin. At the indicated time, cultures were washed with cold PBS and then incubated with lysis buffer (1% Triton-X100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNaP2O7, in PBS, supplemented with an anti-protease mixture; Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer (5% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) at 95 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE (usually 5% polyacrylamide, but 8% for the blot used to separate FRNK and FAK) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking overnight at room temperature with 0.1% casein in PBS, 0.3% Tween, membranes were incubated 1.5 h with different Abs: anti-FAK kinase (immunogen corresponding to the kinase domain of FAK, amino acids 354–533) used at 1/1000 V/V dilution; anti-FAK Ct, (immunogen corresponding to the C-terminal region of FAK, amino acids 1039–1052) used at 1/4000; anti-Tyr397-phosphorylated FAK (1/4000) or anti-MLCK (1/10000), followed by 1-h exposure to either anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/60,000) or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/60,000). Specific staining was revealed using ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were analyzed by densitometry. Band intensities of FAK and phosphorylated FAK were determined as (OD phosphorylated FAK/OD total FAK) × 100. For each condition, blots from four different experiments were analyzed. FAK-Ycam, FRNK-Ycam, or MLCK-GFP cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed 15 min with 3% paraformaldehye at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were treated for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated 30 min with PBS, 3% BSA. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated 1 h with either 1 μg/ml phalloidin-TRITC, the anti-MLCK mAb K36 (1/10000), or with the anti-FAK mAb (1/1000) in PBS, 0.2% BSA. For actin staining, the incubation buffer was removed and replaced by PBS, 0.2% BSA. For MLCK or FAK staining, cells were washed three times and incubated 1 h with a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (GAM-FITC, 1/100). Fluorescence was observed using a confocal microscope and a 40× objective, as above. FITC and TRITC were excited at 488 and 568 nm, respectively, and fluorescence was collected at 522 and 585 nm. We reported that migration of U87 cells is associated with Ca2+ oscillations (14Rondé P. Giannone G. Gerasymova I. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Haiech J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as intracellular Ca2+ buffering by BAPTA partly inhibits serum-dependent migration. To analyze the role of FAK in Ca2+-dependent migration, U87 cells were transfected with FAK or the dominant negative FRNK, fused to the fluorescent yellow Cameleon-2 (Ycam) tag, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based Ca2+ sensor containing CFP and EYFP (22Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Expression of FAK-Ycam or FRNK-Ycam did not alter endogenous FAK levels compared with controls (Fig.1 A, left). FRNK-Ycam expression (Fig. 1 A, right) was deduced by subtracting the endogenous FAK band from the band representing endogenous FAK plus FRNK-Ycam. Expression levels of FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam were 1.5–2 times that of endogenous FAK. Compared with controls, serum-independent migration was unchanged in FAK- and FRNK-transfected cells, while serum-dependent migration decreased by 25% only in FRNK-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B,left), in agreement with previous studies (12Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Buffering of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA did not affect serum-independent migration in control and transfected cells, but inhibited serum-dependent migration by 33% in FAK-Ycam cells. The lack of effect of BAPTA on serum-dependent migration of FRNK-transfected cells together with the clear inhibition by BAPTA in FAK-transfected and control cells indicate that the migration component inhibited by FRNK expression is mainly Ca2+-dependent. We found that Ca2+ spikes in U87 cells occur only in the presence of serum and are blocked by inhibitory antibodies against β1 and β3 integrin subunits, with the generation of such Ca2+ spikes depending on activation of phospholipase Cγ. 2P. Rondé, G. Giannone, A. Scherberich, A. Beretz, J. Haiech, and K. Takeda, submitted for publication. The FAK tyrosine 397 autophosphorylation site interacts with and activates phospholipase Cγ, representing a possible link between integrins and Ca2+ signaling (23Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A., Ji, Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Since FRNK contains the focal adhesion targeting sequence that is necessary and sufficient for FAK recruitment to FAs but lacks the phospholipase Cγ-interacting autophosphorylation site, FRNK-Ycam expression might inhibit Ca2+ oscillations. However, the frequency of Ca2+ spikes over 15 min in cells expressing FAK-Ycam or FRNK-Ycam was similar (Fig. 1 B,right) and not different compared with controls (not shown). For most FRNK-Ycam cells, the distribution of endogenous FAK at FAs, evaluated using an Ab against the FAK kinase domain, was unaltered (Fig. 1 C, left), as found previously (7Richardson A. Parsons T.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This suggests that sufficient endogenous FAK is expressed in most FRNK-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C), perhaps accounting for the unaltered generation of Ca2+ spikes (23Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A., Ji, Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-dependent migration defect of FRNK-Ycam cells is not due to decreased Ca2+ signaling. Since differences in Ca2+ signaling do not underlie impaired migration of FRNK-Ycam cells, possible effects of Ca2+ spikes on FAs were investigated by simultaneously measuring Ca2+ variations (using Fura Red) and FA dynamics (using EYFP fluorescence of FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam) in migrating cells. Color overlays of three sequential images (Fig.2 A) distinguish immobile FAs (black) versus motile FAs (rainbow). Most FAs were immobile in FAK-Ycam cells irrespective of Ca2+ oscillations. Motile FAs were present in oscillatory and non-oscillatory cells, being often localized at one edge of a migrating cell (Fig. 2 A). FA movements were linear and usually resulted in FA disassembly, with EYFP fluorescence decreasing or disappearing (Fig. 2 B), while immobile FAs never disassembled. In many cases, FA movement and subsequent disassembly was triggered by a Ca2+ spike (Fig. 2 B). In oscillatory FAK-Ycam cells, such FA disassembly was temporally correlated with Ca2+ spikes for 64% (37/58) of motile FAs. For 19% of motile FAs (11/58), the Ca2+ oscillation frequency was too high to determine clearly a correlation, and for the remaining 17% (10/58), no correlation was found. This indicates that Ca2+ spikes were responsible for the dynamics of a subset of FAs. Somewhat surprisingly, FA disassembly in oscillatory FRNK-Ycam cells (Fig. 2, C and D) was also temporally correlated with a Ca2+ spike for 50% (35/70) of motile FAs; the Ca2+ oscillation frequency was too high to establish a correlation for 30% of FAs (21/70), and there was no correlation for the remaining 20% (14/70). In FAK-Ycam (Fig. 3; 45 FAs,n = 19 cells) and FRNK-Ycam cells (not shown; 30 FAs,n = 10 cells), we found no clear link between oscillatory (Fig. 3, A and B) versusnon-oscillatory (Fig. 3, C and D) Ca2+ behavior and formation of FAs (evaluated as EYFP fluorescence increases). For FAK-Ycam cells, 49% (22/45) of newly formed FAs were seen in oscillatory cells, while 51% (23/45) were not, as was also the case for FRNK-Ycam cells (not shown). Thus, unlike FA disassembly, Ca2+ spikes and FA formation were not obviously correlated. Strikingly, the number, size, and localization of FAs were different in FNRK-Ycam compared with FAK-Ycam cells (Fig. 4, A andB). FRNK-Ycam cells had 3-fold fewer FAs (25 ± 3/cell,n = 4 cells), which were larger (Fig. 4, Cand D) and more peripherally located compared with FAK-Ycam cells (74 ± 10 FAs/cell, n = 4). Morphometric analysis (ratio of longest to shortest cell lengths) showed that FRNK-Ycam cells were more elongated (3.0 ± 0.2,n = 51) than FAK-Ycam cells (2.3 ± 0.1,n = 69), suggesting that they are more strongly held to the ECM. Comparison of the Ca2+ dependence of FA dynamics revealed that the size distribution of motile Ca2+-sensitive FAs (Fig. 4 E) mirrors that of all FAs in FAK-Ycam cells (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, in FRNK-Ycam cells, the size distribution of motile, Ca2+-sensitive FAs (Fig. 4 F) is not the same as for all FAs (Fig.4 D), with smaller FAs being preferentially disassembled by Ca2+ spikes. This may explain impaired Ca2+-dependent migration in FRNK-Ycam cells, as larger, immobile Ca2+-insensitive FAs would remain attached to the ECM despite oscillatory Ca2+ signaling. Since FAK regulates FA dynamics (5Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 6Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ spikes trigger FA disassembly, this may be related to FAK activity. Therefore, FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated after thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ elevation (14Rondé P. Giannone G. Gerasymova I. Stoeckel H. Takeda K. Haiech J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Increases in Tyr397 phosphorylation of endogenous FAK and FAK-Ycam were detected within 30 s after 1 μm thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 5 A). After 1 min, phosphorylation was maximal (73% increase above control; Fig.5 B). Thus, rapid phosphorylation of FAK in response to Ca2+ increases provides a possible link between FA movements and Ca2+ spikes, supporting that these are regulatory events in migration. As FA disassembly involves disruption of ECM-integrin and/or SF-integrin interactions, we simultaneously followed the dynamics of SF ends and Ca2+ signals using MLCK-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 6). No differences were found in the localization, distribution, and expression of MLCK in MLCK-GFP cells compared with controls (Fig. 6,A and B), as reported previously (24Kudryashov S.K. Chibalina M.V. Birukov K.G. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MLCK-GFP construct used here has the same activity in phosphorylating the 20-kDa regulatory light chain kinase when compared with endogenous MLCK (25Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.-J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Evaluation of SF end dynamics (using MLCK-GFP fluorescence; Fig. 6 C) and Ca2+variations (using Fura Red) revealed that SF end movements were triggered by a Ca2+ spike (Fig. 6 D). The average latency between a Ca2+ spike and SF end movement was 28 ± 6 s, with a rate of movement of 0.25 ± 0.04 μm/min (n = 21 SFs, 6 cells; Fig.7). These SF kinetic parameters were compared with those for motile Ca2+-sensitive FAs in FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam cells (Fig.7 C). The latency between Ca2+ spikes and the onset of FA movement was 33 ± 5 s in FAK-Ycam cells (n = 21 FAs, 8 cells) and 31 ± 5 s in FRNK-Ycam cells (n = 35 FAs; 14 cells), with a FA speed of 0.18 ± 0.02 and 0.22 ± 0.02 μm/min, respectively. These kinetic parameters were not different, suggesting that Ca2+ spikes trigger coordinated movement of SF-associated FA complexes. This implies that during cell migration, Ca2+signaling results in disruption of ECM-integrin interactions rather than a decrease in FA-cytoskeletal interactions. We investigated the implication of intracellular Ca2+elevations in FA dynamics during migration of U87 astrocytoma cells. During oscillatory Ca2+ signaling, single Ca2+spikes triggered FA disassembly and subsequent cell edge retraction. In FRNK-Ycam cells, smaller sized FAs were more sensitive to Ca2+-triggered disruption compared with large FAs, consistent with FA stability being a limiting factor in motility. FAK phosphorylation was rapidly induced by a Ca2+ increase, indicating that FAK is a Ca2+ target during migration. Analysis of FA and SF kinetic parameters suggests that Ca2+signaling coordinates disruption of ECM-integrin interactions at FAs. Cell migration includes phases of protrusion, adhesion, and retraction (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar), involving, respectively, formation, strengthening, and disassembly of focal contacts. FAK plays an important role in the dynamics of cell adhesion, but is not required for FA formation beneath lamellipodia of migrating cells (26Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). FAK aggregates to clustered integrin receptors with or without ligand occupancy (27Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), consistent with FAK localization to FAs being an early or late event in the cascade of interactions, respectively, leading to formation or disruption of integrin-cytoskeletal linkages. This justifies our choice of FAK-Ycam (22Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) as a probe for FA dynamics, indirectly allowing detection of clustered integrins. FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam were localized to newly forming, punctate structures in protrusive areas, further supporting their use to follow indirectly integrin association/dissociation in FAs. As suggested previously (28Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), these punctate structures very probably are focal complexes, putative precursors of FAs. FAK tyrosine kinase activity is involved in the regulation FA turnover (29Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Sieg D.J. Otey C.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3673-3678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In FAK-deficient cells, reduced motility is accompanied by an increased number of FAs (6Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). FRNK expression inhibits integrin-stimulated migration and phosphorylation of endogenous FAK and other FA components such as paxillin and tensin (7Richardson A. Parsons T.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons T. Mol. Cell.

Thus, FAK phosphorylation likely governs FA dynamics and, hence, motility. In FAK-Ycam cells, FA morphology was similar to controls, and as found in previous studies using FAK-transfected U87 cells (12Gu J. Tamura M. Pankov R. Danen E.H. Takino T. Matsumoto K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), migration was unchanged, unlike in Chinese hamster ovary cells where migration increased after FAK overexpression (30Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of FRNK-Ycam induced elongated morphology and a sparse and peripheral distribution of enlarged FAs. Much evidence supports that defective FAK signaling leads to enlarged FAs. Cells expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of Src have larger FAs and reduced migration (31Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The interaction and activation of Src occurs at the FAK autophosphorylation site, which is absent for FRNK (11Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Src kinase activity weakens integrin-cytoskeletal linkages (32Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and may stimulate FA turnover by favoring lateral diffusion of integrins away from FAs. Thus, reduced FA dynamics leading to enlarged FAs is consistent with decreased migration of FRNK-Ycam cells. The disassembly of large FAs in FRNK-Ycam cells was Ca2+-insensitive, possibly because for this subset of FAs, endogenous FAK levels were small compared with FRNK levels. Our data support that FA size affects migration by also reflecting the Ca2+ sensitivity of FAs and, hence, their remodeling. FA disassembly involves disruption of ECM-integrin and/or integrin-cytoskeleton interactions, which are regulated by several calciproteins. For instance, contractile force activation via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK may strengthen integrin-cytoskeletal linkages (26Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and is necessary for Ca2+-dependent migration of neutrophils (20Eddy R.J. Pierini L.M. Matsumura F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, integrin-cytoskeletal linkages are disrupted by calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease, and calpain inhibition or disruption mimics the effects of FRNK expression on FA morphology (18Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P., Lu, Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48382-48388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Calreticulin appears to be essential for integrin-mediated Ca2+ signaling and adhesion (33Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S., St- Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 34Kwon M.S. Park C.S. Choi K. Ahnn J. Kim J.I. Eom S.H. Kaufman S.J. Song W.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a protein phosphatase, is involved in integrin recycling to the front of migrating neutrophils (21Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), probably via affinity modulation. We show that Ca2+ spikes trigger FA disassembly and propose that ECM-integrin linkages are disrupted, given the identical kinetic parameters for FA and SF dynamics, which suggests coordinated FA/SF movement. In agreement, in migrating fibroblasts, FAs move with a similar speed of 0.12 ± 0.08 μm/min and remain associated with SFs in retractile edges (3Smilenov L.B. Mikhailov A. Pelham R.J. Marcantonio E.E. Gundersen G.G. Science. 1999; 286: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Our observation of linearly disassembling FAs suggests that FAK-Ycam and FRNK-Ycam remained linked to SF ends until complete disassembly. However, because integrin-cytoskeleton and integrin-ECM interactions are intimately related, linkage perturbations initiated at either side of these molecular complexes could be transmitted via modulation of integrin affinity/avidity to both intracellular and extracellular partners. For example, integrin ligation initiates recruitment of a cytoskeletal actin component (27Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and linkage with the forward moving actin cytoskeleton (35Felsenfeld D.P. Choquet D. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Conversely, detachment of integrins from the actin cytoskeleton may induce decreased integrin affinity/avidity for their ECM ligands (36Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar,37Nishizaka T Shi Q. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cell migration process implies asymmetric signal transduction that directs cell polarization (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). In U87 astrocytoma cells, we observed spatially localized disassembly and formation of FAs, illustrating this asymmetry. Since FA disassembly but not formation was temporally correlated with Ca2+ spikes, Ca2+ signaling and/or regulatory Ca2+ target proteins may be spatially restricted to discrete subcellular compartments (38Hahn K. DeBiasio R. Taylor D.L. Nature. 1992; 359: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 39Pettit E.J. Hallett M.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1689-1694PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently investigating compartmentalized Ca2+ signaling in migrating cells using our Ycam constructs as local detectors of Ca2+ near FAs. That a single Ca2+ spike is sufficient to trigger FA disassembly agrees with initiation of a regenerative process leading to irreversible FA disruption. The Ca2+-triggered event might transiently increase FAK signaling, perhaps followed by a Ca2+-independent process. This implies a latency between the Ca2+ spike and cell edge retraction resulting from FA disassembly. Consistent with our data, Ca2+ elevation and increased migration speed were positively correlated in neutrophils (16Mandeville J.T. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but since there was a 20-s delay between Ca2+elevation and increased motility, Ca2+ was proposed not to be the immediately causal signal. However, we show that FA disassembly begins 30 s after a Ca2+ spike, and once triggered, several minutes are required for complete disassembly. This supports that Ca2+ elevation is a proximal signal leading to increased motility. Finally, rapid thapsigargin-induced FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation agrees with Ca2+-dependent FAK activation being an initial event associated with FA disassembly. We thank R. Y. Tsien (University of California at San Diego), S. B. Kanner (Bristol Myers Squibb), and A. Bresnick and D. M.

https://openalex.org/W2121883063,"Defining the molecular mechanisms that coordinately regulate proliferation and differentiation is a central issue in development. Here, we describe a mechanism in which induction of the Ets repressor METS/PE1 links terminal differentiation to cell cycle arrest. Using macrophages as a model, we provide evidence that METS/PE1 blocks Ras-dependent proliferation without inhibiting Ras-dependent expression of cell type-specific genes by selectively replacing Ets activators on the promoters of cell cycle control genes. Antiproliferative effects of METS require its interaction with DP103, a DEAD box-containing protein that assembles a novel corepressor complex. Functional interactions between the METS/DP103 complex and E2F/ pRB family proteins are also necessary for inhibition of cellular proliferation, suggesting a combinatorial code that directs permanent cell cycle exit during terminal differentiation."

Homo- and heterodimerization (oligomerization) of the erbB receptors are known to be critical events for receptor signaling. To block receptor self-associations, we have designed a series of peptides derived from potential dimerization surfaces in the extracellular subdomain IV of the erbB receptors (erbB peptides). In surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) studies, the designed peptides have been shown to selectively bind to the erbB receptor ectodomains and isolated subdomain IV of erbB2 with submicromolar affinities and to inhibit heregulin-induced interactions of erbB3 with different erbB receptors. A dose-dependent inhibition of native erbB receptor dimerization by the erbB peptides has been observed in 32D cell lines transfected with different combinations of erbB receptors. The peptides effectively inhibited growth of two types of transformed cells overexpressing different erbB receptors, T6-17 and 32D, in standard MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and cell viability assays. The study identifies distinct loops within the membrane-proximal part of the subdomain IV as potential receptor-receptor interaction sites for the erbB receptors and demonstrates the possibility of disabling receptor activity by structure-based targeting of the dimerization interfaces.

Overexpression of erbB receptors has been found in many types of human cancer raising the possibility that receptor-directed therapies may be useful as cancer management strategies. Greater expression of erbB2 on transformed cells than on normal epithelial tissues allows selective targeting of tumor cells using various approaches (5Drebin J.A. Link V.C. Greene M.I.

A variety of strategies have also been developed for targeting the erbB1 receptor, including monoclonal antibodies, ligand-linked immunotoxins, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antisense approaches. Recently, we have reported the design of an anti-erbB2 peptide mimetic, AHNP, derived from the structure of the CDR-H3 loop of the anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody 4D5 and demonstrated its in vitro and in vivo activities in disabling erbB2 tyrosine kinases similar to the monoclonal antibody (14Park B.W.

We have argued that another interesting approach for disabling erbB receptor activity would be targeting protein-protein interaction surfaces. Because protein-protein interactions play a key role in various mechanisms of cellular growth and differentiation, and viral replication, inhibition of these interactions is a promising novel approach for rational drug design against a wide number of cellular and viral targets (17Zutshi R. Brickner M. Chmielewski J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Peczuh M.W. Hamilton A.D. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 2479-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides that disrupt protein-protein interactions have been successfully shown to act as inhibitors of HIV-1 protease (19Schramm H.J. Boetzel J. Buttner J. Fritsche E. Gohring W. Jaeger E. Konig S. Thumfart O. Wenger T. Nagel N.E. Schramm W. Antiviral Res. 1996; 30: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (20Divita G. Restle T. Goody R.S. Chermann J.C. Baillon J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13080-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), herpes simplex virus ribonucleotide reductase (21Dutia B.M. Frame M.C. Subak-Sharpe J.H. Clark W.N. Marsden H.S. Nature. 1986; 321: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and thymidilate synthase (22Prasanna V. Bhattacharjya S. Balaram P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6883-6893Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Binding of polypeptide hormones, growth factors, or cytokines to cell surface receptors activates dimerization (oligomerization) of the receptors, which leads to the signal transduction to the interior of the cell (23Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Although most of the receptor inhibitors developed to date have been focused on the blockade of receptor-ligand or enzyme-substrate interactions, repression of receptor-receptor interactions that accompany oligomerization might also represent an important target for disabling receptor functioning. This approach has been recently used for the design of peptidic estrogen receptor inhibitors based on the crystal structure of the estrogen receptor dimerization interface (24Yudt M.R. Koide S. Steroids. 2001; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used the “dimeric interface” strategy to inhibit erbB receptor self-associations. This strategy presumes that protein-protein interactions can be inhibited by short constrained peptides that mimic the key regions at the interface. We have recently identified distinct extracellular subdomains of erbB2 that are involved in heterodimerization with erbB1 (25Kumagai T. Davis J.G. Horie T. O'Rourke D.M. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5526-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In particular, we found that the C-terminal part of subdomain IV could reduce the heteromeric signaling and transforming activities induced by EGF after associating with EGFR, suggesting a therapeutic potential for this subdomain as a target for erbB-expressing tumors. We now report a rational design of mimetic peptides derived from the extracellular subdomain IV of erbB receptors (erbB peptides) and show that these peptides can specifically bind to the receptors of the erbB family and inhibit ligand-induced receptor self-associations. Linear peptides (95% purity) were ordered from the Protein Chemistry Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania. Peptide purity and identity was confirmed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MicroMass TofSpec, Micromass Inc., Beverly, MA). The peptides were cyclized by air oxidation in distilled water adjusted to pH 8.0 with (NH4)2CO3 at 0.1 mg/ml and 4 °C. Progress of the oxidation was controlled by measuring amounts of free thiols with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. Briefly, 0.4 ml of a peptide (0.1 mg/ml) and 5 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (20 mm) were added to 0.2 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Absorbance at 412 nm was measured and compared with the linear unoxidized peptides. The cyclized peptides were lyophilized and their purity analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 semi-preparative column (Waters, Milford, MA). Typically, purity of higher than 95% was obtained for the cyclized peptides. Aliquots of 1 mm stock solutions have been prepared for each peptide and kept at −20 °C to be thawed prior to the binding or bioassay studies. Peptide concentrations were confirmed by UV spectrophotometry using extinction coefficients at 280 nm calculated for each peptide as described in a previous study (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding the subdomain IV of erbB2 (erbB2-SbdIV) was generated by polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer was 5′-CGCCCGGATCCTGGCCTGCCACCAGCTGTGC-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-CGCCCGCGGCCGCCGCAGAGATGATGGAGTCAG-3′. These two primers were designed to include BamHI andNotI restriction sites, respectively, for in-frame insertion into the BamHI/NotI-linearized pGEX-5X-3 vector. Recombinant vector was used to infect Escherichia coliBL-21(DE3). 100 ml of the 2×YT medium were inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight culture and grown at 37 °C until theA 600 of 0.4–0.5 was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the medium at the final concentration of 0.1 mm and grown for 2 h. The cells were spun down by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 10 min and resuspended with 5 ml of cold PBS (with dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin at the final concentrations of 5 mm, 1 mm, and 1 μg/ml, respectively). After sonication on ice, Triton X-100 was added to the final concentration of 1%, and the solution was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of glutathione Sepharose bead was then added to the supernatant. It was rocked at 4 °C for 2–4 h, centrifuged, and washed three times with PBS. 100 μl of elution buffer was added followed by rotation for 10 min at room temperature, centrifugation at 300 × g for 1 min, and collection of the supernatant. Elutions were repeated three times and combined. Binding experiments were performed with the surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor instrument BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), at 25 °C. Recombinant purified ectodomain of erbB2 receptor was provided by Dr. Che Law, Xcyte Therapeutics, Seattle, WA. Ectodomains of erbB1 and erbB3, prepared as described in a previous study (27Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were provided by Dr. Mark A. Lemmon (Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Immobilization of the erbB receptors in the sensor surface was performed following the standard amine coupling procedure according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 35 μl of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, were injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min to activate carboxyl groups on the sensor chip surface. Receptors (40 ng/ml in 10 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 5.0) were flowed over the chip surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min until the desired level bound protein was reached. Unreacted protein was washed out, and unreacted activated groups were blocked by the injection of 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine at 5 μl/min. The final immobilization response of each receptor was 3500 resonance units. A reference surface was generated simultaneously under the same conditions but without receptor injection and used as a blank to correct for instrument and buffer artifacts. Peptides were injected at variable concentrations at 20 μl/min flow rate, and binding to the receptors immobilized on the chip was monitored in real-time. Each sensorgram consists of an association phase (first 240 s), reflecting binding of the injected peptide to the receptor, followed by a dissociation phase (300 s), during which the running buffer is passed over the chip and the bound peptide is being washed off the receptor surface. The MTT assay has been used for measuring cell growth as previously described (28Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). Briefly, T6-17 cells were seeded in 96-well plates overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum albumin (1000 per well). T6-17 is derived from NIH3T3 by overexpressing the human erbB2 receptor. Cells were cultured in 100 μl of fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml erbB peptides for 48 h. This incubation time was optimal for measuring inhibitory effects of different analogs. No improvements in the inhibitory activity could be achieved by increasing the incubation period. 25 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well, and after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of the extraction buffer (20% w/v of SDS, 50%N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) were added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the optical density at 600 nm was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. 32D cell transfectants with erbB receptors (gift from Dr. Jacalyn H. Pierce, NCI, National Institutes of Health) were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum albumin, and 5% WEHI medium (GenoQuest, interleukin-3 supplement) and respective antibiotics,i.e. 32D-E1 (gptr), 32D-E2/E3 (neor/gptr), and 32D-E2/E4 (neor/gptr) (29Alimandi M. Wang L.M. Bottaro D. Lee C.C. Kuo A. Frankel M. Fedi P. Tang C. Lippman M. Pierce J.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The WEHI medium was withdrawn, and cells were preincubated with erbB peptides for 2 h at 37 °C before adding 10 μg/ml EGF (for 32D-E1, Collaborative Biomedical Products) or 10 μg/ml HRGβ1 (for 32D-E2/E3 or 32D E2/E4, R&amp;D Systems) and further incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h. The cell viability was detected with propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry quantification. For the cross-linking analysis, ∼2 × 106 cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, and preincubated with erbB peptides for 2 h at 37 °C before adding 10 μg/ml EGF or 10 μg/ml Heregulin-β1 EGF domain and further incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated in 2 mmbis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate/PBS at 4 °C for 45 min. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-erbB2 or anti-erbB3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoblotted with anti-pTyr (PY20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To quantitate the immunoblotting analysis data, the bands corresponding to the dimeric forms of erbB receptors were scanned using the AlphaImage instrument (Alpha Innotech Corp.). At least five measurements were taken for each sample. Normalized band intensities were calculated by subtracting the background noise from each band intensity value. Homology modeling of erbB2-SbdIV and erbB1 ectodomain was performed with Quanta/Protein design (Molecular Simulations Inc.) on the basis of template crystal structures of laminin g1III3–5 (1KLO) for erbB2-SbdIV and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (1IGR) for erbB1. The sequences were aligned manually using the Sequence Viewer by matching positions of conservative cysteine residues and inserting gaps to adjust the lengths of the inter-cysteine spacings. Frameworks for the molecular models were generated by using coordinates from the template structures for manually selected matching residues of the modeled proteins. Missing coordinates for peptide segments that did not have a counterpart in the template structures were calculated by either “Regularizing Region” and “Model Side Chains” tools (for short loops) or by modeling loop conformation using a “Congen” (30Li H.

The final monomeric structures were then obtained by running the CHARMm energy minimization in the Residue Topology File mode. To construct a dimeric erbB1·EGF model, the following assumptions were made based on the existing experimental evidence: erbB1·EGF complex has a 2:2 stoichiometry (32Lemmon M.A., Bu, Z. Ladbury J.E.

Lukas T.J. Staros J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); the C-terminal Arg-45 of bound EGF is close (within about 15 Å) to Lys-465 (subdomain III) of erbB1 (35Summerfield A.E. Hudnall A.K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19656-19659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); the N terminus of EGF bound to erbB1 is about 67 Å (from 52 to 82 Å) away from the membrane surface (36Carraway 3rd, K.L. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8741-8747Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); maximal dimensions of erbB1 are about 110 Å for the monomer and 120 Å for the dimer (32Lemmon M.A., Bu, Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); EGF binds to the second face of subdomain III (37Jorissen R.N. Epa V.C. Treutlein H.R. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Orientations of complex-forming two erbB1 and two EGF (Protein Data Bank code, 3EGF) molecules were adjusted manually to satisfy the criteria listed above based on two different models of the complex arrangement (see “Discussion”). The final dimeric models were minimized using the CHARMm energy minimization tool. These dimeric complex models have a low resolution nature and may have a degree of error in the positioning of the constituent molecules with respect to each other. In the present study, we have designed constrained cyclic peptides derived from the C-terminal portion of subdomain IV that potentially mediate inter-receptor interactions between the erbB family members. The peptides were designed based on the molecular model of the subdomain IV of erbB receptors constructed by comparative modeling with the second subdomain of the type-1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) (38Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Frenkel M.J. Bentley J.D. Lovrecz G.O. Elleman T.C. Cosgrove L.J. Ward C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), as well as structures of the TNF receptor and laminin that have similar disulfide bond connectivities. Most peptides mimic the S22 repeat: B1-S22-ALG (derived from erbB1), B2-S22-APE and B2-S22-AFA (derived from erbB2), B3-S22-APQ (derived from erbB3), and B4-S22-AFD (derived from erbB4). One peptide, B2-S23-BPT, was derived from the membrane-proximal S23 repeat of erbB2. A CD4 receptor-derived cyclic peptide, CD4-G, was used as a negative control. Fig.1 shows the molecular models of the fourth subdomain of HER2 and mimetic peptides derived from the C-terminal part of this subdomain. B2-S22-AFA is a cyclic peptide that mimics part of the S22 loop, whereas B2-S23-BPT is a bicyclic peptide constrained by two disulfide bonds and actually represents a whole S23 repeat followed by the juxtamembrane amino acid residues. Molecular modeling indicates close conformational similarity between the constrained mimetic peptides and corresponding loops of the receptor. The designed erbB peptides have been tested for binding to erbB receptors by means of surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) technology. A sensorgram for binding of B2-S22-APE peptide to erbB receptors immobilized on the sensor chip is shown in Fig.2 A. Kinetic constants were estimated by global fitting analysis of the titration curves to the 1:1 Langmurian interaction model, which gave a k onof 3.24 × 103m−1s−1 and ak off of 6.85 × 10−4s−1. Thek off/k on ratio gave a value of 0.21 μm for the dissociation constant (K D ). Good fitting of experimental data to the calculated curves was observed, suggesting a simple pseudo-first order interaction between the peptide and the receptor. K D values for other erbB peptides, analyzed in a similar fashion as B2-S22-APE, are presented in TableI. All erbB peptides showed binding to different erbB receptors. However, no binding could be detected to immobilized TNF receptor used as a control, indicating selectivity of erbB peptides to the erbB receptor family. A control CD4-G peptide did not bind to any of the studied receptors. Binding specificity could also be observed for different peptides within the erbB family. Thus, erbB2-derived peptide, B2-S22-APE could bind to the erbB1 receptor much better than to erbB2 and erbB3. erbB1-derived B1-S22-ALG showed preferential binding to erbB3. On the other hand, erbB2-derived B2-S22-AFA peptide showed the best overall binding affinity to all three receptors.Table IErbB receptor-derived peptidesPeptideSequenceKD(μm)erbB1erbB2erbB3TNFRμmB2-S23-BPTPCPINCTHSCVDLDDKGCPAEQRASPLTSI2.064.230.832>103B2-S22-APEYCPIWKFPDEECY0.2101.531.40>103B1-S22-ALGYCLVWKYADAGCY0.4490.3710.288>103B3-S22-APQYCPIYKYPDVQCY0.4720.5491.07>103B4-S22-AFDYCPIFKYADPDCY0.5830.6390.394>103B2-S22-AFAYCFPDEEGACY0.4070.3020.429>103CD4-GFCYIGEVEDQCY>103>103>103>103Binding to the immobilized extracellular domains of the ErbB receptors studied by surface plasmon resonance. Open table in a new tab Binding to the immobilized extracellular domains of the ErbB receptors studied by surface plasmon resonance. To demonstrate that erbB peptides bind to SbdIV of erbB receptors, we studied interaction of the B2-S22-APE peptide with recombinantly expressed erbB2-SbdIV immobilized on the surface chip (Fig.2 B). The observed binding to erbB2-SbdIV had very similar kinetic constants (k on, 1.62 × 103m−1s−1;k off, 3.07 × 10−3s−1) and affinity (K D , 1.89 μm) as binding to the whole ectodomain of erbB2 (Fig.2 A and Table I). Likewise, binding of other erbB peptides to erbB2-Sbd IV was undistinguishable from their binding to the full-size erbB2 ectodomain (data not shown), demonstrating that subdomain IV is the binding site for all erbB peptides. Because erbB peptides are derived from subdomain IV of different erbB receptors, this fact indicates direct involvement of subdomain IV in receptor-receptor interactions between the members of erbB receptor family. To study the effect of erbB peptides on receptor self-associations, we have developed a BIAcore assay in which the ectodomains of erbB receptors were immobilized on the surface chip and the ectodomain of erbB3 was injected at 300 nm concentrations either alone or in the presence of 5 μm HRGβ1. We noted a very limited degree of receptor-receptor interactions of these ectodomain forms in the absence of heregulin (Fig. 3, black curves). However, when erbB3 was preincubated with a 17-fold molar excess of HRGβ1, a strong binding to all three erbB receptors was observed (Fig. 3, blue curves), indicating ligand-induced homo- and heteromerization of the erbB receptor ectodomains. No increase in binding upon preincubation with heregulin was observed for the TNF receptor used as a control (data not shown). In a parallel experiment, we attempted to determine whether similar ligand-induced receptor self-associations could be observed for the erbB1 receptor injected in the presence of EGF or transforming growth factor α. However, no interaction of the injected erbB1 ectodomain (150 nm) with the immobilized receptors could be detected either in the absence or in the presence of the erbB1 ligands (5 μm), suggesting that at this erbB1 receptor concentration no significant dimerization is taking place. Effect of the erbB peptides on heregulin-induced receptor self-associations was studied by preinjecting them at 10 μm using the “Coinject” mode of the BIAcore instrument, followed by injection of erbB3-HRGβ1 incubation mixture as described above. The inhibitory effect of B2-S22-AFA on receptor self-associations is shown in Fig. 3 (red curves). The peptide effectively inhibited binding of erbB3 to all three immobilized receptors. The highest degree of inhibition was observed for the erbB3-erbB2 heteromerization (82.5%) followed by erbB3-erbB1 heteromerization (78.4%) and erbB3-erbB3 homomerization (61.7%). As a control, either the running buffer or a control peptide (CD4-G) was preinjected instead of the erbB peptides and showed no effect on receptor self-associations (data not shown). Inhibition values for different erbB peptides are presented in TableII. As expected from the data for the receptor-binding affinities, B2-S22-APE, which shows the best binding to erbB1 (Table I), is more effective in disabling interaction of erbB3 with erbB1 than with other receptors (Table II). Similarly, B1-S22-ALG with the highest erbB3-binding affinity (Table I) is the strongest inhibitor of erbB3 homomerization (Table II). B2-S22-AFA, with the strongest overall affinity to the three studied erbB receptors (TableI), is an effective inhibitor of erbB3-erbB2 and erbB3-erbB1 interactions (Table II). B2-S23-BPT, derived from the S23 repeat of erbB2, had the lowest but still significant inhibitory effect, especially on the homomerization of erbB3 (Table II) to which it binds with the highest affinity compared with other receptors (Table I).Table IIInhibition of ligand-induced ErbB receptor dimerization by ErbB receptor-derived peptidesInhibition2-aInhibitory effect of ErbB peptides (10 μm) on the binding of ErbB3 (300 nm) to the immoblilized ErbB receptors in the presence of HRGβ1 (5 μm).erbB1erbB2erbB3%B2-S23-BPT41.532.355.4B2-S22-APE80.351.142.7B1-S22-ALG65.271.475.1B3-S22-APQ69.058.132.4B4-S22-AFD60.354.272.8B2-S22-AFA78.482.561.7CD4-G2.4−1.23.12-a Inhibitory effect of ErbB peptides (10 μm) on the binding of ErbB3 (300 nm) to the immoblilized ErbB receptors in the presence of HRGβ1 (5 μm).

We expressed CaT1 in HEK293 cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells and measured whole-cell currents by the patch clamp technique. In HEK293 cells, the expression of CaT1 consistently yielded a constitutively active current, the size of which was strongly dependent on the holding potential and duration of voltage ramps. In CaT1-expressing RBL cells, the current was either activated by store depletion or was constitutively active at a higher current density. CaT1 currents could be clearly distinguished from endogenous CRAC by their typical current-voltage relationship in divalent free solution. 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), which is considered a blocker of CRAC, was tested for its inhibitory effect on both cell types expressing CaT1. Endogenous CRAC as well as store-dependent CaT1-derived currents of RBL cells were largely blocked by 75 μm 2-APB, whereas constitutively active CaT1 currents in both RBL and HEK293 cells were slightly potentiated. These results indicate that despite the difference in the permeation properties of CRAC and CaT1 channels, the latter are similarly able to form store depletion-activated conductances in RBL mast cells that are inhibited by 2-APB.

Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) to exhibit the unique biophysical properties of ICRAC when expressed in mammalian cells, and it has been proposed that CaT1 comprises all or part of the CRAC pore. However, Voets et al. (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have shown that clear differences in biophysical properties such as monovalent permeability exist between CaT1 expressed in HEK293 cells and ICRAC in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. To investigate CaT1 characteristics in more detail, we made a direct comparison between CaT1 that is heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and CaT1 that is expressed in RBL cells. The latter cells were chosen because they are the source of the CaT1 clone used in this study and have been widely employed as a model system to study ICRAC (9Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the regulatory and pharmacological characteristics of CaT1 depend on the size of the current and the cell type where it is expressed, and we suggest that a 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB)-sensitive component plays a key role in coupling CaT1 activation to store depletion in RBL mast cells. Experiments were performed on a secreting subline (2H3) of RBL cells maintained in a monolayer culture. The cells were grown in stationary flasks using minimal essential medium Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected by electroporation with 40 μg of pTracerCMV2-rCaT1 (accession numberAF160798; kindly provided by M. A. Hediger and D. E. Clapham, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) or 20 μg of pcDNA3-rCaT1 cDNA. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were used for 12–14 passages and were transferred every 4 days. Transfection was performed using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In brief, cells exhibiting confluence of about 20–40% were transfected with 8 μg of pTracerCMV2-rCaT1 cDNA. Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 20–24 °C, using the patch clamp technique (20Hamil O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15144) Google Scholar) in the whole-cell recording configuration. Soft glass pipettes immersed in extracellular solution exhibited a resistance of 3–5 megaohms. Voltage ramps were applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 or +70 mV, covering a range of −90 to +90 mV over 1 s or 100–200 ms. In RBL cells, the activation of ICRAC was monitored by applying the 1-s voltage ramp at a holding potential of 0 mV. The effect of 2-APB was usually studied by employing the 200-ms ramp applied from a holding potential of +70 mV for both RBL and HEK293 cells using an extracellular solution. In all recordings that were performed in divalent free (DVF) solutions, a 100-s ramp (from −90 to +90 mV) was applied every 2 s from a holding potential of 0 mV according to Ref. 19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol.

Endogenous inward currents (measured at −74 mV) of mock-transfected HEK293 cells were in the range of 0.67 pA/pF independent of the voltage protocol applied. Current signals were detected using an L/M EPC7 amplifier and were low pass filtered at 1 kHz for analysis. The pipette solution used to passively deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores contained 145 mmcesium methane sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 1, 3, or 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Active depletion was obtained by the addition of 20 μm IP3 and 3.5 mmCaCl2 (calculated to yield 60 nm free Ca2+). In experiments to study the effect of 2-APB on RBL cells in an extracellular solution (Fig. 6), 1 μmthapsigargin was usually added to the pipette solution to prevent ICRAC inactivation. The extracellular solution consisted of 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The DVF solution contained 165 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mmHEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, or CsOH. Results are presented as means ± S.E. calculated for the indicated number of experiments. Student's two-tailed t test was used for statistical comparison considering differences statistically significant at p< 0.05. To initially characterize CaT1-derived currents, we heterologously expressed the channel in HEK293 cells. CaT1-expressing cells, as identified by their green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence, exhibited large inward currents immediately after obtaining whole-cell configuration with 10 mm extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 1). Similar constitutively active inward currents (n = 3) were observed when Ca2+ was added to the 10 mm EGTA-containing pipette solution to yield 60 nm free Ca2+. The CaT1-derived current was strongly inward rectifying and reversed at potential >+30 mV. In dependence of the applied voltage protocol, the inward current steadily declined (Fig. 1, A andC) or exhibited a biphasic time course with an initial transient increase (Fig. 1, C and E) followed by a decay to a steady-state level (Fig. 1E). The voltage protocols applied were varied in the holding potential, which was set to 0 mV (Fig. 1A) or +70 mV (Fig. 1, C andE), and by applying voltage ramps of different duration (1000 ms in Fig. 1, A and C; 200 ms in Fig.1E). The decline in inward currents as depicted in Fig. 1,A and C revealed a type of inhibition that was largely prevented when both a short voltage ramp and a rather positive holding potential were applied as evident in Fig. 1E. Moreover, a substantial facilitation was observed within ∼50 s after starting whole-cell recording (Fig. 1, C and E), which may correspond to a relief from inhibition. The inhibitory effect may be partially attributed to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ due to a CaT1-mediated Ca2+ influx in accordance with the recently reported (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A.

Because the rCaT1 clone has been derived from RBL cells, we studied the consequences of its overexpression in this cell type (Fig.2) and compared CaT1-mediated currents in RBL cells with those recorded in HEK293 cells. RBL cells were transiently transfected by employing electroporation, and CaT1-overexpressing cells were identified by their green fluorescent protein fluorescence. As control, ICRAC activation induced by passive (EGTA) store depletion was initially recorded in mock-transfected RBL cells. ICRAC showed the typical characteristics (22Reinsprecht M. Rohn M.H. Spadinger R.J. Pecht I. Schindler H. Romanin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1014-1102PubMed Google Scholar) with a reversal potential above +40 mV. In RBL cells that were transfected to overexpress CaT1, inward current characteristics (Fig. 2C) were similar to mock-transfected RBL cells. When stores were passively depleted, the delay of current activation and the time to reach the maximum current were not different between RBL and CaT1-RBL cells (insets in Fig. 2,A and C), suggesting a similar mechanism of current activation. Moreover, changing the voltage protocol by switching the holding potential from 0 to +70 mV and shortening the ramp duration from 1000 to 200 ms induced a similar increase in inward current densities to 165 ± 8% (n = 4) and 168 ± 21% (n = 5) in both RBL and CaT1-RBL cells, respectively. Active store depletion (IP3, 60 nmCa2+) clearly reduced the delay of current activation and the time to reach the maximum current, yielding similar time courses in both RBL and CaT1-RBL cells (Fig. 2E) and substantiating store depletion as a trigger for current activation. However, current densities obtained upon maximal activation were significantly larger (Fig. 2F) in CaT1-RBL cells. Inward current densities obtained by passive (EGTA) or active (IP3 + 60 nm Ca2+) store depletion were not significantly different both in RBL and CaT1-RBL cells (Fig. 2F). All of the measurements reported above to yield store depletion-activated CaT1 currents were performed 1–2 days after the electroporation of RBL cells. To look for constitutive CaT1 activity, additional experiments were carried out 8–12 h following electroporation, as RBL mast cells suffering from prolonged Ca2+ influx through constitutively activated CaT1 channels may have been eliminated because of complete degranulation after 1–2 days. Constitutive CaT1 activity was indeed observed in ∼50% of cells 8–12 h after electroporation (Fig.3); the remainder already exhibited store-operated CaT1 activation. The constitutive CaT1 activity exhibited similar characteristics as that shown previously in HEK293 cells (compare with Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, the activation of endogenous CRAC expected to occur within 50–150 s was not visible when CaT1 channels were constitutively active in RBL cells, possibly because of Ca2+-dependent inhibition of CRAC channels (1Lewis R.S. Adv. Second. Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The intracellular presence of 10 mm EGTA is obviously not enough to sufficiently buffer the influx of Ca2+ through constitutively active CaT1 channels located along with CRAC channels in the plasma membrane, particularly during hyperpolarizing potentials. To evaluate differences between store-dependent and constitutive CaT1 activity in RBL cells, we determined the current density at 0 and 150 s in control (mock-transfected) and CaT1-transfected RBL cells 8–12 h and >24 h following electroporation (Fig. 3C). Control RBL cells and transfected (> 24h) cells showed clear inward currents activated upon store depletion, whereas 50% of RBL cells 8–12 h after transfection exhibited constitutive inward currents, the densities of which were significantly larger (p < 0.001) than those of the store depletion-activated currents. Hence, RBL cells, in contrast to HEK293 cells, apparently provide a distinctly different cellular environment capable of suppressing the constitutive activity of CaT1 and at the same time coupling its activation to store depletion. However, the higher expression levels of CaT1 suggested from larger current densities yield constitutively active CaT1 currents probably because of interference with the regulatory mechanism that activates CaT1 in dependence of store depletion. To further substantiate that the increase in current density observed in CaT1-RBL cells is due to expressed CaT1 rather than an up-regulation of endogenous CRAC, we used the current-voltage relationship typical of CaT1-mediated currents (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) when extracellular, monovalent cations function as charge carriers in the presence intracellular Mg2+ (Fig. 4). This approach was first established with CaT1-HEK293 cells. Switching from Ca2+-containing extracellular to a DVF solution revealed a negative slope in the current-voltage relationship between −85 and −70 mV (Fig. 4A). To minimize or even exclude a possible contribution of LTRPC7 (23Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 24Nadler M.J.

(Lond.). 2002; 539: 445-458Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to the observed CaT1 current-voltage relationship in DVF solution, the intracellular Mg2+ concentration was increased to 3 mm (Fig.4A) or 10 mm (not shown) Mg2+. Under both conditions the CaT1 current-voltage relationship looked identical, excluding contamination by LTRPC7 in HEK293 cells, and supported our approach to use this characteristic as a clear test for CaT1-mediated currents in RBL cells. Therefore, monovalent currents were initially studied in mock-transfected control RBL cells to establish the current-voltage relationship of endogenous ICRAC. Intracellular Mg2+ was again varied between 3 and 10 mmMg2+ to reveal a possible contribution of LTRPC7 (Fig. 4,C–F). The current-voltage relationships of mock-transfected RBL cells in DVF solution were significantly different using 3 mm (Fig. 4D) or 10 mm (Fig.4F) intracellular Mg2+, which suggested a substantial contribution of LTRPC7 at 3 mmMg2+, particularly at positive potentials. At 10 mm intracellular Mg2+ the remaining inward current in DVF solution exhibited substantial inactivation over time (Fig. 4E) and pronounced inward rectification in the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 4F), both typical for ICRAC, but was clearly lacking the CaT1-specific negative slope beyond −70 mV (compare with Fig. 4B). CaT1-expressing RBL cells were similarly studied as CaT1-HEK293 cells to evaluate the contribution of CaT1 to inward currents in DVF solution (Fig. 5). Constitutively active CaT1 currents in RBL cells (Fig. 5A) clearly exhibited the negative slope in the current-voltage relationship (Fig. 5B) as previously established in CaT1-HEK293 cells, confirming CaT1 channel expression. Furthermore, store-operated CaT1 channels activated by passive store depletion either in the presence of 3 (Fig.5D) or 10 mm (Fig. 5F) intracellular Mg2+ similarly showed the negative slope in DVF solution, indicating that the store-dependence of CaT1 did not interfere with this typical characteristic of CaT1. Hence, the negative slope in the current-voltage relationship observed in DVF solution suggests that CRAC and CaT1 currents are mediated by different channel proteins, although the activation of both channels is coupled to store depletion in RBL cells. To further evaluate whether CaT1 activity in RBL cells shares other features with the endogenous CRAC, we compared its sensitivity to 2-APB, a known blocker of ICRAC (26Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 27Kukkonen J.P. Lund P.-E. Akerman K.E.O.

(Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar), with the CaT1-derived current expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig.6). We initially confirmed that 75 μm 2-APB caused a block of endogenous ICRACin RBL cells (Fig. 6A). In RBL cells overexpressing CaT1, a blockade by 75 μm 2-APB occurred with similar characteristics as observed with endogenous ICRAC (Fig.6A). Interestingly, CaT1-RBL rather than RBL cells showed initially a small transient increase in inward current upon the application of 2-APB before the blockade occurred (Fig. 6A). In mock-transfected and CaT1-transfected RBL cells (Fig. 6B) the 2-APB-sensitive component showed similar inward rectification and reversal potential of >+30 mV. In contrast to the pronounced blocking effect of 2-APB on depletion-activated CaT1 and CRAC channels in RBL cells, the CaT1-mediated current in HEK293 cells was slightly potentiated by about 20% followed by a slow decline to control values upon the application of 75 μm 2-APB (Fig. 6, Cand D), which is consistent with Ref. 19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar. Moreover, preincubation with 75 μm 2-APB completely eliminated store-dependent activation of CRAC (data not shown) and CaT1 channels in RBL cells (Fig. 6E) but had no significant effect on the constitutively active CaT1-derived currents in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6F). These results suggest that the mechanism of store-dependent activation for CRAC and CaT1 currents is similar and possibly involves the same component sensitive to blockade by 2-APB, which is missing in HEK293 cells. To substantiate the involvement of the 2-APB-sensitive component provided by the RBL cell (Fig. 7), monovalent currents of store-operated CaT1 are rapidly and strongly inhibited by 2-APB (Fig. 7A). The CaT1 blockade by 2-APB was clearly visible (Fig. 7B) as the negative slope in the current-voltage relationship typical of CaT1 disappeared. In contrast, those currents carried by constitutively active CaT1 channels in RBL cells responded by a transient ∼20% stimulation (Fig. 7,C and D) similar to what was observed previously with constitutively active CaT1 in HEK293 cells (compare Fig. 6,C and D). This report demonstrates that the regulatory and pharmacological properties of heterologously expressed CaT1 are dependent on the cell type used as the expression system. We compared the properties of CaT1 channels generated by the expression in HEK293 and RBL cells. The typical current-voltage relationship of monovalent CaT1 currents enabled us to differentiate them from endogenous ICRAC in RBL cells. Based on this biophysical characteristic, we identified store-operated CaT1 currents in RBL cells that were highly sensitive to blockade by 2-APB. In contrast, larger current densities of CaT1 currents in RBL cells suggesting higher CaT1 expression levels generated constitutively active currents that were slightly stimulated by 2-APB. In HEK293 cells, CaT1 currents were always constitutively active and stimulated by 2-APB independent of their current densities. Yue et al. (18Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) have reported that CaT1 manifests the pore properties and store dependence of CRAC. However, very recently (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) it has been demonstrated that the ion selectivity, inward rectification, intracellular Mg2+ sensitivity, and the effect of 2-APB are different between CaT1-mediated current in HEK293 cells and ICRAC in RBL cells. Hence, it has been suggested that the pore properties of CRAC and CaT1 are distinct, thereby ruling out the possibility that CaT1 encompasses the full CRAC pore (18Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In the present study, the negative slope in the current-voltage relationship of CaT1 in DVF solution served as an indication to distinguish it from endogenous CRAC in RBL cells. This CaT1 characteristic was observed in all transfected RBL cells independent of the current densities obtained. The observed biophysical difference of CaT1 and CRAC channels in RBL cells is supported by a previous report comparing CaT1 channels in HEK293 with CRAC channels in RBL cells (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Based on this significant biophysical feature we conclude that CaT1 channels that are formed in RBL cells behave differently than endogenous CRAC channels, although the regulatory and pharmacological properties of CaT1 at lower current densities are identical to those of CRAC channels (see below). Thus, CRAC channels are apparently not homotetramers of CaT1 proteins. However, mutable heteromerization with another yet unidentified component, gradually changing channel characteristics in dependence of CaT1 expression level, cannot be excluded, leaving the possibility that CaT1 is part of the CRAC channel. The current densities obtained by CaT1 expression and the cell type where it is expressed affects the regulatory and pharmacological properties of CaT1. Current densities of constitutively active CaT1 channels in RBL cells were significantly larger than those reached upon CaT1 activation by store depletion. Furthermore, CaT1 current densities in HEK293 cells (−6.5 ± 0.8 pA/pF; n = 6) comparable in size with those of store-operated CaT1 currents in RBL cells (−5.7 ± 0.3 pA/pF; n = 17) never showed store-dependent activation. Recently, store-dependent regulation of CaT1 has been reported in Chinese hamster ovary cells (18Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), whereas constitutive activity has been observed when CaT1 (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H.

Niemeyer B. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reuss K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) has been expressed in HEK293 cells. This cell-dependent activation of CaT1-derived currents is in line with our findings and suggests the involvement of an auxiliary regulatory component coupling CaT1 activity to store depletion. The expression level of this CaT1-interacting component obviously varies between different cell types. Complementarily, the level of CaT1 channel expression may interfere with the degree of coupling to store depletion. In line with our observation, it has been recently suggested that the level of TRPC3 channel expression affects TRPC3 regulation by intracellular stores (32Vazquez V. Lievremont J.-P. Bird G.St. J. Putney J.W., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11777-11782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, high CaT1 expression levels may significantly change the stoichiometry of CaT1 channel interaction with the 2-APB sensitive (see below) component, yielding non-interacting CaT1 channels that are constitutively active. Here, we demonstrate that the pharmacological characteristics of CaT1 channels change with alteration in their regulatory properties. Constitutively active CaT1 currents responded to 75 μm2-APB with a slight increase, whereas store-operated CaT1 were substantially inhibited. These effects occurred independently of the charge carrier used both in Ca2+-containing or DVF solutions. Our observations complement a recent study (19Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reporting a 2-APB-induced potentiation of CaT1-derived currents in HEK293 cells in contrast to a 2-APB-mediated blockade of CRAC. The finding of the contrary effect of 2-APB on CaT1 currents suggests the existence of two distinct targets (30Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar) in RBL cells mediating stimulation or inhibition. It is tempting to speculate that the stimulatory effect is accomplished by a direct interaction with CaT1, whereas the inhibitory effect involves a CaT1-interacting component, which may provide the key function of current activation by store depletion as primarily proposed for the IP3 receptor (11Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC sigtrans;2001/90/re1Google Scholar). Recent reports (26Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

(Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (427) Google Scholar) imply that the target for the 2-APB block is exposed to the extracellular medium, suggesting a transmembrane protein. The missing 2-APB-sensitive component may be found among the TRPC family, possibly within the more Ca2+-selective and store-operated TRPC4 and TRPC5 proteins (10Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 11Montell, C. (2001) Science's STKE, www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC sigtrans;2001/90/re1Google Scholar). Accordingly, a distinct action of inhibitors such as 2-APB or Gd3+ on human TRPC3-mediated cation entry has been recently reported to result from different modes of activation reflecting differences in basic channel structure (33Trebak M. Bird G. St. J. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Additionally, channel properties such as blocker sensitivity and store-dependent activation may well be determined by auxiliary subunits that do not directly contribute to the permeation pathway. The background expression of such subunits is expected to vary between expression systems, resulting in different properties of the channels generated by the expression of CaT1. Importantly, our results strongly suggest the existence of a regulatory protein that on the one hand suppresses the constitutive activity of CaT1 and on the other hand enables regulation of the channels by the filling state of intracellular stores. In addition, the CaT1-associated regulatory component confers sensitivity of the channel to blocking by 2-APB. Recently (34Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K. Parys J.B. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6915-6922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the target for 2-APB is a component of the coupling machinery linking store depletion to current activation. We suggest that such a regulatory component is present in RBL but not HEK293 cells and may be shared among CaT1 and endogenous CRAC channels. CaT1 expression generates highly Ca2+-selective channels of different regulatory and pharmacological properties, depending on the type of expression system and the current density. Endogenous CRAC channels in RBL cells are activated by store depletion and blocked by 2-APB (Fig. 8A). CaT1 currents derived from the moderate expression of CaT1 channels resemble ICRAC in terms of activation by store depletion and the inhibition by 2-APB. However, based on different biophysical properties, CRAC and CaT1 channels are not identical (Fig.8B). Larger current densities obtained by higher CaT1 expression levels in RBL cells generate constitutively active CaT1 channels that are resistant to the inhibitory effect of 2-APB. These CaT1 channels are now present in excess to the 2-ABP sensitive component, thus lacking the interaction required to couple channel activation to store depletion (Fig. 8C). In future studies it will be important to identify the 2-APB sensitive component, probably by the help of CaT1. We thank S. Buchegger and B. Kenda for excellent technical assistance."

Osteoblasts are involved in the bone remodeling through the production of soluble factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts and by means of cell-cell interaction (1Manolagas S.C.

Many soluble osteotropic factors have been identified; however, it is not clear what kinds of adhesion molecule(s) are involved in the interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Recently, the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL),1 which is also known as the osteoclast differentiation factor, was cloned (2Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L. Kelley M.J. Dunstan C.R. Burgess T.

RANKL is essential for full osteoclastic differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells into mature multinucleated bone-resorptive osteoclasts in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Arai F.

Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1416-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Its expression is up-regulated in marrow stromal cells or osteoblasts by osteotropic hormones or cytokines such as parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, interleukin (IL)-11, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). RANKL interacts with a cell surface receptor, RANK, present at a certain stage of osteoclasts differentiation and on mature osteoclasts to stimulate their fusion, development, and bone resorption (7Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoprotegerin (OPG), which is also known as osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, is a soluble member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is widely expressed in multiple tissues and binds to RANKL, thereby neutralizing its function. Therefore, OPG acts as a secreted decoy receptor to negatively regulate osteoclast differentiation, activity, and survival both in vivo and in vitro (8Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M.

For instance, most metastatic foci in bone occur near the epiphyseal plate where microvasculature is abundant (10Sasaki A. Boyce B.F. Story B. Wright K.R. Chapman M. Boyce R. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T.

We previously established bone-derived endothelial cells (BDECs) to study their roles in bone disease (13Zhang Y. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Morinaga Y. Nakagawa T. Yamada M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that they play an important role in bone metabolism by producing IL-11 and PGE2 (13Zhang Y. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Morinaga Y. Nakagawa T. Yamada M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Kage K. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Ogata E. Fujita T. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These facts indicate that endothelial cells in bone play an important role in osteoclastogenesis. Bone is unique because its matrix serves as a reservoir of growth factors. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the most abundantly stored in bone matrix (15Delany A.M. Canalis E. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. 3. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 127-155Google Scholar). Because TGF-β is released and activated during the breakdown of the bone matrix in pathological conditions, the released TGF-β might affect the behavior of cells within the bone microenvironment. It has been reported that released TGF-β stimulates tumor growth and further bone breakdown by stimulating cancer cell production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (16Thomas R.J. Guise T.A. Yin J.J. Elliott J. Horwood N.J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that released active TGF-β modifies the nature of endothelial cells in bone to promote osteoclastogenesis. In this report, we examined the effects of TGF-β on endothelial cell function. We found that TGF-β stimulated the expression of RANKL both in our previously established BDECs and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), although TGF-β down-regulated its expression in bone marrow stroma ST2 cells. Further analysis revealed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways were involved in the TGF-β-induced RANKL expression. We also discovered that mouse RANKL promoter contains two cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-like domains (−945 to −926 and −484 to −465) and that the domains were involved in the TGF-β-induced RANKL transcription. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway or the PKA pathway decreased the TGF-β-induced RANKL expression in endothelial cells. Therefore, endothelial cells might be involved in osteoclastogenesis via RANKL expression during the pathological bone resorption. TGF-β1 was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Vitamin D3 was purchased from Sigma. COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PKA inhibitor KT5720 and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs (Cambridge, MA). The mouse bone marrow-derived endothelial cell line BM-3 was established in our laboratory as described previously (13Zhang Y. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Morinaga Y. Nakagawa T. Yamada M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). BM-3 cells were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) and fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml kanamycin (Meiji Seika Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (DMEM growth medium) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Mouse bone marrow stroma ST2 cells were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Ibaraki, Japan) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (RPMI growth medium). HUVECs, culture medium (essential basal medium (EBM)), and medium supplements (packaged as SingleQuots containing human recombinant epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, gentamicin, bovine brain extract, and fetal bovine serum) were purchased from Sanko Junyaku (Tokyo, Japan). Total cellular RNA was purified by the acid-guanidium-phenol-chloroform method; first strand cDNA was synthesized with the 1.0 μg of the total RNA using Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase; and 1.5 μg of the cDNA was amplified by PCR in the conditions as shown in Table I. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify and detect human RANKL (GenBankTM accession number AF019047), murine RANKL (GenBankTM accession numberAF019048), human OPG (GenBankTM accession number U94332), human β-actin (GenBankTM accession number NM001101), murine G3PDH (GenBankTM accession number M32599), and murine EP4 (GenBankTM accession number NM008965).Table IConditions of PCRPrimerCycleNucleotidesAnnealing temperature °CMouse RANKL30434–1034 (601 bp)67Mouse G3PDH2351–1033 (983 bp)65Mouse EP435715–1556 (842 bp)65Human RANKL30533–1088 (556 bp)65Human OPG3085–493 (409 bp)65Human β-actin23468–1128 (661 bp)68 Open table in a new tab Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Lee S.H. Fujita N. Mashima T. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2131-2139PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and solubilized with lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and 0.2% SDS. The cell lysates (25 μg/lane) were applied to a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresed proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with antibodies to COX-1 or COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI); antibodies to CREB, phospho-CREB (Ser133), p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr183/Tyr185), ATF-2, or phospho-ATF-2 (Thr69/Thr71) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); antibodies to mouse RANKL or human RANKL (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); an antibody to β-actin (Sigma); or an antibody to active-MAPK/ERK (pTEpY; Promega, Madison, WI). The membranes were then incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis of RANKL was performed according to the method described previously (18Menaa C. Reddy S.V. Kurihara N. Maeda H. Anderson D. Cundy T. Cornish J. Singer F.R. Bruder J.M. Roodman G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1833-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). BM-3 cells were plated onto six-well gelatin-coated dishes and grown to confluence in DMEM. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h, and then TGF-β was added to the culture. The conditioned medium was filtrated with 0.22-μm filters and stored at −80 °C until use. The concentration of PGE2 in each sample was determined by using an enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical Co.). BM-3 cells were seeded onto six-well gelatin-coated dishes and grown to 50–80% confluence in DMEM growth medium. ST2 cells were seeded at the same density onto six-well dishes and grown in RPMI 1640 growth medium. After incubation for 18–24 h, 1 μg of luciferase reporter vector pGL3–1005 containing nucleotides −1005 to +1 of the murine RANKL gene, pGL3–723 containing nucleotides −723 to +1 of the murine RANKL gene, or pGL3–256 containing nucleotides −256 to +1 of the murine RANKL gene (19Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was introduced into cells using 3 μg of Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 4 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. After incubation for an additional 12 h, the cells were treated with TGF-β. Luciferase activity in the lysate was measured using a luciferase assay system as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity in the lysate was measured using MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The activities were normalized by measuring protein concentrations in each sample with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) or by co-transfection of control thymidine kinase-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). BM-3 cells that had been seeded at 1.5 × 105/ml were transfected with appropriate plasmids using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We typically transfected at least 50% of cells as judged using a control pcDNA3 vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein under fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type human CREBcDNA (WT CREB) and dominant-negative human CREB cDNA (DN CREB133) in a pCMV vector were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The p38 MAPKcDNA was generated by RT-PCR using mRNA isolated from C7 cells as the template. The sense and antisense primers for murine p38 MAPK were 5′-AGATGTCGCAGGAGAGGCCCACG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGACTCCATTTCT TCTTGGTCAAGGGGTGG-3′, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Substitutions of the internal EcoRI site in p38 MAPK cDNA were accomplished by converting GAATTC to GAGTTC by PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After restriction with EcoRI, the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment cDNA was subcloned into an EcoRI site of the pcDNA3 vector in which the sequence between the BamHI and EcoRI sites had been replaced with a FLAG epitope containing the translation initiation codon ATG at the 5′ end (pc5FLAG vector) (20Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of BM-3 cells were prepared with the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). Biotin end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-biotin-TGAGTTTGAGGTCAGCCTGG-3′ (−945 to −926) and 5′-biotin-CCCATTTGAAGTCGCTTTTG-3′ (−484 to −465) as well as nonlabeled oligonucleotide containing CRE consensus sequence 5′-ATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGC-3′ were generated using an oligonucleotide synthesizer (CRE-like domains are underlined). The binding reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extract protein, buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 2 nm of biotin-labeled DNA. The reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. The competition reactions were performed by adding 200-fold excess unlabeled double-stranded CRE consensus oligonucleotide to the reaction mixture. The reactions were electrophoresed on a 6% precasted Tris-borate-EDTA gel (Invitrogen) at 100 V for 1 h in a 100 mm Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. The reactions were transferred to a nylon membrane. The biotin-labeled DNA was detected with LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Pierce). Some osteolytic bone diseases are known to be associated with excessive angiogenesis in bone (11Dickson G.R. Hamilton A. Hayes D. Carr K.E. Davis R. Molla R.A. Bone. 1990; 11: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Dickson G.R. Mollan R.A. Carr K.E. Histochemistry. 1987; 87: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that bone endothelial cells participate in the regulation of bone remodeling as osteoblasts. After establishing BDECs, we found that they promoted bone resorption in vitro by secreting IL-11 (13Zhang Y. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Morinaga Y. Nakagawa T. Yamada M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or PGE2 (14Kage K. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Ogata E. Fujita T. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in response to several osteotropic factors. Recently, RANKL was cloned from stromal and osteoblasts and has been reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis (3Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar). We thus examined the expression of RANKL in BDECs. Because TGF-β is stored in bone matrix and is released and activated during the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (15Delany A.M. Canalis E. LeRoith D. Bondy C. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. 3. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 127-155Google Scholar), we examined the expression of RANKL mRNA in BDECs after treatment with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 1 A, TGF-β induced RANKL mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in bone-derived endothelial BM-3 cells. Time course analysis revealed that RANKL mRNA expression reached the peak at 3 h (Fig. 1 B). Then the amount of RANKL mRNA declined slightly in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the expression level of G3PDH mRNA was not changed by TGF-β treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm the results, we performed Western blot analysis using an anti-RANKL antibody. BM-3 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β and then harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Consistent with the previous results, TGF-β induced RANKL protein expression in a time-dependent manner in BM-3 cells (Fig. 1 C). Under this condition, β-actin protein expression was not changed by TGF-β treatment. BM-3 cells were established by transformation with SV40 virus (13Zhang Y. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Morinaga Y. Nakagawa T. Yamada M. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the established BM-3 cells might respond differently than endothelial cells in vivo, we investigated the effect of TGF-β on RANKL mRNA expression in HUVECs. Consistent with the established BM-3 cell line, TGF-β enhanced the expression of RANKL mRNA in HUVECs in a time-dependent (Fig. 2 A) and a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). We also performed Western blot analysis with an anti-RANKL antibody and found that TGF-β induced RANKL protein expression in HUVECs (Fig.2 C). The results indicate that TGF-β induces RANKL expression in cells of endothelial lineage. OPG is a soluble decoy receptor of RANKL, thereby inhibiting the RANK binding to RANKL and negatively regulating osteoclast differentiation, activity, and survival both in vivo and in vitro(8Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliott R. Colombero A. Tan H.L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N.

Recently, TGF-β was reported to up-regulate OPG expression in osteoblasts (21Takai H. Kanematsu M. Yano K. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27091-27096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Murakami T. Yamamoto M. Ono K. Nishikawa M. Nagata N. Motoyoshi K. Akatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β down-regulated OPG mRNA expression in HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). This result indicates that TGF-β stimulates osteoclastogenesis not only by inducing RANKL expression but also by decreasing OPG expression in endothelial cells. To further quantify the TGF-β-mediated transcriptional regulation of RANKL, we performed transient luciferase assays. BM-3 cells were transiently transfected with RANKL promoter-luciferase fusion gene containing 1005 bases of 5′-flanking sequence (pGL3–1005) (19Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1 A), the addition of TGF-β increased the luciferase activity in pGL3–1005-transfected BM-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). In pGL3–1005-transfected ST2 cells, no such luciferase activity was seen even in the presence of 10 ng/ml TGF-β (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the previous reports (19Kitazawa R. Kitazawa S. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1445: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), treatment of ST2 cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 raised the RANKL promoter activity about 2-fold (Fig.3 B). RT-PCR analysis also suggested that TGF-β could not induce RANKL mRNA expression in ST2 cells (data not shown). PGE2 is a potent stimulator of bone resorption in vitro and induces osteoclast formation in mouse bone marrow culture (23Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Clin. Orthop. 1995; 313: 36-46PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 synthesis is regulated by cyclooxygenases COXs, which catalyze the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acids (24Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed, and COX-2 is inducibly expressed by a variety of mitogen and inflammatory stimuli (25Kawaguchi H.

It is also reported that COX-2 is up-regulated in BDECs by cytokine stimulation such as IL-1α and basic fibroblast growth factor (14Kage K. Fujita N. Oh-hara T. Ogata E. Fujita T. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, TGF-β was seen to stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE2release in a few cell types (29Fong C.Y. Pang L. Holland E. Knox A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L201-L207PubMed Google Scholar, 30Saha D. Datta P.K. Sheng H. Morrow J.D. Wada M. Moses H.L. Beauchamp R.D. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 508-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We first investigated the COXs expressions after treatment of BM-3 cells with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 4 A, TGF-β up-regulated COX-2 protein expression, but not COX-1 protein expression, in a dose-dependent manner. Measurement of PGE2concentration showed that TGF-β promoted, in a dose-dependent manner, PGE2 production in BM-3 cells (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 C, adding a high dose of PGE2(10 μm) induced RANKL mRNA expression. However, RANKL expression was not promoted at a lower concentration of PGE2 (data not shown). PGE2 could bind to four different cognate receptors: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. The PGE2-induced RANKL induction in osteoblasts was reported to be mediated by EP4 receptor (31Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We checked the EP4 mRNA expression in BM-3 cells and found that BM-3 cells expressed EP4 as in ST2 cells (Fig. 4 D). Therefore, we speculated that COX-2 expression and its product, PGE2 secretion, could be the cause of RANKL up-regulation. To investigate whether PGE2induction was critical for TGF-β-induced RANKL expression, we examined the expression in BM-3 cells that had previously been treated with the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398. Pretreatment of the cells with 10 or 30 μm NS-398 completely inhibited the PGE2 synthesis (Fig. 4 E). The TGF-β-induced RANKL mRNA expression was not affected even in the presence of NS-398. Therefore, TGF-β-induced RANKL expression in BM-3 cells was not due to COX-2 protein expression or to PGE2secretion. We screened the drugs that could interfere with TGF-β-induced RANKL expression. It revealed that pretreatment of cells with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and the PKA inhibitor KT5720, but not the MAPK/ERK inhibitor PD98059, decreased RANKL mRNA expression (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that PKA and p38 MAPK may participate in the TGF-β-induced RANKL expression. Because PKA promoted the phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB, we performed Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-CREB antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the treatment of BM-3 cells with TGF-β induced the phosphorylation of CREB without affecting CREB protein amount. The phosphorylation of CREB was seen within 15 min after TGF-β was added and then declined slightly in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). Because TGF-β did not rise the level of cAMP in BM-3 cells (data not shown), TGF-β may directly activates PKA as it did in mesangial cells (32Wang L. Zhu Y. Sharma K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8522-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When BM-3 cells were incubated with PKA activator forskolin, it induced RANKL mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig.5 C). Thus, PKA activation is involved in RANKL mRNA expression. To confirm the involvement of the PKA-CREB signaling pathway in RANKL expression, we transiently transfected pCMV vector containing WT and DN CREB cDNA into BM-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 D, overexpression of WT CREB protein alone induced the RANKL mRNA expression. In contrast, overexpression of DN CREB protein did not up-regulate but rather decreased the RANKL mRNA expression. Moreover, TGF-β-induced RANKL mRNA expression was suppressed by transfecting DN CREB cDNA into BM-3 cells (Fig. 5 E). These results strongly indicate that the PKA-CREB signaling pathway plays an important role in the TGF-β-induced RANKL expression. Because the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 could also inhibit the TGF-β-induced RANKL mRNA expression in BM-3 cells (Fig.5 A), we examined the role of p38 MAPK signaling on RANKL expression. The p38 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation via upstream kinases, such as MKK3 and MKK6 (33Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Here, we demonstrate that GATA-5 and HNF-1α physically associate both in vivo andin vitro and that this interaction is necessary for cooperative activation of the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase promoter. Furthermore, physical association is mediated by the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA factors and the homeodomain of HNF-1α. Deletion of HNF-1α activation domains or interruption of HNF-1-binding sites in the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase promoter resulted in a complete loss of cooperativity, whereas deletion of GATA-5 activation domains or interruption of GATA-binding sites resulted in a reduction, but not an elimination, of cooperativity. We hypothesize that GATA/HNF-1α cooperativity is mediated by HNF-1α through its activation domains, which are oriented for high levels of activation through binding to DNA and physical association with GATA factors. These data suggest a paradigm whereby intestine-specific gene expression is regulated by unique interactions among tissue-restricted transcription factors coexpressed in the intestine.

During intestinal development, interactions between visceral endoderm and mesoderm at E81 in mice result in the formation of a primitive foregut that rapidly undergoes cytodifferentiation, so that by E19, an epithelial monolayer overlies nascent villi. During the first 2 weeks of postnatal life, a proliferating compartment develops into the crypts of Lieberkühn. Stem cells located near the base of crypts rapidly divide and give rise to four terminally differentiated cell types, which migrate both basally and apically. Cells migrating to the base of crypts become Paneth's cells, whereas those migrating up the crypt toward villi become absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. At the crypt-villus junction, the proliferative phase ends, and cells acquire a differentiated phenotype characterized by the synthesis of functionally relevant proteins. The cells continue to migrate up the villi, enter an apoptotic cycle, and are shed into the intestinal lumen ∼3 days after their initial appearance on villi. The molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic processes of intestine-specific gene expression and cellular differentiation during development are poorly understood.Absorptive enterocytes compose ∼95% of epithelial cells on villi and are the cells responsible for the terminal digestion and absorption of nutrients. Lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH), the enzyme critical for the digestion of milk lactose, is an absorptive enterocyte-specific protein that serves as a marker for intestine-specific gene expression and intestinal differentiation (4Krasinski S.D.

LPH expression is highest at birth and continues to be highly expressed throughout the suckling period. After weaning, LPH expression per enterocyte is reduced and is also restricted to the jejunum and proximal ileum (4Krasinski S.D. Estrada G. Yeh K.Y. Yeh M. Traber P.G. Rings E.H. Buller H.A.

Defined by two evolutionarily conserved zinc fingers of the motif Cys-X 2-Cys-X 17-Cys-X 2-Cys that mediate binding to the consensus DNA sequence WGATAR (where W = A or T, and R = A or G), the GATA family is generally categorized into two classes based on expression patterns and amino acid homologies. GATA-1, -2, and -3 are expressed in developing bone marrow cells and are critical for hematopoiesis (30Orkin S.H. Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 79-83PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GATA-4, -5, and -6 have a more diverse pattern of expression that includes the small intestine, heart, liver, lungs, and gonads (22Arceci R.J.

Although the wide-ranging expression patterns of GATA-4, -5, and -6 argue against these proteins as being master regulators of tissue or cell type-specific gene expression, there is increasing evidence that this subfamily might be critical in regulating cell-specific gene expression through unique interactions with other semirestricted transcription factors and cofactors (34Molkentin J.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar).HNF-1α is a member of a transcription factor family that contains a modified homeodomain and that binds as a dimer to the consensus sequence GTTAATNATTAAC (35Tronche F.

We have recently shown that GATA subfamily members and HNF-1α synergistically activate the LPH and sucrase-isomaltase promoters (21Krasinski S.D. van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that members of these two transcription factor families interact to produce high levels of enterocyte-specific gene expression.The goal of these experiments was to characterize the role that GATA and HNF-1α transcription factors play in regulating intestine-specific gene expression by defining the mechanism by which these two transcription factors function to synergistically activate the human LPH promoter. In these studies, the importance of critical structures in GATA factors and HNF-1α, including domains responsible for protein/protein interaction, DNA-binding domains, and activation domains, for cooperative activation was determined. Using GATA-5 as a model, the results of this study reveal that physical association between GATA-5 and HNF-1α is required for the synergistic activation of the human LPH promoter and that this interaction occurs through the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 and the homeodomain of HNF-1α. Identification of parallel mechanisms of protein/protein interaction between zinc finger and homeodomain proteins in other vertebrate tissue (46Lee Y. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Development. 1997; 124: 839-847PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that zinc finger/homeodomain interactions are an efficient mechanism for synergistic activation of gene transcription that has been conserved throughout evolution.RESULTSGATA-5 and HNF-1α synergistically activate the human LPH promoter (21Krasinski S.D. van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these two transcription factors physically associate. To test the hypothesis that GATA-5 and HNF-1α physically associate in vivo, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with G5-FLAG and H1α-CMV, and FLAG-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts using beads coated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Detection of HNF-1α in the G5-FLAG immunoprecipitate indicates GATA-5/HNF-1α interactions. As shown by EMSAs using an HNF-1-binding site as a probe (Fig.2), a protein·DNA complex was identified that supershifted with an anti-HNF-1α antibody, demonstrating that HNF-1α was present in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate. HNF-1α was not detected in nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells cotransfected with FLAG-CMV and H1α-CMV, indicating that HNF-1α does not bind to FLAG alone. These data demonstrate that HNF-1α physically associates with GATA-5 in vivo.To characterize critical domains in GATA-5 necessary for physical association and functional cooperativity with HNF-1α, mutations were introduced into GATA-5 to delete or disrupt specific structures (Fig.3 A). The capacity of wild-type and mutant GATA-5 proteins to associate physically with HNF-1αin vitro was then tested by GST pull-down assays using GST fused to HNF-1α. As indicated by the presence of a labeled protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), GATA-5 proteins that have intact C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions (wild-type GATA-5 and GATA-5 mut1, mut3, and mut4) were pulled down by GST-H1α. In contrast, GATA-5 mut2, in which the basic region and C-terminal domain are deleted, and GATA-5 mut5, in which the structure of the C-terminal zinc finger is disrupted, were not pulled down by GST-H1α. GST alone did not pull down wild-type GATA-5, indicating that GST does not interact with GATA-5. Direct loading of labeled TnT products (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) indicates that proteins of predicted sizes were synthesized. These data demonstrate that the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 are required for physical association with HNF-1α.Figure 3C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 are necessary for physical association with HNF-1 α and binding to DNA. A, schematic representation of wild-type and mutant GATA-5 proteins. GATA-5 contains two N-terminal activation domains (AD I andAD II), two zinc fingers (ZnI, N-terminal zinc finger; and ZnII, C-terminal zinc finger), and a basic region (B) near the C terminus (24Morrisey E.E., Ip, H.S. Tang Z., Lu, M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is deleted in mut1, whereas the C-terminal domain and basic region are deleted in mut2. Both activation domains are deleted in mut3, whereas both activation domains and the N-terminal zinc finger are deleted in mut4. GATA-5 mut5 is a cysteine-to-serine substitution in the C-terminal zinc finger at amino acid 270. B, the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 are necessary for physical association with HNF-1α. GST pull-down assays (upper panel) were carried out using GST-H1α incubated with labeled,in vitro transcribed and translated wild-type (WT) (lane 1) and mutant (lanes 2–6) GATA-5. Wild-type GATA-5 and GATA-5 mut1, mut3, and mut4 were pulled down by GST-H1α, whereas GATA-5 mut2 and mut5 were not. GATA-5 was not pulled down by GST alone (lane 7). All proteins used in the GST pull-down assays were synthesized as shown by direct loading of TnT products (lower panel). C, the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions are critical for binding to DNA. EMSAs were carried out using the Xenopus intestinal fatty acid-binding protein GATA site as a probe (25Gao X. Sedgwick T. Shi Y.B. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2901-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and wild-type and mutant GATA-5 proteins as indicated (lanes 2–9). Wild-type GATA-5 formed a complex (lane 2) that was competed with a specific oligonucleotide (S; lane 3), but not with a nonspecific oligonucleotide (N;lane 4). Wild-type GATA-5 and GATA-5 mut1, mut3, and mut4 all bound to DNA, whereas GATA-5 mut2 and mut5 did not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To map DNA-binding domains in GATA-5, EMSAs were carried out using a GATA-binding site as a probe and in vitro synthesized wild-type and mutant GATA-5 proteins (Fig. 3 C). A protein·DNA complex was formed with wild-type GATA-5 that was competed away by a specific oligonucleotide, but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide, indicating that GATA-5 binds the DNA specifically. GATA-5 mut1, mut3, and mut4 bound DNA, but GATA-5 mut2 and mut5 did not. These data are parallel to the GST pull-down experiments demonstrating that the domains critical for GATA-5/DNA interaction also map to the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions. Thus, regions in GATA-5 that mediate protein/protein interaction with HNF-1α and DNA binding are co-localized to the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions.The functional importance of specific structures in GATA-5 for synergistic GATA-5/HNF-1α activation of the human LPH promoter was tested by transient cotransfection assays using wild-type or mutant GATA-5 and wild-type HNF-1α expression vectors (Fig.4). To test specific effects of transfected wild-type and mutant GATA-5 and HNF-1α, a model system utilizing cells that do not synthesize appreciable amounts of these factors was necessary. HeLa cells provided such a model system (15Fang R. Santiago N.A. Olds L.C. Sibley E. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Fang R.

The human LPH promoter (h118wt) was independently activated by HNF-1α, as previously described in Caco-2 cells (21Krasinski S.D. van Wering H.M. Tannemaat M.R. Grand R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G69-G84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GATA-5 alone only minimally activated this promoter. The human LPH promoter was synergistically activated by a combination of GATA-5 plus HNF-1α, as indicated by a transcriptional activity that was ∼3-fold greater than the sum of the individual transcriptional activities of GATA-5 and HNF-1α alone (indicated by the dashed line). GATA-5 mut1, mut3, and mut4 all demonstrated synergistic activation of the human LPH promoter when cotransfected with HNF-1α as indicated by a mean activation that extends to the right of the dashed line. Noteworthy, however, is that synergy, although present, was greatly reduced with mut3 and mut4, which do not contain GATA-5 activation domains. GATA-5 mut2 and mut5, which did not physically associate with HNF-1α or bind to DNA, failed to show synergistic activation of the human LPH promoter. These data suggest that the C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 are required for synergistic activation of the human LPH promoter.Figure 4C-terminal zinc finger and basic regions of GATA-5 are required for synergistic activation with HNF-1α.Transient cotransfection assays were carried out in HeLa cells using the h118wt promoter cotransfected with pRC-CMV (negative control expression vector) or with wild-type (wt) or mutant GATA-5 and wild-type HNF-1α. GATA-5 mutants are as indicated in Fig.3 A. The dashed line indicates the sum of the transcriptional activities of wild-type GATA-5 and HNF-1α cotransfected individually with h118wt. The transcriptional activities that extend to the right of the dashed line indicate synergistic activation. Data are means ± S.E. (n= 5). *, p < 0.05 compared with h118wt cotransfected with GATA-5 and HNF-1α.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize functional domains in HNF-1α, mutations that result in C-terminal deletions were introduced into wild-type HNF-1α (Fig.5 A). The capacity of these proteins to physically associate with GATA-5 in vitro was assessed by GST pull-down assays using GST linked to GATA-5 (Fig.5 B, upper panel). As indicated by the presence of labeled protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5 B,upper panel), wild-type HNF-1α and HNF-1α mut1, in which the activation domains are deleted, physically associated with GST-G5. However, HNF-1α mut2, in which the activation domains plus a segment of the C-terminal side of the homeodomain are deleted, did not physically associate with GST-G5. All proteins were synthesized as shown by direct loading of the TnT reactions (Fig.5 B, lower panel).Figure 5An intact homeodomain in HNF-1 α is necessary for physical association with GATA-5 and binding to DNA. A, schematic representation of wild-type and mutant HNF-1α proteins. HNF-1α contains an N-terminal dimerization domain (DD), a POU domain, a homeodomain (HD) that has a unique 21-amino acid loop (21 AA loop), and two C-terminal activation domains (AD I and AD II). The activation domains are deleted in HNF-1α mut1, and the activation domains plus a segment of the C-terminal side of the homeodomain are deleted in HNF-1α mut2.B, an intact homeodomain of HNF-1α is required for physical association with GATA-5. GST pull-down assays were carried out using GST-G5 incubated with in vitro labeled wild-type (WT) and mutant HNF-1α proteins (upper panel). Wild-type HNF-1α (closed arrowhead; lane 1) and HNF-1α mut1 (open arrowhead; lane 2) physically associated with GATA-5, whereas HNF-1α mut2 did not (lane 3). HNF-1α did not interact with GST alone (lane 4). All wild-type and mutant HNF-1α proteins were synthesized as indicated by direct loading of labeled products (lower panel). HNF-1α mut2 is indicated by the shaded arrowhead. C, an intact homeodomain is required for HNF-1α binding to DNA. EMSAs were carried out using the rat β-fibrinogen probe (53Courtois G. Morgan J.G.

https://openalex.org/W1966115265,"PA700, the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, plays a central role in the recognition and efficient degradation of misfolded proteins. PA700 promotes degradation by recruiting proteasomal substrates utilizing polyubiquitin chains and chaperone-like binding activities and by opening the access to the core of the 20 S proteasome to promote degradation. Here we provide evidence that PA700 in addition to binding misfolded protein substrates also acts to remodel their conformation prior to proteolysis. Scrambled RNase A (scRNase A), a misfolded protein, only slowly refolds spontaneously into an active form because of the rate-limiting unfolding of misfolded disulfide isomers. Notably, PA700 accelerates the rate of reactivation of scRNase A, consistent with its ability to increase the exposure of these disulfide bonds to the solvent. In this regard, PA700 also exposes otherwise buried sites to digestion by exogenous chymotrypsin in a polyubiquitinated enzymatically active substrate, pentaubiquitinated dihydrofolate reductase, Ub5DHFR. The dihydrofolate reductase ligand methotrexate counters the ability of PA700 to promote digestion by chymotrypsin. Together, these results indicate that in addition to increasing substrate affinity and opening the access channel to the catalytic sites, PA700 activates proteasomal degradation by remodeling the conformation of protein substrates.

Unless degraded, these damaged proteins tend to aggregate. An accumulation of protein aggregates is tightly linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases (1Harris D.A.

Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In cells, molecular chaperones retard the aggregation process and present the aberrant proteins for proteolysis (5Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), the bulk of which is mediated by the proteasome. The 20 S proteasome consists of two seven-member rings of β-subunits containing the active sites flanked by two seven-member rings of noncatalytic α-subunits (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 7Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Either end of the 20 S proteasome can interact with two proteasomal regulatory complexes, PA700 (also called the 19 S regulatory complex) and PA28 (also called 11 S regulatory complex). PA700 contains ATPase sites, polyubiquitin, and misfolded protein binding sites. Together with the 20 S core, PA700 forms the 26 S proteasome responsible for the degradation of large polyubiquitinated and/or damaged proteins (8DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A.

The PA28·20 S proteasome complex degrades smaller polypeptides, producing peptides for presentation as class I major histocompatibility complex antigens (9Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 10Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

The multifunctional PA700 complex can be disassociated into two subcomplexes, the so-called “lid” and “base” (12Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Although the function of most PA700 subunits is obscure, several activities have been defined by genetic and biochemical studies. First, the six AAA1 ATPase subunits of PA700 base compose a ring, which associates with both ends of the 20 S proteasome when the 26 S proteasome is formed, thereby opening the narrow pore of the 20 S core (13Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the lid complex contains polyubiquitin chain binding activity. The S5a subunit of PA700 specifically binds polyubiquitin-tagged proteins in vitro(15Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However in vivo studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plants show that the ubiquitin chain binding site in S5a is not required for the degradation of all polyubiquitinated proteins (16van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M., Fu, H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 17Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional sites are involved. Third, an isopeptidase activity (18Lam Y.A., Xu, W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 19Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) is present in the lid. A 37-kDa subunit, P37, catalyzes the cleavage of the polyubiquitin chains into ubiquitin monomers, which are then presumably recycled, whereas the targeted substrates are degraded. Fourth, a misfolded protein binding activity has been identified in the base. Both mammalian PA700 (20Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and yeast proteasome regulatory complex (21Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) interact with several misfolding proteins and repress their aggregation. The base alone, which contains the six AAA ATPases and two other proteins, can mediate this activity. Finally, PA700 is presumed to be an unfoldase (22Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 23Johnston J.A. Johnson E.S. Waller P.R. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8172-8178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The constricted annulus of even the dilated 20 S proteasome is thought to permit access of only denatured proteins to the catalytic sites within the chamber. By analogy, the AAA ATPase regulators of the prokaryotic Clp protease family, ClpA and ClpX, have been demonstrated to unfold the substrate prior to degradation (24Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 26Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). An unfoldase activity was also demonstrated for the recently described archaebacterial proteasome-activating nucleotidase in addition to its anti-aggregation and refolding activities (27Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that proteasomal substrates are unfolded and/or remodeled by PA700, a misfolded protein, scrambled bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (scRNase A) and a polyubiquitinated substrate pentaubiquitin-tagged dihydrofolate reductase (Ub5DHFR) was selected as model substrates. Our results suggest that PA700 promotes the exposure of otherwise buried sites in these two substrates, highlighting additional parallels between the 26 S proteasome and the Clp proteases. PA700 and latent 20 S proteasome were purified from bovine red blood cells as described previously (8DeMartino G.N. Proske R.J. Moomaw C.R. Strong A.A. Song X. Hisamatsu H. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A.

Acta. 1989; 995: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recombinant PA28α, a potent proteasomal activator of peptide hydrolysis, was purified by standard methods (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain as reported previously (30Strickland E., Qu, B.H. Millen L. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25421-25424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ub5DHFR was a kind gift from Dr. C. M. Pickart (Johns Hopkins University). Purified Escherichia coli GroEL and GroES were a gift from Dr. D. Chuang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). scRNase A was made as described previously (31Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was purified from rat liver (32Noiva R. Kimura H. Roos J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19645-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbA was purchased from Stress Gene. Polyribonucleic acid was from Calbiochem. Purified PA700, 20 S proteasome, and PA28α concentration were calculated based on their molecular masses of 700, 700, and 210 kDa, respectively. Purified scRNase A, PDI, and DsbA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 9300, 43,000, 11,900 cm−1 m−1, respectively. scRNase A stock solution was prepared in 0.1% acetic acid. PA700, PDI, and other proteins were preincubated in refolding buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.65 mm DTT, pH 7.6) for 10 min at 30 °C, and then scRNase A was added to a final concentration of 6 μm. At each time point, 30 μl of the solution was removed, and the RNase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at room temperature with a cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic monophosphate (cCMP) substrate (33Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 1.2 μm incubated scRNase A, 4 mm cCMP in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.35. The hydrolysis of cCMP, reflecting the reactivation of RNase A, was monitored continuously as an increase in absorbance at 296 nm. The noncatalyzed reactivation of scRNase A under the same conditions was subtracted as background. The activity of an equivalent amount of native RNase A in this assay was taken as 100%. Alternatively, scRNase A activation was determined using RNA as a substrate. 3 μg of polymerized nucleic acid was incubated with 50 nm scRNase A in the presence or absence of 60 nm PDI, PA700, and other proteins in refolding buffer A for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% perchloric acid. The degree of reactivation was monitored by separating RNA on a 2% agarose gel and visualizing the remaining RNA with ethidium bromide fluorescence. In glycerol gradient co-sediment experiments, 15 mg of PA700 was resolved on a 2-ml 10–35% glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 3 h. The fractions were collected (100 μl) and assayed (10 μl) for their ability to promote the reactivation of 73 nm scRNase A using 2 μg of RNA substrate. The fractions were also assessed (20 μl) for their ability to stimulate the proteolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome using a suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorogenic peptide substrate as described previously (35Ma C.P., Vu, J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modification of PA700 and PDI by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was performed according to the protocol “conjugation with thiol-reactive probes” offered by Molecular Probes. Approximately, 3 μm PDI or PA700 was incubated with 1 mm NEM in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, I mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C for 6 h under dark. Excess NEM was removed by dialysis extensively at 4 °C against the same reaction buffer. The peptide was synthesized at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center using a Rainin Symphony multiplex peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (>95%). The identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectral analysis. The peptide concentration was calculated based on the molecular mass of 1329 Da. The redox folding of the peptide (50 μm) was carried out in McIlvaine buffer (0.2m dibasic sodium phosphate, 0.1 m citric acid, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 6.5) with appropriate concentrations of DsbA, PA700, and BSA as shown in Fig. 3B (34Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Reduced and oxidized peptides were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a 0.46 × 150-cm ultrasphere C18 column (Beckman). The peptides were eluted (1 ml/min) using a 1%/min gradient of 90% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid:H2O), 10% buffer B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid:acetonitrile) to 70% buffer A, 30% buffer B. The peptide was detected using the absorbance of the dansyl-lysine group at 340 nm. The oxidized and reduced peptides were eluted at 19% and 20% buffer B, respectively and were well resolved (data not shown). Ub5DHFR (80 nm) was incubated with chymotrypsin (2 nm) with or without PA700 (20 nm), GroEL (20 nm)·GroES (40 nm) complex, Hsc70 (20 nm), and/or MTX (200 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA for the indicated time at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-NC transfer membranes (Millipore). Ub5DHFR was detected using a monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (BAbCo, Richmond, CA) against the hemagglutinin tag at the C terminus of Ub5DHFR (21Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). 26 S proteasome was assembled in vitro in refolding buffer A as described previously (35Ma C.P., Vu, J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from 20 S proteasome (50 nm) and PA700 (200 nm). The proteasome-specific inhibitor β-lactone (100 μm) was added after 15 min of assembly. scRNase A stock solution (2.5 μg) was added to 30 μl of either 20 S or 26 S proteasome. To access the influence of DTT on degradation, 2.5 μg of scRNase A was incubated in buffer A with or without DTT for 10 min, and then 75 nm 20 S proteasome was added to start the reaction. To detect the influence of PA700 on the degradation rate, 2.0 μg of scRNase A in buffer A was preincubated for 30 or 150 min with or without 0.75 μm PA700, and then 75 nm 20 S proteasome was added to the substrate for another hour. All of the reactions were carried out at 30 °C. 5× SDS sample buffer was added to stop the reactions. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to 10% SDS-PAGE and visualization by Coomassie Blue staining. The native bovine pancreatic RNase A structure required for enzymatic activity contains a specific set of disulfide bonds, Cys26-Cys84, Cys40-Cys95, Cys58-Cys105, and Cys65-Cys72. Any mismatched cysteinyl disulfide results in misfolding, RNase A with one or more inappropriate disulfides is classically denoted as scrambled RNase A (36Sela M. White F.H., Jr. Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1957; 125: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The reactivation of this misfolded protein is slow unless the disulfide exchange reaction is enzymatically catalyzed, or the exposure of these mismatched bonds to the solvents is increased (33Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 37Yu J. McLaughlin S. Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4326-4330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both eukaryotic PDI and prokaryotic DsbA, a periplasmic thiol disulfide oxidoreductase, catalyze the formation and/or isomerization of disulfide bonds in vitro (33Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 37Yu J. McLaughlin S. Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4326-4330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isomerization by PDI utilizes the reduced form of its Cys-X-X-Cys active sites to attack disulfide bonds of misfolded proteins and directly promote their exchange (38Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To assess whether PA700 could also promote the reactivation of scRNase A, the formation of native enzymatically active RNase was assayed by the RNase-dependent digestion of RNA. Fig. 1A shows that like PDI and DsbA, PA700 can promote the reactivation of scRNase A. At a 1:1.2 molar ratio of scRNase A to enzymes, their relative scRNase A reactivation abilities are PDI > PA700 > DsbA. As shown in Fig. 1B, neither of the other proteins such as PA28α nor BSA has any obvious ability to accelerate the reactivation of scRNase A. This indicates that the ability of reactivation of scRNase A is not a common property of proteasomal activators like PA28 α or a “sticky” protein, BSA. The data in Fig. 1C demonstrate that the peak of the reactivation of scRNase A activity co-sediments with PA700 protein (data not shown) and proteasome activation activity on a glycerol density gradient (10–35%) centrifugation. This result argues that the catalyzed reactivation of scRNase A is because of PA700 and not the contamination of a trace amount of known disulfide isomerase. The kinetics of scRNase A reactivation were assessed in the presence of PDI, DsbA, PA700, PA28α, and BSA by detecting the RNase A-dependent hydrolysis of cCMP (33Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The spontaneous reactivation of scRNase A among different preparations of scRNase A during the 3-h incubation in buffer A varied between 9 and 16%. The reactivation observed in the presence of PA700 is consistently above this background. PDI-dependent reactivation reached a maximum of ∼40% by 1.5 h, consistent with previous reports (39Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PA700 and DsbA, respectively, produced 12 and 6% reactivation above the spontaneous level after the 3-h incubation. PA28α and BSA did not catalyze significant reactivation over the same time course (Fig. 2A). The data in Fig.2B show that PA700 exhibits an initial rate of reactivation of scRNase A linearly proportional to its concentration, suggesting a first-order process with a kcat ∼0.08% reactivation/h/nm PA700. The results demonstrate that PA700 accelerates the reactivation of scRNase A, a misfolded protein. PA700 contains six AAA ATPases (14DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether ATP binding or hydrolysis could play a role in the reactivation ability, we carried out the RNA digestion assay for PA700 in the presence of ATP, but no obvious inhibition or promotion effect was observed. PDI utilizes reduced Cys residues in the Cys-X-X-Cys active sites to catalyze the oxidoreduction steps. NEM, a sulfydryl-specific modifying reagent, blocks the catalytic cysteines in PDI, which results in the loss of activity (Fig. 3A). NEM treatment also effectively inhibits the ATPase activity of PA700 (14DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not its chaperone-like activity (21Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In this regard, the NEM-modified reactivation activity of PA700 is unaltered (Fig.3A), consistent with the lack of ATP dependence in our RNA digestion assay. The results suggest that PA700 does not require ATPase activity for reactivation and that PA700 does not utilize exposed catalytic cysteines for accelerating the exchange of the misfolded disulfide pairs in scRNase A. The thiol disulfide exchange reaction can be executed by PDI and DsbA on a wide range of substrates including proteins, peptides, and low molecular weight thiols and disulfides (31Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both PDI and DsbA catalyze the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in a small largely unstructured decapeptide, NRCSQGSCWN (34Ruddock L.W. Hirst T.R. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To assess whether PA700 could also promote the formation of a disulfide bond, we synthesized an analogue (NRCSQGSC (dansyl-K)N) of this peptide, replacing the tryptophan residue with a dansyl-modified lysine. As shown in Fig.3B, the catalytic amounts of DsbA catalyzed the oxidation of the peptide, whereas PA700 and BSA did not promote the formation of the disulfide bond, consistent with their inability to directly catalyze the oxidation step and a lack of an effect on already exposed bonds. Together, these results strongly suggest that PA700 does not directly catalyze the oxidoreduction step of the reactivation reaction, but rather the mechanism for promoting reactivation here is probably the remodeling of scRNase A by PA700 to increase and/or prolong the exposure of the substrate disulfides to the solvent. To further assess whether PA700 can expose otherwise inaccessible sites, Ub5DHFR was examined as a substrate. Ub5DHFR is degraded by the 26 S proteasome (22Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The rate of degradation suggests that in light of the high affinity binding of Ub5DHFR (Km = 35 nm) by PA700, substrate unfolding may be the rate-limiting step (22Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). To directly test whether PA700 could remodel this substrate, we examined the ability of PA700 to present otherwise buried sites in Ub5DHFR to chymotrypsin in trans. As shown in Fig. 4, at the present concentration of chymotrypsin, Ub5DHFR is resistant to chymotryptic digestion (lane 1). The isopeptidase activity (18Lam Y.A., Xu, W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) of PA700 catalyzes removal of ubiquitin from the Ub5DHFR substrate (lane 4). After eliminating the contribution because of the deubiquitination of Ub5DHFR, the degradation of Ub5DHFR by chymotrypsin was accelerated ∼5-fold by PA700 (lane 5). No obvious acceleration was mediated by the lid subcomplex, which contains the polyubiquitination chain binding subunit S5a and the isopeptidase activity. Significantly, PA700 does not promote the chymotryptic digestion of nonubquitinated DHFR (data not shown). Moreover, Fig. 4 shows that the chymotryptic degradation was inhibited by saturating concentrations of methotrexate (MTX), a ligand that stabilizes the folded conformation of DHFR (40Matthews D.A.

Cell. 1988; 52: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ability of two chaperones to promote the exposure of chymotryptic sites in Ub5DHFR was also assessed. Hsc70, a chaperone known to be involved in substrate presentation to the proteasome (42Bercovich B. Stancovski I. Mayer A. Blumenfeld N. Laszlo A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9002-9010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), has no effect on the chymotryptic digestion of Ub5DHFR in the presence or absence of Mg-ATP (data not shown), suggesting that simple differential binding of the substrate cannot account for the further increased exposure of the chymotryptic sites. By contrast, the GroEL·GroES complex, a chaperonin with known unfoldase activity (43Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. Science. 1996; 271: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), also increased the exposure of the sites in Ub5DHFR (data not shown). These results are consistent with a PA700-dependent increase in exposure of otherwise occluded or buried sites and suggest that PA700 alone is unable to efficiently act on hyperstable conformations such as MTX-stabilized Ub5DHFR. The degradation of scRNase A is stimulated when PA700 associates with the 20 S proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome. 20 S proteasome degrades nonubiquitinated proteins, such as mildly oxidized proteins (45Ferrington D.A.

Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the recognition of these substrates by the 20 S proteasome is not yet well understood, although it has been suggested that hydrophobic interactions may play a role (50Chao C.C., Ma, Y.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 51Pacifici R.E. Kono Y. Davies K.J. J. Biol.

We assessed the possibility that scRNase A is also a substrate for the proteasome. As shown in Fig.5, A and C, the latent bovine red cell 20 S proteasome is capable of degrading nonubiquitinated scRNase A. This activity is enhanced when PA700 associates with the 20 S proteasome to form the 26 S proteasome (Fig.5A). The degradation of the misfolded protein was inhibited by the addition of β-lactone, a specific proteasome inhibitor. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 5B, native RNase A is resistant to degradation by either the 20 S or 26 S proteasome, consistent with earlier reports (48Lasch P. Petras T. Ullrich O. Backmann J. Naumann D. Grune T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9492-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 53Dunten R.L. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The scrambled disulfides in scRNase A can be reduced under mild reducing conditions (0.2–1.0 mm DTT) (51Pacifici R.E. Kono Y. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15405-15411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed whether the 20 S proteasomal degradation of scRNase A requires the disruption of the mismatched disulfide bridges by DTT. This is not the case as DTT in the reaction buffer actually retarded the degradation (data not shown). This effect is probably the result of accelerated spontaneous reactivation of scRNase A into the proteasomal resistant native RNase A. Thus, the degradation of scRNase A by the latent 20 S proteasome does not require the reduction of the scrambled disulfides by DTT. PA700 catalyzes the reactivation of scRNase A to native RNase A. Because native RNase is resistant to 20 S proteasomal degradation, it was reasonable to expect that PA700 could rescue misfolded scRNase A from proteasomal degradation by promoting its reactivation and refolding. As shown in Fig. 5D, the preincubation of PA700 with scRNase A and DTT prior to the addition of the 20 S proteasome protects this substrate from degradation. Protection correlates well with the degree of reactivation (Fig.2A), suggesting that it is the gain of native structure during the preincubation that is protective rather than the formation of some more proteasome-resistant structure (i.e.aggregates). These results raise the possibilities that PA700 preforms multiple roles in vitro, promoting the degradation of a misfolded protein when it is associated with the 20 S proteasome and reactivating the misfolded substrate when it is not bound to the 20 S proteasome. Both abilities would require the remodeling of the substrates as shown here. In this work, we have shown that PA700, the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, catalyzes the reactivation of scRNase A and promotes exposure of buried chymotryptic sites in a folded functionally active proteasomal substrate, Ub5DHFR. This ability is probably a critical component of a concerted action of PA700 by which it binds the substrate using ubiquitin binding and chaperone-like sites, opens the annulus of the 20 S proteasome, and alters the conformation of the substrate itself. By contrast to the thiol oxidoreductases, PA700 promotes isomerization of the misfolded disulfides by increasing their exposure and does not exhibit the ability to promote the formation of disulfides. Not surprisingly, this reactivation activity is not observed for the proteasomal regulatory complex PA28α (Figs. 1 and 2). PA700 also accelerates the exposure of buried chymotryptic sites in the DHFR moiety of Ub5DHFR. Notably, this effect is unlikely to be simply attributed to preferential binding and stabilization of an open conformation, because Hsc70 does not exhibit this activity. By contrast, GroEL or GroEL·GroES complex, a chaperone molecule with known unfoldase activity (43Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. Science. 1996; 271: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 44Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), exhibits a similar ability to accelerate chymotryptic digestion of Ub5DHFR. This property of both PA700 and GroEL·GroES is inhibited by ligand-dependent stabilization of DHFR by MTX. Taken together, these data suggest that PA700 remodels the conformation of proteasomal substrates in addition to its well established activities, such as, polyubiquitin binding (15Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ubiquitin isopeptidase (18Lam Y.A., Xu, W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone-like activity of PA700 requires interaction site(s) that recognize misfolded proteins in the base subcomplex (20Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,21Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, this nonnative state recognition site may reside in the ring formed by the six AAA ATPases. In addition, a proteasome-activating nucleotidase from archaebacteria (27Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 54Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1339-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), homologous to these six AAA ATPases in PA700, mediates anti-aggregation, refolding, and unfoldase activities to promote proteasomal degradation. In analogy to cellular chaperones such as the GroEL·GroES complex and Hsc70, a hydrophobic interaction site(s) on PA700 would be expected to bind the misfolded proteins including scRNase A. The observation that Hsc70 is ineffective in remodeling these substrates suggests that a more extensive hydrophobic surface, such as that found on GroEL (55Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 56Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), may be required. Such a hydrophobic surface on PA700 has been detected by 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid binding (data not shown). Interaction with this site could stabilize and trap the more open forms of the misfolded substrates in preparation for translocation into the annulus of 20 S and subsequent proteolysis. Consistent with this model, the ability to promote the reactivation of scRNase A reported here is ATPase-independent. These open states are visited only rarely in MTX-stabilized Ub5DHFR and thus they can not be efficiently trapped by PA700 (as shown in Fig. 4). In this regard, the accelerated reactivation of scRNase A catalyzed by PA700 could be explained by a prolonged exposure of mismatched disulfides to solvent while bound to this site. Again, the stabilization of these remodeled open states of the substrate could promote their translocation through the narrow channel of the 20 S core particle to the catalytic sites. The preferential translocation of open conformers to the proteolytic sites probably accounts for the ATPase dependence of the proteolytic process. This model predicts that substrate conformational remodeling by PA700 is coupled to translocation. As such, a more efficient remodeling of proteasome substrates (active unfolding) would require an intact translocation reaction in addition to stabilization of the open conformers. In prokaryotes, the regulatory complexes of Clp protease, ClpA and ClpX, have been shown to unfold green fluorescence protein, a very stable protein (24Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol.

The unfolding process is facilitated when these complexes are associated with ClpP to form the proteolytic complexes ClpAP and ClpXP (25Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 26Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) suggested that both the Clp protease and the proteasome catalyze unfolding by processively unraveling their substrates from the attachment point of the degradation signals and that the ability of a protein to be degraded depends on the stability of the local structure adjacent to the degradation signal. In these cases, degradation requires the associated regulatory complexes for both Clp protease and proteasome to recognize the substrates. However, as we reported here, the latent 20 S proteasome alone degrades scRNase A but not native RNase A. This observation suggests that the substrate itself may regulate the gating of the latent 20 S proteasome to promote degradation. The ability of PA700 to either promote proteasomal degradation when forming the 26 S proteasome complex (Fig. 5A) or the refolding of the misfolded protein into a proteasome-resistant form in the absence of 20 S (Fig. 5D) raises an interesting question. Does PA700 catalyze the refolding of misfolded proteinsin vivo? To date, there exists no firm evidence for PA700sans 20 S in a cell other than during the assembly of 26 S. Therefore, The ability of PA700 to promote refolding and suppress aggregation in vitro may simply reflect partial reactions of its normal function in proteasomal activation. However, it is interesting to consider the alternative possibility that the balance between degradation and refolding could be adjusted depending upon the conditions facing the cell by controlling the association of PA700 with 20 S proteasome.

Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). An initiator caspase, caspase-9, is activated by apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1)1 in the presence of cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria to the cytosol in response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, thereby triggering a proteolytic caspase cascade (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). The activation of caspases is also negatively controlled by endogenous inhibitory proteins.

IAPs are RING finger domain proteins and can also function as ubiquitin ligases. A previous study demonstrated that the levels of IAPs are regulated by their own ubiquitination-dependent degradation such that IAPs are selectively lost upon exposure to cell death stimuli in a proteasome-dependent manner (12Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of programmed cell death are highly conserved throughout evolution (13Vernooy S.Y. Copeland J. Ghaboosi N. Griffin E.E. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. J.

In Drosophila, there are seven caspases (DCP-1, drICE, Dredd, DECAY, STRICA, and DAMM, including a functional counterpart of caspase-9, DRONC), an Apaf-1 homolog (Dark/Dapaf-1/HAC-1), and two Bcl-2 family proteins (Drob-1/Debcl/dBorg-1/dBok and Buffy/dBorg-2). TheDrosophila genome also encodes four IAPs, DIAP1, DIAP2, Deterin, and dBruce. Caspase-dependent cell death induced by a Drosophila killer protein, Reaper or Hid, is strongly inhibited by the overexpression of DIAP1 or DIAP2 (15Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In addition, adiap1 loss-of-function mutant embryo displays global cell death with an elevated caspase activity (16Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), indicating that DIAP1 is required to inhibit cell death and facilitate normal embryonic development. Although a diap1 mutant embryo exhibits massive apoptotic cell death, accompanied by cell rounding, membrane blebbing, and DNA fragmentation, no acridine orange staining is seen (16Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanism of the cell death caused by the loss of DIAP1 function is somehow different from the cell death induced by the overexpression of Reaper or Hid. Here, using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique, we performed loss-of-function analyses of the cell death induced by the down-regulation of DIAP1. Our findings demonstrate a novel cell death pathway triggered by DIAP1 depletion that is executed independently of caspase activity but depends on Dark and DRONC.

Each cDNA fragment containing T3 and T7 polymerase binding sites was amplified by PCR from the subclone, and sense or antisense RNA was synthesized using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. To make dsRNA, equal amounts of sense and antisense RNA were mixed and incubated at 68 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Annealing was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis. For the cell death assay, S2 cells were transfected with dsRNAs as described above for the expression vectors. To confirm that each dsRNA blocked the protein expression, S2 cells were transfected with a pUAST-derived HA- or FLAG-tagged expression construct together with the CaspeR-hs-GAL4 driver. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with serum-free medium, and dsRNA was added directly to the medium to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. The cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then 2 volumes of Schneider's medium containing fetal calf serum were added. The cells were then incubated at 26 °C for 30 min, heat shocked as in the cell death assay, incubated at 26 °C for an additional 24 h, and then subjected to Western blotting. To analyze cell morphology, S2 cells were treated directly with dsRNA as described above. Double-strandeddiap1 RNA was dissolved in injection buffer (5 mm KCl in 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) at 0.75 mg/ml. Precellularized embryos from wild-type ordpfK1/dpfK1 (19Kanuka H. Sawamoto K. Inohara N. Matsuno K. Okano H. Miura M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 757-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) flies were injected posteriorly with dsRNA or buffer alone and allowed to develop at 23 °C. Using the RNAi technique, we examined whether the down-regulation of DIAP1 is sufficient to induce cell death in Drosophila S2 cells. Treatment of S2 cells with diap1 dsRNA dramatically induced cell death (Fig. 1 B), whereas control GFP dsRNA displayed no detectable cytotoxicity to the cells (Fig. 1 A). We observed that diap1 dsRNA specifically suppressed the expression of the DIAP1 protein compared with the control ced-9 dsRNA (Fig. 1 C). In addition to killing cells, the down-regulation of DIAP1 strongly stimulated caspase-3-like DEVD cleavage activity, but not caspase-1-like YVAD cleavage activity, similar to the overexpression of Reaper (Fig. 1 D). However, cleavage of the tetrapeptide VEID, which is preferentially cleaved by DRONC, was not significantly increased (Fig. 1 D). To assess whether the cell death induced by diap1 dsRNA was dependent on caspase activation, the effects of caspase inhibitors were tested. Although baculovirus p35, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitory protein, completely inhibited the Reaper-induced cell death (Fig. 2 A), diap1dsRNA-induced cell death was only partially suppressed by p35 (Fig.2 B). Although p35 can strongly inhibit DrosophilaDEVDase activity (17Igaki T. Kanuka H. Inohara N. Sawamoto K. Nunez G. Okano H. Miura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it cannot block the DRONC activity (20Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To further examine whether the caspase activity was required for DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death, we used a pan-caspase inhibitor zD-dcb. A treatment of the cells with zD-dcb blocked Reaper-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 E); however, it could not suppress the cell death caused by DIAP1 depletion (Fig.2 F). As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, a cell lysate from cycloheximide-treated S2 cells had elevated caspase activities including DRONC activity as assayed by cleavage of DEVD and VEID. These activities were completely inhibited in vitro by adding zD-dcb, suggesting that zD-dcb had a potential to block Drosophila caspase activity including DRONC. These results suggest that, although it strongly stimulates caspase activation, the cell death induced by the down-regulation of DIAP1 can be executed through a caspase-independent pathway. To further analyze whether the caspases participated in DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death, we treated cells with dsRNAs synthesized from the cDNAs of Drosophila caspases, DRONC, drICE, and DCP-1, as well as the Drosophila Apaf-1, Dark. Each dsRNA worked as a specific inhibitor of the corresponding protein expression (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, Reaper-induced cell death was blocked almost completely by dronc dsRNA and was also suppressed by dsRNA fordrice, dcp-1, and dark at lower but significant levels. In contrast to the observation that the pan-caspase inhibitor could not suppress the DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death, the cell death was completely inhibited by dronc dsRNA (Fig.3 C). Furthermore, dark dsRNA strongly suppressed the diap1 dsRNA-induced cell death. This was unexpected because in mammals IAPs function as inhibitors of caspases, and Apaf-1 functions upstream of the caspase cascade. Therefore, we further assessed in vivo whether Dark could function genetically downstream of DIAP1. Precellularized embryos were injected with diap1 dsRNA or buffer alone, and the effects on their hatch rates were analyzed. As shown in Table I, injection ofdiap1 dsRNA resulted in a reduced hatch rate (10.6%) compared with buffer injection (34.9%). ThedpfK1 allele is a loss-of-function hypomorphic dark mutant allele (19Kanuka H. Sawamoto K. Inohara N. Matsuno K. Okano H. Miura M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 757-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We injected embryos from dpfK1 homozygous flies, and observed no reduction in the hatch rate of diap1 dsRNA-injected embryos (22.6%) compared with buffer-injected embryos (21.0%). These data demonstrate that Dark functions genetically downstream of DIAP1 in the DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death pathway.Table IEffects of dsRNA on the hatch rate of wild-type and dark mutant embryosGenotypeInjectionHatch rate n 1-aTotal number of embryos is shown. %Wild typeBuffer34.9106 diap1 dsRNA10.6104 dpf K1 /dpf K1Buffer21.0124 diap1 dsRNA22.6137Precellularized embryos from wild-type or dark mutant (dpf K1 /dpf K1 ) flies were injected posteriorly with diap1 dsRNA or buffer alone and allowed to develop at 23 °C.1-a Total number of embryos is shown. Open table in a new tab Precellularized embryos from wild-type or dark mutant (dpf K1 /dpf K1 ) flies were injected posteriorly with diap1 dsRNA or buffer alone and allowed to develop at 23 °C. Our co-depletion analyses using S2 cells and Drosophilaembryos indicated that the cell death induced by DIAP1 down-regulation was dependent on the presence of DRONC and Dark despite the fact that this cell death could not be inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zD-dcb. To examine whether DRONC could mediate the cell death signaling independently of its caspase activity, we introduced a caspase-inactive mutant form of DRONC (mDRONC) (21Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) into the DIAP1-depleted background. The cell death caused by DIAP1 depletion was accelerated by overexpression of both of Dark and DRONC (Fig.4), consistent with the notion that DIAP1 functions genetically upstream of Dark. As with wild-type DRONC, mDRONC also accelerated cell death (Fig. 4), indicating that caspase activity of DRONC is not required for this phenomenon. These results suggest that the cell death signaling stimulated by DIAP1 down-regulation is mediated by DRONC and Dark through a mechanism independent of DRONC caspase activity. In this study, we found that the down-regulation of DIAP1, but not DIAP2 (data not shown), is sufficient for inducing cell death inDrosophila S2 cells. This indicates that DIAP1 normally blocks a naturally stimulating cell death pathway. Unexpectedly, caspase inhibitors could not suppress the DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death, but it was blocked by the co-depletion of DRONC or Dark. Recently Zimmermann et al. (22Zimmermann K.C. Ricci J.E. Droin N.M. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that down-regulation of DIAP1 in S2 cells induces a cell death pathway that can be blocked by the down-regulation of Dark. More recently Rodriguezet al. (23Rodriguez A. Chen P. Oliver H. Abrams J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2189-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that phenotypes caused by a loss of DIAP1 function were suppressed by a loss of Dark function. These are consistent with our observation, and we analyzed the mechanism of the cell death further. DIAP1 down-regulation-induced spontaneous cell death did not require caspase activity, but it depended on DRONC and Dark. It has been reported that DRONC can bind to both Dark and DRONC (19Kanuka H. Sawamoto K. Inohara N. Matsuno K. Okano H. Miura M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 757-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In mammals, the three-dimensional structure of the apoptosome (Apaf-1·cytochrome c·caspase-9 complex) suggests a model in which cytochrome c promotes the assembly of the apoptosome to activate caspase-9 (24Acehan D. Jiang X. Morgan D.G. Heuser J.E. Wang X. Akey C.W. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 423-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, on the other hand, it has been suggested that the apoptosome may form in the vicinity of the mitochondria in the absence of cytochrome crelease (25Dorstyn L. Read S. Cakouros D. Huh J.R. Hay B.A. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We also observed that DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death was not affected by cytochrome c dsRNA (data not shown). These observations and our data suggest that in DrosophilaDIAP1 might normally inhibit the Dark·DRONC complex and that the down-regulation of DIAP1 might result in an “active” Dark·DRONC complex, triggering both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death pathways (Fig. 5). The observation that the pan-caspase inhibitor zD-dcb could not suppress the DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death suggests that DRONC may be able to induce cell death independent of its caspase activity. The observation that the caspase-inactive form of DRONC could functionally substitute the wild-type DRONC in accelerating DIAP1 depletion-induced cell death also supports the idea that the cell death can be mediated through non-caspase mechanisms. DRONC might have a protease-independent cell-killing activity that is activated by Dark. It is possible that DRONC is required simply as a bridging or scaffolding protein to bring other proteins together to transmit the cell death signaling. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that zD-dcb could not completely inhibit the caspase activity of DRONC, it is apparent that the mode of cell death caused by the down-regulation of DIAP1 is distinct from Reaper-induced cell death. We also assessed the effects of dsRNAs synthesized from reaper, hid, grim,drob-1, and buffy/dborg-2 cDNAs on the diap1 dsRNA-induced cell death and found that none of them suppressed the cell death (data not shown). Further in vivo analysis should help elucidate the role of the caspase-independent cell death pathway regulated by DIAP1.

We have used NAPc2 as a tight binding probe of human Xa to investigate protein substrate recognition by the human prothrombinase complex. NAPc2 binds with high affinity (K d ∼1 nm) to both X and Xa in a way that does not require or occlude the active site of the enzyme. In contrast, NAPc2 is a tight binding, competitive inhibitor of protein substrate cleavage by human Xa incorporated into prothrombinase with saturating concentrations of membranes and Va. By fluorescence binding studies we show that NAPc2 does not interfere with the assembly of human prothrombinase. These are properties expected of an inhibitor that blocks protein substrate recognition by targeting extended macromolecular recognition sites (exosites) on the enzyme complex. A weaker interaction (K d = 260–500 nm) observed between NAPc2 and bovine X was restored to a high affinity one in a recombinant chimeric bovine X derivative containing 25 residues from the COOH terminus of the proteinase domain of human X.

Although solution-phase Xa is a competent enzyme, its incorporation into prothrombinase yields a profound increase in the rate of thrombin formation (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 3Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prothrombin is the only known protein substrate cleaved efficiently by prothrombinase (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev.

Such stringent selectivity is not evident in the action of factor Xa on oligopeptidyl substrates, nor is the rate of peptidyl substrate hydrolysis significantly enhanced upon assembly of factor Xa into prothrombinase (7Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E. Zupan A. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13920-13929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the narrow and defined specificity of prothrombinase toward its protein substrate is unlikely to be solely explained by the specific recognition of residues surrounding the scissile bond by the active site of factor Xa within the enzyme complex. Mechanistic studies of bovine prothrombinase function have borne out this suggestion (9Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Betz A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A series of studies indicate that recognition of the biological substrate is achieved through stepwise interactions of the protein substrate at an extended macromolecular recognition site (exosite) in prothrombinase removed from the catalytic site of Xa, followed by docking of elements surrounding the scissile bond with the active site of the enzyme and subsequent cleavage (9Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The initial exosite-binding step dominates the affinity and binding specificity of the enzyme for the protein substrate. This interaction serves to tether the substrate to the enzyme, thereby directing ordered active-site docking and cleavage at two spatially distinct sites in the zymogen (11Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, surfaces on the enzyme complex, removed from the active site of factor Xa, contribute in a dominant way to the productive recognition of the protein substrate. Although comparable mechanistic information is lacking in the human system, studies with human prothrombin derivatives have implied a principal role for an interaction between (pro)thrombin and factor Va, mediated by the (pro)fibrinogen-binding site in the substrate, in human prothrombinase function (12Anderson P.J.

Proteolytic derivatives of prothrombin lacking the fibrinogen-binding site apparently retain the ability to participate in exosite interactions with prothrombinase (10Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody (αBFX-2b)1 directed against a region of the proteinase domain of factor Xa, spatially distinct from the active site, appears to block exosite binding of the protein substrate to bovine prothrombinase without affecting the active site (15Wilkens M. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9366-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These points along with the necessary caveats associated with the findings highlight uncertainties in the field and cast doubt on the validity of directly extrapolating findings in the bovine system to explain the mechanism of action of human prothrombinase on its protein substrate. Recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (NAPc2) is an 85-residue polypeptide originally isolated from the hematophagous hookworm,Ancyclostoma caninum (16Stassens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y.

NAPc2 is a potent inhibitor (K i * ∼10 pm) of factor X activation by the extrinsic Xase complex composed of VIIa and tissue factor (TF) (16Stassens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y.

A critical component reaction in the inhibitory pathway is the initial interaction between NAPc2 and either factors X or Xa which facilitates delivery and greatly enhances the affinity of NAPc2 for the VIIa-TF complex (16Stassens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As NAPc2 binds tightly to human Xa in a way that is apparently independent of the active site of the enzyme (17Bergum P.W. Cruikshank A. Maki S.L. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol.

Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yielded an approximate equimolar mixture of the α and β forms of factor Xa. Active site titration of several preparations with p-nitrophenolp′-guanidinobenzoate (26Chase T., Jr. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar), yielded 0.88–1.21 mol of active sites/mol of Xa. Factor Xa was inactivated with APMSF to yield Xai and purified as described (27Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or inactivated with acetothioacetyl-EGR-CH2Cl, reacted with Oregon Green488 maleimide following thioester hydrolysis, and purified to yield OG488-hXa exactly following procedures described for bovine Xa (9Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human factor V was isolated from plasmapheresis plasma by modifications to the immunoaffinity approach described (28Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Factor V containing fractions obtained by this approach were pooled, treated with 5 μm d-Phe-l-Pro-l-Arg CH2Cl (Calbiochem), dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 mNaCl, 5 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4, and applied to a 1 × 10-cm POROS HQ/M column (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0.15 to 0.6 m) developed in the same buffer (7 min, 5 ml/min). Fractions containing factor V were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centricon 30, Amicon, Danvers, MA), exchanged into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4. by repeated concentration, and stored at −80 °C. Factor V (3.5 μm, 4.7 ml) was activated by incubation with 50 nm bovine thrombin at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was treated with 63 μm APMSF, diluted with two volumes of 20 mm MES, 5 mm Ca2+, pH 6.0, and applied to a POROS HS/M column (0.46 × 10 cm, Applied Biosystems) equilibrated in 20 mm MES, 0.1 mNaCl, 5 mm Ca2+, pH 6.0. Bound protein was eluted with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0.1 to 0.6 m) developed in the same buffer (5 min, 5 ml/min). Factor Va, eluting in a sharp peak at ∼0.35 m NaCl, well resolved from thrombin and the activation fragments, was concentrated and exchanged into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 5.0 mmCa2+, pH 7.4, by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centricon-30), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C as a ∼10 μm solution. An important feature of this method is that factors V and Va were never exposed to (NH4)2SO4 or glycerol during purification or storage. Human prethrombin 2 and human thrombin were prepared by proteolysis of prothrombin and purified by established procedures (29Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Methods for the preparation and purification of X, Xa, Va, and prethrombin 2 of bovine origin, used in some experiments, have been described (9Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NAPc2 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified as described (16Stassens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Integrity of the resulting product was established by mass spectrometry, amino acid composition, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. NAPc2 (265 μm) in 0.1 m NaPi, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4, was reacted with 5.3 mmsulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-biotin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by dialysis against the same buffer to remove unreacted reagent. The product (NAPc2-biotin) contained 2.6 mol of biotin/mol of NAPc2 and was established to be heterogeneously modified by mass spectrometry but retained full factor X-dependent inhibitory activity toward VIIa-TF (17Bergum P.W. Cruikshank A. Maki S.L. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10063-10071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recombinant derivatives of factor X were expressed in HEK293 cells using the pCMV4 vector bearing cDNA encoding the human prothrombin signal sequence and propeptide followed by the sequence for the factor X derivative (pCMV4-ss-pro-II-fX) as described for human factor X (23Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The equivalent vector bearing the sequence encoding bovine X was prepared by PCR using the technique of splicing by overlap extension (31Horton R.M., Ho, S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence encoding bovine X was recovered by reverse transcriptase-PCR from bovine liver poly(A) mRNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Following first strand synthesis, bovine factor X cDNA was amplified using primers A (5′-CAGCGGGTCCGGCGAGCCAAGTCATTCTTG-3′) and B (5′-GCCGCGCCCGGG(T)18-3′) to yield a product encoding bovine factor X flanked by a 5′-extension containing the last 15 bases of the cDNA encoding the human prothrombin propeptide and a 3′-extension bearing a XmaI restriction site. In a parallel PCR, human prothrombin cDNA (32Degen S.J. MacGillivray R.T. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was used as a template along with primers C (5′-GATCCCAAGCTTGGGATGGCGCACGTCCGA-3′) and D (5′-CAAGAATG AGTTGGCTCGCCGGACCCGCTG-3′) to yield a product encoding the propeptide and signal sequence of human prothrombin flanked by a 5′-extension containing a HindIII restriction site and a 3′-extension complementary to the cDNA for bovine factor X. A final round of PCR used the two PCR products generated in the first round as template and primers B and C. The resulting product (ss-pro-II-XBov) was digested using XmaI and HindIII and ligated into the pCMV4 vector previously digested with the same enzymes to yield pCMV4 ss-pro-II-XBov. A cDNA construct encoding a chimeric derivative of bovine X containing proteinase domain residues 240–264 2Proteinase domain residues are numbered according to the topographically equivalent residues in chymotrypsinogen (1Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). For clarity, the construction of the recombinant derivatives is also specified using sequential numbers starting at the mature NH2 terminus of the light chain. These instances are clearly identified in the text. from human X was prepared by a similar strategy. In the sequential numbering system (33Messier T.L. Pittman D.D. Long G.L. Kaufman R.J. Church W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 99: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the XBov/Hum derivative is composed of bovine X residues 1–423 and human X residues 424–448. The cDNA encoding the human prothrombin signal sequence and propeptide followed by residues 1–423 of bovine X was obtained using pCMV4 ss-pro-II-XBov as a template, primer C (above), and primer E (5′-GGTTTTCATGGACCTGTCGATCCACTTGAG-3′). A parallel reaction with pCMV4 ss-pro-II-XHum as template, primers F (5′-CTCAAGTGGATCGACAGGTCCATGAAAACC-3′), and G (5′-ATCGCTTGAACCCAGGAG-3′) yielded a product encoding residues 424–448 of human factor X flanked by appropriate extensions. The final product obtained by PCR using primers C and G and the initial two products as templates was digested and ligated into the cut vector as before to yield pCMV4 ss-pro-II-XBov/Hum. The identity of all inserts was established by DNA sequence analysis. HEK293 cells were transfected with each of the vector constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) along with plasmids bearing the neomycin resistance gene and paired basic amino acid-converting enzyme-furin as described (23Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The production, purification, and detailed characterization of wild-type human factor X has been described (23Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the recombinant bovine derivatives, stable clones selected with G418 were identified by a functional assay in which conditioned medium was treated with the purified factor X activator from Russell's viper venom followed by measurements of the initial rate of SpXa hydrolysis. Selected clones were estimated to produce 5–20 μg of functional protein/24 h in a confluent T-25 flask with 10 ml of medium. Two stable cell lines producing each derivative of bovine factor X were separately expanded into cell factories (Nalge-Nunc, Naperville, IL) for long term protein expression in serum-free medium supplemented with vitamin K (Abbott) (23Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (20 liters) containing either bovine X derivative was applied to a column (4.6 × 6 cm) of XAD-2 (Bio-Rad) to adsorb the indicator dye. A 50× stock solution was used to adjust the colorless effluent to 20 mm Tris, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and factor X was captured by application (24 ml/min) to a column (4.6 × 10 cm) of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mmTris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4. Bound protein was eluted (10 ml/min, 90 min) with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0.15 to 0.6 m) prepared in the same buffer. Fractions containing factor X, identified by a functional assay, were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mm MES, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, pH 6.0. A fraction (∼20%) of the resulting material was applied to a 10 × 1-cm Poros HQ/M column (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound protein was eluted (2 ml/min) with a gradient of increasing Ca2+ developed with buffer B: 20 mm MES, 0.15 m NaCl, 100 mmCaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 6.0 (0–100% buffer B, 40 min). Fractions containing factor X functional activity were pooled from repeated runs, precipitated by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 (80% saturation), collected by centrifugation (56,000 × g, 20 min), and dissolved in a small volume of 20 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5. The sample was further purified using a HiPrep S-200 column (2.6 × 60 cm,Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer and developed at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions containing factor X were pooled, precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (80% saturation), collected by centrifugation (56,000 × g, 20 min), dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. A representative yield of ∼34 mg of purified product was obtained from 20 liters of conditioned medium. All protein preparations were quality-controlled by SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Concentrations were calculated using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E 280mg−1·cm2): human Xa, 45,300, 1.16 (35Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W.

Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4492-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); NAPc2, 9,649 atomic mass units, 0.54. A systematic overestimate in the reported extinction coefficients for factor X derivatives noted in previous studies (20Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was obvious in the precise stoichiometries obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The concentrations of plasma derived or recombinant factor X derivatives in the ITC experiments were calculated using the following extinction coefficients according to the method of Gill and von Hippel (39Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar): human X, 1.05; bovine X, 1.06; XBov/Hum, 0.95; human Xai, 1.03. Measurements were performed using a MCS-ITC instrument (Microcal, Cambridge, MA) stabilized at 25 °C. Factor X derivatives and NAPc2 were dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, either with or without 2 mm Ca2+, and the dialysate was used for subsequent dilutions and control experiments. The cell (1.3298 ml) contained factor X or its derivatives at concentrations ranging from 5 to 9 μm, and the injection syringe contained 120 μm NAPc2. Heat flow was measured with continuous stirring, following a series of injections of NAPc2 spaced at 210-s intervals. In a typical experiment, the first injection was 3 μl followed by 29 injections of 6 μl each. When the results of two experiments were combined, the injection sequence for the second run was adjusted to yield offset values for the independent variable. Trivial heat flow due to ligand dilution and buffer mismatch was determined from an identical series of injections of NAPc2 into dialysate. SDS-PAGE analysis of samples taken before and after each experiment ruled out proteolysis during the experiment. Steady state kinetic constants for the cleavage of SpXa were determined either in the absence or presence of 40 nmNAPc2 (∼10–80 × K d ) in reaction mixtures (200 μl) prepared in wells of a 96-well plate (Corning Glass), containing increasing concentrations of SpXa (24 values, 0–500 μm) and 1 nm Xa, 1 nm Xa plus 50 μm PCPS, or 1 nm Xa plus 50 μmPCPS and 25 nm Va. Initial velocities were determined by continuously monitoring the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm with time at 25 °C, measured in a kinetic plate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA).

Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cas demonstrated resistance to Src-induced transformation along with impaired actin bundling and cell motility, indicating critical roles of Cas in actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and oncogenesis. To gain further insight into roles of each domain of Cas in these processes, a compensation assay was performed by expressing a series of Cas mutants in Cas-deficient fibroblasts. The results showed that motifs containing YDxP were indispensable for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration, suggesting that CrkII-mediated signaling regulates these biological processes. The C-terminal Src-binding domain played essential roles in cell migration and membrane localization of Cas, although it was dispensable in the organization of actin stress fibers. Furthermore, the Src-binding domain was also a prerequisite for Src transformation possibly, because of its crucial role in the phosphorylation of Cas during transformation.

It has a structure with a number of protein-protein interaction domains, including an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a substrate domain (SD) that consists of a cluster of YxxP motifs (one YLVP, four YQxPs, nine YDxPs, and one YAVP), and a C-terminal Src-binding domain containing motifs YDYV (amino acids 762–765) and RPLPSPP (2Sakai R.

The substrate domain offers docking sites for several molecules including adaptor proteins Crk, Nck, and an inositol 5′-phosphatase, SHIP2 (SH2-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase), through their SH2 domains in a phosphorylation dependent manner (3Mayer B.J.

Phosphorylated Cas is localized to focal adhesions where it appears to recruit numerous binding partners such as FAK (17Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), Crk (18Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to participate in the signaling of cell adhesion and migration. On the other hand, Cas was originally found as a putative substrate of the v-Src kinase and a binding target for the SH2 domain of v-Crk, implying that phosphorylation of Cas is closely associated with retroviral transformation. Earlier study using the antisense Cas mRNA also supported the idea that Cas is a positive regulator of cell transformation (20Auvinen M. Paasinen-Sohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was finally confirmed by the fact that mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Cas were resistant to Src induced transformation. Cas-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts also showed impaired actin bundling and cell migration. These phenotypes were restored after re-expression of Cas, suggesting that Cas plays essential roles in the signal transduction of actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration and transformation (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,22Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An open question now is how each functional domain of Cas is utilized during the specific biological events mentioned above. The answer will be important for the understanding of how this molecule serves as a docking port for many distinct signal inputs and how it ultimately contributes to generation of appropriate cellular responses. Therefore, we investigated the roles of each domain of Cas in actin stress fiber organization, cell migration, and Src transformation by establishing Cas−/− fibroblast lines stably expressing a series of systemic mutants of each protein-binding domain of Cas. The capability of each mutant to rescue actin stress fiber organization, cell migration, and Src transformation was analyzed to identify essential domains responsible for each biological process. It was demonstrated that Cas participates in multifold biological processes by utilizing many protein-binding sites in an event-specific manner. The short form of rat Cas cDNA (encoding an 874-amino acid product), with deletions of the SH3 domain (ΔSH3), the SB domain (ΔSB), the substrate domain (ΔSD), motifs YQxP (ΔYQxP) and YDxP (ΔYDxP), the SH3 and SB domains (ΔSH3·SB), and both the SH3 domain and YDxP motifs (ΔSH3·YDxP), or mutation of Y762 (Y762F), RPLP (RLGS), Y762, and RPLP (RLGS-Y762F), were HA-tagged and constructed, respectively, into expression vector pSSRα-bsr, which contains an SRα promoter and a blasticidin-resistance gene as described previously (6Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transfected into mouse embryonic Cas-deficient fibroblasts (Cas−/−) or Cas−/−Src fibroblasts (Cas-deficient fibroblasts stably expressing 527F-c-Src, an activated form of c-Src) (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In detail, 6 × 105 Cas−/− fibroblasts were plated into 10-cm dish and cultured overnight. 12 μl of Fugene reagent was incubated with serum-free medium for 5 min and then mixed with 6 μg of DNA and co-incubated for 15 min before being introduced into cells. Transfected cells were subjected to blasticidin selection (5 μg/ml) for Cas−/− cells or blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and puromycin (1 μg/ml) double selection for Cas−/−Src cells after 48 h as described previously (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Colonies formed 2 weeks later were then picked up, expanded, and subjected to Western blot screening for expression of Cas mutants. Antibodies against HA or CrkII were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, and polyclonal antibody αCas2 against Cas was used as described previously (2Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 2-17 against Src was from Microbiological Associates. FITC-labeled phalloidin was purchased from Sigma, and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bovine plasma fibronectin was purchased from Sigma. Y-27632 dihydrochloride was from Tocris Cookson Ltd. (Avonmouth, Bristol, UK), and LPA was from Sigma. Protein extraction and Western blotting analysis were performed as described (6Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies diluted 1:2000. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein was mixed with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody or 1 μg of αCas2 and incubated for 1 h on ice. Then samples were rotated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and beads were washed four times with 1% Trixon X-100 buffer and boiled in sample buffer before being subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described previously (23Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 3 × 104cells were plated into each well of an 8-well chamber slide and allowed to grow for 48 h in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with FITC-phalloidin (50 μg/ml) to stain actin filaments for 1 h on ice. To analyze the effects of Y-27632 and LPA on actin stress fiber formation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h before incubation in serum-free medium containing Y-27632 (10 μm) or LPA (10 μm) respectively. After 1 h, cells were fixed and stained by FITC-labeled phalloidin. For staining, Cas mutants were washed three times with PBS after fixation, and then cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl 10% glycerol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 5 min before incubation with the primary antibody. The primary antibody αCas2 was used at 10 ng/μl for 2 h, and secondary antibody FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit was used at 1:40 for 1 h. After cells were washed three times by PBS, cover glasses were mounted using mounting liquid (Entellan; Merck). Cells were then visualized by an Olympus fluorescence microscope, and photographs were taken at the original magnification of 200×. Wound-healing assay was performed according to a method used previously (22Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first grown to confluence in plastic culture dishes, and a wound was made in the cell monolayer using a sterile micropipette tip. Then cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS after being washed three times with PBS. Cell movement was assessed 24 h after wounding from photographs taken under the microscope with a 40× objective. The percentage of reduced distance between the nuclei of cells moving forward 24 h later relative to the distance between two rims in the cleared field at the beginning was taken as the index. Migration of all the cell lines was also analyzed using a Boyden chamber cell migration assay with some modification (22Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In detail, polyvinylpyrrolidine-free polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 μm (Neuroprobe) were coated for 30 min with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The coated filters were then dried and placed over the lower well of a Boyden chamber, which was then filled with 1.28 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. After being detached from the culture dishes by exposure to 5% trypsin-EDTA, 1.5 × 105 cells in 0.56 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS were added to the upper well. The chamber was then placed in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells on the membrane that had migrated through the filter were fixed in methanol for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then exposed to Giemsa staining for 15 s. After three washes with PBS, the filter was mounted on a glass slide. The side of the filter to which cells had been added was scraped. The number of migrated cells was counted from photographs taken of at least eight fields at a magnification of 200× under the microscope. Soft agar colony formation assay was performed as described previously (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 trypsinized cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.4% SeaPlaque GTG agarose (Bioproducts) and poured onto bottom agar containing 10% FBS and 0.53% agarose in 6-cm culture dishes. Then cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 14 days, colonies containing more than 5 cells were counted under the microscope with a 100× objective. The short form of Cas cDNA encoding an 874-amino acid product was used for construction of a series of Cas mutants as described previously (6Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Each Cas deletion mutant along with full-length Cas (CasFL) were HA-tagged and subcloned into vector pSSRα-bsr, which contains an SRα promoter. Cas mutants that lacks the SH3 domain, the substrate domain, YQxP motifs, YDxP motifs, or the Src-binding domain were defined as ΔSH3, ΔSD, ΔYQxP, ΔYDxP, and ΔSB, respectively. Cas cDNA that mutated at RPLP, Y762, or both in the C-terminal Src-binding domain were named RLGS, Y762F, and RLGS-Y762F, respectively (Fig.1A). Multiple clones expressing individual Cas mutants in Cas−/− fibroblasts (Cas-deficient fibroblasts) were selected using immunoblotting by antibodies against Cas and HA (Fig. 1B). We failed to establish Cas−/− fibroblast expressing ΔYQxP to the level comparable with other mutants, although we tried several independent transfections. It was confirmed by phalloidin staining that actin stress fibers were totally disrupted in Cas−/− fibroblasts, whereas they were restored by expressing CasFL as already reported (Fig.2, a and b). No detectable actin stress fibers were formed in cell lines expressing ΔSD or ΔYDxP similar to the original Cas−/− fibroblasts, indicating that YDxP motifs located in the center of the SD domain were indispensable for the signal transduction of actin stress fiber organization (Fig. 2, d and f). In contrast, a series of mutants, ΔSH3, ΔYQxP, ΔSB, RLGS, Y762F, and RLGS-Y762F, could reorganize actin stress fibers in Cas−/− cells at least to the same level as CasFL (Fig. 2, c, e, andg–j), indicating that these domains or motifs are not required for actin stress fiber formation. The fact that two of major protein-binding domains of Cas, the SH3 and Src-binding domains, were dispensable, raised a new question as to whether these domains are redundant for actin stress fiber formation (i.e. whether only one of these domains is required) or whether none of these domains is required for this event. To answer this question, a Cas mutant with deletion of both the SH3 and SB domains (ΔSH3·SB) was constructed and stably expressed into Cas−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Phalloidin staining showed that actin stress fibers were significantly reorganized in Cas−/− cells expressing ΔSH3·SB (Fig. 2k). It was suggested that YDxP motifs were involved in the signal transduction of actin organization independently of other domains of Cas. Additionally, it was noticed that the amount of actin stress fibers formed by expressing ΔSH3, RLGS-Y762F, ΔSB, or ΔSH3·SB mutant (Fig. 2, c,j, g, and k, respectively) appeared to be rather excessive compared with that formed by expressing CasFL (Fig. 2b), although the mechanism was not clear. Actin stress fibers restored by CasFL or RLGS-Y762F were completely disrupted by Y-27632 (24Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase (p160ROK) (Fig. 2, l and m), suggesting that the original Rho-ROK pathway was utilized in these restoration processes. LPA, a Rho family activator, could induce the formation of actin stress fibers in Cas−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 2n), indicating that LPA-mediated signal activation involves either downstream or alternative pathways of Cas in actin stress fiber organization. To investigate domain functions of Cas in the signal transduction of cell migration, wound-healing assay and Boyden chamber cell migration assay were performed. In a wound-healing assay, cell motility was judged from the reduction of the gap 24 h after the wound was made. Consistent with the previous report, original Cas−/− fibroblasts exhibited only about 17.3% reduction, whereas expression of CasFL showed complete restoration of cell mobility, causing 97.4% healing of the wound (22Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression of Y762F showed almost complete restoration of the gap (95.6%), and ΔSH3 mutants resulted in 45.7% reduction of the wound (Fig. 3) possibly because the expression level of ΔSH3 is lower than others. No significant improvement (about 20% reduction of the gap) of cell migration was obtained by expressing ΔSD, ΔYDxP, ΔSB, RLGS, or RLGS-Y762F mutants compared with Cas−/− fibroblasts, indicating an essential role for YDxP motifs in the SD domain and RPLP motif in the SB domain in cell migration. In a Boyden chamber assay, cell mobility was analyzed by counting the number of cells migrating through pores of the filter coated with fibronectin. As shown in Fig. 4, as few as ∼8 cells/field could migrate through the filter by fibroblasts lacking Cas protein, whereas 70 cells/field could move through the filter by expression of CasFL. Y762F or ΔSH3 mutants gained cell motility of 70 or 40 cells/field, respectively, showing that these domains are not crucial for cell migration by this assay. Expression of ΔSD, ΔYDxP, ΔSB, RLGS, or RLGS-Y762F mutants, however, failed to improve the cell motility of Cas−/− fibroblasts by Boyden chamber assay. As expected, ΔSH3·SB failed to restore the cell mobility impaired in Cas−/− fibroblasts in both the wound-healing and Boyden chamber assays (Figs. 3B and 4). Because we failed to get clones to express enough of the ΔYQxP mutant (Fig.1B), it could not be concluded that YQxP motifs are dispensable for cell migration from the result that cell mobility was not detectably rescued by ΔYQxP (Figs. 3 and 4), although the same amount of the mutant protein did rescue actin stress fiber formation. Direct association of Cas and Crk was indicated both by screening of a synthetic peptide library and an in vitro binding assay (6Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Eduardo Fajardo J. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Previous results showed that CrkII served as signal effectors in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (18Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles of YDxP motifs expressed in Cas−/− fibroblasts in actin stress fiber organization and cell migration, the association of Cas with CrkII was investigated by immunoprecipitation. It was confirmed that CasFL and mutants RLGS, Y762F, and RLGS-Y762F, but not ΔYDxP, were co-precipitated with CrkII (Fig.5), implicating a role of CrkII-mediated signaling through the YDxP motifs of Cas in cell migration and actin stress fibers organization. As the subcellular localization of Cas is closely associated with its role in signal transduction, localization of CasFL, ΔYDxP, and RLGS-Y762F in cell lines established was investigated by immunocytostaining. In CasFL (Fig. 6b)- and ΔYDxP (Fig. 6c)-expressing cells, several dense areas of staining appeared around the plasma membrane, showing the membrane-located fraction of Cas. This kind of localization was not observed in RLGS-Y762F mutant-expressing cells, indicating that RLGS-Y762F mutant is not able to localize to the cell membrane and exhibits cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 6d). Focal adhesions were also investigated by vinculin staining in the cell lines mentioned above, and no significant difference in the number was observed just as reported for Cas −/− cells (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Similar series of systemic mutants of each domain of Cas were stably introduced into Cas−/−Src cells, Cas−/− fibroblasts expressing activated c-Src (527F-c-Src) (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) (Fig.7A). Anchorage-independent growth during Src transformation was examined by a soft agar colony formation assay. As shown by the results in Fig. 7B, almost no colonies were formed by Cas-deficient fibroblasts even in the presence of activated Src, but a considerable number of colonies were formed by cells expressing CasFL, as reported previously (21Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Expression of ΔSH3, ΔYDxP, or Y762F was also able to restore colony formation capability, suggesting that motifs YDxP and Y762 and domain SH3 are dispensable for Src transformation. In contrast, similar to Cas−/− fibroblasts, ΔSB, RLGS, and RLGS-Y762F mutants failed to recover colonies formation as the result of several experiments. It was shown that the SB domain of Cas is critical for anchorage-independent growth by activated Src. As we failed to get clones to express ΔSD or ΔYQxP in Cas−/−Src cells even after many trials, the role of YQxP motifs in transformation was not clear. To know whether the SB domain participates in this process by itself, Cas containing deletion of both the YDxP motifs and the SH3 domain (ΔSH3·YDxP) was stably expressed in Cas−/−Src fibroblasts (Fig.7A). It was shown that comparable numbers of colonies were formed by ΔSH3·YDxP, ΔSH3, and ΔYDxP (Fig. 7B), suggesting that both the SH3 domain and YDxP motifs of Cas are dispensable for soft agar colony formation. The SB domain that remains in the ΔSH3·YDxP mutant might be responsible for the signal transduction of anchorage-independent growth in Src transformed cells. To further explore the mechanisms underlying the observations described above, phosphorylation of Cas mutants in Cas−/− and Cas−/−Src fibroblasts was investigated. Phosphorylation of ΔYDxP was at a level similar to CasFL in Cas −/− fibroblasts, whereas phosphorylation level of ΔSB and ΔSH3·SB was much lower (Fig. 8A). In Cas−/−Src cell lines, tyrosine phosphorylation of ΔSB, RLGS, and RLGS-Y762F mutants was significantly reduced compared with ΔSH3, ΔYDxP, ΔSH3·YDxP, and CasFL (Fig. 8B). It was revealed that the SB domain is essential for phosphorylation of Cas expressed in Cas−/− fibroblasts both in the absence and presence of activated Src. Finally, the results from all of the compensation assays done in this study demonstrated distinct roles for the individual signaling domains of Cas in the biological processes of fibroblasts (summarized in Table I).Table ISummary of the rescue ability of Cas mutants in actin stress fiber organization, cell migration, and Src transformationCell linesActin stress fibersCell migrationSoft agar coloniesCas−/−−−−CasFL+++ΔSH3++++ΔSD−−NΔYQxP+/−−NΔYDxP−−+ΔSB++−−Y762F+++RLGS+−−RLGS-Y762F++−−ΔSH3·SB++−NΔSH3·YDxPNN+N, not tested; −, no compensation; +, compensation; ++, excessive compensation.

This study revealed the domain functions of Cas through an investigation of the ability of a series of systemic mutants of Cas to rescue actin stress fiber organization, cell migration, and Src transformation that were impaired in Cas-deficient fibroblasts. As a result, the YDxP motifs were shown to be indispensable for actin stress fiber organization and to play essential roles in cell migration. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the SB domain was another critical region of dynamic regulation of cell motility, possibly because it plays an essential role in the membrane localization of Cas. Furthermore, it was shown that the SB domain was the vital region for anchorage-independent growth caused by activated Src, presumably because this region promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by direct association with activated Src. No detectable difference in tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization between the ΔYDxP mutant and CasFL was identified in Cas−/− fibroblasts. This fact suggests that phosphorylation at YDxP motifs is a minor portion of the whole tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and is not critical for anchoring sites to the cellular membrane. The basal level of phosphorylation of YDxP motifs might be enough for the induction of actin stress fibers organization. A processive phosphorylation mechanism has been presented, to predict a type of autonomous function of YDxP motifs by using repetitive YDxP sequences as targets of both tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains (3Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); this could explain an action of YDxP motifs independently of other domains of Cas. The influence of YDxP motifs on actin stress fiber organization is exerted by physical connections with specific molecules in phosphorylation-dependent manners. Previous studies have shown that CrkII and Nck are associated with Cas in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration (4Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The CrkII SH2 domain has a binding preference for YDxP motifs found in the substrate domain of Cas (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Eduardo Fajardo J. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). In our study, ΔYDxP actually lacks the association with CrkII, which may be responsible for the defect in actin stress fiber formation. No detectable association of adaptor protein Nck with any mutant was identified in Cas−/− fibroblasts (data not shown). The CrkII-C3G pathway, which is reported to activate the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, is closely involved in the process of actin organization and cell migration (27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 28Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, there remains the possibility that other SH2-containing molecules binding to YDxP motifs of Cas regulate actin biosynthesis. LPA, a strong activator of Rho family GTPases, has been reported to induce phosphorylation of Cas (12Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fact that it could stimulate the formation of actin stress fibers in the absence of Cas indicates that direct target proteins of LPA are not located upstream of Cas in the signaling pathway but are found either downstream or in different pathways in actin stress fiber organization. The finding that ΔYDxP also showed a significant defect in cell migration could be explained by previous study showing that actin stress fiber formation is one of the critical step in cell migration (29Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). It was also known from analysis of the ΔSB mutant that cell migration additionally requires the Src-binding domain of Cas, which, by binding Src-family kinases, promote tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent membrane localization of Cas. Previous reports also suggest these functions of the Src-binding domain in normal fibroblasts (2Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 16Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L., Ma, A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Pellicena P. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this case, Fyn and Src kinases have been identified as Src-family kinases responsible for phosphorylation of Cas in fibroblasts (13Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Sakai R. Nakamoto T. Ozawa K. Aizawa S. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A high level of tyrosine phosphorylation, which may involve phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues of Cas protein, will be required for association with special sets of signaling molecules and for the completion of cell migration. A similar case was found in Src/Yes/Fyn (SYF)-deficient fibroblasts, which showed a decreased level of adhesion-dependent Cas phosphorylation and exhibited marked defects in cell migration (31Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The interaction between Src and Cas occurs mainly between the SH3 domain of Src and the RPLPSPP motif of Cas, located within the SB domain (6Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, cell mobility was almost completely restored by Y762F but very poorly by RLGS in Cas−/− fibroblasts. These results indicate that the RPLP motif that sustains Src-Cas association plays an essential role in cell migration. The ΔSH3 mutant could rescue both the organization of actin stress fibers and cell migration of Cas−/− fibroblasts, although it was suggested that the SH3 domain of Cas was involved in cell migration through direct binding with FAK and PTP-PEST (17Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 19Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). There is another model showing that Src serve as a bridge between FAK and Cas by its SH2 and SH3 domains (4Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). There is also a report that integrin-mediated phosphorylation of Cas is not compromised in fibroblasts lacking FAK but significantly reduced in cells lacking Src (14Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these studies, there might be alternative pathways utilizing the SB domain of Cas via FAK and Src family kinases in actin stress fiber organization and cell migration. Cas is a specific substrate of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST (32Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). From our results, it was suggested that either action of PTP-PEST does not require association at the SH3 domain of Cas or that PTP-PEST itself is dispensable for some biological activities of Cas. We failed to establish Cas−/− fibroblast lines expressing comparable level of ΔYQxP to other mutants, although we tried several independent transfections. No rescue of cell motility by ΔYQxP was observed, perhaps because of its lower expression level. However, it was observed that ΔYQxP could rescue the organization of actin stress fibers, indicating that YQxP motifs are dispensable for this process. It was revealed that the SB domain of Cas also plays indispensable roles in anchorage-independent growth by activated Src. The reduced phosphorylation level of Cas caused by deletion of the SB domain was observed also in Cas−/− Src fibroblasts. Similar to the case of Cas and normal Src family kinases in Cas−/− fibroblasts, the association between Cas and activated Src kinase is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by activated Src, which results in cellular transformation. Consistent with our results, a previous study revealed that C-terminal Src-binding sequence of Cas can functionally substitute for full-length endogenous Cas in transformation of rat 1-LA29 cells (33Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Bouton A.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 26: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, YDxP sequences that are critical for actin stress fiber formation are not required for cell transformation in either case. Hyperphosphorylation at tyrosines around Src-binding domain of Cas caused by the activated Src might be critical for the signaling of cellular transformation. In fact, hyperphosphorylation of Cas was frequently found in malignant solid tumor cell lines such as melanoma, colon cancer, seminoma, and glioblastoma (data not shown) although the meaning of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in cancer cells is not clear so far. It will require further investigation to identify the specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Cas that play critical roles in anchorage-independent growth in cell transformation. In conclusion, this study has given insight into the domain functions of Cas using a compensation assay of Cas−/− fibroblasts. Cas keeps the signal equilibrium of actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and Src transformation by utilizing different domains in differential and cooperative ways. In addition, important roles of direct Cas-Src association and phosphorylation of Cas in cell migration and transformation were observed.

Here we investigated the requirements for transfer of the information given by ligand binding to the cytoplasmic domain of gp130. It is demonstrated that the box 1/2 region has to be located membrane-proximally in order to bind and activate Janus kinases. To test the possible requirement of an α-helical orientation, we inserted 1–4 alanine residues into this juxtamembrane intracellular region. The insertion of one alanine results in a strongly reduced activation of STAT1 and STAT3, whereas insertion of three alanine residues leads to a stronger STAT activation. These results suggest that gp130-mediated activation of STATs is sensitive to rotational changes around the receptor axis perpendicular to the membrane. Surprisingly, insertion of 1, 2, 3, or 4 alanine residues into this juxtamembrane region leads to successive impairment but not abolishment of Janus kinase and receptor phosphorylation, supporting the finding of sensitivity of Janus kinases toward changes in distance of box 1/2 from the plasma membrane.

In recent years, new insights into cytokine receptor function have emerged. In particular, studies on the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)1 have revealed that the so far commonly accepted activation mode by pure dimerization or oligomerization is not sufficient. Instead, a new model shows that the intracellular regions of cytokine receptors have to be precisely orientated in order to allow signal transduction upon ligand binding (for a review see Ref. 1Ballinger M.D. Wells J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 938-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The type I transmembrane glycoprotein gp130 is the commonly used signaling receptor chain of all interleukin-6-type cytokines (i.e. interleukin-6 (IL-6) (2Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), interleukin-11 (IL-11), leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, and cardiotrophin-like cytokine (3Senaldi G.

A. 1999; 96: 11458-11463Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). While signal transduction via IL-6 and IL-11 requires gp130 homodimerization, the other cytokines transduce their signals through gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor heterodimers. Oncostatin M alternatively signals via gp130/oncostatin M receptor heterodimers. Therefore, unlike several other cytokine receptors (e.g. EpoR and growth hormone receptor), gp130 functions as part of multiple receptor complexes and has to meet higher requirements concerning its mode of activation (i.e. precision and yet flexibility (for a review, see Ref. 4Heinrich P.C.

In contrast to the structure of the intracellular region, the domain organization of the extracellular part is well understood. The ligand binding region in the ectodomain of gp130 (D1–D3) is defined (5Horsten U. Müller-Newen G. Gerhartz C. Wollmer A. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. J. Biol.

It was recently shown that two antibodies are required for the activation of gp130; one of them can be functionally replaced by its Fab fragment. This observation implies that simple receptor dimerization is not sufficient for signaling; the right conformation needs to be adjusted (13Müller-Newen G. Küster A. Wijdenes J. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4579-4586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to the presently accepted mechanism of signal transduction induced by cytokines, the following events occur. Receptor activation leads to juxtaposition of the constitutively receptor-associated Janus kinases, which become activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and in turn phosphorylate the receptor on specific tyrosine residues. Thereby, docking sites are created for proteins with Src homology 2 domains like the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), the Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatases 1 and 2, or the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3. The Janus kinases bind to a section comprising the membrane-proximal 61 amino acids, the so-called box 1/2. Both regions seem to be absolutely required for Jak association and activation (14Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). So far, it is unknown whether the box 1/2 comprises a domain that has a modular character and can be transferred to a different position within the cytoplasmic region. This study deals with some unanswered questions concerning the gp130-mediated signal transduction. (i) Is the activation of gp130 sensitive to orientation of the cytoplasmic domains? (ii) Is Jak binding dependent on membrane proximity? (iii) Does the box 1/2 region have a modular character? We demonstrate that the box 1/2 region cannot be transferred to a position distant from the membrane in order to bind and activate Janus kinases. Insertion of 1–4 alanine residues into the juxtamembrane intracellular region of gp130 shows that the extent of Jak and receptor phosphorylation is not necessarily linked to STAT phosphorylation and STAT-dependent transcription. Whereas a gp130 mutant with one additional amino acid in the juxtamembrane region still leads to full Jak and receptor phosphorylation after stimulation, STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation are greatly impaired. In contrast, the insertion of three alanine residues still allows a stronger STAT activation and reporter gene induction although Jak and receptor phosphorylation are significantly reduced. These results are discussed in a new model concerning the gp130 activation mode in which the relative orientation of the cytoplasmic regions seems to be critical for further signal transduction. Standard cloning procedures were performed. The construction of the pSVL-based expression vectors (AmershamBiosciences) encoding the receptor chimeras IL-5Rα/gp130 and IL-5Rβ/gp130 has been described by Behrmann et al. (15Behrmann I. Janzen C. Gerhartz C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Hermanns H. Heesel B. Graeve L. Horn F. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5269-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); construction of those encoding IL-5Rα/gp130Δbox1 and IL-5Rβ/gp130Δbox1 (also known as Δ1) has been described by Thiel et al.

To generate the mutants IL-5Rα/gp130-Δ1-1/2CT and IL-5Rβ/gp130-Δ1-1/2CT, the construct IL-5Rβ/gp130Δbox1 was subcloned into the pBluescript (pBS) cloning vector. The entire box 1/2 region of gp130 was amplified using primers flanked by restriction sites for SphI, and the resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the SphI site located in the C-terminal region of gp130 downstream of amino acid Met901. The constructs IL-5Rα/gp130–1/2CT and IL-5Rβ/gp130–1/2CT were generated analogously. All insertion mutants (+1A, +2A, +3A, +4A, +1K and +2K) were generated by overlap extension using PCR with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino acid insertion and the cDNA for IL-5Rβ/gp130 as a template. The resulting products were cloned into theEcoRI/BstEII-digested expression plasmid for IL-5Rα/gp130. To obtain the equivalent IL-5Rβ chimeras, the respective IL-5Rα chimeras were digested withEcoRI/BamHI and subcloned into IL-5Rβ/gp130. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analyses. For transfection of HepG2 cells, XhoI/BamHI fragments comprising the cDNA encoding the various receptor constructs were inserted into XhoI/BglII-digested pCAGGS expression vector (17Nakajima K.

The expression plasmid for Jak1 was kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK); the one for murine STAT3 was from Dr. J. E.

Simian monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Approximately 1.5 × 107 COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA using either the DEAE-dextran method as described (18Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C.

COS-7 cells were stimulated for 15 min with 10–20 ng/ml IL-5 (Cell Concepts, Umkirch, Germany) and lysed in BRIJ97 or Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described previously (18Hermanns H.M. Radtke S.

Proteins were separated on a 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL, Dreieich, Germany). Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reprobing the blots, they were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.7) for 20 min at 75 °C. The monoclonal antibody against STAT3 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); monoclonal antibodies against IL-5Rβ (S-16) and phosphotyrosine (PY99) and polyclonal antisera against IL-5Rβ (N-20) and Jak1 (HR-785) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The phosphospecific polyclonal antisera against STAT1(Tyr701) and STAT3(Tyr705) were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). The polyclonal antiserum against Jak1 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Ziemiecki (Bern, Switzerland). PGL3α2M-215Luc contains the promoter region −215 to +8 of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene upstream of the luciferase-encoding sequence of plasmid pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid pGL3-IRF-Luc contains two copies of the STAT1 binding site of the IRF-1 promoter upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter and the luciferase-encoding sequence. The plasmid was generated by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding sequence of the plasmid described by Yuan et al. (19Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lütticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T.

HepG2 cells were grown on six-well plates to 30% confluence and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Calcium phosphate precipitation was performed with 2.5 μg of each receptor construct, 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector, and 3.5 μg of the pGL3α2M-215Luc or 6 μg of the pGL3-IRF-Luc. Transfection, stimulation, lysis, and luciferase assays were carried out as described (18Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors are critically dependent on associated tyrosine kinases belonging to the Jak family, which are recruited to the receptor via their so-called box 1/2 region. Sequence analyses of the intracellular regions of basically all cytokine receptors localize the box 1/2 within the membrane-proximal 61 amino acids. In order to investigate whether the box 1/2 represents an independent domain that can be shifted to a different location within the cytoplasmic region of gp130, we took advantage of receptor chimeras that have been successfully used in previous studies (15Behrmann I. Janzen C. Gerhartz C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Hermanns H. Heesel B. Graeve L. Horn F. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5269-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol.

We first deleted box 1 in the membrane-proximal region (gp130-Δ1) (Fig. 1A), thereby abrogating Jak binding to gp130 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Subsequently, we reintroduced the cDNA encoding the full-length box 1/2 region (Arg644–Ser710) into the membrane-distal region of gp130 C-terminal to amino acid Met901 (Fig. 1A, gp130-Δ1–1/2CT). The receptor cDNAs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, equal surface expression was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (data not shown), and STAT1 activation was evaluated using an EMSA. The mutated as well as the wild-type gp130 cytoplasmic regions were analyzed in a homodimerized setup (i.e. both the IL-5Rα chimera and the IL-5Rβ chimera carry the same intracellular part). As expected, the receptor construct containing the wild-type cytoplasmic region of gp130 mediates strong STAT1 activation (Fig.1A, lane 4). In contrast, the receptor construct lacking the box 1 region, gp130-Δ1, failed to activate STAT1 after stimulation of the COS-7 cells with IL-5 (Fig.1A, lane 6). Interestingly, transfer of the box 1/2 region to a more C-terminal location cannot restore signal transduction; the gp130-Δ1–1/2CT construct failed to mediate STAT1 DNA binding (Fig. 1A, lane 8). As a control, we introduced the full-length box 1/2 into the wild-type gp130 cytoplasmic region (gp130–1/2CT). Introduction of this additional C-terminally located box 1/2 region did not significantly alter the signal transduction potential (Fig. 1A,lane 10). To investigate at what point signal transduction through the gp130-Δ1–1/2CT construct is abrogated, we performed immunoprecipitation assays of the receptor. As shown in Fig.1B (lane 3), Jak1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with this receptor mutant. In contrast, both gp130 and gp130–1/2CT efficiently recruited Jak1 (Fig. 1B,lanes 4 and 5). Equal expression levels of Jak1 and the receptor constructs are shown in theright section of Fig. 1B. Since Jak1 is absolutely required for gp130-mediated signal transduction (21Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), it is obvious that the failure of recruitment to the receptor leads to abrogation of signaling. From our experiments, we conclude that the box 1/2 region needs to be located in close proximity to the plasma membrane in order to efficiently recruit Jaks and therefore allow signal transduction, although the possibility cannot be excluded that the region transferred to the C terminus might not fold correctly within a different sequence context. Previous work with the gp130 TM domain 2H. M. Hermanns, P. C. Heinrich, and I. Behrmann, unpublished results. led us to hypothesize that there may be an α-helical structure of the juxtamembrane domain of gp130. Therefore, activation of gp130 might not only be sensitive to changes in distance of conserved motifs from the plasma membrane but also to their orientation. To test this hypothesis, we inserted either 1, 2, 3, or 4 extra alanine residues (+1A, +2A, +3A, +4A) into the membrane-proximal intracellular region of gp130 N-terminally to box 1. Every extra alanine residue would give each receptor chain within the dimer a twist of ∼110° (Fig.2A); at the same time there is a shift in distance of ∼1.6 Å. Since no structural data are available for the cytoplasmic region of any cytokine receptor and exon/intron transitions in genes often correlate with domain borders of the protein, we used the known exon/intron organization of the human gp130 gene (22Szalai C. Toth S. Falus A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) to find the most suitable site for insertion mutagenesis. We chose the border between exons 15 and 16, corresponding to amino acids Leu646 and Ile647, for insertions of 1–4 alanine residues, five amino acids downstream of the predicted TM region and upstream of the Jak recruitment site box 1 (see Fig. 2B). The TM and intracellular regions of the resulting mutants were fused to the extracellular parts of the IL-5 receptors as described above. We first analyzed Jak binding to the receptors after coexpression of the indicated receptor constructs (in a homodimerized setup) with Jak1 in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the IL-5Rβ-chain chimeras revealed basically similar binding of Jak1 to all receptor mutants (Fig.3A). The reduction in binding of Jak1 to the +3A construct (Fig. 3A, lane 4) was not consistently observed. Therefore, we conclude that the introduction of 1–4 alanine residues does not impair the receptor-Jak1 interaction.Figure 3A, binding of Jak1 to gp130 is not impaired by insertion of alanine residues into the membrane-proximal region. COS-7 cells, transfected with plasmids encoding the IL-5Rβ/gp130 constructs (7.5 μg) as indicated and Jak1 (1 μg), were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal IL-5Rβ antibody (S-16). Western blots were probed with a polyclonal antiserum against Jak1 (upper panel) and reprobed with the IL-5Rβ (N-20) antibody (lower panel).B, insertion of alanine residues into the membrane-proximal region of gp130 impairs Jak phosphorylation. COS-7 cells expressing the various chimeric constructs (7.5 μg each) as indicated in a homodimerized setup and Jak1 (1 μg) were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-5, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antiserum against Jak1. Blots were probed with an antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY99) and an antiserum against Jak1 (HR-785).C, impairment of Jak phosphorylation results in reduced gp130 receptor phosphorylation. COS-7 cells were transfected as described for B. Blots were analyzed with an antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY99) and a polyclonal antibody against IL-5Rβ (N-20). IP, immunoprecipitation; WB, Western blot detection. Representative results of three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then investigated whether Jak1 could still be activated. Transient transfection into COS-7 cells revealed equal surface expression of all constructs except for IL-5Rα/gp130(+3A) and IL-5Rα/gp130(+4A), which were slightly less expressed on the cell surface (mean fluorescence ∼70% of wild type; not shown). 12 h post-transfection, cells were stimulated with IL-5 or left untreated. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of Jak1 (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that the ability of the mutated receptors to transmit the cytokine-induced signal to the intracellularly attached Janus kinases decreases with rising number of inserted alanines; whereas stimulation of the +1A mutant led to Jak1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B,lane 4) even stronger than the wild-type receptor construct (Fig. 3B, lane 12), stimulation of the +4A mutant resulted in a strongly diminished Jak1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 10). These experiments therefore rather suggest the requirement of membrane proximity for full phosphorylation of Jaks than a sensitivity toward orientational changes. We next analyzed the level of receptor phosphorylation induced by stimulation of +1A, +2A, +3A, and +4A constructs with IL-5. Interestingly, the receptor phosphorylation decreases to the same extent as observed before for Jak phosphorylation; whereas the +1A mutant shows the strongest receptor phosphorylation followed by the +2A and +3A mutant, phosphorylation of the +4A mutant is hardly detectable (Fig. 3C, lanes 4, 6,8, and 10). To investigate whether the Jak and receptor phosphorylation impairment proceeds also to STAT activation, we analyzed the STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation status after activation of the four different gp130 mutants. Surprisingly, stimulation of the +1A receptor chimeras reveals a drastically reduced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.4, A and B,lane 2, respectively) compared with the wild-type constructs (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 12, respectively). In contrast, especially tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 transmitted by the +3A mutant appears to be stronger (Fig. 4B, lane 6), considering the pronounced reduction in Jak and receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). This indicates that insertion of one alanine residue into the juxtamembrane region of gp130 uncouples Jak and receptor phosphorylation from STAT activation. The most straightforward explanation for these results is a sensitivity of STAT activation toward receptor orientation. Under the assumption of an α-helical structure protruding from the TM to the intracellular region, one extra alanine residue would turn each receptor chain by ∼110°, resulting in a position far from the wild-type state (as schematically shown in Fig. 2A), which might explain the observed reduced signal transduction. In contrast, insertion of two or three extra alanine residues into an α-helix should lead to a rotation of ∼220 or 330°, respectively, twisting the receptor back, closer to its native position. The +3A receptor construct resembles the wild-type receptor to the greatest extent in that it shows a consistent Jak/receptor/STAT phosphorylation. The reduction in signal intensity compared with the wild type might represent the requirement for close membrane localization of the Jaks in order to be fully activated. In order to further substantiate the discrepancy between Jak/receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C) and STAT phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B) induced by the various mutants (summarized in Table I) and to compare the +1A and +3A mutant in a more quantitative approach, we analyzed the signal transduction capacities of the +1A, +2A, +3A, and +4A mutants in a homodimerized setup using EMSA experiments. Interestingly, the +1A mutant led to a severe impairment of STAT1 and STAT3 activation (Fig. 5, Aand C, lane 4) compared with the wild-type construct (Fig. 5, A and C,lane 12). The +2A or +3A mutant (Fig.5A, lanes 6 and 8) displays a stronger STAT1 activation although the receptor is less phosphorylated (Fig. 3C). For STAT3 especially, the +3A mutant leads to a strong recovery of the DNA binding capacity (Fig.5C, lane 8). The insertion of four alanines into the juxtamembrane region leads to complete abrogation of STAT1 and STAT3 DNA binding after IL-5 stimulation (Fig. 5,A and C, lane 10).Table ISummary of the data obtained with the gp130 mutantsWild type+1A+2A+3A+4AReceptor association++++++++++++++++++++Jak1 Y-P+++++++++++++Receptor Y-P+++++++++++++STAT1 Y-P+++++++−STAT3 Y-P++++++++++++EMSA (STAT1)+++++++++++−EMSA (STAT3)+++++++++−Reporter gene induction*+++++++++++/−Data obtained with chimeric gp130 receptors in COS-7 or in HepG2 cells (*) are shown.

In order to confirm these results in a different cell line, we performed reporter gene assays in HepG2 hepatoma cells. We used two different reporter gene constructs to be able to investigate STAT1 and STAT3 activation. The plasmid pGL3-IRF-Luc contains two copies of the STAT1-binding site of the IRF-1 promoter (Fig. 5B); the α2-macroglobulin promoter-driven reporter gene is mainly STAT3-responsive (Fig. 5D). We could tell that again the +1A mutant was less efficient in signal transduction than the +2A and especially the +3A constructs (Fig. 5, B andD, lanes 2, 4, and6, respectively). Sequence analyses of many cytokine receptors revealed a clustering of positively charged residues within the membrane-proximal 10 amino acids. The phospholipids at the plasma membrane/cytoplasm interface are largely negatively charged. Therefore, one could envisage an interaction of the negatively charged phospholipid head groups with amino acids from the receptor thereby anchoring the receptor in the membrane. An alanine insertion into this region could disrupt such an interaction. To exclude this possibility, we also performed experiments with an insertion of one (+1K) or two lysine (+2K) residues instead of the alanines. Interestingly, these mutants resulted in similarly severe impairment of signaling as shown in EMSA experiments and reporter gene assays (Fig. 6, A andB, lanes 4 and 6, respectively).

HslU ATPase forms a hexameric ring, and HslV peptidase is a dodecamer consisting of two stacked hexameric rings. In HslVU complex, the HslU and HslV central pores are aligned, and the proteolytic active sites are sequestered in an internal chamber of HslV, with access to this chamber restricted to small axial pores. Here we show that the C-terminal tails of HslU play a critical role in the interaction with and activation of HslV peptidase. A synthetic tail peptide of 10 amino acids could replace HslU in supporting the HslV-mediated hydrolysis of unfolded polypeptide substrates such as α-casein, as well as of small peptides, suggesting that the HslU C terminus is involved in the opening of the HslV pore for substrate entry. Moreover, deletion of 7 amino acids from the C terminus prevented the ability of HslU to form an HslVU complex with HslV. In addition, deletion of the C-terminal 10 residues prevented the formation of an HslU hexamer, indicating that the C terminus is required for HslU oligomerization. These results suggest that the HslU C-terminal tails act as a molecular switch for the assembly of HslVU complex and the activation of HslV peptidase.

N-carbobenzoxy amido-4-methylcoumarin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) maltose-binding protein ATP-dependent proteolysis plays an essential role in controlling the levels of key regulatory proteins and in the elimination of abnormal polypeptides (1Goldberg A.L.

These tasks are carried out by architecturally related ATP-dependent proteases such as the 26 S proteasome in eukaryotes (3Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemüller E.

The 26 S proteasome consists of the 20 S proteasome, which forms a proteolytic core, and the 19 S regulatory complex harboring multiple ATPase activities (8Ciechanover A.

The barrel-shaped 20 S proteasome is composed of α- and β-type subunits. The α-type subunits, which are proteolytically inactive, form the outer ring, and the β-type subunits, which contain the active sites, form inner rings of the complex. The bacterial HslVU protease is a homolog of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome (10Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 88-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HslVU in Escherichia coli is the product of the hslVU operon, which encodes two heat shock proteins, the HslV peptidase and HslU ATPase (12Chuang S.E. Burland V. Plunkett G. Daniels D.L. Blattner F.R. Gene. 1993; 134: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). HslV forms a dodecamer of two back-to-back stacked hexameric rings (13Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HslU forms a hexameric ring and binds to either one or both HslV ends (14Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U.

Nature. 2000; 408: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cod operon in Bacillus subtilis encodes the CodW and CodX proteins (in addition to CodV and CodY), both of which display more than 50% identity in their amino acid sequences with HslV and HslU in E. coli, respectively (16Slack F.J. Serror P. Joyce E. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that CodW provides the peptidase activity, whereas CodX harbors the ATPase activity, both of which can function together as a new type of two-component ATP-dependent protease (17Kang M.S. Lim B.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Remarkably, CodW uses its N-terminal Ser hydroxyl group as the catalytic nucleophile, unlike HslV in E. coli and certain β-type proteasome subunits, which have N-terminal Thr as an active site residue (18Seemüller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HslU ATPase is a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family of molecular chaperones (20Neuwald, A. F., Aravind, L., Spouge, J. L., and Koonin, E. V. Genome Res. 9, 27–43Google Scholar). Functions that have been attributed to this family member include facilitating the degradation of target proteins by cognate proteases (21Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 22Pak M. Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). HslU supports the HslV-mediated degradation of SulA, an inhibitor protein of E. coli cell division, but by itself can also function in prevention of aggregation of the inhibitor protein (23Seong I.S., Oh, J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Seong I.S., Oh, J.Y. Lee J.W. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among these family members, ClpA and ClpX target ssrA-tagged polypeptides to the ClpP peptidase for degradation (21Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) but by themselves can also function in disassembly of oligomeric proteins, such as the plasmid P1 RepA replication initiator and the DNA-bound MuA transposase, respectively (22Pak M. Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19316-19322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies using ssrA-tagged green fluorescent protein as a substrate have shown that ClpA and ClpX unfold green fluorescent protein in an ATP-dependent process and translocate it into the catalytic compartment of the ClpP protease (26Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 27Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of peptidase components such as ClpP and HslV reveal that the peptidases consist of two doughnut-shaped rings within which the proteolytic active sites are sequestered in an inner chamber, with access to this chamber restricted to small axial pores (13Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The diameters of these pores are so small that only a single strand of polypeptide can be threaded through (13Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 29Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, native protein substrates have to be unfolded by an associated ATPase and actively translocated into the cognate peptidase for degradation (30Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Hoskins J.R. Pak M. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This mechanism requires the specific docking of the ATPase with the peptidase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a tripeptide, IGF, in E. coli ClpX is essential for ClpP recognition and that mutations in this IGF sequence disrupt ClpXP complex formation and prevent protease function (33Kim Y.I. Levchenko I. Fraczkowska K. Woodruff R.V. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HslU, which does not have the conserved IGF motif, does not bind ClpP but interacts with HslV. These findings imply that other motif in HslU ATPase may exist and mediate the interaction with and activation of HslV through different mechanisms. To date, a number of crystal and solution structures of HslVU have been reported (34Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 35Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. McKay D.

We have recently characterized four distinct HslU conformational states (in complex with HslV) and determined the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes within them, especially including a conformational change of its C terminus (38Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H. Structure. 2001; 9: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The highly conserved HslU C terminus is inserted at an HslV-HslV interface when ATP is bound; otherwise it is buried at the HslU-HslU interface (35Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. McKay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have suggested that the insertion of HslU C-terminal tails into pockets at the HslV-HslV interface in the ATP-bound state might cause the opening of the central pore of HslV peptidase for the access of unfolded polypeptide substrates into the proteolytic chamber. In the present studies, we provide biochemical evidence showing that the HslU C terminus is essential for its interaction with HslV and for activation of the peptidase. We demonstrate as well that the C-terminal tails of CodX ATPase are also involved in the activation of CodW peptidase. All reagents for PCR, including Taqpolymerase and restriction endonuclease, were purchased from Takara (Shiga, Japan). Peptide substrates were obtained from Bachem Feinchmikalien AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Synthetic peptides ADEDLSRFIL (HslU tail sequence), KNKDLSQFIL (CodX tail sequence), and SLDIARFKNE (scrambled tail sequence) were purchased from AnyGen (Kwangju, Korea). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. HslV, HslU, CodW, CodX, and their mutant forms were purified as described previously (17Kang M.S. Lim B.K. Seong I.S.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with pGEM-T/HslVU as the templates. The PCR reactions were carried out using mutagenic primers, which were designed to replace the codons for Ser439, Asp437, or Ala434 by a stop codon (TAA) for generating the HslU deletion mutants lacking 5 (HslU/ΔC5), 7 (HslU/ΔC7), or 10 amino acid residues (HslU/ΔC10) from its C terminus, respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into MC1000H carryinghslVU::kan (23Seong I.S., Oh, J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Substitutions of the nucleotides by mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing. Peptide hydrolysis was assayed as described previously using N-carbobenzoxy (Cbz)1-Gly-Gly-Leu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) as a substrate (40Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S.

Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained the peptide substrate (0.1 mm) and appropriate amounts of the purified HslV and HslU or its mutant forms in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 8) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Incubations were performed for various periods of time at 37 °C and were stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 1% (w/v) SDS and 0.8 ml of 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 9.1. The release of AMC was then measured using a fluorometer. ATP hydrolysis was assayed by incubating similar reaction mixtures at 37 °C but in the absence of the peptide. After incubation, 0.2 ml of 1% SDS was added to the samples, and the amount of phosphate released was determined as described (41Ames B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). For assaying protein degradation, reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained 5 μg of α-casein or MBP-SulA, 0.5 μg of HslV, and 2 μg of HslU or its mutant forms in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 8) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Incubations were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped by adding 30 μl of 0.75 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 7.5% SDS and 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. They were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 13% slab gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Proteins were quantified by their absorbance at 280 nm or by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots (4 μg each) of the purified HslU or HslV protein or their mixtures were incubated in 0.1m HEPES buffer (pH 8) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATPγS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in a total volume of 0.1 ml. After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the samples were mixed with 30 μl of 0.75 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 7.5% SDS and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. They were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–8% gradient slab gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were visualized by silver staining. The crystal and solution structures of HslVU complex (35Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. McKay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Wang J. Song J.J. Seong I.S. Franklin M.C. Kamtekar S. Eom S.H. Chung C.H.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have revealed that the HslU C terminus interacts with the binding pocket of HslV. Notably, Leu443 (C-terminal carboxylate), Arg440, and Asp437 in the C-terminal tails of HslU ATPase are involved in a direct interaction with Lys28, Glu61, and Lys73 of HslV peptidase, respectively, by forming salt bridges (Fig. 1 A). In addition, Leu438 and Ile442 in the C-terminal tails of HslU form a hydrophobic core with Val72, Val76, and Val112 of the adjacent HslV. Moreover, these amino acid residues in the C-terminal sequence of HslU are highly conserved in various microorganisms (Fig.2), implying the ubiquitous function of the C-terminal tail region of HslU family in the interaction with and thus in the activation of cognate peptidases.Figure 2Amino acid sequences of the C-terminal tail region of HslU family members. The HslU tail sequence conservation is shown in gray scale from the most (dark) to least (white) conserved. At the top, the amino acid residues that may form salt bridges with those in cognate peptidases are marked by asterisks. The amino acids that may form hydrophobic cores are indicated by diamonds. The amino acid sequence data were obtained from the Swiss Protein, GenBankTM, and EMBL databases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the C-terminal tails of HslU indeed play an essential role in HslVU complex formation and thus in the activation of HslV peptidase, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of HslU was synthesized and referred to as C10HslU. Site-directed mutagenesis was also performed to serially delete the amino acid residues in the C-terminal tail region of HslU (Fig.3 A). The mutant proteins (HslU/ΔC5, HslU/ΔC7, and HslU/ΔC10) were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 3 C). Although we attempted to generate other HslU mutants with different C-terminal lengths (e.g.HslU/ΔC1), they were recovered as insoluble precipitates (data not shown). First, we examined whether C10HslU alone could support the hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC by HslV. As shown in Fig.4 A, the peptidase activity of HslV was dramatically stimulated by C10HslU. HslV (0.1 μg) in the presence of 20 μg of C10HslU hydrolyzed the peptide substrate at about one-half the rate seen with 0.4 μg of HslU. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of C10HslU was dependent on its concentration (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, a control peptide with scrambled sequence showed little or no effect (data not shown). These results indicate that C10HslU can replace HslU in the activation of the HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis, although its apparent affinity to HslV is much lower than that of HslU. We then examined the effect of C10HslU on the degradation of protein substrates by HslV. α-Casein was incubated with HslV in the absence and presence of C10HslU for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. As previously reported (44Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Shin D.H. Shim Y.K. Kang M.S. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), HslV efficiently degraded α-casein in the presence of HslU but much less efficiently in its absence (Fig.5 A). Remarkably, C10HslU also supported the casein degradation by HslV nearly as well as HslU did. Similar results were obtained when insulin B-chain was used as a substrate (data not shown). The casein milk proteins, including α-casein, are known as natively unfolded proteins with nonregular structures (45Holt C. Sawyer L. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1993; 89: 2683-2692Crossref Google Scholar, 46Syme C.D. Blanch E.W. Holt C. Jakes R. Goedert M. Hecht L. Barron L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These results suggest that C10HslU interacts with HslV and causes the opening of its central pore for the access of unfolded polypeptide substrates as well as small peptides into the proteolytic chamber. SulA is a cell division inhibitor protein in E. coli encoded by the SOS-inducible sulA gene, which is also calledsfiA (47Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5602-5609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the inhibitor protein fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP) is degraded by HslVU under both in vitro and in vivoconditions. We have also shown that ATP hydrolysis by HslU is essential for SulA degradation by HslV (23Seong I.S., Oh, J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether C10HslU can replace HslU in supporting SulA degradation by HslV, MBP-SulA was incubated with the peptidase in the absence and presence of C10HslU. Little or no degradation of MBP-SulA was observed unless both HslU and ATP were present (Fig.5 B). Thus, it appears that unfolding of SulA by HslU ATPase is essential for degradation of the inhibitor protein, in addition to the opening of the central pore of HslV. To define further the involvement of the C-terminal tails of HslU in the activation of HslV peptidase, we examined the effects of HslU deletion mutations in the tail region on the proteolytic activity of HslV. HslU/ΔC5 was capable of supporting the hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC by HslV ∼40% as well as the wild-type HslU (Fig.6 A). In contrast, neither HslU/ΔC7 nor HslU/ΔC10 could support the peptidase activity of HslV. Similar to the peptide hydrolysis, HslU/ΔC5 but not HslU/ΔC7 or HslU/ΔC10 could support the HslV-mediated degradation of protein substrates, including α-casein and MBP-SulA, about 40% as well as the wild-type HslU (data not shown). These results suggest that the shortening of C-terminal tail length (i.e. serial elimination of the amino acids that form salt bridges and hydrophobic interaction) reduces the affinity of HslU to the binding pocket of HslV, resulting in a gradual loss of its potential to activate the peptidase. HslU alone hydrolyzes ATP, and its ATPase activity is enhanced severalfold upon interaction with HslV (40Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14035-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the deletion mutations in the C-terminal tail region of HslU on the ATPase activity, ATP hydrolysis was assayed in the absence and presence of HslV. Without HslV, HslU/ΔC5 and HslU/ΔC7 cleaved ATP nearly as well as the wild-type HslU (Fig. 6 B), indicating that deletion of C-terminal tails up to seven amino acids does not influence on the ability of HslU in ATP binding and its hydrolysis. However, the ATPase activity of HslU/ΔC7 was not stimulated at all by HslV. In addition, the extent of HslV-activated ATPase activity of HslU/ΔC5 was reduced to about one-half of that seen with the wild-type HslU. These results suggest that HslU/ΔC5 but not HslU/ΔC7 is capable of interaction with HslV, albeit with a lower affinity than the wild-type HslU. In contrast, little or no ATPase activity was observed with HslU/ΔC10 whether or not HslV was present, suggesting that HslU/ΔC10 is unable to bind ATP or to form a hexameric complex, which is essential for ATP hydrolysis. To confirm whether the C-terminal tails of HslU are indeed essential for its interaction with HslV, cross-linking analysis was performed by incubating each of the C-terminal deletion mutants with glutaraldehyde in the absence and presence of HslV. Fig.7 A shows that HslU/ΔC5 and HslU/ΔC7 but not HslU/ΔC10 could oligomerize into a hexameric form in the absence of HslV. However, HslU/ΔC7 could not form a HslVU complex, unlike the wild-type HslU and HslU/ΔC5 (Fig. 7 B). In addition, the extent of HslVU complex formation by HslU/ΔC5 was significantly lower than that by the wild-type HslU. On the other hand, HslU/ΔC10, which is unable to oligomerize into a hexamer, could not form a HslVU complex with HslV. These results indicate that the C-terminal tails of HslU play a key role not only in its oligomerization but also in HslVU complex formation with HslV. Recently, we have shown that CodWX in B. subtilis, which is a homolog of HslVU in E. coli, is a new type of ATP-dependent protease, harboring the Ser active site for proteolysis at the N terminus of CodW (17Kang M.S. Lim B.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because the structure of CodWX has not been determined yet, modeling on the binding pocket of CodW peptidase for the C terminus of CodX ATPase was performed on the basis of the structure of HslVU complex. In this modeling (Fig. 1 B), CodX has Gln464 at the position corresponding to Arg440 of HslU, which forms a salt bridge with Glu61 in HslV (see Fig. 1 A). Therefore, the Gln residue in the C-terminal tails of CodX is unlikely to form a salt bridge with Glu67 in CodW, which corresponds to Glu61 in HslV. Moreover, CodW has Lys78 at the position corresponding to Val72 in HslV, which forms a hydrophobic core with Leu438 and Ile442 in the C-terminal tails of HslU (Leu462and Ile466 in CodX) as well as with Val76 and Val112 in the same HslV polypeptide (Val82 and Val118 in CodW). Thus, the hydrophobic interaction around the C-terminal tail region of CodX in CodWX complex would not be as strong as that in HslVU. This modeling implies that CodWX would be a weaker protease than HslVU. To test this possibility, we compared the activity of CodWX with that of HslVU by incubation of the same amounts of the enzymes for the same period with Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC or α-casein. CodWX was found to degrade both substrates only about 3–4% as well as HslVU (data not shown). Based on these findings, we intended to generate an artificial CodWX protease with improved activity by replacing Gln464 of CodX by Arg and Lys78 of CodW by Val, thus allowing the substituted amino acids to form a salt bridge and hydrophobic interaction, respectively. The mutant proteins, referred to as CodX/Q464R and CodW/K78V, were purified to apparent homogeneity as described (see Fig. 3 C) (17Kang M.S. Lim B.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TableI shows that the peptidase activity of CodWX increased by about 1.5- and 4.7-fold upon substitution of Gln464 of CodX by Arg and Lys78 of CodW by Val, respectively. Furthermore, when CodW/K78V and CodX/Q464R were incubated together, the peptidase activity was increased further to about 7.5-fold. Under similar assay conditions, the ATPase activity was not significantly changed upon the mutations. These results strongly suggest that the activation mechanism involving the C-terminal tail of ATPase is also functional in CodWX complex.Table IEffects of mutations in putative interacting regions in CodW and CodX on peptide and ATP hydrolysisProteinsRelative activity againstCbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMCATPase %CodW plus CodX100100CodW plus CodX/Q464R122105CodW/K78V plus CodX472121Cod/WK78V plus Cod/XQ464R750148Hydrolysis of Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC was assayed by incubation of 0.1 μg of CodW or CodW/K78V with 0.4 μg of CodX or CodX/Q464R in the indicated combination for 10 min at 37 °C. For ATP hydrolysis, assays were performed as described above but by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C using 1 μg of each protein.

The activities seen with the mixtures of the wild-type CodW and CodX proteins were expressed as 100%, and the others were expressed relative to the value. Whereas HslV itself is a weak peptidase, CodW cannot cleave Cbz-Gly-Gly-Leu-AMC without CodX. Moreover, the ATPase activity of CodX is essential for activation of CodW peptidase, 2M. S. Kang, unpublished observation. whereas ATP binding, but not its hydrolysis by HslU, is required for degradation of peptides by HslV (48Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To examine whether the CodX C-terminal tail peptide can activate CodW peptidase as C10HslU did, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of CodX was synthesized and referred to as C10CodX. Upon incubation with C10CodX, we could clearly detect the peptidase activity of CodW. Furthermore, CodW/K78V exhibited an ∼6-fold higher activity than CodW in the presence of the same amount of C10CodX. However, the activity of CodW/K78V even in the presence of excess C10CodX was less than 5% of that seen with CodX and ATP (data not shown). These results suggest that other mechanism(s) for CodX ATPase-mediated activation of CodW peptidase should exist in addition to that involving the interaction of the C-terminal tails of CodX with the binding pocket of CodW. Recent structural studies on HslVU complex as well as on uncomplexed HslU have shown that in the dADP-bound state the C-terminal tail of HslU, which forms a short loop and helix, is buried inside a hydrophobic pocket at the HslU-HslU interface (35Sousa M.C.

This conformational change, which is likely to cycle upon ATP hydrolysis, reflects the role of the HslU C-terminal tails as a molecular switch for binding and functional interaction with HslV. Lines of biochemical evidence provided in the present study indicate that the C-terminal tails of HslU ATPase acts as a molecular switch for the assembly of HslVU complex and for the activation of HslV peptidase. First, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of HslU, C10HslU, could activate the peptidase activity of HslV. Moreover, C10HslU could also support the hydrolysis of unfolded protein substrates such as α-casein nearly as well as HslU. These results clearly suggest that the binding of C10HslU to the HslV-HslV interface leads to opening of the HslV pore for the entry of unfolded polypeptides as well as small peptides into its proteolytic chamber. These results also suggest that ATP hydrolysis is not essential for opening of the HslV pore and that the catalytic activation reflects a simple opening of the pore. However, C10HslU was unable to support the degradation of SulA, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding of native folded proteins by HslU prior to their access to the HslV pore. Second, a mutant form of HslU, HslU/ΔC7 lacking the C-terminal seven amino acids, could not form a HslVU complex with HslV, indicating that the tail region provides a critical motif for interaction with HslV. In the C-terminal tail region of HslU, the last seven amino acids are highly conserved among the HslU family members in various microorganisms (see Fig. 2). Moreover, most of these residues are involved in the formation of salt bridges and a hydrophobic core with the adjacent amino acids in HslV (35Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta S. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy R.S. McKay D. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 39Trame C.T. McKay D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the finding that HslU/ΔC10 lacking the C-terminal 10 amino acids is unable to form a hexamer, unlike HslU/ΔC7 or the wild-type HslU. Structural analysis of HslVU complex has shown that Glu436 in HslU forms a salt bridge with Lys314 in adjacent HslU subunit (39Trame C.T. McKay D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), implying that the Glu residue may play a critical role in oligomerization of HslU although we cannot exclude the possibility that two adjacent amino acids (i.e.Ala434 and Asp435) in HslU are also involved in the oligomer formation. Thus, the C-terminal tails of HslU appear to play an essential role in the assembly of HslVU complex with HslV as well as the oligomerization of itself. Finally, a catalytically improved CodWX protease could be engineered by introduction of a salt bridge and hydrophobic interaction between the C-terminal region of CodX ATPase and the binding pocket of CodW peptidase, which were not present in the authentic CodWX complex, unlike HslVU, due to the difference in the sequences of the binding region. Moreover, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 10 residues of CodX, C10CodX, could activate the peptidase activity of CodW, which by itself is inactive, although the extent of the activation by C10CodX was far lower than that by CodX. These results further support the idea that the activation mechanism involves the interaction of the C-terminal tail of HslU with the binding pocket of HslV. In certain structures of HslVU complex, HslV is in contact with HslU through the intermediate (I) domain, and the pores of HslV and HslU are not aligned with each other (34Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, this structure appears not feasible, because the activation of HslV requires its binding with the C-terminal tail region of HslU located opposite the I domain and because the deletion of seven amino acids from the C terminus prevents the formation of HslVU complex. Thus, the HslVU structure, in which HslV is contacted by HslU through the N and C domains, appears relevant. Crystallographic and biochemical analyses have recently demonstrated that the eukaryotic 20 S proteasome is a gated protease and that opening of the gate can be achieved by binding of PA26 and 19 S regulatory complex (49Groll M.

In the latent state of the 20 S proteasome, substrate entry into the inner proteolytic chamber is blocked by the gate formed by the N-terminal tails of certain α-subunits that reside in the outer ring (49Groll M.

In analogy, the insertion of HslU C-terminal tails into the HslV-HslV interface in the ATP-bound state causes the HslU and HslV rings to twist around their mutual 6-fold axis, opening the HslV pore in a “twist-and-open” mechanism (38Wang J.

Fig.8 shows a schematic model for the opening of the HslV pore upon interaction of a HslU tail peptide with HslV. Thus, it is interesting that both bacterial and eukaryotic proteasomes share a similar activation mechanism using the C-terminal tails of their regulatory components."

Given the importance of the lipid products generated by PLD activation, we aim to understand the signaling events that control the enzymatic activity of PLD through these protein activators. In particular, we are interested in the connection between PLD activity and the cellular events mediated by the Rho family of GTPases. PLD is unique among effectors for the Rho GTPases in that all three major Rho proteins, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are capable of binding to PLD and stimulating its enzymatic activity. In contrast to most other Rho effectors, PLD does not contain a recognizable binding motif, such as a CRIB domain, responsible for its GTP-dependent interaction with the switch I region of these GTPases. To study the specificity and contribution of each Rho family protein to PLD signaling necessitates an understanding of the protein-protein interactions required for the Rho proteins to bind PLD, as well as an understanding of the mechanism by which these interactions stimulate PLD activity. In previous work, we investigated the activation of hPLD1 by Cdc42 and demonstrated that there are three key features to the activation mechanism (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). First, activation of hPLD1 by Cdc42 requires prenylation of the GTPase. Cdc42 is geranylgeranylated at its carboxyl terminus, and this lipid modification, whereas not necessary for Cdc42 binding to hPLD1, is necessary for potent stimulation of PLD activity by Cdc42, suggesting that colocalization of Cdc42 and hPLD1 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-containing membranes is essential to the activation mechanism. Second, the binding of Cdc42 to hPLD1 and its subsequent activation are GTP-dependent. This GTP-dependent binding event is mediated by the switch I region of Cdc42, and a specific point mutation (Y40C) in the switch I region of Cdc42 renders Cdc42 unable to bind or activate hPLD1. Finally, in contrast to mutations in the switch I region, deletion of the entire Rho insert region from Cdc42 (designated Cdc42 ΔL8), a 13-amino acid insert helix unique to Rho family proteins, does not interfere with the GTP-dependent binding of Cdc42 to hPLD1 but inhibits Cdc42-stimulated hPLD1 activity. Interestingly, binding of Cdc42 ΔL8 to hPLD1 inhibits both the basal activity of PLD as well as the synergistic activation of hPLD1 by Arf and PKC. This work suggests that the binding of Cdc42 to hPLD1 and subsequent activation are separable and distinct events, with the switch I region mediating the GTP-dependent binding, while the insert helix of Cdc42 acts as an activation domain. During this previous study, several papers had already demonstrated that the insert helix of Cdc42 is not required for regulation of the GTPase by GEFs or GAPs, nor is it required for Cdc42-mediated signaling events, such as Pak activation or cytoskeletal rearrangements (10Wu W.-J. Leonard D.A. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26153-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deletion of the insert helix from Cdc42 did, however, interfere with Cdc42-mediated transformation (11Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fact that deletion of the insert region does not perturb most conventional Cdc42 signaling pathways implies that a specific effector that utilizes the insert helix for activation is essential to Cdc42-mediated transformation. The requirement for the Cdc42 insert helix in activation of PLD activation suggests a role for PLD in Cdc42-mediated transformation. To study the role of PLD activation by Cdc42 in cellular signaling events, it is important to understand the underlying mechanism of this interaction, as well as the specificity of the insert helix in activation of PLD. To better understand the mechanism of PLD1 activation by the insert helix, we have conducted a mutational analysis of the Rho insert region of Cdc42. Specifically, we have individually mutated the solvent-exposed residues along the Cdc42 insert helix (Ser-124, Glu-127, Lys-128, Lys-131, Asn-132) to alanine to assess their role in PLD1 activation. Mutations E127A, K128A, K131A, and N132A are right shifted in their ability to activate PLD1 in a dose-dependent manner. The S124A mutation completely blocks the ability of Cdc42 to activate PLD1. In contrast to Cdc42 ΔL8, which inhibits the basal as well as Arf- and PKC-stimulated PLD activity, Cdc42 S124A does not interfere with Arf or PKC activation. This suggests a mechanism in which a single residue, Ser-124, makes an essential contact with hPLD1 for activation of its enzymatic activity. Charge-charge interactions between the large charged residues on the surface of the Cdc42 insert helix and hPLD1 are likely responsible for properly positioning this key activation residue. As noted above, PLD is unique among Rho-family effectors in its ability to interact with all three members of the Rho family. To assess the general importance of the Rho insert region in PLD activation, we performed mutational analysis of the insert helices of RhoA and Rac1. Our data demonstrates that unlike Cdc42, where the insert helix plays an essential role in PLD activation, the insert helix of RhoA is important to but not essential for the ability of RhoA to activate hPLD1. In contrast to Cdc42 and RhoA, Rac1 activation of hPLD1 shows no dependence on its insert helix. These results suggest that the specificity of signaling to hPLD1 through the Rho family proteins may be regulated not only by specific upstream signaling pathways but also through the interaction between a given insert helix and PLD1 and the underlying mechanism of this interaction. The Cdc42, Rho, and Rac constructs/proteins used in these studies were derived from human sequences. Construction of the Cdc42 ΔL8 mutant was described previously (10Wu W.-J. Leonard D.A.

All mutations (including the ΔL8 mutations of RhoA and Rac1 and the 5A mutant of Cdc42) were generated using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with the constructs in pet15b as templates (Table I). Mutations were confirmed by restriction digest analysis, when applicable, and sequence analysis in all cases. The generation of hexahistidine-tagged Cdc42, Rac, and Rho constructs in the pVL1392 vector (PharMingen) and subsequent virus production were completed as previously described (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J.

The D4 PLD1 fragment was generated using PCR with full-length hPLD1 in the pCMV3 vector as the template. The D4 PLD1 product was inserted into pet15b using NdeI sites engineered during the PCR reaction. Expression and purification of recombinant hPLD1, Cdc42, PKCβII, and Arf1 were carried out as described previously (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RhoA and Rac1 were expressed and purified using the same protocol as that for Cdc42 expression and purification. Briefly, for the production of the geranylgeranylated GTPases, monolayers of Sf21 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding the hexahistidine-tagged constructs. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.4% CHAPS, 100 μm GDP, protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with 50 mm nickel sulfate and equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer followed by wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 0.2%N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). The protein was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 250 mmimidazole. Hexahistidine-tagged D4 PLD1 was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 (Novagen). Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 12–16 h. Cell pellets were lysed with binding buffer (supplemented with 10% glycerol) followed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column charged with 50 mm nickel sulfate and equilibrated with binding buffer. The loaded column was washed with 100 ml of binding buffer followed by 100 ml of wash buffer. The protein was eluted using a gradient of imidazole (0–1 m). Fractions containing D4 PLD1 were pooled, concentrated, and snap frozen. Activity in the exogenous substrate assay was measured as described previously (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14935-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The hPLD1 source for the exogenous assays was cytosol from Sf21 cells infected with hPLD1 baculovirus, and all assays contained 3 μg of this cytosol unless otherwise noted on the graph label. The data in Fig. 6 was generated with an SP-Sepharose-purified fraction of Sf21 cytosol expressing hPLD1; this fraction and its purification were described previously (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm GTPγS in the presence of lipid vesicles containing radiolabeled substrate ([3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine). Activity was measured using scintillation counting of the released, soluble product, [3H]choline. The PLD activity data were plotted using a simple equilibrium model assuming a bimolecular interaction between the protein activator (i.e. Cdc42) and hPLD1. Curves were obtained using the IGOR pro software package (Wave Metrics). Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that a construct of Cdc42 in which the entire Rho insert helix and an additional seven residues were deleted and replaced with loop 8 of Ras (Cdc42 ΔL8) retains GTP-dependent binding to hPLD1 but is unable to stimulate the enzymatic activity of hPLD1 (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In fact, binding of Cdc42 ΔL8 to PLD inhibits both basal and stimulated PLD activity. This data established a role for the Rho insert helix of Cdc42 not as a binding region for PLD but as an activation domain in the regulation of PLD activity. Here we further demonstrate that this regulation is the result of a specific interaction between Cdc42 ΔL8 and PLD by coupling the ΔL8 mutation with a mutation in the switch I region (Y40C), which abolishes Cdc42 binding to hPLD1. This Cdc42 Y40C/ΔL8 construct neither activates nor inhibits hPLD1 activity (Fig. 1). This result clearly demonstrates that the inhibition of PLD activity by Cdc42 ΔL8 requires switch I-dependent binding to PLD. The ΔL8 construct removes the insert helix as well as a significant number of surrounding residues by replacing residues 120–139 with loop 8 from Ras. To specifically implicate residues within the insert helix in PLD activation, we generated a Cdc42 mutant in which the five solvent-exposed residues on the insert helix (Ser-124, Glu-127, Lys-128, Lys-131, Asn-132) were mutated in combination to alanine (designated Cdc42 5A). As shown in Fig. 1, Cdc42 5A does not activate hPLD1. Thus, the inability of the Cdc42 ΔL8 construct to activate hPLD1 can be attributed to the loss of solvent-exposed residues within the insert helix itself. To further delineate the contribution of individual residues on the insert helix of Cdc42 to hPLD1 activation, we singly mutated each of the solvent-exposed residues on the helix to alanine. Mutation of the large charged residues Glu-127, Lys-128, Lys-131, and Asn-132 results in a right shift of the dose-dependent activation of hPLD1 by Cdc42, while mutation of Ser-124 completely blocks hPLD1 activation (Fig.2 A). This data suggests that the interaction between the insert helix and hPLD1 is bifunctional. A single residue, Ser-124, is critical for the insert-mediated activation of hPLD1 by Cdc42. Charge-charge interactions between surrounding residues of the insert helix and hPLD1 likely play a role in orienting this critical activation residue to stimulate the full catalytic activity of PLD. It is interesting to note that unlike Cdc42 ΔL8, which inhibits Arf and PKC stimulation of PLD, Cdc42 S124A has no effect on Arf or PKC activation (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the residues from loop 8 of Ras, which replace the insert helix in the ΔL8 construct, may perturb the site on hPLD1 that normally binds to Ser-124 in its proper orientation. It also demonstrates that binding of Cdc42 to PLD without activation (S124A) is insufficient for the synergistic effects normally observed with wild type Cdc42 in combination with Arf or PKC. Deletion of the insert helix from Cdc42 results only in a loss of PLD activation; binding is unaffected. This loss of activation can now be attributed to a single residue, Ser-124. To date, this mutation in Cdc42 appears to only affect activation of PLD. Furthermore, just as the ΔL8 mutation does not interfere with regulation of the nucleotide cycle of Cdc42 (nucleotide exchange or hydrolysis) or most Cdc42-mediated signaling events (10Wu W.-J. Leonard D.A. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26153-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the 5A and S124A mutations do not interfere with exchange or hydrolysis, nor do they interfere with conventional effector interactions (i.e. association with the CRIB domain of PAK) (data not shown). Having examined the role of the insert helix of Cdc42 in hPLD1 activation in detail, we examined the requirement of the insert helix for other Rho family members, RhoA and Rac1, in PLD activation. We constructed and expressed the ΔL8 versions of RhoA and Rac1 to assess the roles of their insert helices in hPLD1 activation. Deletion of the insert helix from Cdc42 results in inhibition of hPLD1 activity. However, this is not true for either RhoA or Rac1 (Fig. 3). Deletion of the insert from RhoA results in a partial loss of hPLD1 activation; thus, the insert helix on RhoA seems to be involved in but not necessary for RhoA activation of hPLD1. Deletion of the insert helix from Rac1 has little or no effect on its ability to activate hPLD1, as wild type and ΔL8 Rac1 activate hPLD1 to the same extent. These results clearly demonstrate differential requirements for the insert helix in activation of PLD by different Rho family proteins. It suggests that the specificity of activation of PLD, unlike other Rho GTPase effectors, results from the concerted action of the switch I region and the insert helix. Because deletion of the insert helix from RhoA resulted in a partial loss of hPLD1 activation, we examined the contribution of individual residues along the RhoA insert to this activation event. The insert helices of the Rho proteins are most divergent in sequence at the amino-terminal end of the helix (Fig.4 A); therefore, we singly mutated the solvent-exposed residues Glu-125, His-126, and Thr-127 at the amino-terminal end of the RhoA insert helix to alanine. Mutations H126A and T127A lead to a right shift in the dose-dependent RhoA activation of hPLD1, similar to mutation of the large, charged residues of the Cdc42 insert helix (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, RhoA E125A was no better than RhoA ΔL8 in activating hPLD1 (Fig. 4 B). It seems that this residue is a critical residue for the insert helix-mediated activation of hPLD1 by RhoA, similar to Ser-124 of Cdc42. Because deletion of the insert helix of RhoA does not result in the complete loss of PLD activation, as is the case for Cdc42, this residue is not the sole determinant of RhoA activation. Thus, although both Cdc42 and RhoA share a common requirement for a specific residue in insert activation of hPLD1, the mechanisms by which these two proteins activate hPLD1 are distinct. Our results demonstrate that the specificity of activation of hPLD1 by individual Rho proteins results from differing requirements for the insert helix. Activation of hPLD1 by all Rho GTPases requires an initial GTP-dependent binding event mediated by switch I of the Rho protein. Several groups have shown that RhoA binds in a GTP-dependent manner to residues within the carboxyl-terminal region of PLD (residues 712–1074 in hPLD1) (13Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanbe H. Yokozeki T.

J. 2001; 355: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region of PLD1 that block RhoA binding also block activation of PLD by RhoA, suggesting that this carboxyl-terminal region of PLD contains the switch I binding site for RhoA. The assumption is that this region is also the site for binding of Cdc42 and Rac1 through their switch I domains. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the competitive effect of a carboxyl-terminal domain of hPLD1 (D4 PLD1) on the activation of full-length hPLD1 by RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (Fig. 5). In agreement with previous data, we show that addition of D4 PLD1 in increasing amounts does not compete for activation of hPLD1 by Arf or PKC. We also confirm that the carboxyl terminus of PLD1 is an interaction site for RhoA, as D4 PLD1 competes in a dose-dependent manner for activation of hPLD1 by RhoA. In fact, the addition of D4 PLD1 at 1 μm reduces the activation of hPLD1 by RhoA to almost 20% of the maximal RhoA activation. Unlike activation of hPLD1 by RhoA, activation of hPLD1 by Cdc42 and Rac1 is only mildly affected by the addition of D4 PLD1, reducing activation levels at most to 70% of the maximal Cdc42 or Rac1 activation. Not only does this data further suggest that the mechanism of activation of hPLD1 by Rho GTPases is specific to the individual GTPase, but it suggests an explanation for the quantitative differences observed in activation of PLD by RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. RhoA activates PLD approximately four to five times better than does Rac1 or Cdc42, both of which activate PLD to approximately the same level. The fact that D4 PLD1 competes quite strongly for activation of PLD by RhoA but more weakly for Cdc42 or Rac1 activation suggests that the interaction between switch I of the GTPase and the D4 region of PLD1 is different for Rho than for Rac1 and Cdc42, a difference that ultimately affects the activation of PLD. That wild type Rac1 and Cdc42 quantitatively activate PLD1 to the same extent and that D4 PLD1 quantitatively competes for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation to the same extent are likely the result of an underlying similarity in the interaction between switch I of these GTPases and the D4 region of PLD1. PLD is unique among effectors for the Rho GTPases in that all three major Rho proteins, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are each capable of binding to PLD and stimulating its enzymatic activity. In contrast to most other Rho-family effectors, PLD does not contain a recognizable binding motif, such as a CRIB domain, responsible for its GTP-dependent interaction with the switch I region of these GTPases. Given the unique nature of this effector interaction and the importance of lipid products generated by PLD in cellular events, we are interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying the ability of Rho GTPases to stimulate PLD activity, the specificity of the interaction between the Rho GTPases and PLD, and the contribution of each Rho-family protein to PLD signaling. In previous work we implicated the Rho insert helix of Cdc42 in PLD activation (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we have further delineated the mechanism by which Cdc42 activates PLD, identifying a critical residue in the insert helix central to the activation mechanism. We also examined this activation mechanism with respect to other members of the Rho family and demonstrated that each Rho protein activates PLD by distinct mechanisms, allowing for unique signaling outcomes in the cell. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 exhibit a GTP-dependence for binding to PLD and the subsequent stimulation of its enzymatic activity (4Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahn R. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14935-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A number of groups, including our own, have demonstrated that this event is mediated through a GTP-dependent conformational change in the switch I region of the GTPase (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanbe H. Yokozeki T. Ohno S. Kaibuchi K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6035-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as specific point mutations in switch I abrogate both binding and activation. The region on PLD that binds to the active conformation of the switch I region is still not clear. Several groups have shown that RhoA binds in a GTP-dependent manner to residues within the carboxyl-terminal region of PLD (residues 712–1074 in hPLD1) (13Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanbe H. Yokozeki T.

J. 2001; 355: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region that block RhoA binding also block activation of PLD by RhoA, suggesting that this carboxyl-terminal region of PLD contains the switch I binding site for RhoA. The assumption is that this region is also the site for binding of Cdc42 and Rac1 through their switch I domains. Here we show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of PLD1 (D4 PLD1) described above does not compete for activation of PLD1 by Cdc42 and Rac1 to the same extent as it competes for RhoA activation of PLD1. This is interesting, as many groups have observed that in vitro activation of PLD1 by RhoA is quantitatively better than activation by Rac1 or Cdc42; in fact, Rac1 and Cdc42 quantitatively activate to the same extent, approximately four to five times less than RhoA. Because D4 PLD1 competes strongly for RhoA activation but weakly for Rac and Cdc42 activation, the interaction between the D4 region of PLD1 and switch I of the GTPases may partially control the level to which each Rho protein can activate hPLD1. In the work described here, we demonstrate that following the GTP-dependent binding event, the mechanism of PLD activation by each Rho-family GTPase is distinct. Specifically, we demonstrate that Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1 exhibit a differential requirement for the insert helix in stimulating the enzymatic activity of PLD, as summarized in the model in Fig.6. Deletion of the insert helices from each Rho protein shows that Cdc42 absolutely requires the insert helix for activation of PLD, Rac1 activation of PLD does not involve the insert helix at all, and the insert helix of RhoA contributes to PLD activation but is not essential. We have identified a single residue within the insert helix of Cdc42 (Ser-124) that is critical to the activation mechanism, as mutation of this residue to alanine completely blocks the ability of Cdc42 to activate PLD. In addition, surrounding residues in the insert helix appear to play a role in charge-charge interactions with PLD that serve to orient the critical serine residue. Deletion of the insert helix from RhoA compromises its ability to stimulate the enzymatic activity of PLD relative to wild type RhoA. Unlike Cdc42 ΔL8, RhoA ΔL8 is able to stimulate PLD activity, achieving a level of activation similar to wild type Rac1 or Cdc42. However, with the insert helix, RhoA stimulates PLD approximately four to five times better. Similar to Ser-124 in Cdc42, a single residue, Glu-125, makes a significant contribution to the insert-mediated stimulation of PLD by RhoA, and its interaction with PLD is facilitated by charge-charge interactions between surrounding residues of the helix and PLD. Furthermore, there is clearly a contribution of the switch I region, or possibly other regions of RhoA, to the activation of PLD. A secondary contribution may come from an interaction with switch II on RhoA, as a single residue, Asp-76, in RhoA has been shown to contribute to the activation of PLD (16Bae C.D. Min D.S. Fleming I.N. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11596-11604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to RhoA and Cdc42, the Rac1 insert makes no contribution to the activation of PLD. It seems that the switch I of Rac1, or possibly the switch I combined with a different secondary region, is solely responsible for the activation of PLD. The loss of PLD1 activation by mutations in the Cdc42 insert helix is the first demonstration of a Cdc42 effector whose activity is completely dependent on residues within the insert helix. This data is also the first demonstration that the underlying mechanisms involved in activation of PLD by individual Rho family GTPases are distinct for each protein. In combination with work from other laboratories on the insert helix and effector interactions, our previous (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and current work suggests that the Rho insert helix is not an effector-binding region but serves as an activation domain for a variety of effectors. Recent work from Zong et al. (17Zong H. Kaibuchi K. Quilliam L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5287-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) studied the role of the insert helix of RhoA in effector binding and activation. Similar to our earlier results on the Cdc42/PLD interaction (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), they showed that the insert helix was not required for binding to the Rho effector, Rho kinase, but was essential for stimulation of its kinase activity, as well as for Rho-mediated foci formation in vivo (17Zong H. Kaibuchi K. Quilliam L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5287-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, work from both the Lambeth and Bar-Sagi laboratories independently demonstrated that the insert region in Rac is essential to activation of the NADPH oxidase (18Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and is critical for the ability of Rac to promote cell cycle progression, as well as mitogenesis through regulation of superoxide production (19Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac-induced elevation of superoxide levels plays a critical role in Ras-mediated transformation (20Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Recent work from Diebold and Bokoch showed that activation of the oxidase by Rac2 involves an insert helix-dependent interaction between Rac2 and cytochromeb (21Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nature Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This interaction is subsequent to a GTP-dependent interaction between the switch I region of Rac2 and another component of the oxidase system, p67phox. Interestingly, like PLD, p67phox does not contain a conventional Rho-protein binding domain. Switch I of Rac binds to a TPR motif on p67phox (22Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), a unique mode of effector binding to its associated GTPase. This binding event, and the subsequent activation of the oxidase complex through contacts between the Rac insert helix and cytochrome b, is specific to Rac; neither Cdc42 nor Rho can stimulate superoxide production. Two residues in Rac, Ala-27 and Gly-30, are responsible for this specificity. In fact, changing the equivalent residues in Cdc42, Lys-27 and Ser-30 to alanine and glycine, respectively, allows Cdc42 to bind p67phox and activate the oxidase system (22Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 23Kwong C.H. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this system, the specificity of signaling resides in the switch I region of the GTPase. This is in contrast to PLD, which can be activated by a range of Rho proteins, with the specificity in signaling arising from distinct activation mechanisms employed by each GTPase. Taken together, our data suggests a unique and specific role of the insert helix of each Rho GTPase in signaling to PLD1. It is interesting to speculate that the distinct mechanisms of PLD activation by each Rho protein may result in distinct outcomes in cell signaling. We are specifically interested in the unique cellular outcomes of Cdc42 signaling to PLD, and in particular, the role that PLD plays in Cdc42-mediated transformation. Because the Rho insert helix of Cdc42 is required not as a binding region but as an activation domain for PLD, the most interesting finding is that Cdc42 shows an absolute dependence on a critical residue in its insert helix for stimulation of PLD1 activity. The insert helix on Cdc42 is absolutely required for its ability to transform cells (11Wu W.-J. Lin R. Cerione R.A. Manor D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16655-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for its ability to activate PLD (9Walker S.J., Wu, W.-J. Cerione R.A. Brown H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15665-15668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PLD is the only known Cdc42 effector that requires the insert helix for its activation. These observations implicate PLD as a highly specific effector for a Cdc42-mediated signaling pathway that, when up-regulated, may lead to transformation. This potential role for PLD in Cdc42-mediated transformation, which is dependent on the insert helix of Cdc42, is analogous to the activation of both the NADPH oxidase system by Rac and activation of Rho kinase activity by RhoA. In these interactions the insert helix acts as an activation domain, responsible for stimulating the activity of the effector. Interestingly, in each case, the insert helix is involved in effector activation events that can be linked to signaling pathways leading to enhanced cell growth and transformation through the activated effector. The studies described here represent an important step in understanding the cell biology of PLD activation by the Rho GTPases. The realization that each Rho protein utilizes a distinct mechanism in activating PLD suggests that these underlying mechanisms may impart specificity to PLD signaling through the Rho GTPases. The identification of a critical residue in the Cdc42 insert helix that is responsible for the activation of PLD by Cdc42 provides a powerful reagent for the study of the specific cellular events regulated by Cdc42 activation of PLD.

https://openalex.org/W1993070704,"Tumors evade cell death by constitutively activating cell survival pathways and suppressing intrinsic death machinery. Activation of cell survival pathways leads to transcriptional repression of genes associated with cell death and activation of ones promoting anti-apoptosis. Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylates forkhead transcription factors and prevents their nuclear localization, leading to repression of genes involved in apoptosis, such as Fas ligand (FasL). Using bioinformatic approaches, we have identified three consensus sequences for forkhead transcription factor binding in transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) promoter. TGF-β inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in many cell types, and acquisition of TGF-β resistance is linked to tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that activated Akt down-regulates TGF-β2 promoter, and sequences within the promoter that are related to consensus forkhead binding sites are necessary for repression. Forkhead factor FKHRL1 binds in vitro to the three consensus sequences and can activate TGF-β2 promoter in normal and Akt-transformed cell lines. In human breast and pancreatic tumors, activated Akt expression correlated with down-regulation of TGF-β 2 mRNA levels. A number of tumor cells expressing activated Akt were responsive to TGF-β addition, indicating the presence of an intact TGF-β-signaling pathway. These results suggest that repression of TGF-β 2 promoter activity in cells expressing activated Akt may play a role in promoting tumorigenesis and escape from the growth-inhibitory and/or apoptotic effects of TGF-β.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in cell survival signaling, and its activation has been linked to tumorigenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 2Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar and 3Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Akt as well as its upstream regulator phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been found in many tumors, and the negative regulator of this pathway, PTEN/MMAC, is a tumor suppressor (4Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Akt activity contributes to cellular transformation is generally thought to be by inhibiting apoptosis. Several substrates of Akt have been recently identified, and these include two components of the intrinsic cell death machinery, BAD and caspase-9, transcription factors of the forkhead family, and a kinase IKK-α, which regulates the NFκB transcription factor (for reviews, see Refs. 2Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar and 3Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In the case of BAD and caspase-9, phosphorylation by Akt suppresses their proapoptotic functions, accounting at least in part for the potent survival functions of Akt. In addition, Akt phosphorylates proteins that control the cell cycle progression, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 and p21Cip/WAF1 (5Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It is clear that Akt is a focal point for deregulation in cancer and can impact on cell proliferation and survival of cancer cells through a growing list of key targets. The best-characterized nuclear substrates of Akt are transcription factors of the Forkhead family, FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX (6Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). According to the new nomenclature these three proteins have been assigned to the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors (7Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factor by Akt results in its retention in the cytoplasm and repression of its target genes (6Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P., Hu, L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). Under conditions of growth factor deprivation, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is inactivated, and forkhead factor is unphosphorylated, leading to activation of genes associated with programmed cell death. Genes that might be targets for transcriptional regulation by the forkhead transcription factors have been identified in several systems. These include the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1)1 (9Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), Fas ligand (FasL) (10Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 24: 9138-9148Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Evidence that forkhead family members can regulate apoptosis stems from the observation that the non-phosphorylatable mutants of FKHR or FKHRL1, which are potent transcriptional activators in the nucleus, trigger apoptosis in multiple cell types (8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P., Hu, L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). In the case of FKHRL1-induced apoptosis, a target gene suggested to be able to mediate this effect is the Fas ligand gene (FASL), but other genes involved in forkhead-induced apoptosis have yet to be identified. Hence, we set out to identify other candidate target genes that may be under the control of the Akt/forkhead pathway. In this study, using bioinformatic approaches we have identified candidate target genes that contain forkhead binding sites in their promoter region. One candidate gene identified in this search is transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2). TGF-β is of particular interest because it is known to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cell types (13Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3987) Google Scholar). In mammals there are three isoforms of TGF-β, -β1, -β2, and -β3, encoded by three different genes, all of which function through the same signaling systems (14Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is initiated by binding to two receptors, termed type I and type II, and mediated by a family of effector proteins known as Smads (15Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Derynck R. Akhurst A.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). The TGF-β-signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor suppression, and acquisition of TGF-β resistance has been linked to tumorigenesis (15Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Derynck R. Akhurst A.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). We show that TGF-β2 promoter contains three consensus sequences for forkhead transcription factor binding, and TGF-β2 is a transcriptional target for Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. TGF-β2 mRNA levels are down-regulated in several human breast and pancreatic cell lines expressing activated Akt. Growth of a number of tumor cells expressing activated Akt was inhibited by exogenous TGF-β addition, indicating the presence of an intact TGF-β-signaling pathway. These studies suggest that repression of TGF-β 2 promoter through forkhead factor may be a novel mechanism for tumors to escape from the growth inhibition and/or apoptotic effects of TGF-β. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene plasmids pTGF-β2-CAT (−1729 to +63) and pTGF-β2-CAT (−28 to +63) were gifts from Dr. Seong-jin Kim at NCI, National Institutes of Health. Akt expression plasmid pEE-Myr-Akt (EE epitope-tagged) was a gift from Dr. Phil Hawkins (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK), and kinase dead Akt pHA-Akt-AA (hemagglutinin-epitope tagged) was a gift from Dr. Richard Roth at Stanford University. The primer pair used for amplification of the regions containing the three forkhead binding sites (−579 to −212) in TGF-β2 was 5′-ATATAAGCTTGCAGCAAATTATAAAGGTGACCA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGACGGATCCCGCCCTGACAACAGTGATT-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR product was digested with HindIII andBamHI restriction enzymes and ligated into theHindIII-BamHI sites of the plasmid pBLCAT2 containing minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter linked to CAT reporter gene. Transient transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. CAT assays were performed as described previously (17Bushel P. Kim J.H. Chang W. Catino J.J. Ruley H.E. Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1361-1370PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308) (New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-FKHRL1 (Thr-32), anti-phospho FKHRL1 (Ser-253) (Upstate Biotechnology). Proteins were extracted with cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAeasy reagent (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The mRNA for TGF-β2 and TGF-β1 were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Taqman) using PE Applied Biosystems prism model 7700 sequence detection instrument. The sequences of the primers (using primer express-PE ABI) were TGF-β1 forward primer (5′-CTCTCCGACCTGCCACAGA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TAACCTAGATGGGCGCGATCT-3′). The primers for TGF-β2 were 5′-GTCGCGCTCAGCCTGTCT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCTCGATCCTCTTGCGCAT-3′ (reverse primer). The TaqmanTm fluorogenic probes used for TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 are 5′-6FAM-CCCTATTCAAGACCACCCACCTTCTGGTA-TAMRA-3′ and 5′-6FAM-CCTGCAGCACACTCGATATGGACCAGT-TAMRA-3′ respectively. During PCR amplification, 5′ nucleolytic activity of Taqpolymerase cleaves the probe separating the 5′ reporter fluorescent dye from the 3′ quencher dye. Threshold cycle CT, which correlates inversely with the target mRNA levels, was measured as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescence emission increases above a threshold level. The comparative CT method was used to derive relative quantitation of the mRNA levels. This takes into account differences in concentration between RNA samples by normalizing to endogenous ribosomal S9 mRNA that is not transcriptionally regulated. The TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 expression was relative to TGF-β2 mRNA level in Miapaca cells. A bacterial expression vector encoding human FKHRL1 cDNA fused to the GST sequences (a gift from Dr. Anne Brunet, Harvard Medical School) was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The transformants were grown at 37 °C for 2 h followed by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) to the culture medium and continuing incubation for 4 h at 24 °C. Recombinant protein was purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Purified GST or GST-FKHRL1 proteins (100 ng/reaction) were used for the gel shift assays. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) corresponding to TGF-β2 binding site 3 (−579) (5′-ggcTCAAATCAGTAAAACAAACAAGTATACCT-3′), TGF-β2 binding site 2 (−480) (5′-ggcACAAACTAACAAAATAAATTCTGGGATGG-3′), TGF-β2 binding site 1 (−212) (5′-ggcAAATGACTGGAAAGTAAATACCGTAAATC-3′), IGFBP1 (5′-ggcCACTAGCAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACAC-3′), and nonspecific oligos (5′-ggcGACCAGCAACCATGCCATGGTTGAACAT-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and gel-purified. The binding reactions were analyzed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (17Bushel P. Kim J.H. Chang W. Catino J.J. Ruley H.E. Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1361-1370PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides corresponding to the forkhead binding sites from TGF-β2 or IGFBP1 promoters or nonspecific oligonucleotides were used in the reaction mixtures before the addition of the labeled probe. We undertook a search for genes containing forkhead factor binding sites in their promoter regions using computational methods (18Wang L., Wu, Q. Qiu P. Mirza A. McGuirk M. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Wang Y. Pickett C.B. Liu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43604-43610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The forkhead factor binding sequences from IGFBP1 and FasL promoters have been characterized (8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P., Hu, L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar, 9Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The DNA binding specificities of four of the FREAC proteins belonging to the forkhead family were determined by selection of binding sites from random sequence oligonucleotides (19Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recently, the binding sites for the forkhead transcription factors have also been experimentally defined (20Biggs W.H. Cavenee W.K. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). We aligned the six known forkhead transcription factor binding sequences and derived a consensus sequence for forkhead transcription factor binding (Fig. 1). The consensus sequence, WAARYAAAYW (W = A or T, R = A or G, Y = C or T) was used to search the GenBankTM data base. The informatics approach focused on genes with annotated gene structure, particularly in the 5′-flanking region. The GCG FINDPATTERNS program was used to match the consensus sequence of the forkhead factor binding site as described above. We analyzed the human subset (93,412 sequences) of the primate division of GenBankTM and identified 16,511 forkhead binding sites (or 6,406 sequences) that match the consensus sequence. The GenBankTM feature fields that define the transcript start site of a gene were used as coordinates to locate the matched sequences in the 5′-flanking region of a gene. The parsing of the GenBankTM report was carried out using script language PERL (22Wall L. Schwartz R.L. Programming PERL. O'Reilly & Associates Inc., Sebastopol, CA1991Google Scholar). This resulted in a forkhead target reference data base that is composed of 437 genes with at least one forkhead binding site in the promoter region. 2A. A. Samatar, L. Wang, A. Mirza, S. Koseoglu, S. Liu, and C. C. Kumar, unpublished results. A partial list of genes that contain the forkhead factor binding sites is shown in Table I. We selected TGF-β2 from this list to determine whether its transcription is under the control of Akt/protein kinase B-signaling pathway. TGF-β is of particular interest since it is the prototype of a family of structurally related cytokines capable of inducing diverse cellular responses, including apoptosis, differentiation, and cell cycle arrest.Table IPartial list of genes containing forkhead binding sitesGenBank™ accession No.Gene nameNo. of transcription factor sitesPosition No. of the match siteD29675Human inducible nitric oxide synthase4−336, −340, −344, −348AF001904 Homo sapiens 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase isoform 2 gene, partial coding domains1−218AJ002550Human MMP-14−546, −630, −884, −1081AJ009560Human CDC64−296, −438, −611, −841AF031236Human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)3−876, −1366, −1430D00618Human vascular smooth muscle α-actin1−605J00120Human c-mycprotooncogene4−699, −997, −1694, −2107L07624Human multidrug resistant P glycoprotein (MDR1)1−365AF006381 Homo sapiens CD30L protein (CD30L) gene, promoter region, and exon 11−451M23592Human insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-1)1−225M35760Human mitochondrial ubiquinone-binding protein1−154M37065Human glutathione S-transferase (GST-pi)1−656M86181Human prosaposin (PSAP)4−375, −407, −1042, −1046M87843Human transforming growth factor β-23−212, −480, −579U20734Human transcription factor junB (junB)1−2356U20816Human nuclear factor κ-B2 (NF-KB2)4−824, −828, −832, −836U22364Human cyclin B11−353U24170Human p21 (WAF1)1−16492669697Fas ligand (FasL)4−715, −772, −764, −934AF149773 Homo sapiens NOD1 protein (NOD1) gene3−4554, −4738, −5712U44381Human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2)2−638, −921U51914Human matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3)3−381, −1193, −1871U56422Human stromelysin 13−428, −1241, −1920U75285Human apoptosis inhibitor survivin7−898, −1643, −1647, −1721, −1725, −1729, −1733 Open table in a new tab Our analysis showed that TGF-β2 promoter contains three consensus forkhead binding sites at −212, −480, and −579 positions from the transcription start site (Table I) (23Noma T. Glick A. Geiser A.G. O'Reilly M.A. Miller J. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The core forkhead consensus binding site is not found in other isoforms of TGF-β such as TGF-β1 and -β3. The three putative forkhead binding sites in TGF-β2 promoter matched perfectly with the consensus sequence (Fig. 2 a). The sequences also matched the experimentally derived consensus site for FOXO sub-family (21Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-β2 promoter activity is regulated by activated Akt in mammalian cells, a plasmid containing TGF-β2 promoter linked to CAT reporter gene was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, and its response to activated Akt expression was measured. Two forms of Akt expression vectors were tested. One encodes myristoylated Akt (pEE-Myr-Akt), in which a membrane-targeting myristoylation sequence and an EE epitope tag were fused to Akt-coding sequences at the N terminus. The addition of myristoylation signal to Akt-coding sequence has been previously shown to lead to constitutive activation of Akt due to membrane localization (24Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). The other encodes a mutant form (pHA-Akt-AA, with a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the N terminus) in which the two phosphorylation sites (Thr-308 to and Ser-473) have been mutated to generate an inactive version of the protein (25Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Coexpression of constitutively active Myr-Akt in NIH 3T3 cells leads to strong repression of TGF-β2 promoter, whereas the kinase-dead mutant of Akt had very little effect (Fig. 2 b). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates using epitope-specific antibodies indicates (Fig. 2 d) that the two Akt proteins are expressed at equal levels in this transient transfection experiment. Next, we transfected TGF-β2-CAT plasmid into parental Rat-1 and myristoylated Akt-transformed Rat-1 (Myr-Akt-Rat-1) cells. As a control, plasmid pLW2 containing herpes immediate early promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene was transfected into these cells. Fig. 2 c shows that TGF-β2-CAT reporter gene expression was selectively repressed in Myr-Akt-Rat-1 cells compared with parental Rat-1 cells. In contrast, transfection of a deletion mutant of TGF-β2 (−28, TGF-β2-CAT) lacking all three forkhead binding sites into Rat-1 and Myr-Akt-transformed Rat-1 cells showed basal CAT activity in both cell lines. Roughly a 3.5-fold higher amount of deletion mutant was transfected in this experiment. This result shows that deletion of region containing forkhead binding sites in TGF-β2 promoter leads to loss of Akt responsiveness. Together these results show that TGF-β2 promoter is repressed in cells expressing activated AKT, and the region containing the three forkhead binding sites is required for its repression. To determine whether the three forkhead binding sites in TGF-β2 promoter can confer Akt responsiveness to heterologous promoters, we isolated the region containing the three forkhead binding sites (−579 to −212) in TGF-β2 promoter by PCR methods. This region, which does not contain the binding sites for other known transcription factors, was subcloned into plasmid pBLCAT2 containing minimal TK promoter linked to CAT reporter gene (26Luckow B. Schultz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). This plasmid, designated 3XFH-TK-CAT, was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells along with myr-Akt and Akt kinase dead mutant expression vectors. Coexpression of myr-Akt, but not the kinase dead mutant of Akt, resulted in strong repression of the 3XFH-TK-CAT expression (Fig.3 a). Similarly, CAT gene expression by this plasmid was also strongly repressed in myr-Akt-Rat-1 cells compared with parental Rat-1 cells (Fig. 3 b). To analyze the ability of forkhead transcription factor to bind in vitro to the putative forkhead binding sites in TGF-β2 promoter, we synthesized oligonucleotides corresponding to the three forkhead factor binding sites in TGF-β2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using GST-tagged FKHRL1protein purified from an E. coli expression system. The results indicate specific binding of forkhead protein to the three forkhead consensus binding sites which can be competed out by unlabeled oligonucleotides and also by oligonucleotides corresponding to forkhead binding site in IGFBP-1 promoter (Fig. 4). Nonspecific oligonucleotides did not compete for the mobility shift in these experiments, suggesting that forkhead factor binds specifically to these sites. Similar results were seen with all three forkhead binding sites, although the forkhead binding site 3 bound less protein compared with sequences corresponding to binding sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 4). Next we wanted to see if forkhead transcription factor could activate TGF-β2 promoter in vivo. Previous studies show that forkhead, when not phosphorylated by Akt, is an activator of transcription, and phosphorylation by Akt leads to its retention in cytoplasm, resulting in repression of forkhead target genes (8Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P., Hu, L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5434) Google Scholar). A mutant of FKHRL1 in which all three putative Akt phosphorylation sites have been converted to alanines localizes to the nucleus and induces transcription of genes even in the presence of activated Akt. To determine whether forkhead transcription factor expression can regulate TGF-β2 promoter activity in vivo, we cotransfected TGF-β2-CAT plasmid along with expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutant FKHRL1 into Myr-Akt-transformed Rat-1 cells, ZR-75, and LNCaP tumor cells. ZR-75 is a human breast carcinoma cell line, whereas LNCaP cell line is derived from prostate carcinoma. Both these cells are null for PTEN/MMAC gene, indicating that Akt activation in these cells is primarily due to inactivation of PTEN/MMAC tumor suppressor gene product (27Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C. Stiles B. Thomas G. Petersen R. Frost P. Gibbons J.J., Wu, H. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10314-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). TGF-β2-CAT activity is repressed in Myr-Akt-Rat-1, ZR-75, and LNCaP cells (Fig.5 a). Cotransfection of wild type or mutant FKHRL1 expression plasmids stimulated TGF-β2-CAT activity in all three cell types (Fig. 5 a). The mutant FKHRL1 protein was slightly more active than the wild type protein in stimulating TGF-β2-CAT activity in these cell lines (Fig.5 a). Next, we cotransfected plasmid p3XFHTK-CAT into ZR-75 and LNCaP cells along with FKHRL1 expression plasmids. Wild type and mutant FKHRL1 protein stimulated CAT activity in both cell types (Fig.5 b). These results show that the TGF-β2 promoter is repressed in tumor cells in which Akt is activated primarily due to inactivation of PTEN/MMAC tumor suppressor gene product, and forkhead factor can activate the promoter activity in vivo. To further confirm that activated Akt expression mediates the repression of TGF-β2-CAT activity in tumor cells, we treated LNCaP cells with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY2940002 to inhibit Akt activation and determine the effect on TGF-β2 promoter activity. TGF-β2-CAT and 3XFHTKCAT plasmids were transfected into LNCaP cells and then treated with LY2940002 for 24 h. As shown in Fig.5 c, TGF-β2-CAT and 3XFHTKCAT activities were significantly activated after treatment with LY2940002, indicating that inhibition of Akt activation by treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor leads to activation of TGF-β2 promoter activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TGF-β2 is a transcriptional target for Akt signaling via forkhead transcription factor. Next, we examined the relationship between Akt activation and TGF-β2 mRNA levels in several human tumor cell lines. Total RNA from pancreatic and breast tumor cell lines was used for quantitation of both TGF-β2 and TGF-β1 mRNA levels by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method using TaqMan fluorogenic probes. The results showed that TGF-β2 mRNA levels are selectively down-regulated in Panc-1, Miapaca-2, Aspc-1, LNCAP, PC3, and MCF-7 cells and remained unchanged in Capan-1, Cfpac-II, and MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 6 a). The fold repression observed in these cells ranged from 100- to 150-fold. There was no change in TGF-β1 mRNA levels in these cell lines (Fig. 6 a). We also determined the relative levels of TGF-β1 and -β2 mRNAs in these experiments and observed that in Cfpac-II and MDAMB-231 cells TGF-β2 mRNA is expressed ∼5-fold higher than TGF-β1 (Fig. 6 a). Recently we carried out a genome-wide gene expression analysis of breast tumor cell lines using microarrays that contain ∼60,000 cDNAs including TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 (18Wang L., Wu, Q. Qiu P. Mirza A.

Fig. 5 b shows the results obtained using microarray experiments, indicating that TGF-β2 mRNA levels are down-regulated in T47D, MCF-7, ZR-75–1, BT-474, and BT-20 cells but not in MDAMB-231 and HMEC21 (normal mammary epithelial) cells.

We have shown that high concentrations of glucose or mannitol induce apoptotic cell death in dorsal root ganglia in culture and in SH-SY5Y and SH-EP human neuroblastoma cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that has a critical role for transmitting integrin-mediated-signals. In this study, we report that hyperosmolar treatment mediates FAK dephosphorylation and cleavage, which is prevented by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) treatment. Mannitol treatment of SH-EP cells transfected with vector (SH-EP/pSFFV) results in concentration- and time-dependent dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK. Dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK are tightly correlated with apoptotic morphological changes, including the disruption of actin stress fibers, the loss of focal adhesion sites, membrane blebbing, and cell detachment. Treatment of SH-EP/pSFFV cells with IGF-I or transfection of IGF-I receptor prevents these changes. Treatment of cells with pharmacologic inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways does not affect mannitol-induced FAK dephosphorylation and degradation. However, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is necessary for IGF-I-mediated protection against FAK alteration. Mannitol treatment also results in the degradation of Akt. Mannitol induces the activation of caspases-3 and -9 in a time course similar to the dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK. Treatment of the cells with ZVAD, a general caspase inhibitor, blocks the mannitol-induced FAK and Akt degradation as well as cell detachment and apoptosis. These results suggest that one of the pathways of mannitol-mediated apoptosis is through the degradation of FAK and Akt and that IGF-I protects the cells from apoptosis by blocking the activation of caspases, which may be responsible for the loss of FAK and Akt.

The current study extends our previous reports by investigating the role of FAK in mannitol-induced apoptosis in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells. Our results indicate that the initial effects of mannitol treatment are the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and loss of focal adhesion sites, followed by cell detachment and death. This process is preceded by dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK and degradation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt. These events are prevented by IGF-IR overexpression or activation. Treatment of the cells with ZVAD, a general caspase inhibitor, prevents the loss of FAK and Akt. Our study suggests that one mechanism for IGF-I/IGF-IR-mediated survival is through prevention of alterations in FAK, which is essential in maintaining an intact cellular cytoskeleton. Antibodies against phosphorylated FAK (pFAK; pY397 and pS722) were purchased from BIOSOURCE. Anti-FAK, anti-integrin β1, and PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and antibodies against phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Akt and MAPK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-caspase-3 and anti-caspase-9 antibodies were from BD PharMingen. Secondary antibodies for Western immunoblotting and protein A/G-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin, biotin-labeled secondary antibodies, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). PD98059 and LY294002 were purchased fromCalbiochem. ZVAD was purchased from Enzyme System Product (Livermore, CA). Recombinant human IGF-I was kindly provided by Cephalon, Inc. (Westchester, PA). Transfection of SH-EP cells with pSFFV and the vector containing human IGF-IR cDNA has been described previously (26Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected SH-EP cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and 0.25 mg/ml G418. The cells were serum-starved for 6 h before each experiment. When inhibitors were used, cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min before mannitol and/or IGF-I treatment. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (32Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Typical representative results of at least three repeated experiments are shown in the figures. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (3Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For simultaneous staining of pFAK and F-actin, Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was added with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin at the final incubation. The percentage of sub-G0 DNA was measured as the percentage of apoptotic cells using flow cytometry as described previously (27van Golen C.M. Castle V.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All results are expressed as the mean percentage of apoptotic cells of at least three experiments ± the S.E. We began the current study by investigating the morphological changes induced by mannitol exposure in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells. When vector-transfected SH-EP (SH-EP/pSFFV) cells are serum-starved for a total of 10 h, most of the cells remain attached to the culture dishes (Fig. 1A). However, about 30% of the cells start to round up and display morphological features of cells undergoing detachment. Less than 15% of IGF-IR-transfected SH-EP (SH-EP/IGF-IR) cells detach from the dishes under serum-free conditions (Fig. 1A). When both SH-EP/pSFFV and SH-EP/IGF-IR cells are stained with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin, well-organized actin stress fibers are seen in attached cells. In contrast, when SH-EP/pSFFV cells are serum-starved for 6 h and then incubated with 300 mm mannitol for 4 h, most (94.5 ± 5.8%) of the cells are rounded and detached from the dishes and subsequently undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1, Aand B). Actin stress fibers in mannitol-treated SH-EP/pSFFV cells are completely disrupted, even in the attached cells (Fig.1A). Although the cells start to detach, significant numbers of SH-EP/IGF-IR cells still adhere to the dishes after 4 h of mannitol treatment (<40% detached cells) (Fig. 1B). However, the adherent cells have less organized actin stress fibers than cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone, and mannitol-treated SH-EP/IGF-IR cells show dense actin staining at the periphery of the cells, which represents active membrane ruffling (Fig.1A, arrowheads). After mannitol treatment, the cells were stained with propidium iodide to measure sub-G0DNA, indicating apoptosis. Mannitol treatment results in apoptosis in both SH-EP/pSFFV and SH-EP/IGF-IR cells; however, significantly fewer SH-EP/IGF-IR cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that the initial cellular events after mannitol treatment are the loss of actin stress fibers and detachment of the cells from substrate, leading to an anoikis-like cell death. Consistent with our previous results (26Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 27van Golen C.M. Castle V.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), IGF-IR overexpression significantly prevents or delays these early apoptotic events. FAK is involved in anoikis in many cell types (14Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 19Xu L.H. Owens L.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because our results suggest an anoikis-like cell death induced by mannitol treatment, we investigated changes in FAK in SH-EP/pSFFV and SH-EP/IGF-IR cells. Treatment with mannitol results in a concentration-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 in both SH-EP/pSFFV and SH-EP/IGF-IR cells (Fig. 2A). However, FAK phosphorylation is maintained in SH-EP/IGF-IR cells treated with 150 and 300 mm mannitol. FAK is cleaved during apoptosis, resulting in smaller fragments (33Hirata H. Takahashi A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Mannitol treatment also induces the degradation of FAK, resulting in two major cleavage fragments between 97 and 66 kDa (Fig. 2A). However, mannitol treatment has no effect on the protein levels of actin (Fig.4E), IGF-IR β subunit (Fig. 4F), or MAPK (Fig. 7), suggesting that the changes in FAK are specific. Mannitol-induced FAK dephosphorylation and degradation are also time-dependent (Fig. 2B). FAK phosphorylation starts to decrease after 45 min of mannitol treatment, and FAK is completely dephosphorylated by 90 min (Fig. 2B). This dephosphorylation occurs simultaneously with the disappearance of 125-kDa bands, indicating degradation. FAK degradation also begins at 45 min and continues up to 6 h. The time course of FAK dephosphorylation and degradation in SH-EP/IGF-IR cells is delayed compared with that of SH-EP/pSFFV cells, indicating an important role of IGF-IR signaling in the prevention of mannitol-induced FAK alterations.Figure 4IGF-I prevents mannitol-induced FAK dephosphorylation and degradation. Serum-starved vector-transfected SH-EP cells were incubated without or with 300 mm mannitol (Man) in the absence or presence of 10 nm IGF-I for 4 h. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with the anti-pFAK-specific antibodies raised against Tyr397 (A) or Ser722(B) or with regular anti-FAK antibody (D).C, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To prove the specificity of mannitol treatment, the cell lysates were also immunoblotted with anti-actin (E) or anti-IGF-IR β subunit antibodies (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Mannitol induced degradation of Akt that can be prevented by IGF-I signaling.

These morphological changes, which include membrane blebbing, loss of contact with neighboring cells, rounding up, and detachment, are noticeable 45 min after mannitol treatment (Fig.3). Morphological changes continue through the time course, and most of the cells lose their contact by 90 min. These results suggest that mannitol-induced apoptosis involves alterations of phosphorylation and protein levels of FAK, resulting in cell detachment. Our results suggest that IGF-I signaling through the IGF-IR prevents FAK dephosphorylation and degradation. We therefore investigated the effect of IGF-IR activation on mannitol-induced FAK alteration. Serum-starved SH-EP/pSFFV cells were treated with IGF-I and immunoblotted with anti-pFAK antibodies raised against pTyr397 and pSer722 sites (Fig.4, A and B). In the absence of mannitol, IGF-I treatment slightly increases the phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 4A). Mannitol treatment results in almost complete dephosphorylation on both sites, and, like IGF-IR transfection, IGF-I treatment blocks this effect of mannitol (Fig.4B). Similar results are obtained by immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4C). IGF-I treatment also blocks the degradation of FAK by mannitol (Fig. 4D). Mannitol treatment has little effect on the protein levels of actin (Fig. 4E) or the IGF-IR β subunit (Fig. 4F). To examine IGF-I-induced morphological changes, cells were immunostained with anti-FAK and phalloidin (Fig.5). Serum-starved SH-EP/pSFFV cells show well-organized actin stress fibers in most of the cells (Fig. 5,top row). FAK staining displays a typical punctate pattern at the focal adhesion sites. When the two images are overlaid, most FAK staining is localized at the termini of actin stress fibers. The addition of IGF-I to the control serum-starved cells results in little change in both actin and FAK immunostaining (Fig. 5,second row). As in Fig. 1, mannitol treatment results in the disruption of actin stress fibers, and FAK staining cannot detect the focal adhesion sites (Fig. 5, third row). IGF-I treatment prevents mannitol-induced detachment of the cells, the disruption of actin stress fibers, and the loss of focal adhesion sites, although the focal adhesions are not as well maintained as those in control or control + IGF-I-treated cells (Fig. 5, fourth row). Most of the focal adhesion sites in the mannitol + IGF-I-treated cells are smaller than those in the control or control + IGF-I-treated cells and are localized at the periphery of the cells. Immunostaining with anti-pFAK showed a similar pattern of staining (data not shown). IGF-I mediates its biological effect through two major signaling pathways, the MAPK and PI3K pathways (2Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl. 2: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,36Feldman E.L. Sullivan K.A. Kim B. Russell J.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the MAPK pathway is important for neurite outgrowth (4Kim B. Cheng H.-L. Margolis B. Feldman E.L.

Feldman E.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Delaney C.L. Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J.

To test which pathway is important for IGF-I prevention of FAK dephosphorylation and degradation, we treated the cells with pharmacologic inhibitors of each pathway. Treatment of the cells with PD98059, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway, has no effect on either mannitol-induced FAK alterations or the preventive effect of IGF-I (Fig. 6). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also has no effect on mannitol-induced FAK dephosphorylation or degradation, although it made the cells detach earlier than treatment with mannitol alone (data not shown). However, LY294002 completely inhibits the protective effect of IGF-I, which is in agreement with our previous reports (28Delaney C.L. Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29van Golen C.M. Schwab T.S. Woods Ignatoski K.M. Ethier S.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar). PD98059 and LY294002 block basal and IGF-I-induced MAPK and Akt activation, respectively. One of the important downstream signaling molecules in the PI3K pathway is Akt (38Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway is critical for the survival of many cell types (39Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). We have shown that transfection of dominant negative Akt prevents IGF-I-mediated survival in Schwann cells (31Cheng H.-L. Steinway M. Delaney C.L. Franke T.F. Feldman E.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Incubation of SH-EP/pSFFV cells with mannitol results in a time-dependent degradation of Akt (Fig.7A), which occurs later than FAK degradation. Akt degradation begins 1.5 h after mannitol treatment, and Akt expression is undetectable by 4 h. Activation of IGF-I signaling prevents the degradation of Akt (Fig.7B). 4 h of treatment with IGF-I in the absence of mannitol has no effect on the protein levels of Akt in both SH-EP/pSFFV and SH-EP/IGF-IR cells. However, mannitol treatment in SH-EP/pSFFV cells results in the degradation of Akt without affecting MAPK. IGF-I treatment or IGF-IR overexpression prevents mannitol-induced loss of Akt. Interestingly, MAPK levels are unaffected by mannitol or IGF-I treatment in both cell types. These results suggest that the modulation of Akt protein levels plays a role in mannitol-induced apoptosis. Caspases are important mediators of apoptosis (40Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and are responsible for the cleavage of FAK during apoptosis (33Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Caspases-3 and -9 are synthesized as inactive precursors that are proteolytically cleaved to generate active enzymes (41Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). We have shown that caspases are involved in neuronal apoptosis (25Delaney C.L. Russell J.W. Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27van Golen C.M. Castle V.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Russell J.W. Windebank A.J. Schenone A. Feldman E.L. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 36: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When SH-EP/pSFFV cells are treated with 300 mm mannitol, there is a time-dependent cleavage of caspases-3 and -9 (Fig.8A). This time course is similar to the time course of FAK dephosphorylation and degradation, suggesting the involvement of caspases in FAK alterations. To study the role of caspases in FAK cleavage, we used ZVAD, a general caspase inhibitor. ZVAD treatment blocks the activation of caspase-3 and also inhibits caspase-9 cleavage to some degree (Fig.8B). 50 μm ZVAD partially blocks mannitol-induced dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK (Fig.8C). ZVAD treatment also prevents mannitol-induced degradation of Akt (Fig. 8D). As in Fig. 6, mannitol treatment results in Akt degradation, and treatment with either IGF-I or ZVAD blocks this effect. Unlike the effect on FAK, ZVAD almost completely blocks the degradation of Akt. 4 h of incubation with mannitol results in cell detachment and apoptosis, and IGF-I treatment significantly prevents these events. Consistent with the effect on FAK and Akt alterations, ZVAD also inhibits mannitol-induced cell detachment and apoptosis in SH-EP/pSFFV cells (Fig. 8E). The current study investigates the effects of hyperosmotic stress induced by mannitol on cytoskeletal changes and FAK and Akt preceding apoptosis. We have shown previously that glucose and mannitol induce an apoptotic death in human neuroblastoma cells and primary neuronal cells (22Russell J.W. Feldman E.L. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Matthews C.C. Odeh H. Feldman E.L. Neuroscience. 1997; 79: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24van Golen C.M.

Physiol. 2000; 182: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Singleton J.R. Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar, 27van Golen C.M. Castle V.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SH-EP neuroblastoma cells incubated with mannitol show morphological changes typical of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, rounding up, and cell detachment, (42Mills J.C. Stone N.L. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) about 1 h after treatment. Mannitol-treated cells also lose focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, consistent with changes induced by other apoptotic signals (43van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). IGF-IR overexpression or activation prevents cell detachment, but the actin stress fibers are less organized and show dense staining at the periphery of the cells, representing active membrane ruffling. Mannitol-treated cells incubated with IGF-I and immunostained with FAK display typical features of focal complexes (smaller dot-like staining mostly at the edge of lamellipodium of the cells, considered to be the precursor of focal adhesions) rather than focal adhesions (flat, elongated, and larger than focal complexes, located mainly at the periphery of the cells) seen in control cells (8Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). FAK, an important molecule in focal adhesion formation (11Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), plays a critical role in various types of apoptosis. Inhibition of FAK signaling by microinjection of an anti-FAK antibody or antisense oligonucleotide can induce apoptosis (15Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 19Xu L.H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of FAK prevents anoikis (14Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) and apoptosis induced by ultraviolet irradiation (20Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol.

Hanks S.K. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that FAK is dephosphorylated and degraded during mannitol-induced apoptosis. FAK is cleaved during apoptosis in other systems (34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C.

Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); however, we could not detect this band, possibly due to the different cell type or antibody used. Given the importance of FAK in focal adhesion formation, mannitol-induced dephosphorylation and cleavage of FAK likely lead to cell detachment, promoting anoikis. Caspases are responsible for the cleavage of FAK and other signaling molecules during apoptosis (33Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Our current data suggest the involvement of caspases in FAK degradation during mannitol-induced apoptosis as well. The time course of caspase-3 and -9 cleavage (i.e. activation) is similar to that of FAK degradation and dephosphorylation. However, the general caspase inhibitor, ZVAD, does not completely prevent mannitol-induced caspase activation and FAK degradation, suggesting that another pathway is involved in these processes. The proteasome/ubiquitin pathway is responsible for apoptosis in other systems, and proteasomes can activate caspases (47Wojcik C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,48Orlowski R.Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The proteasome/ubiquitin pathway is activated during mannitol-induced apoptosis, and proteasome inhibitors block FAK alterations and apoptosis. 2B. Kim, unpublished observations. Therefore, multiple proteolytic pathways are likely involved in mannitol-induced FAK degradation and dephosphorylation in neuroblastoma cells. Although ZVAD partially prevents FAK degradation and apoptosis, this inhibitor has less effect on FAK dephosphorylation and detachment, similar to previous reports (43van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SH-EP cells treated for 4 h with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid display complete dephosphorylation and cell detachment with no effect on FAK degradation and apoptosis.2 Therefore, we believe that phosphorylation of FAK is required for the cells to maintain their attachment, but degradation of FAK is a prerequisite to the commitment of apoptosis. IGF-I is a strong survival factor in neuronal cells (36Feldman E.L. Sullivan K.A. Kim B. Russell J.W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with its antiapoptotic effect, IGF-I treatment inhibits mannitol-induced dephosphorylation and degradation of FAK. However, unlike SH-SY5Y cells (9Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), treatment of SH-EP cells with IGF-I alone has little effect on FAK phosphorylation or changes in cell morphology. This may be due to high basal FAK phosphorylation or low IGF-IR levels present in SH-EP cells. IGF-I treatment of SH-EP/IGF-IR cells results in increased membrane ruffling (data not shown) without detectable changes in FAK phosphorylation. We have shown that the PI3K pathway, but not the MAPK pathway, is important for the survival effect of IGF-I (25Delaney C.L. Russell J.W. Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 60: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29van Golen C.M. Schwab T.S. Woods Ignatoski K.M. Ethier S.P. Feldman E.L. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of SH-EP cells with a PI3K inhibitor completely blocks the ability of IGF-I to inhibit mannitol-induced FAK alterations. This suggests that PI3K is an upstream regulator of FAK, in contrast with previously published reports (21Sonoda Y. Matsumoto Y. Funakoshi M. Yamamoto D. Hanks S.K. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, we (9Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and others (10Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26149-26156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have shown that cytochalasin D and LY294002 or wortmannin block IGF-I-induced FAK phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma (9Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells (10Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26149-26156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PI3K also plays an important role in maintaining the cytoskeletal integrity (49Hooshmand-Rad R. Claesson-Welsh L. Wennström S. Yokote K. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.-H. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that PI3K regulates cytoskeletal structures in our system, not FAK directly. Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in many cellular responses, including glucose metabolism, apoptosis, and cell migration (39Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation or growth factor activation phosphorylates and activates Akt through PI3K (38Franke T.F.

In our laboratory, we have shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for IGF-I signaling in cell survival (25Delaney C.L. Russell J.W. Cheng H.-L. Feldman E.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4881-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). IGF-I treatment or IGF-IR transfection prevents mannitol-induced degradation of Akt. Unlike the effect on FAK, ZVAD almost completely inhibits the loss of Akt. Apoptotic signals also induce inactivation of Akt through caspase-mediated cleavage in U937 and Jurkat cell lines (35Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 56Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There are at least three caspase cleavage consensus sequences in Akt upon which caspases-3, -6, and -7 can operate (56Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 57Francois F. Grimes M.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cell detachment induces the cleavage of Akt by a death receptor-dependent pathway that results in anoikis (58Bachelder R.E. Wendt M.A. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34702-34707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have shown that mannitol treatment reduces the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein level in neuroblastoma cells (59Singleton J.R. Dixit V.M. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31791-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, Akt degradation, along with the decreased levels of Bcl-2, could accelerate mannitol-induced apoptosis. In summary, we demonstrate in this study that mannitol treatment results in FAK dephosphorylation and degradation, resulting in morphological changes. Mannitol treatment also results in the degradation of Akt. Based upon these data, we believe that mannitol induces caspase-mediated degradation of FAK, which results in cell detachment, Akt loss, and apoptosis. Activation of IGF-I signaling through the PI3K pathway prevents caspase activation and the loss of FAK, resulting in cell attachment and survival.

The MMP gene family is generally divided into four subgroups, collagenases (MMP-1, -8, and -13), gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9), stromelysins (MMP-3, -10, and -11), and membrane type (MT) MMPs (MMP-14–17). With a few exceptions, MMPs are composed of an amino-terminal prodomain, a catalytic domain containing the zinc binding active site, and a hemopexin-like carboxyl-terminal domain, which is separated from the catalytic domain by a proline-rich linker (hinge region). The length of the hinge region varies among the members of the MMP family (reviewed in Refs. 17Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar, 18Matrisian L.M.

The turnover of type I collagen by mammalian collagenases MT1-MMP and gelatinase A is considered to be an important part of connective tissue remodeling. Collagenases cleave α1(I) and α2(I) chains of triple helical type I collagen at a unique bond, generating characteristic ¼- and ¾-length fragments (22Gross J. Hay E.D. Cell Biology Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 217-258Google Scholar). Using collagen α1(I) mutants, Wuet al. (23Wu H. Byrne M.H. Stacy A. Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Jaenisch R. Krane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5888-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the conservation of the vicinal positions both upstream and downstream of the cleavage site is necessary for maintaining collagenase susceptibility. However, the means by which recognition of the triple helical collagen by the enzymes is coupled to cleavage remain speculative. It has been demonstrated that the binding of collagenases to type I collagen occur via the COOH-terminal domain, and this binding is required for the specific cleavage of type I collagen (24Murphy G.

Whether this domain is removed or replaced with that of the stromelysins, the resulting enzymes are not able to cleave type I collagen (24Murphy G. Allan J.A. Willenbrock F. Cockett M.I.

However, it has been shown that the isolated COOH-terminal domain of fibroblast collagenase (FC) (MMP-1), despite its ability to bind to collagen, cannot cleave type I collagen (24Murphy G.

Alexander C.M. Behrendsten O. Breathnach R. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7238-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) attached to the COOH-terminal domain of FC have been shown not to have type I collagenolytic activity. A further analysis of the COOH-terminal domain demonstrated that a 67 amino acid sequence (amino acid residues 259–326) consisting of the hinge region and a part of the first hemopexin-like repeat are essential for type I collagenolytic activity of neutrophil collagenase (NC) (MMP-8) (25Hirose T. Patterson C.E. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The replacement of the hinge region of NC with that of MMP-3 substantially reduced the proteolytic activity of the enzyme toward type I collagen (25Hirose T. Patterson C.E. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amino acid sequence RWTNNFREY in the catalytic domain of FC was recently identified as being involved in the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme (29Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the insertion of this sequence in MMP-3 did not render the enzyme type I collagenolytic activity (29Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that both the COOH- and NH2-terminal domains of collagenases contribute equally to their type I collagenolytic activity. Here, we have found that Gly272 in the hinge region of FC is one of the key elements required for the efficient utilization of type I collagen by the enzyme. Gly272 is located in the middle of the hinge region, suggesting that the structural flexibility of the hinge region led by Gly272 allows for the spatial cooperation between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains necessary for catalysis. Substituting Gly272 limits the flexibility of the hinge region, leading to a lack of enzyme specificity. The construction of pET/FC containing the full-length cDNA for FC has been described previously (30O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A single-site mutation was introduced in and around the hinge region (amino acid residues 262–313) of FC by PCR using pET/FC as the template. The following 5′-mutagenic primers (substituted nucleotide is underlined) were used to substitute Ser264, Asn266, Val268, Gln269, Gly272, Asn307, and Val313 with Ala, Asp, Pro, Glu, Asp, Ser, and Pro, the corresponding amino acid residues in MMP-3, respectively (Fig. 1): S264A, 5′-ATATATGGACGTGCCCAAAATCCTGTCCAG-3′; N266D, 5′-TATATGGACGTTCCCAAGATCCTGTCCAG-3′; V268P, 5′-ATATGGACGTTCCCAAAATCCTCCTGTCGAGCCC-3′; Q269E, 5′-ATATGGACGTTCCCAAAATCCTGTCGAGCCC-3′; G272D, 5′-ATATGGACGTTCCCAAAATCCTGTCCAGCCCATCGACCCACAAACC-3′; T284S, 5′-AAAGCGTGTGACAGTAAGCTAAGCTTTGAT-3′; T289S, 5′-AAAGCGTGTGACAGTAAGCTAACCTTTGATGCTATAAGTACGATT-3′; N307S, 5′-ATTGTACATGCGCACAAGTCCCTTCTACC-3′; and V313P, 5′-CCCTTCTACCCGGAACCTGAGCTCAA- TTTCAC-3′. The 3′ primer, 5′-TTTGGACTCACACCATGTGTTTTCCATTCAAATTAG-3′, that was used to construct all of the above mutations was complementary to the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA and contained a uniqueDraIII restriction site. The PCR products corresponding to S264A, N266D, V268P, Q269E, and G272D mutations were digested with MaeIII and DraIII restriction enzymes and ligated with SphI/DraIII and SphI/MaeIII fragments from pET/FC to produce the final expression vectors pET/FC/S264A, pET/FC/N266D, pET/FC/V268P, pET/FC/Q269E, and pET/FC/G272D, respectively. The pET/FC/T284S and pET/FC/T289S expression vectors were generated by digesting T284S and T289S PCR products with MaeIII and DraIII and ligating the resulting DNA fragments withBstXI/DraIII andBstXI/MaeIII DNA fragments of pET/FC. The N307S-mutagenic primer incorporated an FspI restriction site in the PCR product. Thus, pET/FC/N307S expression vector was generated by digesting the N307S PCR product with DraIII andFspI restriction enzymes and ligating the PCR fragment withSalI/DraIII and SalI/FspI DNA fragments of pET/FC. The V313P PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes DraIII and NciI (a unique restriction site at the 5′ end of the DNA fragment) and ligated withNciI/DraIII fragment from pET/FC to produce the expression vector pET/FC/V313P. To substitute Ala for Lys at position 277, the 3′-mutagenic primer (substituted nucleotide is underlined), 5′-TAGCTTACTGTCACACGCTGCTGGGGTTTG-3′, that was complementary to the nucleotides 821–850 of the FC cDNA and contained a unique MaeIII restriction site 5′ to the substituted nucleotide was used. The 5′-primer, 5′-GGGGATGCTCATTTTGATGAACATGAAAGGTGGACCAAC-3′, contained a uniqueBstXI restriction site and was complementary to the nucleotides 578–616 of the FC cDNA. The resulting 272-bp PCR product was used as a 3′ primer in the second round of PCR using pET/FC as template. The same 5′ primer used to construct all of the above mutations (264–313 mutations) was used in this reaction. The final PCR product was digested with BstXI and DraIII and finally ligated with DraIII/BstXI DNA fragment of pET/FC to produce pET/FC/K277A expression vector. All of the PCR-derived DNA for these constructs was sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were the only mutations generated by the PCR. Plasmids encoding the mutant enzymes were introduced intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and were maintained in 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cells bearing the plasmids were induced by 0.4–1.0 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant enzymes were activated with 1.0 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate in the presence of 2.0 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 4 h and purified on zinc-chelating columns as described previously (30O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Purified enzymes were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 μm ZnCl2 and stored at −20 °C until use. Thekcat/Km values for the fluorogenic peptide substrate were obtained by assaying the enzymes at 23 °C using 4 μm substrate as described previously (30O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27964-27972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The assays were conducted under the condition whereKm ≫ [S] andkcat/Km values were calculated from the following equation:kcat/Km ≅vo/[E]T[S]. To demonstrate that 4 μm substrate concentration used in the above reaction mixture was adequate to fulfill the requirements for the kinetic analysis in which Km ≫ [S], all of the enzymes were initially assayed with various concentrations (2–36 μm) of Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2 peptide. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence (λex = 328 nm, λem= 393 nm) over the first 500 s of the reaction at 23 °C. The apparent Km and Vmax values were then calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots using the Enzyme Kinetics program, version 1.0 (Trinity Software, Camton, NH). The concentrations of active enzymes, [E]T, were determined by active-site titration with the amino-terminal 14-kDa inhibitory domain of recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2-ID) (a kind gift from Dr. Harold Tschesche, Lerstuhl für Biochemie, Universitat Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany) as described previously (31O'Farrell T.J. Pourmotabbed T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The type I collagenolytic activity of the wild type and the mutant enzymes was initially determined by using soluble type I collagen as substrate. The active enzymes (0.6 μm) were incubated with 380 μg/ml triple helical native bovine type I collagen (Fluka Biochemika, Milwaukee, WI) in an assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl at 27 °C for 18 h. The reactions were then quenched by 10 mm EDTA, boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 6% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. The integrated intensities of the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen bands were determined by using an Alpha Imager 2000 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The difference between the integrated intensities of the α1(I) collagen band in the presence and in the absence of the enzyme was used to calculate the activity of the enzyme as described previously (32Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 259: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The activity of the enzymes toward type I collagen was also measured using 14C-labeled fibril type I collagen at 35 °C for 1 h as described previously (33Cawston T.E. Mercer E. Tyler J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 657: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Specific activity values for the enzymes were calculated by dividing the amount of14C-collagen degraded per hour by nanomoles of the full-length active enzyme used in the assay. The relationship between the concentration of the enzyme and the amount of collagen degraded per hour was linear. The concentrations of the full-length active enzymes were calculated by multiplying the percentages of their corresponding protein in the enzyme solution as determined by SDS-PAGE by the total protein in the solution. The total amount of the protein was calculated by the Bradford dye binding technique using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activity of the wild type and FC/G272D enzymes was determined using the fluorogenic triple helical substrate [C6-(GP-Hyp)4GPL(Mca)GPQGLRGQL(DPN)GVR(GP-HYP)4-NH2]3(a kind gift from Dr. Gregg Fields, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida Atlantic University) as described previously (34Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Chung L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Type I collagen film was prepared by plating 50 μl of 100 μg/ml collagen in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl onto the wells of XenobindTM covalent binding microwell plates (Xenopore, Saddle Brook, NJ). The films were allowed to dry at 37 °C. The wells were then washed with wash buffer, 25 mm Na2B4O7, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μm ZnCl2, 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and blocked with 300 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the wash buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed for the second time with wash buffer and incubated with various concentrations (4–20 μg/ml) of either the wild type or the FC mutants in 50 μl of wash buffer containing 67 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 17 °C. The supernatants were then removed from the wells, and the films were washed five times with wash buffer. The bound enzymes were eluted by adding 50 μl of wash buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Brij-35, and 15% (v/v) Me2SO to the wells and by incubating the plates for 1 h at 17 °C. The eluted samples (bound fractions) were then assayed for proteolytic activity (initial rate of hydrolysis) using 10 μm Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2 as described above. The assays at each applied enzyme concentration were performed in duplicate, and the initial rates were averaged. The amino acid substitutions in the crystal structure of porcine fibroblast collagenase (35Li J Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lioyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawstone T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) were made using Swiss Protein Data Bank viewer modeling system. The substitutions were made, and the energy of the resulting structure was minimized by the Biopolymer and Discover modules, respectively. Our previous experiments demonstrated that the substitution of hinge region and part of the first propeller of the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain of NC with that of MMP-3 substantially decreased type I collagenolytic activity of the enzyme (25Hirose T. Patterson C.E. Pourmotabbed T. Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To identify specific amino acid residues in this region of collagenases that might be important for enhancing their type I collagenolytic activity, a partial amino acid sequence alignment from this region of FC, NC, and MMP-3 was made (Fig. 1). Although MMP-3 binds type I collagen, it does not cleave native triple helical collagen. This alignment revealed that the conserved amino acid residues Ser264, Asn266, Val268, Gln296, Gly272, Lys277, Thr284, Thr289, Asn307, and Val313 in FC and NC have been substituted by Ala, Asp, Pro, Asp, Glu/Asp, Ala, Ser, Ser, Ser, and Pro in MMP-3, respectively. The significance of these conserved residues on the collagenolytic activity of the collagenases was studied by individually replacing these residues in FC with their corresponding residues in MMP-3. The latent wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli, activated with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, purified, and recovered as 45-kDa species (Fig.2) as expected (36Windsor L.J. Bodden M.K. Birkedal-Hansen B. Engler J.A. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26201-26207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiencies of recombinant FC and all of the mutant enzymes toward the peptide substrate Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2 were then determined at 23 °C. In this experiment, the active site of each enzyme was titrated with TIMP-2-ID, and the same amount of active enzyme was assayed. The catalytic efficiency of all of the FC mutants toward the peptide substrate was found to be essentially equal to that of FC (Table I). These data suggest that all of the enzymes were properly folded and that the general proteolytic activity of FC was not compromised by the substitutions.Table ISubstrate specificity of FC and FC mutantsEnzymeMca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH21-aThe assay was carried out at 23 °C.

Open table in a new tab Experimental details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of the wild type and FC mutants toward collagen was initially assessed using soluble type I collagen as a substrate. Because upon activation some of the 45-kDa forms converted to lower molecular mass species (Fig. 2) and only the full-length FC expressed collagenolytic activity, the amount of each of the full-length enzyme was quantified by densitometric analysis after SDS-PAGE and staining of proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. As shown in Fig.3 and Table I, all of the mutant enzymes with the exception of FC/G272D (Fig. 3, lane 7) were able to cleave type I collagen with similar specific activity to that of the wild type enzyme. FC/G272D mutant at the same concentration as FC (Fig.3, lane 7, and Tables I andII) was able to degrade only ∼13% of the soluble type I collagen. This finding was confirmed by assaying the enzyme using 14C-labeled type I collagen fibril as a substrate. FC/G272D also showed a low collagenolytic activity (∼10 μg of collagen degraded/h/pmol) toward the type I collagen fibril, whereas FC/V268P, FC/K277A, and FC/T289S had similar type I collagenolytic activity as that of FC (78–81 μg of collagen degraded/h/pmol). This finding indicated that the presence of Gly272 in the collagenase molecule is important for the type I collagenolytic activity of the enzyme. However, the Gly272 to Asp mutation did not affect the cleavage pattern of type I collagen (Fig. 3, lane 7), indicating that the low type I collagenolytic activity of the mutant was not because of a change in the specificity of cleavage sites within the collagen molecule. In addition, the digestion of gelatin by FC and FC/G272D and subsequent analysis of the products by SDS-PAGE indicated that these enzymes have similar substrate specificity.

To investigate the role of Gly272 in triple helicase activity of the enzyme, the catalytic efficiencies of FC and FC/G272D mutant toward the fluorogenic triple helical peptide substrate [C6-(GP-Hyp)4GPL(Mca)GPQGLRGQL(DPN)GVR(GP-HYP)4-NH2]3were determined at 30 °C. The catalytic efficiency of FC/G272D toward the peptide substrate (kcat/Km = 9945m−1s−1) was found to be ∼1.5 times higher than that of FC (kcat/Km = 6430m−1s−1).

Yeast copper uptake is controlled at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels.

Ctr1p is known to undergo degradation in cells exposed to high copper levels. We report that Mac1p is also required for copper-dependent Ctr1p degradation. Both mutations within a conserved copper ion binding motif, the “Cu-fist” in the Mac1p DNA-binding domain, and within a metal ion binding motif, REP-III located in the cytosolic domain of Ctr1p, cause defects in Ctr1p turnover. Furthermore, we show that the Mac1p limits intracellular copper accumulation likely by controlling Ctr1p degradation.

Yet the physiological level of copper ions must be maintained to ensure the activities of those enzymes dependent on copper as their cofactor. This concentration-governed biological nature of copper is reflected in two human diseases. One, Menkes' disease, is caused by copper deficiency. The other, Wilson's disease, is caused by copper excess (4Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that copper uptake through high affinity transporters is critical for copper homeostasis. Studies of transgenic mice show that homozygous mutations of copper transporters,Ctr1 −/−, are embryonic lethal, and the heterozygous mutation Ctr1 +/− causes profound developmental abnormalities (5Zhou B.

These findings are reminiscent of earlier observations in the model system yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast has two known high affinity copper transporters encoded by CTR1 and CTR3 (9Dancis A.

These studies support the idea that high affinity copper uptake is the mechanism by which eukaryotic organisms accumulate sufficient intracellular copper ions. A more recent study of Mac1p indicates that control of copper uptake is also critical for avoiding excessive accumulation and preventing copper toxicity. 1J. Yonkovich and Z. Zhu, submitted. Taken together, the above studies show that control of copper uptake is at the center of copper homeostasis. Hence, understanding how copper uptake is controlled will shed light on the molecular mechanism by which eukaryotic cells maintain the physiological copper level. The mechanism of copper uptake regulation in mammals is currently unknown. In yeast, copper uptake is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S.

Crooks M. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8793-8797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies have indicated that Mac1p senses two different levels of copper, perhaps the physiological and toxic levels (19Heredia J. Crooks M. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8793-8797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which Mac1p senses copper ions will be important for understanding how copper uptake is controlled. In addition to the transcriptional regulation, yeast copper uptake is also controlled at the post-translational level: Ctr1p undergoes degradation in response to high levels of copper ions (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the Ctr1p, the Ctr3p does not undergo turnover (21Peña M.M.O. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The post-translational processing of Ctr1p is thought of as a defensive means for cells to avoid excessive copper accumulation (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, how Ctr1p degradation is controlled is currently unknown. In this study, we report that Mac1p is required for Ctr1p to undergo post-translational turnover in response to increases in copper ion concentrations. The discovery suggests that, in addition to its regulatory role in the CTR1 transcription, Mac1p may also regulate the Ctr1p degradation. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were SLY2 (MATa gal1 trp1 his3 ade8 lys2–801 ura3::KanRmac1::URA3) (13Zhu Z. Labbe S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and ZY60 (MATa gal1 ade8 ctr1::ura3::KanRctr3::trp1::hisG his3 lys2–801 mac1::ura3). Strain ZY60 was generated by disrupting the TRP1 locus in strain ZY59 (MATa gal1 ade8 ctr1::ura3::KanRctr3::TRP1 his3 lys2–801 mac1::ura3) using the TRP1deletion plasmid pNKY1009 (purchased from ATCC). The plasmid was digested with EcoRI and BglII; URA3integrants were selected on growth medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura−). The TRP1 deletion strain ZY60 was then generated by selection on growth medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (22Boeje J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Strain ZY59 was constructed using the URA3deletion plasmid pJL164 (purchased from ATCC). The plasmid was digested with SpeI and XhoI and then transformed into yeast strain MPY18 (MATa gal1 ade8 ctr1::ura3::KanRctr3::TRP1 his3 lys2–801 mac1::URA3) (23Peña M.M. Koch H.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) followed by selection on the 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates. The deletions were verified by PCR. A plasmid p414GAL-CTR1myc was constructed by cloning CTR1flanked with BamHI (5′ to the start codon) andPstI (3′ to the stop codon) sites into vector p414GAL1 (a generous gift from Dennis Thiele). The BamHI andPstI restriction sites were introduced by PCR. The plasmid pCTR1-myc (generously provide by Andy Dancis) was used as template DNA for the PCR (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Mutations of REP-III (C304S, C310S, C312S, and H315S) were introduced into CTR1 by oligo-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid for REP-IIIS mutant Ctr1-Myc, p414GAL-REP-IIIS-myc, was constructed in virtually the same manner as for the p414GAL-CTR1myc. Mutations of mFist, REP-IA, REP-IIA, and REP-I+IIA were introduced intoMAC1 by oligo-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Expression plasmids pRS313-mCuFist(HA), pRS313-REP-IA(HA), pRS313-REP-IIA(HA), and pRS313-REP-I+IIA(HA) were constructed as described previously (13Zhu Z. Labbe S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmid p414GAL-CTR1myc was co-transformed with the above wild type or mutant Mac1-HAp expression plasmid into strain ZY60. Cells were grown in SC-His−-Trp− medium containing raffinose (2%), and Ctr1-Myc expression was induced by galactose (0.5%). The medium was either treated (copper-depleted) or not treated (copper-rich) with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad). Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared, and Mac1-HA2 and Ctr1-Myc were detected by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies as described previously (13Zhu Z. Labbe S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Strain ZY60 harboring plasmids pRS313 and pGAL414, pRS313 and p414GAL-CTR1myc, or pRSMac1(HA) and pGAL-CTR1myc was grown in the SC-His−-Trp− medium containing raffinose (2%) and galactose (0.5%) to early log phase (A 600 nm of 1.0) and was then treated with CuSO4 at 10 μm for 30 min or left untreated. Cells of 50 A 650 nm units were harvested and frozen at −80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed and washed twice with EDTA solution of 10 mm and subsequently washed twice with Nano-pure water. Then cells were lysed by resuspending them in the nitric acid solution (50%) and heating at 80 °C. Five duplicates were prepared for each sample. Copper concentrations of the lysates were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and calculated according to standards of known concentrations. A previous study by the Klausner group (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) reported that Ctr1p undergoes degradation at high copper levels. We have recently found that Mac1p likely senses both physiological and toxic copper levels and that inactivation of CTR1 andCTR3 gene expression is critical for yeast to defend against copper toxicity (19Heredia J. Crooks M. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8793-8797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).1 These findings prompted us to speculate that the Mac1p may also regulate Ctr1p degradation. We analyzed Ctr1p turnover in cells either expressing or not expressing Mac1-HAp. To remove the Mac1p control over CTR1transcription, expression of Ctr1p, tagged with one copy of the Myc epitope, was driven by the GAL1 promoter and detected by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody 9E10 as described previously (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We first observed that when cells were grown in the standard yeast growth medium, the Ctr1-Myc protein level in cells expressing the Mac1-HAp was drastically lower than that in cells not expressing Mac1-HAp (Fig. 1 A). We then repeated the experiment by growing the cells in medium either containing or not containing the copper-specific chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS). As shown in Fig.1 B, the Ctr1-Myc level in BCS-treated cells was much higher than in untreated cells and comparable to that of cells lacking Mac1p. These data suggest that the Ctr1-Myc level is modulated by Mac1p and that Mac1p modulates the Ctr1-Myc level in a copper-dependent fashion. We next characterized Ctr1-Myc degradation by first growing cells in copper-depleted medium and then treating them with CuSO4. The data in Fig. 1 Cshow that copper at 100 μm failed to induce Ctr1-Myc to undergo turnover in cells not expressing Mac1-HAp. In contrast, in cells expressing Mac1-HAp, the Ctr1-Myc was degraded upon exposure to the same concentration of copper ions. The data not only confirmed the previous finding by the Klausner group but also demonstrated that the Mac1p is required for Ctr1p to undergo degradation in response to high copper levels. To begin to explore how Mac1p may function in the turnover of Ctr1p, we asked whether the known copper ion-sensing motifs in Mac1p, the N-terminal Cu-fist and C-terminal REP-I and REP-II motifs, are involved. The Cu-fist motif is conserved among known copper-sensing transcription factors such as Ace1p, Amt1p, Mac1p, and Cuf1p (3Pena M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar); copper binding by this motif triggers DNA binding of Ace1p and Amt1p resulting in the transcriptional activation of metallothionein genes (27Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 307-320Crossref Google Scholar). Cells expressing a dominant mutant Mac1p, Mac1up1, carrying a single mutation of H279Q within the REP-I motif are found to be hypersensitive to copper (11Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the Cu-fist and REP-I motifs in the Mac1p likely sense two different copper levels during the transcriptional regulation of CTR1 andCTR3. 3Y. Wang and Z. Zhu, submitted. In turn, we analyzed the turnover of Ctr1-Myc in the ZY60 strain expressing either wild type Mac1p or mutant Mac1p carrying mutations within the Cu-fist, REP-I, and REP-II motifs, respectively (Fig.2 A). Cells were grown in copper-rich medium as in Fig. 1 A, and Ctr1-Myc was detected by immunoblotting. In cells expressing mutant Mac1-HAp, including Mac1up1 (11Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), REP-IA, REP-IIA, and REP-I+IIA, the Ctr1-Myc levels were the same as in the wild type cells and markedly lower than in cells expressing no Mac1p (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, in cells expressing the mutant Mac1-HAp with mutations within the Cu-fist motif, mFist, the Ctr1-Myc level was much higher than that in the wild type cells, indicative of defects in Ctr1p degradation. These results suggest that the Cu-fist motif, but not the REP-I and REP-II motifs, is important for Mac1p to function in the copper-induced degradation of Ctr1p. Previously it was reported that the Ctr1p turnover occurs at the plasma membrane in a fashion independent of endocytosis (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the cytosolic domain of Ctr1p might be involved in protein-protein interaction with its cognate protease. Since copper triggers the Ctr1p degradation, we further speculated that the possible protein-protein interaction might be dependent on copper binding, a mechanism known to operate in copper trafficking in yeast (25Casareno R.L. Waffoner D. Fgitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Schmidt P.J. Kunst C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). By visual examination, a typical metal ion binding motif, CX 5CXCX 2H, was identified within the cytosolic domain of Ctr1p (Fig.3 A) (9Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This motif spans from residue Cys304 to His315 and resembles a shortened Mac1p REP motif; because of this similarity, we named it REP-III. To ascertain whether or not this motif plays a role in the Ctr1p degradation, we mutated the corresponding cysteine and histidine residues to serines (REP-IIIS) (Fig. 3 A). We then analyzed this mutant Ctr1p by growing cells in the copper-rich medium as described above in Figs. 1 and 2. In cells not expressing Mac1-HAp, the levels of both wild type and REP-IIIS mutant Ctr1-Myc were comparable to each other (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the REP-IIIS level was significantly higher than that of the wild type Ctr1-Myc in cells expressing Mac1-HAp. Thus, it appears that the mutation stabilized Ctr1-Myc protein, suggesting that the potential copper binding motif REP-III is important for Ctr1p degradation. To ascertain the biological significance of Mac1p-directed turnover of Ctr1p, we measured copper accumulation by three isogenic ZY60 strains harboring different plasmid combinations: 1) pRS313 and pGAL414 (ctr1Δ mac1Δ), 2) pRS313 and pGAL-CTR1myc (CTR1 mac1Δ), and 3) pRSMac1(HA) and pGAL-CTR1myc (CTR1 MAC1). Intracellular copper accumulations by these cells were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under low copper conditions (i.e. no exogenous CuSO4 was added), all cells accumulated low amounts of copper ions (Fig. 4). In the presence of 10 μm CuSO4, the accumulation increased 2.7-fold for the ctr1Δ mac1Δ, 10.5-fold for the CTR1 mac1Δ, and 3.9-fold for the CTR1 MAC1cells (Fig. 4). First, the data show that high affinity copper uptake by Ctr1p accounted for 90% of copper accumulation. Second, cells expressing Mac1p (CTR1 MAC1) accumulated ∼28% of copper ions amassed by the cells expressing no Mac1p (CTR1 mac1Δ). These data show that Mac1p limits intracellular copper accumulation possibly by controlling Ctr1p degradation. We have investigated how the turnover of a high affinity copper transporter, Ctr1p, is controlled in response to high copper levels. We found that the copper-induced degradation of Ctr1p occurs only when yeast express Mac1p, a copper-sensing transcription factor known to regulate the transcription of CTR1 (12Labbe S. Zhu Z.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, we have also provided evidence demonstrating that Mac1p limits intracellular copper accumulation. Thus, it seems that Mac1p plays a critical role in balancing intracellular copper concentration by regulating copper transporter gene expression at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. How does Mac1p function in the degradation of Ctr1p? Ctr1p degradation occurs at the plasma membrane (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), while Mac1p is localized in the nucleus (18Serpe M. Joshi A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29211-29219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism of Mac1p controlling Ctr1p turnover is that the Mac1p activates a gene(s) encoding the protease(s) that degrades Ctr1p. This possibility is consistent with our finding that Ctr1p degradation is defective in cells expressing the mutant Mac1p carrying mutations within the Cu-fist motif. The defect may be due to the inability of this mutant Mac1p, mFist, to express the necessary protease(s). We have found that the mutant fails to activate the transcription of CTR1 and CTR3.3Currently the protease for Ctr1p degradation is unknown. DNA microarray studies by the Winge group (28Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have identified two new genes, YFR055w and YJL217w, that are activated by Mac1p in addition to the previous known target genes CTR1, CTR3, FRE1, and FRE7. FRE1 and FRE7 encode plasma membrane reductases important in iron uptake and are believed to be required for copper uptake as well (14Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 29Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadkis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). YFR055w shares homology with a family of trans-sulfuration enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis; the function of YJL217w is currently unknown (28Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whether or not YFR055w and YJL217w are involved in Ctr1p degradation has yet to be determined. Another possible scenario is that Mac1p helps to recruit a pre-existing protease(s) or that Mac1p acts as a protease itself. Since the Ctr1p degradation occurs at the plasma membrane, either mechanism would require Mac1p to be present in the cytosol. Currently there is no indication that Mac1p is localized in cytoplasm. However, a truncated Mac1p (residues 1–70) was found in the cytosol (18Serpe M. Joshi A. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29211-29219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Mac1p itself underwent degradation in response to high copper levels (13Zhu Z. Labbe S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that Mac1p undergoes phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation is required for Mac1p to bind to DNA (19Heredia J. Crooks M. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8793-8797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event may affect cellular localization of Mac1p, and the unphosphorylated Mac1p may be present in the cytosol to function in Ctr1p degradation. A precedent of such a mechanism is that the nuclear translocation of transcription factor NF-κB is regulated by phosphorylation (24Drier E.A. Huang L.H. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Currently whether or not phosphorylation affects Mac1p localization is not known, and there is no indication that Mac1p has proteolytic activity. The finding that Mac1p is required for Ctr1p degradation represents an important advance in understanding copper homeostasis, especially how copper uptake is controlled in eukaryotic cells. Since high affinity copper transporters are highly conserved (5Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 6Lee J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), this work may serve as a framework for understanding how copper uptake is controlled in higher organisms such as humans. The current study also raises the possibility that Ctr1p degradation involves metal ion-Ctr1p interaction given that a mutation of the putative metal ion binding motif REP-III stabilized Ctr1p. This interaction may transfer copper signals in the Mac1p-dependent degradation of Ctr1p. Although the exact mechanism of Mac1p functioning in Ctr1p turnover has yet to be elucidated, the current work, nonetheless, uncovers an unprecedented mechanism in which a transcription factor functions at transcriptional as well as post-translational levels in the control of its target gene expression.

Hum. Pathol. 1987; 18: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This recessiveX-linked bleeding disorder is known as hemophilia A. The adequate treatment of this disease relies on infusions of human FVIII concentrates. However, a serious treatment complication is the development of a humoral immune response to FVIII in ∼25% of patients with hemophilia A. These antibodies (Abs), also called inhibitors, block the FVIII procoagulant activity and complicate seriously the medical care of the patients by precluding further FVIII injections (2Lusher J.M. Blatt P.M. Penner J.A. Aledort L.M. Levine P.H. White G.C. Warrier A.I. Whitehurst D.A. Blood. 1983; 62: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This immune response is not only polyclonal but also heterogeneous in its specificity (3Gilles J.G. Arnout J. Vermylen J. Saint-Remy J.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, epitope mapping studies have shown that inhibitors recognize restricted binding sites, predominantly on the A2, C2, and A3domains on the FVIII molecule (4Scandella D. Vox Sang. 1999; 77 Suppl. 1: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The incidence of inhibitor occurrence in hemophilia A patients is difficult to estimate and can vary from 18 to 28% (5Kreuz W. Escuriola-Ettingshausen C. Martinez-Saguer I. Gungor T. Kornhuber B. Vox Sang. 1996; 70: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This variation can be the result of a number of parameters, which needs to be considered, including quantitative criteria of inhibitor dosages, the elapsed time from the first apparition, the origin, the viral inactivation procedure applied, the purity of the administered product, and, of course, the patient. A number of different therapeutic approaches have been developed to circumvent complications arising from inhibitors, such as the administration of porcine FVIII, which is less antigenic than its human counterpart (6Hay C.R. Laurian Y. Vox Sang. 1996; 70: 68-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the administration of activated human FVII to bypass the intrinsic pathway (7Hedner U. Glazer S. Falch J. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1993; 7: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the activation of the coagulation cascade by using prothrombin complex concentrates (8Lusher J.M. Arkin S. Abildgaard C.F. Schwartz R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although these treatments have greatly improved the medical management of the disease, the ultimate goal for therapy, the specific neutralization of the immune response to FVIII, has not yet been achieved. As this complication of hemophilia A is largely antibody-mediated, we have applied a novel approach based on blocking the deleterious activity of these Abs by low molecular weight peptide decoys mimicking epitopes recognized by anti-FVIII Abs with a view to restore a normal procoagulant activity. For the selection of peptide decoys, an approach based on phage peptide display was adopted (9Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar). This technology has already been successfully applied in the area of thrombosis and hemostasis (10Arza B. Felez J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In particular, a number of researchers have used phages displaying single chain variable fragment to study the molecular properties and functional characteristics of human anti-FVIII Abs (11Voorberg J. van den Brink E.N. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nord et al.(12Nord K. Nord O. Uhlen M. Kelley B. Ljungqvist C. Nygren P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) used phages displaying ligands, which were able to bind to human FVIII to isolate them by affinity chromatography. However, to our knowledge, the phage peptide display technique has never been used to isolate peptides that are able to neutralize the inhibitory activity of anti-FVIII Abs. This methodology based on the display of random peptides fused to the minor (pIII) or major (pVIII) coat proteins of filamentous phages allows the identification of new molecules that influence protein-protein interactions as, for example, the antigen-antibody interaction. Such libraries allow to isolate mimotopes, i.e. peptides mimicking the binding properties of the natural antigen but with no apparent sequence homology with the antigen (13Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The mimicking potential of the peptides is broad as mimotopes of linear, conformational, and even non-proteinaceous epitopes have been reported (14Smith G.P. Petrenko V.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility of disrupting the interaction between the FVIII molecule and its inhibitors by peptide decoys to restore the procoagulant activity of FVIII, a model system was investigated, namely, the well characterized murine inhibitor mAb ESH8 (15Scandella D. Gilbert G.E. Shima M. Nakai H. Eagleson C. Felch M. Prescott R. Rajalakshmi K.J. Hoyer L.W. Saenko E. Blood. 1995; 86: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used this mAb to screen four different libraries displaying foreign peptides at the surface of the major coat protein, pVIII. We present here evidence both in vitro and in vivo that mimotopes of the C2 domain can efficiently neutralize the inhibitory activity of mAb ESH8 and as such could represent an efficient method for the treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitory antibodies. The different M13 phage libraries used expressing 15-mer (X15), 30-mer (X30), 17-mer including a fixed cysteine residue (XCX15), and 12-mer peptides including two fixed cysteine residues (XCX8CX,) were all described by Bonnycastle et al. (16Bonnycastle L.L. Mehroke J.S. Rashed M. Gong X. Scott J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 747-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. J. Scott (Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). MAb ESH8 was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT) and has been characterized previously (15Scandella D. Gilbert G.E. Shima M. Nakai H. Eagleson C. Felch M. Prescott R. Rajalakshmi K.J. Hoyer L.W. Saenko E. Blood. 1995; 86: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pannings were performed as described by Smith (9Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar). mAb ESH8 was coated onto a polystyrene Petri dish (10 × 1.5 cm, Falcon 1029) overnight at 4 °C at a concentration of 5 μg/ml for the first two pannings and a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml for the last panning in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.6, on a shaking platform. For the first panning, 5 × 1012 transducting units of each library were incubated with the adsorbed mAb. After incubation, unbound phages were washed, and bound phages were removed by acidic elution. Eluted phages were then used to infect Escherichia coli K91 cells. After three rounds of enrichment, individual phage clones were isolated and further analyzed (17Ferrieres G. Villard S. Pugniere M. Mani J.C. Navarro-Teulon I. Rharbaoui F. Laune D. Loret E. Pau B. Granier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ELISA microtiter plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml ESH8 or control mAbs in 100 mmNaHCO3, pH 8.6, overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and then blocked with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 2% nonfat dried milk (w/v) for 1 h at 37 °C. A mixture of 50 μl of a phage dilution and 50 μl of blocking buffer then was added to each well. Phage particles were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Binding was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer. After 1 h at 37 °C and washing, color was developed by adding the peroxidase substrate. The resulting absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an automated microtiter plate reader (Dynatech MR 5000). The buffers used were the same as those described above. ELISA plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml ESH8 overnight at 4 °C and then washed and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C. Phages at 1012 transducting units/ml and FVIII at increasing concentrations were incubated together for 2 h at 37 °C. For the control, the phages were incubated with an irrelevant protein, bovine serum albumin. The binding of the phages was detected by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody incubated 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting absorbance was measured at 450 nm as described above. For each phage, ∼9 μg of single-stranded DNA was purified using the QIA prep Spin M13 protocol (Qiagen). Sequencing reactions were done by the dideoxy chain termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using the Abi Prism kit (PE Applied Biosystems) with ABI PRISM 377 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primer 5′-TCGGCAAGC TCTTTTAGG-3′ was used for annealing. The different phage sequences as well as overlapping peptides of 15 and 25 amino acids frameshifted by one residue representing the C2domain of FVIII were prepared by the Spot technique. The general protocol has been described previously (19Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were obtained from Intavis (Bergish Gladbach, Germany). Fmoc amino acids and N-hydroxybenzotriazole were obtained from Novabiochem. An ASP222 robot (Abimed) was used for the coupling steps. All of the peptides were acetylated at their N terminus. After the peptide sequences had been assembled, the side-chain protecting groups were removed by trifluoroacetic acid treatment. The set of membrane-bound peptides was probed by incubation with ESH8 (5 μg/ml). Its binding to peptides was detected by using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 with its substrate, BCIP-MTT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma), which gives a blue precipitate on peptide spots recognized by ESH8. A plot of spot intensities was obtained with the Scion Image software after scanning the membrane. The membrane was further treated to remove precipitated dye and bound antibodies and was reused (19Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). All of the soluble peptides were synthesized on an Abimed AMS422 synthesizer by Fmoc chemistry (20Gausepohl H. Boulin C. Kraft M. Frank R.W. Pept. Res. 1992; 5: 315-320PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were deprotected and released from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid treatment in the presence of appropriate scavengers. Peptides were lyophilized, and their purity assessed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. When necessary, peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to reach a purity greater than 90%. ESH8 (0.05 μg/ml) was preincubated in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, 2% nonfat dried milk (w/v) with synthetic peptides at increasing concentrations overnight at 4 °C. ELISA plates were coated with 1 μg/ml recombinant FVIII overnight at 4 °C in PBS. Plates were washed and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture of ESH8 and synthetic peptides was incubated 2 h at 37 °C. mAb binding was revealed by adding a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:3000 for 1 h at 37 °C. The resulting absorbance was measured at 490 nm after the addition of 50 μl of 4 n H2SO4. The reference absorbance was obtained with the incubation of ESH8 alone. This assay was based on the Bethesda assay (21Kasper C.K. Pool J.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 875-876PubMed Google Scholar) with the Nijmegen modification. ESH8 at a fixed concentration giving 50% FVIII activity inhibition was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the different peptides at various concentrations diluted with 0.05 m imidazole buffer, pH 7.3. Equal volumes (250 μl) of this sample and normal plasma buffered with 0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.4, were mixed together and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. One-stage FVIII potency assays were then carried out. The inhibitory activity was read in Bethesda unit/ml from a semilogarithmic plot representing the correlation between residual FVIII activity (logarithmic) and inhibitor activity (linear). A minimum of three dilutions was made for each condition. This assay is a modification of that carried out by Pitney and Dacie (22Pitney W.R. Dacie J.V. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.). 1953; 6: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Normal platelet-poor plasma was used as substrate. 375 μl of this normal platelet-poor plasma substrate was added to a 100-μl preincubated solution of ESH8 (175 nm) mixed with either Tris borate saline buffer (control) or with a 1000 molar excess of the different peptides. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of 80 μl of FIXa (14 nm) and further incubated for 1.5 min at 37 °C. To this mixture, 400 μl of phospholipid (3.1 μg/ml) and 400 μl of CaCl2 (7.8 mm) were then added to start the reaction. At different time intervals, 50-μl aliquots were then removed and placed in 200 μl of fibrinogen in cups on a Deca coagulometer (Diagnostic Grifols S.A., Barcelona, Spain). The clotting times were then converted into thrombin units by use of a α-thrombin standard curve. The peak thrombin level and the time taken to reach half-maximal (t12max) coagulation were deduced from the thrombin generation curves. The peptides were incubated for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24 h at 37 °C at 300 μm in cell culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Following incubation, the samples (150 μl) were centrifuged for 8 min at 11,000 rpm through an ultrafiltration membrane (10 kDa, Amicon Microcon) to remove serum proteins. 100 μl aliquots of the filtrate were then analyzed by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and quantified. The FVIII knock-out mice used here were as described previously (23Bi L. Lawler A.M. Antonarakis S.E. High K.A. Gearhart J.D. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 24Bi L. Sarkar R. Naas T. Lawler A.M. Pain J. Shumaker S.L. Bedian V. Kazazian H.H., Jr. Blood. 1996; 88: 3446-3450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Singh I. Smith A. Vanzieleghem B. Collen D. Burnand K. Saint-Remy J. Jacquemin M. Blood. 2002; 99: 3235-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All of the mice were used in groups of three individuals. 0.5 IU of human FVIII (Kogenate, Bayer Inc., Berkeley, CA) diluted to 100 μl in physiological medium was injected in the tail vein. A blood sample obtained by cardiac puncture after 15 min was taken, and the concentration of FVIII was evaluated in a chromogenic assay (Dade Behring). A group of mice was injected in the tail with 0.25 μg of ESH8 followed 30 min later by an injection of 0.5 IU of FVIII. Preliminary experiments had demonstrated that this amount of ESH8 was sufficient to inhibit 80% FVIII activity. Lastly, ESH8 was preincubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg of peptide 46 or an irrelevant peptide before injection in the tail vein, and the residual FVIII activity was determined as described above. To identify peptide binding to mAb ESH8, we screened four different phage libraries, two of which expressed linear peptides of either 15 (X15) or 30 amino acids (X30), whereas the other two phage libraries displayed peptides including either one or two fixed cysteines and whose sizes were 17 (XCX15) or 12 amino acids (XCX8CX). These random peptides are fused to the pVIII coat protein of filamentous phage. A significant enrichment for phage binding to the target Ab was obtained after three rounds of panning on the immobilized mAb ESH8. Three hundred phage clones were randomly picked from the third round of selection and were checked by ELISA for their ability to bind mAb ESH8. The specificity of the signal was tested by evaluating their reactivity on mAb ESH4 (15Scandella D. Gilbert G.E. Shima M. Nakai H. Eagleson C. Felch M. Prescott R. Rajalakshmi K.J. Hoyer L.W. Saenko E. Blood. 1995; 86: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another anti-C2 mAb, or an anti-Troponin I mAb of the same isotype, mAb 11E12 (26Larue C. Defacque-Lacquement H. Calzolari C., Le Nguyen D. Pau B. Mol. Immunol. 1992; 29: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thirty positive clones giving ELISA signals at least four times higher than background were further characterized. All of them bound to mAb ESH8 in a dose-dependent manner and in a specific way, because none of them cross-reacted with each of the control mAbs. The results obtained with the most reactive phage clone are shown in Fig.1A. This phage was further used in a competition experiment with FVIII (Fig. 1B). FVIII competed with the phage for mAb ESH8 binding in a dose-dependent manner with a IC50 of 4 μg/ml at 1011 phages/ml. Reciprocally, the clone was able to inhibit FVIII binding to mAb ESH8. However, because of limitation in the available quantity of phages, no complete inhibition curve could be obtained (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that phage peptides specifically recognizing mAb ESH8 have been obtained. The phage DNA coding for foreign peptide was sequenced. The deduced peptide sequences are shown in Table I. A sequence analysis revealed striking features. Despite exhaustive screening of four phage peptide libraries, all of the selected peptides originated only from the dodecapeptide cysteine-constrained library (XCX8CX), suggesting that both the primary sequence and the conformational context in which the sequence is presented are critical for binding. From the thirty selected clones, only seven distinct sequences were obtained with six peptides sharing the consensus motif GKTXL. These four invariant amino acids suggested that they might be important for binding either by providing residues contacting mAb ESH8 or by participating in the appropriate peptide folding. A closer inspection of the six related sequences revealed that the second position in the loop was exclusively occupied by a hydrophobic residue, a valine (3 times), a threonine (2 times), or a leucine (1 time). The third position in the loop corresponded to two aromatic residues, tyrosine or phenylalanine. Consequently, the final consensus motif could be the following:XCX(V/T/L)(Y/F)GKTXLCX withX being any amino acids. The seventh sequence (YCNPSIGDKNCR, peptide 73) is totally distinct from the others. To assess whether the selected peptides could still be recognized by mAb ESH8 out of phage context, they were synthesized on a cellulose membrane by the Spot technique. All of the sequences were recognized by mAb ESH8, suggesting that the binding activity was an intrinsic property of the peptide (Fig. 2A). In this format, the unique sequence, YCNPSIGDKNCR (peptide 73), as well as the sequences ECIVYGKTALCT (peptide 46) and QCQTFGKTMLCT (peptide 47) were the most reactive.Table ISequences of peptides isolated after screening of phage librariesThe two cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bridge are shown in italics and the consensus motif is shown in boldface.1-aNumber of identical sequences found.

To identify peptide residues critical for binding to mAb ESH8, a mutational analysis based on the Spot technique was performed. A set of peptides was generated in which each residue of the lead sequence was replaced in turn by each one of the other nineteen naturally occurring amino acids. Fig. 2B shows the results on the analysis conducted on peptide 46, ECIVYGKTALCT. The four conserved residues, Gly, Lys, Thr, and Leu, of the consensus motif appeared important functionally and/or structurally as any substitution totally abrogated the binding. Similarly, the substitution of the two cysteines by two alanines or serines resulted in a complete loss of reactivity, underlying the possible importance of the disulfide bridge for binding. With regards to the second position, only the amino acid with hydrophobic properties (Ile, Leu, Val, Met, Trp, Tyr, and Thr) was tolerated, and a phenyl functionality at the third position was crucial because no substitution even by tryptophan was allowed. The same reactivity profile was obtained with the five other related sequences (data not shown). However, the same study conducted on the sequence YCNPSIGDKNCR (peptide 73) showed that the critical amino acids were isoleucine, glycine, aspartic acid, lysine, and the last asparagine residue as well as the two cysteines (data not shown). The sequence alignment between the C2 domain of FVIII and the consensus motif indicated a putative three residue homology (2234FKT2237) in the sequence QVDFQKTMKV (residues 2231–2240) of the C2 domain (Table I). By inspecting the three-dimensional structure of the C2 domain (27Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), these three residues appeared to belong to an exposed loop, which faces residues 2267DGHQ2270 (Fig.3A). On the other hand, although peptide 73 presented no apparent homology with the FVIII sequence, we observed possible similarities between its sequence, YCNPSIGDKNCR, and the sequence 2267DGHQ2270 of the C2 domain. The aspartic acid and the glycine residues were present in both of them. His2269 can be replaced by conservative substitution with lysine and Gln2270 with asparagine. Therefore, it is possible that peptide 73 functionally mimicked the region 2267DGHQ2270 of FVIII, a region that is close to residues 2234FKT2237 in the three-dimensional structure of the C2 domain (Fig.3B). We postulate that the mAb ESH8 epitope is discontinuous and made up of two antigenic determinants represented by the two selected sequences (Fig. 3B). Another observation strengthens this hypothesis. Epitope mapping studies using overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the whole sequence of the C2domain gave no positive result, suggesting that mAb ESH8 recognized a conformational epitope (data not shown). However, when 25-mer peptides were used instead, an epitope with two components was uncovered,i.e. EFLISSSQDGHQWTLFFQNGK (residues 2259–2279) and KEWLQVDFQKTMKVT (residues 2227–2241) (Fig. 3A). Each one of these components contained the regions (underlined) we postulated as constituting the mAb ESH8 epitope. The seven sequences were chemically synthesized in a soluble form and tested for their ability to inhibit the interaction of mAb ESH8 with FVIII in ELISA. To this end, the binding of mAb ESH8 to FVIII was examined in the presence of increasing amounts of specific or unrelated peptides. As shown in Fig.4A, the different peptides derived from the phage display selection efficiently inhibited the binding of mAb ESH8 to FVIII in a dose-dependent manner, which was not the case for an irrelevant peptide. At a concentration of ∼10 μm, all of the six peptides were able to inhibit 50% mAb ESH8 binding, and complete inhibition was obtained at a concentration higher than 100 μm. Therefore, these results suggest that the different peptides derived from the phage display selection mimicked the C2 domain for its binding properties to mAb ESH8. The capacity of peptides to neutralize the inhibitory activity of mAb ESH8 was measured in two different functional tests. First, in a modified Bethesda assay (21Kasper C.K. Pool J.G. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 875-876PubMed Google Scholar) in which mAb ESH8 was used at a concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of FVIII cofactor activity, the peptides were all able to neutralize mAb ESH8 inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner with complete neutralization achieved by peptides 46 and 47 when used in a 106 molar excess, corresponding to a final concentration of 200 μm, over mAb ESH8 (Fig. 4B). The neutralization was specific, because an irrelevant peptide had no measurable activity in the same range of concentrations (Fig. 4B). The peptides by themselves had a minimal effect in the assay (data not shown). Interestingly, when the test was repeated with a concentration of mAb ESH8 giving 70% inhibition of FVIII activity, complete neutralization was still reached by using a 106 molar excess of peptides 46 and 47. These peptide properties were confirmed in a second functional assay based on thrombin generation (TG). Fig. 5shows the TG profiles of normal platelet-poor plasma in the absence and presence of mAb ESH8. A lag phase was observed in the presence of mAb ESH8, although the peak thrombin produced remained very similar to the profile obtained in absence of mAb ESH8. The inhibition of FVIII by mAb ESH8 gave a t12max value of 220 s compared with the t12max value of 116 s for normal plasma alone (Fig. 5). When this test was repeated with mAb ESH8 that had been preincubated with the various peptides, the inhibition of the TG profile was corrected by all of the peptides with the exception of the control peptide, which showed only a slight correction of the lag phase. This finding suggests that neutralization of the inhibitory activity of mAb ESH8 by peptides 45, 46, 47, and 48 is indeed of physiological relevance. Based on these in vitro experiments, a potential application of such peptides for neutralizing FVIII inhibitor Abs in vivo was considered. We first assessed the stability of peptides 46 and 73 upon incubation in 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for various lengths of time using high pressure liquid chromatography. No degradation was observed for either p"

In the initial report, bakers' yeast Pex3p was suggested to represent an integral component of the peroxisomal membrane, containing one membrane-spanning region that exposes the N terminus of the protein into the organellar matrix. Biochemically, HpPex3p behaved like an integral membrane protein as it was resistant toward high salt and carbonate treatment. However, urea fully removed Pex3p from the membrane under conditions in which the integral membrane protein Pex10p was resistant to this treatment. Additional experiments, including protease protection assays and pre-embedding labeling experiments on purified organellar fractions from cells that produced Pex3ps carrying Myc epitopes at various selected locations in the protein, revealed that invariably all Myc tags were accessible for externally added proteases and antibodies, independent of the presence of detergents. Also, overproduction of Pex3p failed to demonstrate the typical integral membrane protein structures in fracture faces of freeze-fractured peroxisomes. Taken together, our data suggest that HpPex3p does not span the peroxisomal membrane but instead is tightly associated to the cytosolic face of the organelle where it may be present in focal protein clusters.

Peroxisomes are recognized as a class of versatile organelles that play an essential role in the cellular metabolism in all eukaryotes, including humans (for reviews, see Refs.1Gould S.J. Valle D. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar and 2Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 22-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In yeasts, peroxisomes are predominantly involved in the primary metabolism of specific carbon and/or nitrogen sources used for growth (3van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 502-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the past few years, we have isolated various peroxisome-deficient (pex) mutants of the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha and cloned 16 of the corresponding genes (4Veenhuis M. Salomons F.A. van der Klei I.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 51: 584-600Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported the cloning and partial characterization of one of these genes, PEX3, which encodes a 52-kDa protein essential for peroxisome biogenesis, and showed that Pex3p plays a key role in the biogenesis and maintenance of the peroxisomal membrane (5Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A.K.W. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The crucial importance of Pex3p in peroxisome biogenesis is underlined by the absence of peroxisomal membrane remnants (“ghosts”) in a pex3deletion strain. A comparison of the putative topologies reported for Pex3p homologues from several organisms shows remarkable differences. For most of the known Pex3p homologues, the N terminus of the protein was shown to reside in the peroxisomal matrix, whereas the C terminus protrudes into the cytosol. On the other hand, Ghaedi et al.(6Ghaedi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Matsuzono Y. Fujiki Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2085-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) recently reported on the topology of Rattus norvegicusPex3p, which exposes both N and C termini into the cytosol. In HpPex3p, a short stretch of positively charged amino acid residues located at the N terminus of the protein (Arg11-X-Lys-Lys-Lys15) may play a role in sorting of the protein (7Baerends R.J.S.

Comparable signals were observed in Pex3ps of other organisms as well as in ScPex15p (8Wiemer E.A.C. Luers G.H. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Veenhuis M. Subramani S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, HpPex3p also contains a sequence that resembles the peroxisomal targeting signal for membrane proteins (mPTS) presented for PMP47 ofCandida boidinii (10Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The function of this sequence is not yet clear; however, proper sorting requires additional information rather than just the positively charged amino acids 11–15. This was clear from experiments that demonstrated that the first 37 N-terminal amino acids were capable of efficiently targeting a reporter protein to the peroxisomal membrane (5Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A.K.W. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol.

These data lend support to the view that the endoplasmic reticulum may play a role in targeting of HpPex3p. In the course of our studies to further delineate the precise function of HpPex3p in peroxisome biogenesis, we obtained evidence that the topology of the protein may deviate from that proposed for its orthologue in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Further understanding of the role of HpPex3p is critically dependent on the detailed understanding of the insertion of the protein in the membrane. This prompted us to study the topology of HpPex3p in more detail, using various methods. The combined results, which suggested that HpPex3p is tightly associated to the cytosolic face of the peroxisomal membrane, are presented in this study.

Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The constructed strains were designated as listed in Table I. All Myc-tagged Pex3p proteins functionally complemented the methanol utilization-deficient pex3deletion strain, indicating that they were normally functional as WT1 Pex3p. A H. polymorpha strain in which the complete open reading frame of the PEX8 gene was deleted was constructed as follows. First, a 4.5-kb NheI (Klenow-treated)-XbaI genomic fragment, containing thePEX8 gene (16Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was cloned in pBluescript II KS+ digested with SmaI-XbaI (resulting in pBS-PEX8). Furthermore, a 2.3-kb BamHI (Klenow-treated) genomic fragment, containing the URA3 gene (17Merkelbach A. Godecke S. Janowitz Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 40: 361-364PubMed Google Scholar), was inserted into SmaI-digested pBluescript II SK+, resulting in pBS-URA3 (insert in two orientations). Into pBS-URA3-ori1, cut with SalI (partially) and PstI, a 0.9-kbSalI-PstI fragment, containing the 3′-untranslated region of the PEX8 gene, was inserted, which was amplified by PCR using the primers RB24 and RB25 (Table II) and plasmid pBS-PEX8 as template, resulting in pHOR36. Subsequently, a 1.6-kb 5′-untranslated region of the PEX8gene was amplified by PCR using the primers reverse and RB23, and pBS-PEX8 as template, cut with HindIII (Klenow-treated)/BglII, and inserted into pHOR36 digested with NotI (Klenow-treated)/BglII, resulting in pHOR37. Finally, a 3.8-kb linear DNA fragment, containing theURA3 gene flanked by PEX8 upstream and downstream sequences, was isolated from pHOR37 using BamHI andSalI digestion. This DNA fragment was used to transformH. polymorpha NCYC495 [leu1.1 ura3] cells; transformants were selected for uracil prototrophy and inability to grow on methanol (Mut−). One Mut− strain (designated RBG35) was selected that harbored the expected chromosomal alterations, as determined by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Pex8p was extended at its C terminus with the Myc epitope by site-directed mutagenesis using primers Npex8 and Cmycpex8 (Table II). pHRP2 (16Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), containing the PEX8 open reading frame, was used as template. After subcloning, the PCR fragment was checked by sequence analysis. The amplified 2-kb fragment was cloned as aBamHI/XhoI fragment intoBamHI/SalI-digested pHIPX4-PAS3 (15Kiel J.A.K.W. Keizer-Gunnink I. Krause T. Komori M. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), resulting in pHIPX4-CmycPex8. In this construct, the chimericPEX8 gene is under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter (P AOX ). SphI-linearized pHIPX4-CmycPex8 was used to transform the PEX8 deletion strain. Leu+/Mut+ transformants were selected, and proper insertion of the construct into the P AOX locus was verified by Southern blot analysis (results not shown). The regained ability of the transformants to grow on methanol-containing media shows that the Pex8p-Myc fusion protein is fully functional. A strain harboring a single copy of the PEX8-Mycfusion (Δpex8::P AOX PEX8·C-Myc) was selected for use in this study. An H. polymorpha wild type strain was constructed in which the endogenous PEX3 promoter regulates the synthesis of the reporter protein Pex3p-eGFP. To this end, a 7.2-kbNotI-MluI (both Klenow-treated) fragment of pFEM152 (47Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Ehrmann M. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36501-36507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was self-ligated, resulting in pHOR46. This plasmid contains only the 3′-end ofPEX3 encoding codons 157–457. Finally, to obtain a stable strain expressing PEX3·GFP behind P PEX3 , H. polymorpha NCYC495 [leu1.1] cells were transformed with StuI-linearized pHOR46. Transformants were selected for leucine prototrophy. Correct integration into the PEX3 locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). A single copy integrant was selected for further analysis and designated RBG46. A WT strain expressing a truncated version of Pex3p, lacking the N-terminal 50 amino acids, was constructed by introducing aBamHI site in front of codon 50 of the PEX3 gene using primer KN69. The resulting PCR product was cloned as aBamHI/SalI fragment, which resulted in plasmid pFEM193, which expresses a fusion of ΔN50 PEX3to GFP under the control of P AOX . Linearized pFEM193 was used to transform H. polymorpha NCYC495 [leu1.1] cells as described above. A double copy integrant, designated HF250, was selected for further analysis.

Veenhuis M. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Protease inhibitors were omitted when organellar fractions were used for protease protection assays. Protease protection assays were performed by incubating organellar fractions (100 μg of protein) with various concentrations of proteinase K for 30 min on ice in the absence or presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The proteolytic activity was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The behavior of HpPex3p upon extraction of organellar fractions by different reagents was analyzed essentially as described (9Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (22Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar) were carried out as described. Blots were decorated using the chromogenic nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT-BCIP) or chemiluminescent (POD) Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using specific polyclonal rabbit antibodies against various H. polymorphaperoxisomal proteins or monoclonal mouse α-Mycantibodies. Whole cells were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as described (16Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections of Unicryl-embedded cells using specific polyclonal antibodies against various peroxisomal proteins or monoclonal α-Mycantibodies and gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies (16Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Pre-embedding labeling experiments were performed on 30,000 ×g organellar pellets prepared from homogenized spheroplasts of methanol-grown cells. These pellets, which predominantly contain mitochondria and peroxisomes, were incubated without further treatment with α-Myc or α-Pex3p antibodies. Subsequently, the samples were collected by centrifugation, washed, and incubated with secondary gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies followed by fixation in glutaraldehyde and OsO4 and embedding in Epon 812 resin (23Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I.J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In freeze-etch experiments, methanol-grown cells were frozen in liquid propane and freeze-fractured in a Balzer's freeze-etch unit essentially according to previously described methods (24Moor H. Z. Zellforsch. Mikrosk. Anat. 1964; 63: 546-580Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Also, lysed spheroplasts of wild type cells were fixed in 4.5% formaldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 60 min, washed in buffer, and subsequently processed for freeze etching. Strains producing GFP-containing fusion proteins were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described (7Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For detailed analysis of the topology of H. polymorpha Pex3p, various Myc tags were introduced. We determined the possible position of putative membrane spans in Pex3p by the algorithms based on the methods of Argos et al. (25Argos P. Rao J.K. Hargrave P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (transmembrane helix prediction); Eisenberg et al. (26Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar) (prediction of membrane associated α-helices); and Kleinet al. (27Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) (hydropathic index of protein). These methods indicate the presence of two or three putative membrane spans in HpPex3p, located at amino acids 16–36, 159–179, and 366–387, respectively. Based on this information, we introduced the tags at the extreme N and C termini of the protein, as well as in between the putative membrane spans at positions 102–111 and 214–223. Furthermore, the position of these tags does not coincide with the location of the predicted regions of topogenic information of the protein (7Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All constructed H. polymorpha strains, RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·C-Myc], RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·N-Myc], RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·102–111myc], and RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·214–223myc], grew like WT cells in batch cultures supplemented with 0.5% methanol as sole carbon source (final optical density at 663 nm of all cultures amounted to ∼3.0) and contained normal peroxisomes that were morphologically indistinguishable from organelles in WT cells (shown in Fig. 1 A for RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·N-Myc]). Immunocytochemically, the key enzymes of methanol metabolism, alcohol oxidase, catalase, and dihydroxyacetone synthase, were confined to these organelles (data not shown). These results indicated that all four Myc-tagged variants of HpPex3p were able to functionally complement the pex3 deletion strain and thus, that the Myc tag did not affect normal Pex3p functioning. The level of Pex3p produced in the various strains was comparable with WT levels, as determined by Western blotting of cell-free extracts prepared from cells, grown in batch cultures supplemented with 0.5% methanol (data not shown). Immunocytochemically, using ultrathin sections of Unicryl-embedded cells of all four strains and monoclonal Myc antibodies, the α-Myc-dependent labeling was confined to the peroxisomal membrane (shown for RBG1[P PEX3 ·PEX3·C-Myc] in Fig.1 B).

Here we show that accumulation of PTGF-β mRNA in response to p53 overexpression is delayed relative to p21 WAF1 , whereas the promoters of these genes respond to p53 with similar kinetics. Mutational analyses of two p53 binding sites within the PTGF-β promoter revealed that site p53-1 (+29 bp) is responsible for as much as 80% of the transcriptional response to p53. This is consistent with electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing that site p53-1 binds p53 with a much higher affinity than site p53-2 (−850 bp). We also describe for the first time a novel 21-bp element (−222 to −242 bp) that acts to down-regulate the PTGF-β promoter response to p53. Termed the p53 transcriptional repressor element (p53TRE), this sequence was shown to suppress p53 transactivation in a position- and promoter-independent fashion and to associate with a 28-kDa protein expressed in several tumor cell lines. A p53 suppressor element and asymmetric p53 binding sites may participate determining the activation thresholds of p53-responsive promoters in a cell- and context-specific manner.

May E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7621-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The rapid and substantial increase in p53 protein levels triggered by a genotoxic insult can be attributed primarily to stabilization of the normally labile protein (2Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The ability of p53 to suppress transformation is largely dependent on its ability to act as a sequence-specific transcription factor (3Raycroft L., Wu, H.Y. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). p53 in the nucleus associates with cis-acting DNA sequences composed of two copies of the palindromic motif 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′, separated by a variable linker region of between 0 and 13 bases (4el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Studies in lower eukaryotes have led to the estimate that the human genome contains more than 200 genes that are directly responsive to p53 (5Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Promoter mapping and microarray studies have already implicated p53 in the regulation of more than 100 genes involved in cellular processes such as DNA repair, angiogenesis, signal transduction, and oxidative stress (6Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is clear that p53 is at the helm of a diverse collection of downstream effectors. The most intensively studied outcomes of p53 activation are cytostasis and apoptosis (7Bates S. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). A reversible cell cycle arrest response has been largely attributed to p53-dependent up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorp21WAF1 (8Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar, 9el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). p53 has also been implicated in the induction of a premature senescence program in some cell types (10Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying p53-mediated apoptosis are not as clearly defined, although a multitude of p53 target genes have been implicated in this process (11Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). However, no single gene appears to be crucial in p53-mediated apoptosis, and it is likely that particular subsets of downstream effectors are activated in a cell- and context-specific fashion, with each contributing in varying degrees to the overall apoptotic response (11Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar). The propensity of p53 to initiate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis varies among different cell types (12Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar,13Radford I.R. Murphy T.K. Radley J.M. Ellis S.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 65: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Tumor-associated mutations in the DNA binding and hinge domains of p53 have been shown to have different effects on the ability of mutant p53 to activate p53-responsive promoters and can even lead to the specific loss of the apoptotic function of p53 but not its cell cycle arrest activity (14Rowan S. Ludwig R.L. Haupt Y. Bates S., Lu, X. Oren M. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) demonstrated that transactivation of the apoptosis-inducing gene, p53AIP, by wild-type p53 (phosphorylated at Ser-46) occurs prior to the onset of apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. Together, these observations allude to transcriptional mechanisms that permit the differential regulation of genes downstream of p53 involved in arrest and apoptosis. Much attention has focused on post-translational modifications within the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of p53 and their impact on the ability of p53 to transactivate target genes (19Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation events within the amino-terminal activation domain have been shown to regulate p53 binding to associated proteins such as Mdm2 and components of the transcription initiation complex (20Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). More recently, up-regulation of p53 target genes in vivo has been shown to be contingent on acetylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of p53 (21Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 22Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) showed that acetylation of p53 can significantly enhance associations with transcriptional coactivators p300 and TRAAP necessary for acetylation of nucleosomes in the promoters of p53 target genes. Consistent with these findings, binding and deacetylation of p53 by the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIR2α were shown to repress p53-mediated transcription and the cellular response to DNA damage (24Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D., Su, F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E.N.

Several other p53-interacting proteins have been shown to enhance (e.g.BRCA1 (26Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Tian H., Bi, D. Weber B.L. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), BML (27Garkavtsev I.V. Kley N. Grigorian I.A. Gudkov A.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8276-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) or attenuate (e.g. ATF3 (28Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35037-35041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)) p53-mediated transcription. Among these, Samuels-Lev et al. (30Samuels-Lev Y. O'Connor D.J. Bergamaschi D. Trigiante G. Hsieh J.K. Zhong S. Campargue I. Naumovski L. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ASPP proteins could specifically enhance the transcription of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis, whereas Stros et al. (31Stros M. Ozaki T. Bacikova A. Kageyama H. Nakagawara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) found that high mobility group (B1/B2) proteins down-regulate the apoptosis-inducingBax gene in a cell-specific manner. Because none of these factors have been shown to associate directly with DNA, it is likely that they exert their effects by enhancing or interfering with the ability of p53 to bind DNA or to interact with other important trans-acting factors (e.g. Sp1 (32Koutsodontis G. Tentes I. Papakosta P. Moustakas A. Kardassis D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29116-29125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) associated with p53-responsive genes. Although it is clear that promoter-specific sequence elements play an essential role in the response of individual genes to p53 activation, the nature of these regulatory elements and the mechanisms used to modulate the response of individual gene promoters to p53 are poorly understood. Previous studies in our laboratory identified the PlacentalTransforming Growth Factor-β (PTGF-β)1 gene as responding to both p53-dependent and p53-independent DNA damage-signaling events (33Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PTGF-β alone was sufficient to suppress growth and induce apoptosis of MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and various other breast cancer cell lines, but not untransformed cell lines. We demonstrated that a 1,015-base pair region encompassing the 5′-end of the PTGF-β gene contains a functional p53 binding site (p53-1) within the 5′-untranslated region. Coincident with our study, Tan et al. (34Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) also identified the PTGF-β gene as p53-responsive and described a second p53 binding site (p53-2) almost 900 bp upstream of site p53-1. Here we compare the kinetics of PTGF-β and p21 WAF1 promoter activation by p53, examine more closely the correlation between PTGF-β promoter activity and p53 binding to sites p53-1 and p53-2, and search for cis-acting sequence elements that participate in the PTGF-β promoter response to p53. Conditions for growth of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells have been described previously (35Li P. Bui T. Gray D. Klamut H.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Procedures for the growth and maintenance of adenoviral vectors have also been described previously (33Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A.

Total RNA was extracted from MDA-MB-468 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h postinfection with Adp53 (100 pfu/cell). 10 μg of each sample was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described elsewhere (36Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The p21-lux luciferase reporter construct was graciously provided by Dr. S. Benchimol (Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto). p21-lux contains ∼2.4 kb of the p21 WAF1 proximal promoter in the pGL3-Basic luciferase cloning vector (Promega). A 1,015-bp fragment containing 967 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site and 49 bp within the 5′-untranslated region of the human PTGF-β gene was PCR amplified from human fibroblast genomic DNA using the forward primer SPWTF1 (5′-GTA CCG AGC TCT AGA ACT CTT GAC GT-3′) and reverse primer SPWTR1 (5′-AGA TCT CGA GTT CTT GCC CGG GCA T-3′). This fragment was cloned upstream of a luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic reporter vector (Promega) and is denoted as pWT. Variants of pWT having mutations in p53 binding sites were generated using the following primers (see Fig. 2 B). The pMT1 forward primer was SPWTF1, and the reverse primer was SPMT53R (5′-GGA GTT CGA GAT CGA TCT GGG TCG AAT GGC AAT ACC-3′). The primers for pMT2 were generated in a two-step PCR using fragments generated from forward primer SPWTF1 with SPINMTRB (5′-TCG AGA TCG ATC TGG GTC GAA TGG CA-3′; fragment A) and forward primer SPINMTFA (5′-TGC CAT TCG ACC CAG ATC GAT CTC GA-3′) with reverse primer SPMT53R (fragment B) in a final PCR including fragments A and B with forward primer SPWTF1 and reverse primer SPWTR1. The primers for pMT1/2 were generated using pMT2 as a template with forward primers SPWTF1 and reverse primer SPM53R. 5′-Promoter deletion constructs containing mutations in p53-1 were generated using pMT1 as the template and reverse primer SPMT53R with following forward primers (see Fig. 2 C). The pMT1Δ673 primer was STDL300F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC CTG CTT AGA CTG GAA AG −3′). The pMT1Δ389 primer was STDL600F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC CTC TGC TTC CTT TG −3′). The pMT1Δ105 primer was STDL900F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC ATT GGA GTG TTT ACT C-3′). 5′-Promoter deletion constructs were generated using reverse primer SPWTR1 and the following forward primers (see Fig. 4, A andB). The pWT1Δ818 primer was STDL150F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC AAA CAA TCC ACC CAC-3′). The pMT1Δ673 primer was STDL300F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC CTG CTT AGA CTG GAA AG-3′). The pWT1Δ509 primer was STD450F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC ATT TGA CCA CCT CTC-3′). The pWT1Δ389, the primer was STDL600F. The pWT1Δ105 primer was STDL900F. The pWT1Δ312 primer was STD665F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC TTA AAC TCT TTG TCT GG-3′). The pWT1Δ251 primer was STDL716F (5′-GGT ACC GAG CTC CAA AAA GAC TCC CAG-3′). The pWT1Δ216 primer was STDL750F (5′-GGT ACC CTC ATA TCG AGG AAG AGG-3′). pDLPTR (see Fig. 6) was generated using a four-step cloning procedure as follows. The forward primers SPWTF1 and DLPTRR (5′-GCT GTC GCG GAC ATT GTT ACT ATG TG-3′) were used in a PCR to generate fragment C, and forward primers DLPTRF (5′-GCT GAT ATC ATA TCG AGG AAG AGG A-3′) and SPWTR1 were used to generate fragment D. Both fragments were cloned separately into pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). Fragment D was cloned into the EcoRV/HindIII restriction sites downstream of fragment C, and the resultingSacI/XhoI fragment containing C and D was then cloned into pGL3-Basic. pDCR was generated in a fashion similar to that for pDLPTR; however, primer PCRDCF (5′-GCC GAT ATC CTC ATA TCG AGG AAG AG-3′) was used instead of DLPTRF, and DLPTRR was replaced by PCRDCR (5′-GGA GTC TTT TTG GAG G-3′). pWT-TRE2 was generated by cloning a 171-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the region between −81 and −251 bp using forward primer OLI716F (5′-CTC GAG CTC CAA AAA GAC TCC CAG-3′) and reverse primer OLI716R (5′-GGT ACC TGC CTG CAG AGC AAA CAC-3′) into the KpnI site in pWT. p21-TRE2 was generated in a similar fashion. All reporter constructs were sequenced using vector- and plasmid-specific primers on a LI-COR model 400 automated sequencer (ACGT Corp., Toronto, Ontario). Luciferase reporter constructs were cotransfected into MDA-MB-468 cells with a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (CMV-β-galactosidase) using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (37Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Luciferase was quantitated using the Dual-Light kit (PE Biosystems/Tropix) using a Berthold Lumat LB9507 luminometer and normalized to β-galactosidase activity measured in the same fashion. Nuclear protein extracts from MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, or HeLa cells were prepared as described previously (38Wolkowicz R. Peled A. Elkind N.B. Rotter V. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1998; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A histidine-tagged, truncated recombinant p53 protein (amino acids 82–360, denoted p5382–360) was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (33Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D.

Complementary, single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were combined at 2.5 μm and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Excess nucleotides were removed by gel filtration using Sephadex-G25 fine spin columns (Roche). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in water at ∼350 nm, boiled, and left to cool to room temperature overnight. Oligonucleotides (forward sequence only is indicated): p53-1, forward primer P53BS1 (5′-CAC CAG CCA TGC CCG GGC AAG AAC TCA-3′); MTp53-1, forward primer P53MTFGS (5′-CAC AGC TCG ACC CGG GTC GAA ACT CA-3′); p53-2, forward primer SPINWTFA (5′-TGC CAT CTT GCC CAG ACT TGT CTC GA-3′); MTp53-2, forward primer SPINMTFA (described above). Sequences included in oligonucleotides RA, RB, RC, RD, RE, RF, and R are depicted in Fig. 6 A. Oligonucleotide RMT corresponds to the sequence in forward primer GS724.751F (5′-AGA CTC CAA GGG CGA ATT CTG CAG ATA TCC TCA-3′). Conditions for DNA binding reactions and EMSAs have been described previously (38Wolkowicz R. Peled A. Elkind N.B. Rotter V. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1998; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For UV cross-linking assays, incubation reactions containing oligonucleotides and nuclear protein extracts were exposed to 8,000 J of UV radiation in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) and fractionated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 2 h at 100 V. All gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Microarray studies in colon and lung carcinoma cell lines overexpressing wild-type p53 (6Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2225-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) have suggested that PTGF-β is induced with kinetics that are characteristic of an immediate-early p53 target gene. Northern blot analyses were employed to compare more definitively the steady-state levels of PTGF-β and p21 WAF1 transcripts in MDA-MB-468 cells at various times after infection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type p53 (Adp53) at 100 pfu/cell. As shown in Fig.1 A, p21 WAF1 transcripts were detected by 12 h and peaked by 24 h postinfection with Adp53. PTGF-β mRNA was not detectable at 12 h but also peaked by 24 h postinfection. To investigate whether this induction profile could be recapitulated at the transcriptional level, the PTGF-β and p21 WAF1 promoters were cloned into luciferase reporter vectors to generate pWT and p21-lux, respectively, and their response to p53 was examined. The PTGF-β promoter in pWT contains two functional p53 binding sites: site p53-1 at +29 bp within the 5′-untranslated region and site p53-2 at −850 bp (33Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); p21-lux contains 2.4 kb of the p21 WAF1 promoter (40el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-468 cells were transiently transfected with either the p21-lux or pWT reporter, and luciferase assays were performed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h postinfection with Adp53. As shown in Fig. 1 B, induction levels of the two promoters were virtually identical at 12 h. By 18 h the p21 WAF1 promoter displayed near maximal 15-fold induction levels and remained at this level at the 24 h time point. Induction of the PTGF-β promoter proceeded at a slower rate, reaching 6-fold by 18 h and 13-fold by 24 h postinfection. No induction was observed in cells infected with a control adenovirus expressing the β-galactosidase gene (data not shown). Thus, although p53-mediated induction of the PTGF-β promoter is somewhat delayed relative to the p21 WAF1 promoter at 18 h, induction levels are comparable by 24 h, consistent with the levels of endogenous mRNA transcripts observed at this time point. The absence of a significant difference in promoter induction levels at 12 h suggests that the delay in endogenous PTGF-β transcript accumulation at this time point is not caused by differences in the transcriptional response of these promoters to p53. To examine the contributions of p53 binding sites p53-1 and p53-2 to PTGF-β promoter responsiveness, we examined the activity of promoter constructs bearing mutations in each site. As depicted in Fig.2 A, mutant p53 binding sites were created by nucleotide substitutions (lowercase) within the core (shaded) of each 10-bp consensus repeat motif. Mutations of this nature have been shown to be sufficient to abolish p53 binding (4el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed 24 h postinfection of MDA-MB-468 cells with Adp53. As shown in Fig.2 B, mutation of site p53-1 resulted in a large decline in p53 induction: from 24-fold in pWT to 4-fold in pMT1. Mutation of p53-2 had a less dramatic effect, reducing induction from 24-fold in pWT to 16-fold (pMT2) after Adp53 infection. Mutation of both sites (pMT1/2) completely abolished p53 responsiveness. This was confirmed in an analysis of the p53 response of constructs with a mutated p53-1 and progressively longer deletions from the 5′-end of the PTGF-β promoter (Fig. 2 C). These results are consistent with the notion that site p53-1 makes a larger contribution to the p53 response than p53-2, and that the combined contribution of these sites to PTGF-β promoter induction is additive. We hypothesized that the differential contribution of sites p53-1 and p53-2 might be a function of their relative binding affinities for p53. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a 26-bp, double-stranded, radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing site p53-1 associates strongly with wild-type p53 in nuclear extracts derived from Adp53-infected (100 pfu/cell) MDA-MB-468 cells (lane 3) but not with endogenous mutant p53 in uninfected cells (lane 2). Binding of p53-1 by p53 was specific because competition for p53 was achieved with a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type p53-1 competitor (p53-1; lanes 4–6) but not a mutant form of this oligonucleotide (MTp53-1; lanes 7–9). Furthermore, a p53 antibody (α-p53) was seen to supershift EMSA complexes generated by either p53-1 (lane 10) or a p53 consensus oligonucleotide (lane 21). Unlike site p53-1, no p53-specific EMSA band was observed with the p53-2 probe (lanes 11–14). Moreover, excess unlabeled p53-2 oligonucleotide did not compete for p53 binding to a consensus probe (lanes 18–20) (38Wolkowicz R. Peled A. Elkind N.B. Rotter V. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1998; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the affinity of site p53-1 for p53 is much higher than site p53-2 under our EMSA binding conditions. Previous work by Tan et al. (34Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) suggested that p53 binding to each of these sites was dependent on the presence of monoclonal antibody Ab421 in EMSA binding reactions. As shown in Fig.3 B, inclusion of Ab421 in EMSA binding reactions produced a p53-specific band with the p53-2 probe (lane 9) which could be effectively competed by a 10- and 100-fold excess of p53-1 (lanes 10 and 11) but not by a mutant form of p53-2 (lanes 12 and 13). This EMSA complex was also supershifted by an antibody specific for the amino terminus of p53 (lane 14). These results confirmed that site p53-2 is also a specific target for wild-type p53 binding. The intensity of bands shifted by both p53-1 and p53-2 in the presence of Ab421 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 9, respectively) were comparable, suggesting that p53 is able to bind to these sites with equal affinity. To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSA experiments using a constant amount of a purified recombinant form of p53 (amino acids 82–360) lacking the carboxyl-terminal regulatory region in the presence of varying amounts of poly(dI·dC). Carboxyl-terminal truncations of p53 are known to mimic native p53 in the presence of Ab421 (41Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, recombinant p53 binding to the p53-1 probe could be detected in the presence of the relatively high concentrations of poly(dI·dC) used (lanes 2–5). On the other hand, recombinant p53 binding to p53-2 was only seen in the presence of low concentrations of poly(dI·dC) (lanes 7–10). This result provided further support for the notion that site p53-1 binds p53 with a much a higher affinity than p53-2. This is consistent with our EMSA studies (Fig. 3 A) and suggests that site p53-1 has a more prominent role in p53-mediated induction of PTGF-β gene expression. To investigate whether other regions within the PTGF-β promoter are involved in p53 induction, a series of 5′-end deletion constructs were generated and tested for responses to infection of MDA-MB-468 cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type p53. Interestingly, removal of 284 bp between −389 and −105 bp resulted in a 3-fold increase in p53 induction (compare pWTΔ389 with pWTΔ105), pointing to the existence of a negative regulatory element within this region (Fig.4 A). Functional analysis of constructs containing additional deletions through this region (Fig.4 B) localized this negative regulatory element, designated the “p53 Transcriptional RepressorElement” (p53TRE), to a 35-bp region between −251 and −216 bp within the PTGF-β promoter. To determine whether one or more trans-acting factors specifically associate with the p53TRE, a 40-bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (denoted R in Fig. 5) containing the putative repressor region between −251 and −212 bp was radiolabeled and used in EMSA binding reactions containing nuclear extracts from MDA-MB-468 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, two bandshifts of equal intensity, denoted R1 and R2 for the upper and lower bands, respectively, were observed (lane 2). Both bands could be competed with a 10–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide R (lanes 3–5), although oligonucleotide concentrations needed to compete R1 binding we"

Data base searches revealed that the enzyme contains an active site serine consensus sequence Gly-X-Ser-Tyr-X-Gly that is also found in X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase. The serine hydrolase inhibitorp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidino-benzoate appeared to be an active site titrant and was used to label the α-amino acid ester hydrolase. Electrospray mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of peptides from a CNBr digest of the labeled protein showed that Ser205, situated in the consensus sequence, becomes covalently modified by reaction with the inhibitor. Extended sequence analysis showed alignment of this Ser205with the catalytic nucleophile of some α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes, which posses a catalytic triad composed of a nucleophile, an acid, and a base. Based on the alignments, 10 amino acids were selected for site-directed mutagenesis (Arg85, Asp86, Tyr143, Ser156, Ser205, Tyr206, Asp338, His370, Asp509, and His610). Mutation of Ser205, Asp338, or His370 to an alanine almost fully inactivated the enzyme, whereas mutation of the other residues did not seriously affect the enzyme activity. Circular dichroism measurements showed that the inactivation was not caused by drastic changes in the tertiary structure. Therefore, we conclude that the catalytic domain of the α-amino acid ester hydrolase has an α/β-hydrolase fold structure with a catalytic triad of Ser205, Asp338, and His370. This distinguishes the α-amino acid ester hydrolase from the Ntn-hydrolase family of β-lactam antibiotic acylases."
https://openalex.org/W1994495264,"SHP-2, a nontransmembrane-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase that contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, is thought to participate in growth factor signal transduction pathways via SH2 domain interactions. To determine the role of each region of SHP-2 in platelet-derived growth factor signaling assayed by Elk-1 activation, we generated six deletion mutants of SHP-2. The large SH2 domain deletion SHP-2 mutant composed of amino acids 198–593 (SHP-2-(198–593)), but not the smaller SHP-2-(399–593), showed significantly higher SHP-2 phosphatase activity in vitro. In contrast, SHP-2-(198–593) mutant inhibited wild type SHP-2 phosphatase activity, whereas SHP-2-(399–593) mutant increased activity. To understand these functional changes, we focused on the docking protein Gab1 that assembles signaling complexes. Pull-down experiments with Gab1 suggested that the C-terminal region of SHP-2 as well as the SH2 domains (N-terminal region) associated with Gab1, but the SHP-2-(198–593) mutant did not associate with Gab1. SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(198–593) inhibited platelet-derived growth factorinduced Elk-1 activation, but SHP-2-(399–593) increased Elk-1 activation. Co-expression of SHP-2-(1–202) with SHP-2-(399–593) inhibited SHP-2-(399–593)/Gab1 interaction, and the SHP-2-(399–593) mutant induced SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activation, supporting the autoinhibitory effect of SH2 domains on the C-terminal region of SHP-2. These data suggest that both SHP-2/Gab1 interaction in the C-terminal region of SHP-2 and increased SHP-2 phosphatase activity are important for Elk-1 activation. Furthermore, we identified a novel sequence for SHP-2/Gab1 interactions in the C-terminal region of SHP-2.

Src homology 2 platelet-derived growth factor epidermal growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase hemagglutinin Chinese hamster ovary wild type amino acids SHP-2 is a widely expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase that has two tandem SH21 domain repeats at its N terminus (1Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). SHP-2 binds directly to growth factor receptors, including the PDGF and EGF receptors, in response to receptor stimulation with the corresponding ligand and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation (2Wong L. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20981-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Qi J.H. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14455-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence implicates SHP-2 as a positive regulator of ERK activity downstream from receptor-tyrosine kinases (4Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts derived from SHP-2 exon 3−/− mice exhibit decreased ERK activity in response to EGF and PDGF. Following growth factor stimulation, SHP-2 is recruited through its SH2 domain directly to the EGF or PDGF receptor (5Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: 79-113PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). SHP-2 function is regulated by both intramolecular associations and binding of regulatory proteins (Fig. 1 A). Schematically, SHP-2 consists of a phosphatase domain in the C terminus (PTP2 in Fig.1 A) and two tandem SH2 domains in the N terminus. It has been proposed that the SH2 domains maintain SHP-2 in an inactive conformation under basal conditions. Specifically, previous investigators found that deletion of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 protein enhanced phosphatase activity, and binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides to the SH2 domains (presumably removing their inhibitory interaction with PTP2) increased SHP-2 catalytic activity (7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dechert U. Adam M. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SHP-2 crystal structure provides additional support for this model (9Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), since it predicts that the N-terminal SH2 domain binds the phosphatase domain and directly blocks its active site. In addition to SH2 domains, it is possible that the C-terminal portion of SHP-2 associates with other proteins via putative phosphotyrosine sites that may interact with SH2 domain (1Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SHP-2 is activated by phospholipids that may be mediated by lipid interaction with the phosphatase domain, because a deletion mutant of SH2 domains still can respond to phospholipid stimulation (7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Xuet al. reported that SHP-2 co-localized with stress fibers at low cell densities and directly associates with F-actin through the phosphatase domain (10Xu F. Zhao R. Peng Y. Guerrah A.

Especially, the association of Gab1 (Y637) with SHP-2 is critical for sustained ERK1/2 activation (16Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gab1 and SHP-2 are important partners in cytoplasmic signaling. However, it remains unknown how SHP-2 phosphatase activity and SHP-2-Gab1 complexes mediate downstream events of growth factor receptors such as ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation. Based on previous data, there are three possible models by which SHP-2 may regulate ERK1/2 or Elk-1 activity. 1) Both SHP-2-Gab1 complex formation and SHP-2 phosphatase activity are critical for ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation. 2) The N-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2 associate with Gab1, which increases SHP-2 phosphatase activity and activates ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activity. 3) Association of Gab1 with SHP-2 is the only mechanism necessary to regulate ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activity, and SHP-2 phosphatase activity is not directly involved in this process. Model 1 is supported by data indicating that both a catalytic inactive SHP-2 mutant (SHP-2C/S) and disruption of Gab1/SHP-2 binding inhibit ERK1/2 activation, but the relationship between SHP-2 phosphatase activity and SHP-2/Gab1 interaction remains unclear. Model 2 is supported by the structure of SHP-2 (9Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, since SH2 domain deletion mutants of SHP-2, which act as a constitutively active form of SHP-2, inhibit ERK1/2 activity (4Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the actual involvement of SHP-2 phosphatase activity is not clear. Model 3 is supported by the data that the mutation of SHP-2 binding sites in Gab1 abolished growth factor-induced ERK1/2 activation as described above. In addition, since a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S) is able to form a complex with Gab1 constitutively (17Cunnick J.M. Mei L. Doupnik C.A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24380-24387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a possible mechanism for SHP-2C/S inhibition of ERK1/2 activity may be “trapping” Gab1 from SHP-2 association. In the current study, we made several deletion mutants of SHP-2 to clarify the relationship between SHP-2 phosphatase activity and SHP-2/Gab1 interaction. We found that the SHP-2-(399–593) mutant associated with Gab1. Interestingly, the SHP-2-(399–593) mutant increased wild type SHP-2 phosphatase activity and Elk-1 activity. In contrast, other SHP-2 mutants, which had either no association with Gab1 or no phosphatase activity, significantly inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activity. These results suggest that both Gab1/SHP-2 interaction and SHP-2 phosphatase activity are important for SHP-2 signaling events such as Elk-1 activation. Structure function analysis indicates a novel role for the C-terminal region of SHP-2 in regulating Elk-1 activation by both mediating interaction with Gab1 and regulating SHP-2 phosphatase activity.

For transient expression experiments, CHO cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

The N-terminal truncations of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(1–202) and SHP-2-(1–411)) and the C-terminal truncations of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(198–593) and SHP-2-(399–593)) were created by polymerase chain reaction from SHP-2 wild type and subcloning into pcDNA3.1/hisC or pCMV-Tag2 vectors (Invitrogen). Phosphatase-inactive mutant forms of SHP-2-(198–593) (SHP-2-(198–593C/S)) and SHP-2-(399–593) (SHP-2-(399–593C/S)) were generated by polymerase chain reaction from SHP-2C/S. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. After treatment with reagents, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (−), harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μmNa3VO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After a flash-freezing on liquid nitrogen and thawing on ice, cells were scraped off the dish and centrifuged at 14,000 × g (40 °C for 30 min), and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with anti-HA, SHP-2, Bcr, Gab1, or Xpress antibody for 16 h at 40 °C as indicated and then incubated with 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h on a roller system at 40 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of lysis buffer. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (HybondTM ECL;Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) blocking buffer. The blots were incubated for 4 h at room temperature with a primary antibody and then were followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). SHP-2 phosphatase activity was assayed by using tyrosine-phosphorylated Raytide as a substrate as previously described (21Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were precleared with protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads and control IgG from normal rabbit serum, and SHP-2 and Xpress-tagged SHP-2 were immunoprecipitated by anti-SHP-2 or anti-Xpress antibody, respectively. After having been washed, the immune complexes were added to 50 μl of 32P-labeled Tyr-Raytide and 50 μl of 2× phosphatase reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of acidic charcoal mixture (0.9 m HCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmNaH2PO4, and 4% (w/v) NoritA). After centrifugation, the amount of radioactivity present in the supernatant was counted by a scintillation counter. A PathDetect trans-system (Stratagene) was used for detection of Elk1 transcription activity as described previously (22Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10870-10878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Data are reported as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed with the StatView 4.0 package (ABACUS Concepts, Berkeley, California). Differences were analyzed with unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or Welch'st test as appropriate. p values less than 0.05 are indicated by an asterisk, and p values less than 0.01 are indicated by a double asterisk. We tested the feasibility of using PDGF-β receptor overexpressing CHO cells to study the role of SHP-2 in activation of ERK1/2 by PDGF, because CHO cells can be easily transfected to transiently express protein. cDNAs encoding wild type (WT) or catalytically inactive SHP-2 with a Cys to Ser mutation at residue 459 (C/S) were co-transfected into cells along with an HA epitope-tagged ERK2. Cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated times and lysed, HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA mAb, and ERK2 activity in the immunoprecipitates was determined by using anti-phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, expression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S) in PDGF-β receptor-overexpressing CHO cells significantly inhibited PDGF-induced ERK2 activation. It has been reported that after the binding of the SHP-2 SH2 domains to a tyrosine-phosphorylated target such as Gab1, SHP-2 adopts an “open” conformation associated with increased catalytic activity. Therefore, we also determined the time course of PDGF-induced SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig.2 C, PDGF (20 ng/ml) increased SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity ∼2.5-fold, which reached a peak at 10 min and returned to the basal level within 30 min. Since SHP-2 and Gab1 interaction is critical for ERK1/2 activation and SHP-2C/S inhibits EGF-induced ERK activation, we evaluated SHP-2C/S association with Gab1. As shown in Fig. 2,D and E, cells transfected with SHP-2C/S had elevated levels of Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Gab1-SHP-2 complex in the serum-starved condition. After PDGF stimulation, there was a continuous rise in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and continuous increase in the amount of SHP-2 associated with Gab1 as previously reported (Fig. 2, D and E). These data suggest that SHP-2C/S can trap Gab1 in a tyrosine-phosphorylated state. It has been reported that SHP-2-Gab1 complex formation is critical for ERK1/2 activation (16Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In regard to the regulation of ERK1/2 activation by SHP-2-Gab1 complex formation, the finding that SHP-2C/S constitutively associates with Gab1 is incompatible with the inhibitory effect of SHP-2C/S on PDGF-induced ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation. Therefore, we investigated further the role of Gab1/SHP-2 interaction and SHP-2 phosphatase activity in SHP-2 signaling. To further characterize the role of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity, we constructed two SHP-2 C-terminal truncation mutants (SHP-2-(1–202) and SHP-2-(1–411)), two SHP-2 N-terminal deletion mutants (SHP-2-(198–593) and -(399–593)), and two catalytically inactive forms of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(198–593C/S) and SHP-2-(399–593C/S)) as indicated in Fig. 1 B. To assay tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP-2 mutants, we transfected PDGF β-receptor-overexpressing CHO cells with pcDNA3.1/His SHP-2-(198–593), -(399–593), -(198–593C/S), -(399–593C/S), and vector alone (Fig.3 A). SHP-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-Xpress antibody, and tyrosine phosphatase activity was measured by dephosphorylation of Raytide (21Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As previously reported (7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dechert U. Adam M. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SHP-2-(198–593), which is an N-terminal SH2 domain deletion mutant, possessed significantly higher SHP-2 phosphatase activity than wild type (Fig. 3 B). However, SHP-2-(399–593), which contains the C-terminal region of SHP-2, had no significant tyrosine phosphatase activity. In addition, a Cys to Ser point mutation at amino acid 459 (SHP-2-(198–593C/S) and -(399–593C/S)) resulted in no tyrosine phosphatase activity, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Because it has been reported that SHP-2 forms dimers in mouse fibroblasts (23Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), it is possible that one SHP-2 protein may regulate the SHP-2 phosphatase activity of its binding partner. Therefore, we determined whether SHP-2 mutants can regulate wild type SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity. First, we co-transfected Xpress-tagged wild type SHP-2 with FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(1–202), SHP-2-(1–411), SHP-2-(198–593), SHP-2-(399–593), SHP-2-(198–593C/S), SHP-2-(399–593C/S), or Gab1, immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody, and assayed Xpress-tagged wild type SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity with or without PDGF stimulation. As shown in Fig.3 C, we found that SHP-2-(399–593) and Gab1 increased the basal level of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 C,lanes 5 and 8). SHP-2-(399–593C/S) did not increase the basal level of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). Furthermore, SHP-2-(1–202), SHP-2-(1–411), and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) inhibited PDGF-induced SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity similar to SHP-2C/S (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2, 3,6, and 7). Of note, a constitutively active form of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(198–593)) significantly inhibited PDGF-induced SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). No difference was observed in the expression level of wild type Xpress-tagged SHP-2 phosphatase activity by Western blot analysis with anti-Xpress antibody (data not shown). These data suggested that the N-terminal region of SHP-2 containing SH2 domains and mutants of Cys459 to Ser inhibited the phosphatase activity of the heterodimer wild type SHP-2. It has been reported that after the binding of the SH2 domains to tyrosine-phosphorylated targets such as Gab1, the SHP-2 adopts an “open” conformation and becomes catalytically active. We also found that the C-terminal regions of SHP-2-(399–593) and SHP-2-(399–593C/S)) are able to associate with SH2 domains (SHP-2-(1–202) and -(1–411)) (Fig.4 A). Since SHP-2-(399–593) increased and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) decreased wild type SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity, we evaluated whether SHP-2-(399–593) can associate with the C-terminal region of SHP-2 directly as a dimer. We co-transfected Xpress-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) (lanes 1–4) with FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) (lane 2) or FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593C/S) (lane 4), immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody, and measured the association of SHP-2-(399–593) or -(399–593C/S) by anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) or SHP-2-(399–593C/S) was co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-2-(399–593), suggesting a possible mechanism of SHP-2 dimerization through the C-terminal region of SHP-2. Furthermore, we also evaluated the effect of Gab1 on this SHP-2 dimerization through the C-terminal region of SHP-2. We performed triple co-transfection experiments of Xpress-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) and FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) and either vector (lane 1) or HA-Gab1 (lane 2). As shown in Fig. 4 C, overexpression of Gab1 significantly increased the association of Xpress-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) with FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) (top panel). These data suggest that Gab1 enhances the ability of SHP-2-(399–593) to form dimers. Previous investigators have shown that Gab1 associates with SHP-2 via the N-terminal SH2 domain (23Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We also found that SHP-2-(1–202) and -(1–401), which contain the N-terminal SH2 domain, were able to form a complex with Gab1 by coimmunoprecipitation study with anti-Gab1 antibody (Fig.5, A and B). We determined that the deletion mutant SHP-2-(198–593), in which the N-terminal SH2 domain and a significant part of the C-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 is deleted, did not associate with Gab1 as previously reported (23Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, Gab1 was able to associate with the smaller construct SHP-2-(399–593), composed of C-terminal SHP-2 (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, SHP-2-(399–593C/S) also can associate with Gab1, and no significant difference between the association of Gab1 with SHP-2-(399–593) and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) was observed (Fig.5 C). Equal amounts of Gab1 protein were present in Gab1 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These results indicate that Gab1 is able to interact with the C-terminal region of SHP-2 as well as with SHP-2 SH2 domains and that the mutation of Cys459 to Ser did not affect Gab1 interaction with the C-terminal region of SHP-2. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Gab1 was able to associate with SHP-2-(399–593) but not with SHP-2-(198–593). These data suggest that the domain of amino acids 198–398 of SHP-2 has an inhibitory effect on Gab1/SHP-2-(399–593) association. However, it is also possible that Gab1/SHP-2-(399–593) interaction is artificial, caused by the exposure of new surfaces by the deletion of aa 198–398. The usual way to determine the association of Gab1/SHP-2 is to mutate the binding site for Gab1 in SHP-2-(399–593). However, since the binding site of Gab1 is in the SHP-2 phosphatase domain, the mutation in SHP-2-(399–593) may change the SHP-2 phosphatase activity and also the protein structure of SHP-2. Therefore, to determine whether Gab1 is able to interact with C-terminal region of SHP-2-(399–593) in wild type SHP-2, we performed a competitive assay to evaluate Gab1 association with SHP-2-(399–593) as follows. The competitive assay took advantage of our findings that Bcr could associate with SHP-2 at two different sites similar to Gab1. Specifically, Bcr binds to the SH2 domain in SHP-2-(1–202) and to the C-terminal region of SHP-2-(399–593). Second, overexpression of Bcr disrupted PDGF-induced Gab1/SHP-2 association (data not shown). In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 A, the association of Gab1 with SHP-2C/S was disrupted by the expression of Bcr. These data suggested the presence of competitive binding of Gab1 and Bcr to SHP-2. Finally, to investigate the SHP-2 domain required for Gab1/SHP-2 disruption induced by Bcr, we performed triple co-transfection experiments of Xpress-tagged SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(399–593), HA-tagged Gab1, and either vector or Bcr. We found that Bcr disrupted the association between Gab1 and SHP-2-(399–593) but increased the interaction between Gab1 and SHP-2-(1–202) (Fig. 6,B and C). These data suggested that the C-terminal region of SHP-2-(399–593) contains the domains required for Bcr to disrupt the SHP-2/Gab1 interaction. These data also suggested that Gab1 is able to associate with the C-terminal region of SHP-2-(399–593) even in full-length SHP-2, and this is not due to the artificial exposure of new surfaces by the deletion of aa 198–398. To determine the individual roles of each SH2 domain and the C-terminal region of SHP-2 on downstream events in PDGF signaling, we investigated the effect on PDGF-induced Elk-1 transcription activity of SHP-2 wild type (SHP-2 WT), a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S), and SHP-2 deletion mutants. PDGF β-receptor-overexpressing CHO cells were co-transfected with SHP-2 wild type, SHP-2 mutants (SHP-2-(1–202), SHP-2-(1–411C/S), and SHP-2-(399–593C/S)) and reporter plasmid pFR-Luc along with Gal4 fusion expression vectors containing Elk-1 and pRL-CMV as luciferase control reporter vector. As previously reported (16Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), SHP-2C/S inhibited PDGF (20 ng/ml)-induced Elk-1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 B). We also found that SHP-2 WT slightly (but significantly) inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation (Fig. 7 A). This suggests that there is an SHP-2 phosphatase activity-independent regulatory mechanism for PDGF-induced Elk-1 activity. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, SHP-2-(1–202) or -(1–411), which are N-terminal SH2 domain-containing fragments, inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 transcription activity. These data suggest that SH2 domains of SHP-2 have an inhibitory effect on PDGF-induced Elk-1 transcription activity. As shown in Fig.7 E, the SH2 domain deletion mutant of SHP-2-(198–593) inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation as previously described (4Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal region of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(399–593) alone was able to increase Elk-1 transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 F), indicating the positive effect of the C-terminal region of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(399–593)) on Elk-1 transcription activity. To study the role of phosphatase activity, we generated C459S mutations in SHP-2-(198–593) ((SHP-2-(198–593C/S)) and SHP-2-(399–593) ((SHP-2-(399–593C/S)) and determined the effect of these two mutants on PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation. As shown in Fig.7 G, SHP-2-(198–593C/S) had no effect on PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation. In contrast to SHP-2-(399–593), SHP-2-(399–593C/S) did not increase Elk-1 activity but significantly inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation to a small extent (Fig. 7 H). These data suggest a critical role of Cys459 in regulating PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation. Since self-association of the N-terminal region of SHP-2 with the phosphatase domain inhibits tyrosine phosphatase activity, we determined whether SHP-2-(1–202) or -(1–411) inhibits the interaction between SHP-2-(399–593) and Gab1. As shown in Fig.8 A, FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) was co-immunoprecipitated with Gab1, and N-terminal SH2 domain SHP-2 fragments (SHP-2-(1–202) and -(1–411)) disrupted this Gab1 and SHP-2 phosphatase domain interaction. Since we found that SHP-2-(1–202) and -(1–411) inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activity (Fig. 7), we evaluated the effect of SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(1–411) on SHP-2-(399–593)-induced Elk-1 activation. We cotransfected SHP-2-(399–593) with SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(1–411) and determined Elk-1 transcriptional activity by reporter gene assay. SHP-2-(399–593) induced Elk-1 activity dose-dependently (open squares), whereas co-transfection of SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(1–411) significantly inhibited SHP-2-(399–593)-induced Elk-1 transcription activity (Fig. 8,B and C). Furthermore, to determine whether Gab1 binding modulates SHP-2 phosphatase activity, we co-transfected the cells with Xpress-tagged SHP-2 wild type (Fig. 8 D, lanes 1–6) and FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(399–593) (lanes 2–4) or FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(1–202) (lanes 3 and5) or FLAG-tagged SHP-2-(1–411) (lanes 4 and 6). After 48 h of transfection, each cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody, and Xpress-tagged SHP-2 wild type phosphatase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.8 D, we found that SHP-2-(399–593) increased Xpress-tagged SHP-2 wild type phosphatase activity (lane 2), as we have shown in Fig. 3 C. However, co-transfection of SHP-2-(1–202) (lane 3) or SHP-2-(1–411) (lane 4) significantly decreased SHP-2-(399–593)-induced Xpress-tagged SHP-2 wild type phosphatase activity. An equal amount of Xpress-tagged SHP-2 wild type expression was found by Western blot analysis with anti-Xpress antibody (data not shown). These data suggested a possible functional role for SHP-2 SH2 domains (aa 1–202 or 1–411) in the inhibition of the C-terminal region of SHP-2 (SHP-2-(399–593))-induced SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activation. The major finding of this study is that both Gab1 association with SHP-2-(399–593) and SHP-2 phosphatase activity are critical for the regulation of downstream events activated by growth factor receptors such as the PDGF-β receptor (Fig.9 A). In addition, we found that the autoinhibition of SHP-2 phosphatase activity by SH2 domains also prevents association of Gab1 and SHP-2-(399–593) and subsequent PDGF- or SHP-2-(399–593)-induced SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activation. We summarized our data in Table I, based on the characteristic features of Gab1 association and SHP-2 phosphatase activity. SHP-2-(399–593) can associate with Gab1 and increase wild type SHP-2 phosphatase activity, although SHP-2-(399–593) itself has no phosphatase activity. SHP-2-(399–593C/S) and SHP-2C/S can associate with Gab1 but cannot increase SHP-2 phosphatase activity and instead inhibit PDGF-induced wild type SHP-2 phosphatase activity. SHP-2-(198–593) (SH2 domain deletion mutant) shows high SHP-2 phosphatase activity but cannot associate with Gab1 and therefore cannot increase Elk-1 activation. Only SHP-2-(399–593) was able to increase Elk-1 activation (Fig. 7). The disruption of SHP-2-(399–593) and Gab1 interaction by co-expression of SHP-2-(1–202) or -(1–411) significantly inhibited SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activation induced by SHP-2-(399–593) and probably also by PDGF stimulation (Fig. 8). These data support an essential role for both Gab1 association with SHP-2-(399–593) and SHP-2 phosphatase activity in mediating Elk-1 activity (Table I).Table ISummary of the effects of SHP-2 mutants Open table in a new tab Our data suggest that both Gab1-SHP-2 complex formation and SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity are important for PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation. Specifically, 1) SHP-2-(399–593) mutant associated with Gab1 and increased wild type SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase and Elk-1 activity; 2) SHP-2-(198–593) mutant had significantly high SHP-2 phosphatase activity but inhibited PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation; 3) SHP-2C/S and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) mutants associated with Gab1 but inhibited PDGF-induced SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activity; 4) the association of SHP-2-(399–593) with Gab1 was inhibited by co-transfection of SHP-2-(1–202) or SHP-2-(1–411), and SHP-2-(399–593)-mediated SHP-2 phosphatase and Elk-1 activation was inhibited by co-transfection of SHP-2-(1–202) and -(1–411). Our results are in agreement with a previous study in which mutation of the SHP-2 binding site of Gab1 inhibited growth factor-induced ERK1/2 activation (24Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we propose a scheme for PDGF-mediated SHP-2 activation leading to Elk-1 activation (Fig. 9). A novel aspect of this model is the significant role of C-terminal region of SHP-2-(399–593) to activate Elk-1. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the N-terminal SH2 domain binds with the phosphatase domain and directly blocks its catalytic site (Fig. 9 A, top). Interaction of N-terminal SH2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated ligand, such as Gab1 and PDGF receptor, disrupts its phosphatase recognition surface and generates an open (“active”) state of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase activity (step 1) (9Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that the N-terminal domain of SHP-2 also inhibits Gab1 association with the C-terminal region of SHP-2 (Figs. 8 and 9 A,middle, step 1). SHP-2 forms a dimer and thereby activates SHP-2 phosphatase activity and Gab1 association with the C-terminal region of SHP-2 (Fig. 9 A,bottom, step 2). The combination of Gab1 association with the C-terminal region of SHP-2 and activating SHP-2 phosphatase activity are both critical for PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation (Fig. 9 A). As shown in Fig. 9 B, SHP-2C/S and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) can form a dimer (Fig. 4 B) and associate with Gab1 (Fig. 2 D). However, SHP-2C/S and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) inhibit PDGF-induced SHP-2 phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 C) and Elk-1 activation (Fig. 7, B andH). In contrast, SHP-2-(198–593) (Fig. 9 C) has SHP-2 phosphatase activity but is unable to interact with Gab1 (Fig.5 B) and inhibit PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation (Fig.7 E). Shi et al. (23Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have reported that in fibroblast cells, which express a deletion of 65 amino acids in the N-terminal SH2 SHP-2Δ46–110 domain EGF-induced Ras, Raf-1, and ERK activation were significantly decreased although such a deletion at the N-terminal produces a constitutively active form of SHP-2 (7Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dechert U. Adam M. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results can be explained by the schema in Fig. 9 C as similar to the inhibitory effect of SHP-2-(198–593). SHP-2-(198–593) reveals a significantly high level of SHP-2 phosphatase activation (Fig.3 B). Since PDGF-β receptor can be a substrate of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, it is possible that SHP-2-(198–593) dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-β receptor, thereby preventing PDGF-induced Elk-1 activation. Further investigation is needed to clarify the inhibitory mechanism of SHP-2-(198–593). Maroun et al. (16Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of a catalytically inactive SHP-2 protein (SHP-2C/S) abrogates Met-induced ERK activation, suggesting that SHP-2 phosphatase activity is required for Met receptor-induced ERK1/2 activation. These results can be explained by the schema in Fig. 9 B. Of note, we found that SHP-2-(399–593) activated counterpart SHP-2 phosphatase activity, but SHP-2-(399–593C/S) inhibited PDGF-induced SHP-2 phosphatase activity. Since both mutants of SHP-2-(399–593) and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) did not have phosphatase activity, the inhibition of wild type SHP-2 phosphatase activity mediated by SHP-2-(399–593C/S) may be due to the conformation change by the binding of SHP-2 mutants, which are mutated at Cys459 to Ser. Further investigation is needed to clarify the inhibitory mechanism for SHP-2-(399–593C/S). As we stated in the Introduction, there are three possible models to explain the role of SHP-2 in Elk-1 activation: 1) the combination of both SHP-2-Gab1 complex formation and SHP-2 phosphatase activity is critical for ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activation; 2) Gab1 associates with N-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2, increases SHP-2 phosphatase activity, and then activates ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activity; or 3) the association of Gab1 with SHP-2 is the only critical mechanism to regulate ERK1/2 and Elk-1 activity, and SHP-2 phosphatase activity is not directly involved in this process. Model 2 can explain the first step of SHP-2 activation in Fig. 9 A but not the inhibitory effect of SHP-2-(198–593), which is a constitutively active form of SHP-2, on Elk-1 activation (Fig. 9 C). In contrast, it is possible to explain the inhibitory effect of SHP-2-(198–593) (Fig. 9 C) on Elk-1 activation by model 3. However, the inhibitory effect of SHP-2C/S and SHP-2-(399–593C/S) cannot be explained by model 3. If “trapping” of Gab1 by SHP-2C/S is the main inhibitory mechanism of SHP-2C/S as explained in the Introduction, it is difficult to explain how SHP-2-(399–593) can activate Elk-1, because SHP-2-(399–593) has no phosphatase activity but can associate with Gab1 similarly to SHP-2C/S. Therefore, model 1 is the most likely mechanism of SHP-2 function in Elk-1 activation shown in Fig.9 A. We thank Dr. Harlan E. Ives for providing the PDGF receptor wild type- and mutant-overexpressing CHO cells."
