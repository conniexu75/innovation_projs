https://openalex.org/W3157665187,"Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction1–3. The properties of these materials evolve dynamically and heterogeneously4 with applied voltage through ion insertion redox reactions, converting materials that are inactive under open circuit conditions into active electrocatalysts during operation5. The catalytic state is thus inherently far from equilibrium, which complicates its direct observation. Here, using a suite of correlative operando scanning probe and X-ray microscopy techniques, we establish a link between the oxygen evolution activity and the local operational chemical, physical and electronic nanoscale structure of single-crystalline β-Co(OH)2 platelet particles. At pre-catalytic voltages, the particles swell to form an α-CoO2H1.5·0.5H2O-like structure—produced through hydroxide intercalation—in which the oxidation state of cobalt is +2.5. Upon increasing the voltage to drive oxygen evolution, interlayer water and protons de-intercalate to form contracted β-CoOOH particles that contain Co3+ species. Although these transformations manifest heterogeneously through the bulk of the particles, the electrochemical current is primarily restricted to their edge facets. The observed Tafel behaviour is correlated with the local concentration of Co3+ at these reactive edge sites, demonstrating the link between bulk ion-insertion and surface catalytic activity. Mapping the operational chemical, physical and electronic structure of an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst at the nanoscale links the properties of the material with the observed oxygen evolution activity."
https://openalex.org/W3157724466,"Mitochondrial fission is a highly regulated process that, when disrupted, can alter metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis1–3. Dysregulation has been linked to neurodegeneration3,4, cardiovascular disease3 and cancer5. Key components of the fission machinery include the endoplasmic reticulum6 and actin7, which initiate constriction before dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)8 binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane via adaptor proteins9–11, to drive scission12. In the mitochondrial life cycle, fission enables both biogenesis of new mitochondria and clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria through mitophagy1,13. Current models of fission regulation cannot explain how those dual fates are decided. However, uncovering fate determinants is challenging, as fission is unpredictable, and mitochondrial morphology is heterogeneous, with ultrastructural features that are below the diffraction limit. Here, we used live-cell structured illumination microscopy to capture mitochondrial dynamics. By analysing hundreds of fissions in African green monkey Cos-7 cells and mouse cardiomyocytes, we discovered two functionally and mechanistically distinct types of fission. Division at the periphery enables damaged material to be shed into smaller mitochondria destined for mitophagy, whereas division at the midzone leads to the proliferation of mitochondria. Both types are mediated by DRP1, but endoplasmic reticulum- and actin-mediated pre-constriction and the adaptor MFF govern only midzone fission. Peripheral fission is preceded by lysosomal contact and is regulated by the mitochondrial outer membrane protein FIS1. These distinct molecular mechanisms explain how cells independently regulate fission, leading to distinct mitochondrial fates. Mitochondrial fission at the organelle periphery generates small daughter mitochondria that are removed by mitophagy whereas fission at the midzone leads to proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3159302505,"Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is an enigmatic group of diagnoses where the primary anatomical site of tumor origin cannot be determined. This poses a significant challenge since modern therapeutics such as chemotherapy regimen and immune checkpoint inhibitors are specific to the primary tumor. Recent work has focused on using genomics and transcriptomics for identification of tumor origins. However, genomic testing is not conducted for every patient and lacks clinical penetration in low resource settings. Herein, to overcome these challenges, we present a deep learning-based computational pathology algorithm-TOAD-that can provide a differential diagnosis for CUP using routinely acquired histology slides. We used 17,486 gigapixel whole slide images with known primaries spread over 18 common origins to train a multi-task deep model to simultaneously identify the tumor as primary or metastatic and predict its site of origin. We tested our model on an internal test set of 4,932 cases with known primaries and achieved a top-1 accuracy of 0.84, a top-3 accuracy of 0.94 while on our external test set of 662 cases from 202 different hospitals, it achieved a top-1 and top-3 accuracy of 0.79 and 0.93 respectively. We further curated a dataset of 717 CUP cases from 151 different medical centers and identified a subset of 290 cases for which a differential diagnosis was assigned. Our model predictions resulted in concordance for 50% of cases (\k{appa}=0.4 when adjusted for agreement by chance) and a top-3 agreement of 75%. Our proposed method can be used as an assistive tool to assign differential diagnosis to complicated metastatic and CUP cases and could be used in conjunction with or in lieu of immunohistochemical analysis and extensive diagnostic work-ups to reduce the occurrence of CUP."
https://openalex.org/W3159073875,"Recent studies have provided insights into innate and adaptive immune dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed humoral immune responses in 229 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se but, rather, with the delayed kinetics of NAb production."
https://openalex.org/W3136144856,"The Paris Agreement aims to limit global mean warming in the twenty-first century to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and to promote further efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius1. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades will be consequential for global mean sea level (GMSL) on century and longer timescales through a combination of ocean thermal expansion and loss of land ice2. The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is Earth's largest land ice reservoir (equivalent to 57.9 metres of GMSL)3, and its ice loss is accelerating4. Extensive regions of the AIS are grounded below sea level and susceptible to dynamical instabilities5-8 that are capable of producing very rapid retreat8. Yet the potential for the implementation of the Paris Agreement temperature targets to slow or stop the onset of these instabilities has not been directly tested with physics-based models. Here we use an observationally calibrated ice sheet-shelf model to show that with global warming limited to 2 degrees Celsius or less, Antarctic ice loss will continue at a pace similar to today's throughout the twenty-first century. However, scenarios more consistent with current policies (allowing 3 degrees Celsius of warming) give an abrupt jump in the pace of Antarctic ice loss after around 2060, contributing about 0.5 centimetres GMSL rise per year by 2100-an order of magnitude faster than today4. More fossil-fuel-intensive scenarios9 result in even greater acceleration. Ice-sheet retreat initiated by the thinning and loss of buttressing ice shelves continues for centuries, regardless of bedrock and sea-level feedback mechanisms10-12 or geoengineered carbon dioxide reduction. These results demonstrate the possibility that rapid and unstoppable sea-level rise from Antarctica will be triggered if Paris Agreement targets are exceeded."
https://openalex.org/W3159951467,"The land ice contribution to global mean sea level rise has not yet been predicted1 using ice sheet and glacier models for the latest set of socio-economic scenarios, nor using coordinated exploration of uncertainties arising from the various computer models involved. Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models2-8, but primarily used previous-generation scenarios9 and climate models10, and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios11,12 using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained."
https://openalex.org/W3159347070,"In only a few decades, lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized technologies, enabling the proliferation of portable devices and electric vehicles1, with substantial benefits for society. However, the rapid growth in technology has highlighted the ethical and environmental challenges of mining lithium, cobalt and other mineral ore resources, and the issues associated with the safe usage and non-hazardous disposal of batteries2. Only a small fraction of lithium-ion batteries are recycled, further exacerbating global material supply of strategic elements3-5. A potential alternative is to use organic-based redox-active materials6-8 to develop rechargeable batteries that originate from ethically sourced, sustainable materials and enable on-demand deconstruction and reconstruction. Making such batteries is challenging because the active materials must be stable during operation but degradable at end of life. Further, the degradation products should be either environmentally benign or recyclable for reconstruction into a new battery. Here we demonstrate a metal-free, polypeptide-based battery, in which viologens and nitroxide radicals are incorporated as redox-active groups along polypeptide backbones to function as anode and cathode materials, respectively. These redox-active polypeptides perform as active materials that are stable during battery operation and subsequently degrade on demand in acidic conditions to generate amino acids, other building blocks and degradation products. Such a polypeptide-based battery is a first step to addressing the need for alternative chemistries for green and sustainable batteries in a future circular economy."
https://openalex.org/W3158155618,"Epigenetic dysregulation is a defining feature of tumorigenesis that is implicated in immune escape1,2. Here, to identify factors that modulate the immune sensitivity of cancer cells, we performed in vivo CRISPR–Cas9 screens targeting 936 chromatin regulators in mouse tumour models treated with immune checkpoint blockade. We identified the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 and other members of the HUSH and KAP1 complexes as mediators of immune escape3–5. We also found that amplification of SETDB1 (1q21.3) in human tumours is associated with immune exclusion and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. SETDB1 represses broad domains, primarily within the open genome compartment. These domains are enriched for transposable elements (TEs) and immune clusters associated with segmental duplication events, a central mechanism of genome evolution6. SETDB1 loss derepresses latent TE-derived regulatory elements, immunostimulatory genes, and TE-encoded retroviral antigens in these regions, and triggers TE-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in vivo. Our study establishes SETDB1 as an epigenetic checkpoint that suppresses tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity, and thus represents a candidate target for immunotherapy. A CRISPR–Cas9 screen of chromatin regulators in mouse tumour models treated with immune checkpoint blockade identifies SETDB1 as an epigenetic checkpoint protein that suppresses tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W3159397410,"Disulfide bonds between cysteine residues are important post-translational modifications in proteins that have critical roles for protein structure and stability, as redox-active catalytic groups in enzymes or allosteric redox switches that govern protein function1–4. In addition to forming disulfide bridges, cysteine residues are susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, and are thus central not only to the scavenging of these but also to cellular signalling and communication in biological as well as pathological contexts5,6. Oxidized cysteine species are highly reactive and may form covalent conjugates with, for example, tyrosines in the active sites of some redox enzymes7,8. However, to our knowledge, regulatory switches with covalent crosslinks other than disulfides have not previously been demonstrated. Here we report the discovery of a covalent crosslink between a cysteine and a lysine residue with a NOS bridge that serves as an allosteric redox switch in the transaldolase enzyme of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhoea. X-ray structure analysis of the protein in the oxidized and reduced state reveals a loaded-spring mechanism that involves a structural relaxation upon redox activation, which is propagated from the allosteric redox switch at the protein surface to the active site in the protein interior. This relaxation leads to a reconfiguration of key catalytic residues and elicits an increase in enzymatic activity of several orders of magnitude. The redox switch is highly conserved in related transaldolases from other members of the Neisseriaceae; for example, it is present in the transaldolase of Neisseria meningitides (a pathogen that is the primary cause of meningitis and septicaemia in children). We surveyed the Protein Data Bank and found that the NOS bridge exists in diverse protein families across all domains of life (including Homo sapiens) and that it is often located at catalytic or regulatory hotspots. Our findings will inform strategies for the design of proteins and peptides, as well as the development of new classes of drugs and antibodies that target the lysine–cysteine redox switch9,10. A NOS bridge between cysteine and lysine residues serves as an allosteric redox switch in the transaldolase enzyme of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, demonstrating the existence of protein regulatory switches that contain covalent crosslinks other than disulfides."

https://openalex.org/W3158550782,"Odours are transported in turbulent plumes, which result in rapid concentration fluctuations1,2 that contain rich information about the olfactory scenery, such as the composition and location of an odour source2–4. However, it is unclear whether the mammalian olfactory system can use the underlying temporal structure to extract information about the environment. Here we show that ten-millisecond odour pulse patterns produce distinct responses in olfactory receptor neurons. In operant conditioning experiments, mice discriminated temporal correlations of rapidly fluctuating odours at frequencies of up to 40 Hz. In imaging and electrophysiological recordings, such correlation information could be readily extracted from the activity of mitral and tufted cells—the output neurons of the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, temporal correlation of odour concentrations5 reliably predicted whether odorants emerged from the same or different sources in naturalistic environments with complex airflow. Experiments in which mice were trained on such tasks and probed using synthetic correlated stimuli at different frequencies suggest that mice can use the temporal structure of odours to extract information about space. Thus, the mammalian olfactory system has access to unexpectedly fast temporal features in odour stimuli. This endows animals with the capacity to overcome key behavioural challenges such as odour source separation5, figure–ground segregation6 and odour localization7 by extracting information about space from temporal odour dynamics. Fast temporal dynamics of the olfactory environment can be perceived by mice and used to perform scene segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3157227076,"Aim The lockdown of sports infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially shifted people’s physical activity towards public green spaces. With Germany’s lockdown as one of the more severe governmentally imposed epidemic-control-decisions, we tested to what extent the frequency of outdoor cycling activities changed from March to June 2020. Methods User behaviour and frequency in 15 urban and 7 rural German public green spaces was quantified using cycling data from the fitness application Strava. Changes in cycling activities were analysed with four different generalised linear models, correcting for factors like weather conditions and temporal changes in the user base of the fitness application. Results We found a clear increase in outdoor cycling sport activities in urban public green spaces in response to epidemic-control decisions (e.g. increase by 81% in April relative to the expected value (95% CI [48%, 110%])). In contrast, biking in rural areas showed no significant change with epidemic-control-decisions in place. Conclusion Fitness App data, e.g. from Strava, can be used to monitor visitor behaviour and frequency. The increase in outdoor cycling activities during epidemic control decisions likely reflects a shift of sport activities from indoor and team sports to outdoor and individual sports. This highlights the importance of accessible green space for maintaining physical fitness and health. Beyond this shift, it is likely that outdoor activities may be of particularly importance for stress relief in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3159973781,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have essential functions during embryonic development, and their dysregulation causes cancer1,2. Altered global miRNA abundance is found in different tissues and tumours, which implies that precise control of miRNA dosage is important1,3,4, but the underlying mechanism(s) of this control remain unknown. The protein complex Microprocessor, which comprises one DROSHA and two DGCR8 proteins, is essential for miRNA biogenesis5-7. Here we identify a developmentally regulated miRNA dosage control mechanism that involves alternative transcription initiation (ATI) of DGCR8. ATI occurs downstream of a stem-loop in DGCR8 mRNA to bypass an autoregulatory feedback loop during mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell differentiation. Deletion of the stem-loop causes imbalanced DGCR8:DROSHA protein stoichiometry that drives irreversible Microprocessor aggregation, reduced primary miRNA processing, decreased mature miRNA abundance, and widespread de-repression of lipid metabolic mRNA targets. Although global miRNA dosage control is not essential for mES cells to exit from pluripotency, its dysregulation alters lipid metabolic pathways and interferes with embryonic development by disrupting germ layer specification in vitro and in vivo. This miRNA dosage control mechanism is conserved in humans. Our results identify a promoter switch that balances Microprocessor autoregulation and aggregation to precisely control global miRNA dosage and govern stem cell fate decisions during early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W3157416777,"<h2>Summary</h2> DNA base editors and prime editing technology enable therapeutic <i>in situ</i> correction of disease-causing alleles. These techniques could have broad applications for <i>ex vivo</i> editing of cells prior to transplantation in a range of diseases, but it is critical that the target population is efficiently modified and engrafts into the host. Chemically derived hepatic progenitors (CdHs) are a multipotent population capable of robust engraftment and hepatocyte differentiation. Here we reprogrammed hepatocytes from a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) into expandable CdHs and successfully corrected the disease-causing mutation using both adenine base editors (ABEs) and prime editors (PEs). ABE- and PE-corrected CdHs repopulated the liver with fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-positive cells and dramatically increased survival of mutant HT1 mice. These results demonstrate the feasibility of precise gene editing in transplantable cell populations for potential treatment of genetic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W3159360609,"This study is the first in the world to investigate the expected impact of the COVID-19 crisis on career outcomes and career aspirations. To this end, high-quality survey research with a relevant sample of Flemish (Belgian) employees was conducted. About 21% of them fear losing their jobs due to the crisis—14% are concerned that they will even lose their jobs in the near future. In addition, 26% expect to miss out on promotions that they would have received had the COVID-19 crisis not occurred. This fear of a negative impact is higher in vulnerable groups, such migrants. In addition, we observe that many respondents believe they will look at the labour market differently and will have different work-related priorities in the future. In this respect, more than half of the respondents indicate that they have attached more importance to working conditions and work-life balance since the COVID-19 crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3160659675,"Exciting phenomena may emerge in non-centrosymmetric two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) interplays dynamically with Coulomb interactions, band topology, and external modulating forces, etc. Here, we report illuminating synergetic effects between SOC and Stark in centrosymmetric few-layer black arsenic (BAs), manifested as giant Rashba valley splitting and exotic quantum Hall states (QHS) reversibly controlled by electrostatic gating. The unusual finding is rooted in the puckering square lattice of BAs, in which heavy $4p$ orbitals form highly asymmetric $\Gamma$ valley with the $p_{z}$ symmetry and $D$ valleys of the $p_{x}$ origin, located at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center and near the time reversal invariant momenta of $X$, respectively. When the structure inversion symmetry is broken by perpendicular electric field, giant Rashba SOC is activated for the $p_{x}$ bands to produce strong spin-polarized $D^{+}$ and $D^{-}$ valleys related by time-reversal symmetry, coexisting with weak $\Gamma$ Rashba bands constrained by the $p_{z}$ symmetry. Intriguingly, strong Stark effect shows the same $p_{x}$-orbital selectiveness for $D$, collectively shifting the valence band maximum of $D^{\pm}$ valleys to exceed the $\Gamma$ pockets. Such an orchestrating effect between SOC and Stark allows us to realize gate-tunable spin valley manipulations for 2D hole gas, as revealed by unconventional magnetic field triggered even-to-odd transitions in QHS. For electron doping, the quantization of the $\Gamma$ Rashba bands is characterized by peculiar density-dependent transitions in band topology from two parabolic valleys to a unique inner-outer helical structure when charge carrier concentrations increase."
https://openalex.org/W3159054871,"Cell extrusion is a mechanism of cell elimination that is used by organisms as diverse as sponges, nematodes, insects and mammals1-3. During extrusion, a cell detaches from a layer of surrounding cells while maintaining the continuity of that layer4. Vertebrate epithelial tissues primarily eliminate cells by extrusion, and the dysregulation of cell extrusion has been linked to epithelial diseases, including cancer1,5. The mechanisms that drive cell extrusion remain incompletely understood. Here, to analyse cell extrusion by Caenorhabditis elegans embryos3, we conducted a genome-wide RNA interference screen, identified multiple cell-cycle genes with S-phase-specific function, and performed live-imaging experiments to establish how those genes control extrusion. Extruding cells experience replication stress during S phase and activate a replication-stress response via homologues of ATR and CHK1. Preventing S-phase entry, inhibiting the replication-stress response, or allowing completion of the cell cycle blocked cell extrusion. Hydroxyurea-induced replication stress6,7 triggered ATR-CHK1- and p53-dependent cell extrusion from a mammalian epithelial monolayer. We conclude that cell extrusion induced by replication stress is conserved among animals and propose that this extrusion process is a primordial mechanism of cell elimination with a tumour-suppressive function in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3157050227,"Background The wellbeing of family caregivers of mentally ill persons has often been ignored, despite that family caregivers can be predisposed to psychiatric morbidities and burden in caring for their mentally ill family members. This study examined the levels of psychological distress and burden of care experienced by family caregivers who care for their mentally ill relatives in Edo State, Nigeria. Methods This study assessed psychological distress using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Burden of care was measured using the 22-item Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) questionnaire. Multiple linear regression was done to determine factors associated with burden of care and psychological distress, while factor analysis was used to determine the underlying forms of burden of care and psychological distress among participants. Results Caregivers studied were relatives of patients diagnosed for depression (25.1%), substance use disorder (22.2%), schizophrenia (20.2%) and bipolar affective disorder (11.1%). Approximately 15% experienced no-to-mild burden, 51.3% mild-to-moderate burden and 34.0% high-or-severe burden. Nearly halve (49.0%) of participants experienced psychological distress. Severe rate of psychological distress was observed among subjects caring for patients with schizophrenia (60.7%), epilepsy (60.0%), substance use disorder (52.2%) and depression (49.0%). High burden of care was more preponderant among caregivers of relatives with mental retardation and epilepsy (50% each) and schizophrenia (39.3%). Having a higher educational qualification and being self-employed was a predictor of psychological distress. Gender of caregiver and the diagnosis schizophrenia among relatives of caregivers predisposed to burden of care. Three factors including social and emotional dysfunction, psychological distress and cognitive dysfunction were identified as components of psychological health through factor analysis. On the burden scale, six factor components were identified as: personal strain, role strain, intolerance, patients’ dependence, guilt and interference in personal life. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of psychological morbidity and burden of care among family caregivers providing care for persons with mental illness."
https://openalex.org/W3157234397,"The heat and mass transfer on time dependent hydrodynamic squeeze flow of Jeffrey nanofluid across two plates over permeable medium in the slip condition with heat generation/absorption, thermal radiation and chemical reaction are investigated. The impacts of Brownian motion and thermophoresis is examined in the Buongiorno’s nanofluid model. Conversion of the governing partial differential equations to the ordinary differential equations is conducted via similarity transformation. The dimensionless equations are solved by imposing numerical method of Keller-box. The outputs are compared with previous reported works in the journals for the validation of the present outputs and found in proper agreement. The behavior of velocity, temperature, and nanoparticles concentration profiles by varying the pertinent parameters are examined. Findings portray that the acceleration of the velocity profile and the wall shear stress is due to the squeezing of plates. Furthermore, the velocity, temperature and concentration profile decline with boost in Hartmann number and ratio of relaxation to retardation times. It is discovered that the rate of heat transfer and temperature profile increase when viscous dissipation, thermophoresis and heat source/sink rises. In contrast, the increment of thermal radiation reduces the temperature and enhances the heat transfer rate. Besides, the mass transfer rate decelerates for increasing Brownian motion in nanofluid, while it elevates when chemical reaction and thermophoresis increases."
https://openalex.org/W3157463272,"Galaxy clusters are known to harbour magnetic fields. The nature of the intra-cluster magnetic fields remains an unresolved question. Intra-cluster magnetic field can be observed at the density contact discontinuity formed by cool and dense plasma running into hot ambient plasma, and the discontinuity exists near the 2nd BCG MRC 0600-399 of a merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376 (z=0.0461, hereafter as A3376). Elongated X-ray image in the east-west direction with a comet-like structure reaches a Mpc-scale (Fig1.(a)). Previous radio observations detected the bent jets from MRC 0600-399, moving in same direction as the sub-cluster's motion against ram pressure.Here we report a new radio observation of a radio galaxy MRC 0600-399 which is 3.4 times and 11 times higher resolution and sensitivity than the previous results. Contrary to typical jets, the MRC 0600-399 shows a 90deg bend at the contact discontinuity and the collimated jets further extend over 100 kpc from the bend point. Diffuse, elongated emission named ""double-scythe"" structures were detected for the first time. The spectral index flattens downstream of the bend point, indicating cosmic-ray re-acceleration. High-resolution numerical simulations reveal that the ordered magnetic field along the discontinuity plays a significant role in the change in the jet direction. The morphology of the ""double-scythe"" bear remarkable similarities with the simulations, which strengthens our understanding of the interaction between relativistic electrons and intra-cluster magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W3157886387,"The paper aimed at examining the influence of consumer’s environmental awareness on their intention to visit green hotels in north Cyprus, the mediation role of consumption values. Research on eco-friendly hotels stressed that conventional hotels do not make available to consumers the environmental awareness and consumption values, whereas, there is possibility that these benefits might not sit well with the hotel potential consumers. Aside highlighting the features of green hotels, it is imperative to examine how consumers perceive consumption values. A questionnaire-based survey was used to examine the study’s objectives. A total of 400 customers at 20 five-stars hotels that were randomly selected across the 3 big cities in north Cyprus (Girne, Lefkosa, and Magusa) were approached and invited to participate. The structural model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The configuration model was analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) method. The finding from the SEM results shows that environmental concern directly and positively influenced the guests’ intentions to visit hotels in north Cyprus. Moreover, functional and emotional values were found to mediate the relationship between environmental concern and knowledge on the guests’ intention to visit north Cyprus hotels. Finally, the study suggest that the research will be of benefit to the managers of hotels in north Cyprus to know the significance of developing consumer’s green awareness and to market it to the customers."
https://openalex.org/W3159499399,"In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95—0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88—0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients’ neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W3159957578,"High uptake and optimal adherence to Option B+ antiretroviral therapy (ART) increase effectiveness in averting mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Option B+ ART uptake, early adherence, and associated factors need to be evaluated in Central Uganda.A mixed approaches study was carried out in six health facilities in Masaka, Mityana, and Luwero districts from October 2013 to February 2016. Questionnaires were administered to 507 HIV positive pregnant females seeking antenatal care services. Key informant interviews were conducted with 54 health providers, and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 57 HIV positive women on Option B+ ART. Quantitative data were analyzed using log-binomial regression model to determine factors associated with optimal adherence (taking at least 95% of the prescribed ART), while thematic analysis was used on qualitative data.Ninety one percent of women (463/507) received a prescription of life long ART. Of these, 93.3% (432/463) started swallowing their medicines. Overall, 83% of women who received ART prescriptions (310/374) felt they were ready to initiate ART immediately. Main motivating factors to swallow ART among those who received a prescription were women's personal desire to be healthy (92.3%) and desire to protect their babies (90.6%). Optimal adherence to ART was achieved by 76.8% (315/410). Adherence was higher among females who were ready to start ART (adj. PR = 3.20; 95% CI: 1.15-8.79) and those who had revealed their HIV positive result to someone (adj. PR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.46). Facilitators of ART uptake from qualitative findings included adequate counseling, willingness to start, and knowing the benefits of ART. Reasons for refusal to start ART included being unready to start ART, fear to take ART for life, doubt of HIV positive results, and preference for local herbs. Reasons for non-adherence were travelling far away from health facilities, fear of side effects, non-disclosure of HIV results to anyone, and perception that the baby is safe from HIV infection post-delivery.Uptake of Option B+ ART was very high. However, failure to start swallowing ART and sub-optimal adherence are a major public health concern. Enhancing women's readiness to start ART and encouraging HIV result revelation could improve ART uptake and adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3157796250,"In sports and movement sciences isometric muscle function is usually measured by pushing against a stable resistance. However, subjectively one can hold or push isometrically. Several investigations suggest a distinction of those forms. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these two forms of isometric muscle action can be distinguished by objective parameters in an interpersonal setting. 20 subjects were grouped in 10 same sex pairs, in which one partner should perform the pushing isometric muscle action (PIMA) and the other partner executed the holding isometric muscle action (HIMA). The partners had contact at the distal forearms via an interface, which included a strain gauge and an acceleration sensor. The mechanical oscillations of the triceps brachii (MMGtri) muscle, its tendon (MTGtri) and the abdominal muscle (MMGobl) were recorded by a piezoelectric-sensor-based measurement system. Each partner performed three 15s (80% MVIC) and two fatiguing trials (90% MVIC) during PIMA and HIMA, respectively. Parameters to compare PIMA and HIMA were the mean frequency, the normalized mean amplitude, the amplitude variation, the power in the frequency range of 8 to 15 Hz, a special power-frequency ratio and the number of task failures during HIMA or PIMA (partner who quit the task). A “HIMA failure” occurred in 85% of trials ( p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences between PIMA and HIMA were found for the mean frequency and normalized amplitude. The MMGobl showed significantly higher values of amplitude variation (15s: p = 0.013; fatiguing: p = 0.007) and of power-frequency-ratio (15s: p = 0.040; fatiguing: p = 0.002) during HIMA and a higher power in the range of 8 to 15 Hz during PIMA (15s: p = 0.001; fatiguing: p = 0.011). MMGtri and MTGtri showed no significant differences. Based on the findings it is suggested that a holding and a pushing isometric muscle action can be distinguished objectively, whereby a more complex neural control is assumed for HIMA."
https://openalex.org/W3157907312,"Pressure ulcer (PU) is known as the third most costly disorder usually caused by prolonged pressure and stagnation in various parts of the body. Although several therapeutic approaches are employing, obstacles in appropriate healing for skin lesions still exist which necessitates new practical alternative or adjunctive treatments. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) as one of the mentioned new strategies have gained attention. Besides, curcumin is an herbal medicine extracted from turmeric with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties with promising beneficial therapeutic effects in wound healing. Employing dendrosomal nanoparticles, we overcome the hydrophobicity of curcumin in the present study. We hypothesized that combination treatment of DNC+LLLT (450 nm) simultaneously may promote the wound healing process.MTT assay, PI staining followed by flowcytometry, scratch assay and intracellular ROS measurement were used to investigate the effects caused by DNC and LLLT (450 nm) alone and in combination, on proliferation, cell cycle, migration and oxidative stress mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, respectively. The levels of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by qRT-PCR and ELISA.Our results indicated that combination exposure with DNC and LLLT leads to increased proliferation and migration of MEFs as well as being more efficient in significantly upregulating growth factors (TGF-β, VEGF) and decline in inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6). Moreover, findings of this research provide persuasive support for the notion that DNC could reduce the LLLT-induced enhancement in intracellular ROS in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.Concurrent exposure to anti-oxidant concentrations of DNC and LLLT enriched S phase entry and therefor increased proliferation as well as migration on MEFs through regulating the expression levels growth factors and shortening the inflammatory phase by modulating of cytokines. It should be noted that DNC were able to reduce the laser-induced oxidative stress, during wound healing, representing an informative accompaniment with LLLT."
https://openalex.org/W3159865276,"Shear stress induced by laminar blood flow has a profound effect on the morphology and functional phenotype of macrovascular endothelial cells. The influence of laminar flow on the glomerular microvascular endothelium, however, remains largely elusive. The glomerular endothelium, including its glycocalyx, is a crucial part of the glomerular filtration barrier, which is involved in blood filtration. We therefore investigated the influence of laminar flow-induced shear stress on the glomerular endothelium. Conditionally immortalized mouse glomerular endothelial cells were cultured for 7 days under a laminar flow of 5 dyn/cm2 to mimic the glomerular blood flow. The cells were subsequently analysed for changes in morphology, expression of shear stress-responsive genes, nitric oxide production, glycocalyx composition, expression of anti-oxidant genes and the inflammatory response. Culture under laminar flow resulted in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell alignment compared to static conditions. Moreover, production of nitric oxide was increased and the expression of the main functional component of the glycocalyx, Heparan Sulfate, was enhanced in response to shear stress. Furthermore, glomerular endothelial cells demonstrated a quiescent phenotype under flow, characterized by a decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory gene ICAM-1 and increased expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes HO-1 and NQO1. Upon exposure to the inflammatory stimulus TNFα, however, glomerular endothelial cells cultured under laminar flow showed an enhanced inflammatory response. In conclusion, laminar flow extensively affects the morphology and functional phenotype of glomerular endothelial cells in culture. Furthermore, glomerular endothelial cells respond differently to shear stress compared to macrovascular endothelium. To improve the translation of future in vitro studies with glomerular endothelial cells to the in vivo situation, it appears therefore crucial to culture glomerular endothelial cells under physiological flow conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3129215346,"Phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a chemopreventive compound, is highly reactive due to its considerably electrophilic nature. Furthermore, it is hydrophobic and has low stability, bioavailability and bioaccessibility. This restricts its use in biomedical and nutraceutical or food applications. Thus, the encapsulation of this agent has the function of overcoming these limitations, promoting its solubility in water, and stabilizing it, preserving its bioactivity. So, polymeric microparticles were developed using chitosan-olive oil-PEITC systems. For this, an optimisation process (factors: olive oil: chitosan ratio and PEITC: chitosan ratio) was implemented through a 3-level factorial experimental design. The responses were: the particle size, zeta-potential, polydisperse index, and entrapment efficiency. The optimal formulation was further characterised by FTIR and biocompatibility in Caco-2 cells. Optimal conditions were olive oil: chitosan and PEITC: chitosan ratios of 1.46 and 0.25, respectively. These microparticles had a size of 629 nm, a zeta-potential of 32.3 mV, a polydispersity index of 0.329, and entrapment efficiency of 98.49%. We found that the inclusion process affected the optical behaviour of the PEITC, as well as the microparticles themselves and their interaction with the medium. Furthermore, the microparticles did not show cytotoxicity within the therapeutic values of PEITC. Thus, PEITC was microencapsulated with characteristics suitable for potential biomedical, nutraceutical and food applications."
https://openalex.org/W3157742581,"Aquatic ecosystems nowadays are under constant pressure, either from recent or historical events. In most systems with increased nutrient supply, submerged macrophytes got replaced by another stable state, dominated by phytoplankton as main primary producer. Yet, reducing the nutrient supply did not yield the aimed goal of restored habitats for submerged macrophytes in systems worldwide. The question arises, why submerged macrophytes do not re-colonize, and if they are actually competitive. Therefore, primary production assays were conducted in ex-situ bentho-pelagic mesocosms and compared to the actual ecosystem, a turbid brackish lagoon of the southern Baltic Sea. Mesocosm were either manipulated to be colonized by macrophytes, or stayed phytoplankton dominated. Oxygen evolution was monitored over a period of five months in 5 min (mesocosms) to 10 min (ecosystem) intervals. Surface and depth-integrated production was calculated to analyse seasonal and areal resolved production patterns. It was found that macrophyte mesocosms were more stable, when considering only surface O 2 production. However, calculating depth-integrated production resulted in net-heterotrophy in both shallow mesocosms approaches and the actual ecosystem. This heterotrophy is likely mediated by sediment respiration and POC accumulation in mesocosms, and a low share of productive to respiring water column in the actual ecosystem. Therefore, it seems unlikely that macrophytes will re-settle, as constant net-heterotrophy may allow for high-nutrient turnover at sediment-water interfaces and within the water column, favouring phytoplankton. These results will assist decision makers in developing more effective restoration measures that can mitigate the negative effects of eutrophication on ecosystem function and services."
https://openalex.org/W3158261449,"Activities attested since at least 2.6 Myr, such as stone knapping, marrow extraction, and woodworking may have allowed early hominins to recognize the technological potential of discarded skeletal remains and equipped them with a transferable skillset fit for the marginal modification and utilization of bone flakes. Identifying precisely when and where expedient bone tools were used in prehistory nonetheless remains a challenging task owing to the multiple natural and anthropogenic processes that can mimic deliberately knapped bones. Here, we compare a large sample of the faunal remains from Lingjing, a 115 ka-old site from China which has yielded important hominin remains and rich faunal and lithic assemblages, with bone fragments produced by experimentally fracturing Equus caballus long bones. Our results provide a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria that can help zooarchaeologists and bone technologists distinguish faunal remains with intentional flake removal scars from those resulting from carcass processing activities. Experimental data shows marrow extraction seldom generates diaphyseal fragments bearing more than six flake scars arranged contiguously or in interspersed series. Long bone fragments presenting such characteristics can, therefore, be interpreted as being purposefully knapped to be used as expediency tools. The identification, based on the above experimental criteria, of 56 bone tools in the Lingjing faunal assemblage is consistent with the smaller size of the lithics found in the same layer. The continuity gradient observed in the size of lithics and knapped bones suggests the latter were used for tasks in which the former were less or not effective."

The primary aim of the study was to analyse genetic diversity and breed composition of GWM sheep. Furthermore, different measures of computing inbreeding from the runs of homozygosity (ROH) were investigated. Data for GWM consisted of pedigree information on 19,000 animals and 40,753 quality filtered SNPs on 46 individuals. Additionally, publicly available genotype data on 209 individuals belonging to nine sheep breeds were included in the analysis. Due to evenness of SNPs spacing and proportionality of the number of SNPs in each autosome to autosome length, a high correlation (rp = 0.99) was found between genomic inbreeding coefficients computed based on the length of ROH (FROH_L) and those computed relative to the number of SNPs in ROH (FROH_N). Total inbreeding was partitioned into values for individual chromosomes revealing the highest levels of inbreeding on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3. Correlations between the ROH-based inbreeding measures and pedigree inbreeding reached 0.82. The observed heterozygosity estimate in GWM was high (0.39), however, the breed suffered low level of effective population size (~50) from a genomic viewpoint. Moreover, effective number of founders (186), and effective number of ancestors (144) implied disequilibrium of founder contribution and a genetic bottleneck in the breed. Multidimensional scaling and network visualisation analyses revealed close connectedness of GWM to BDC and German Texel (GTX). A model-based admixture analysis consistently indicated the flow of genes from other breeds, particularly BDC to GWM. Our analyses highlight the mixed genetic background of GWM sheep and furthermore, suggest a close monitoring of the breed to consolidate its genetic diversity while averting further reduction in the effective population size."

We then investigated the mechanism of EA in beige remodeling with a particular focus on DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission and SIRT3. EA induced the trans-differentiation of white adipocytes to beige adipocytes by promoting the expression of UCP1 and other brown and beige adipocytes/fat factors (PRDM16, UCP1, PGC1α, CD137, and TBX1) and mitochondrial dynamics-related factors (SIRT3, NRF1, CPT1β, DRP1, and FIS1) in 3T3-L1/SVF cells, and these were confirmed in the inguinal WAT of a cold-exposed mouse model. The browning effect of EA was abolished by a potent DRP1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 or SIRT3 knockdown, suggesting that EA induces beige remodeling of WAT by regulating the mitochondrial dynamics and SIRT3."

SP16 is a short polypeptide that mimics the LRP1 binding portion of alpha-1 antitrypsin.A pilot phase I, first-in-man, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled safety study was conducted to evaluate a subcutaneous injection at three dose levels of SP16 (0.0125, 0.05, and 0.2 mg/kg [up to 12 mg]) or matching placebo in 3:1 ratio in healthy individuals. Safety monitoring included vital signs, laboratory examinations (including hematology, coagulation, platelet function, chemistry, myocardial toxicity) and electrocardiography (to measure effect on PR, QRS, and QTc).Treatment with SP16 was not associated with treatment related serious adverse events. SP16 was associated with mild-moderate pain at the time of injection that was significantly higher than placebo on a 0-10 pain scale (6.0+/-1.4 [0.2 mg/kg] versus 1.5+/-2.1 [placebo], P = 0.0088).

https://openalex.org/W3157245444,"Two chaperones, Atp23p and Atp10p, were previously shown to regulate the assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase, and extra expression of ATP23 was found to partially rescue an atp10 deletion mutant, by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identified that the residues 112-115 (LRDK) of Atp23p were required for its function in assisting assembly of the synthase, and demonstrated both functions of Atp23p, processing subunit 6 precursor and assisting assembly of the synthase, were required for the partial rescue of atp10 deletion mutant. By chasing labeling with isotope 35S-methionine, we found the stability of subunit 6 of the synthase increased in atp10 null strain upon overexpression of ATP23. Further co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and blue native PAGE experiments showed that Atp23p and Atp10p were physically associated with each other in wild type. Moreover, we revealed the expression level of Atp23p increased in atp10 null mutant compared with the wild type. Furthermore, we found that, after 72 hours growth, atp10 null mutant showed leaky growth on respiratory substrates, presence of low level of subunit 6 and partial recovery of oligomycin sensitivity of mitochondrial ATPase activity. Further characterization revealed the expression of Atp23p increased after 24 hours growth in the mutant. These results indicated, in atp10 null mutant, ATP10 deficiency could be partially complemented with increased expression of Atp23p by stabilizing some subunit 6 of the synthase. Taken together, this study revealed the two chaperones Atp23p and Atp10p coordinated to regulate the assembly of mitochondrial ATP synthase, which advanced our understanding of mechanism of assembly of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase."

To determine whether a similar BCL-2 upregulation occurs in lapatinib-treated patients, we evaluated gene expression within tumor biopsies, collected before and after lapatinib or trastuzumab treatment, from the TRIO-B-07 clinical trial (NCT#00769470). We detected BCL2 mRNA upregulation in both HER2+/ER- as well as HER2+/ER+ patient tumors treated with lapatinib or trastuzumab. To address whether mRNA expression correlated with protein expression, we evaluated pre- and post-treatment tumors for BCL-2 via immunohistochemistry. Despite BCL2 mRNA upregulation within HER2+/ER- tumors, BCL-2 protein levels were undetectable in most of the lapatinib- or trastuzumab-treated HER2+/ER- tumors. BCL-2 upregulation was evident within the majority of lapatinib-treated HER2+/ER+ tumors and was often coupled with increased ER expression and decreased proliferation. Comparable BCL-2 upregulation was not observed within the trastuzumab-treated HER2+/ER+ tumors. Together, these results provide clinical validation of the BCL-2 induction associated with the adaptive response to lapatinib and support evaluation of BCL-2 inhibitors within the context of lapatinib and other HER2-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3158951575,"Background Hypertension (HPT) is an essential public health problem affecting both lower and middle-income countries disproportionately. Evidence suggests that HPT is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. Yet, challenges faced by patients with HPT in Ghana are not sufficiently explored. This study, documents the challenges patients with HPT face in Ghana. Methods We used an explorative descriptive qualitative design. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 patients with HPT. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic content analysis procedure was followed to analyse the data. Results Four main themes emerged from interviews; three of which pertained to dimensions of challenges and a fourth which pertained to coping strategies. These include: [1] impairment in physical activities and mobility constraints [2]. Psychological challenges such as suicidal ideations, sadness, fear, anxiety, and reduced sexual affection [3]. Socio-economic challenges identified include loss of friends and social network, difficulty in job demands, and financial burden, and [4] coping strategies such as health system support, social support, and religiosity were identified. Conclusion Patients with HPT experience an array of challenges. We suggest that health care facilities incorporate post HPT diagnosis counseling sessions for HPT patients in the study area. Also, the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) should re-examine their scope of services; thus, drugs, laboratory services, and electrocardiogram services to avoid the issue of co-payment. Collaboration between healthcare professionals and family relations of patients with HPT ought to also be strengthened to ensure optimal care."

However, little is known about predictors of mortality and LTF among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients in Oromia region, Ethiopia. The current study aimed to identify predictors of mortality and loss to follow-up among drug resistance tuberculosis patients in Oromia Hospitals, Ethiopia.A retrospective follow up study was carried out from 01 November 2012 to 31 December 2017 among DR-TB patients after calculating sample size using single proportion population formula. Mean, median, Frequency tables and bar charts were used to describe patients' characteristics in the cohort. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate the probability of death and LTF after the treatment was initiated. The log-rank test was used to compare time to death and time to LTF. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine predictors of mortality and LTF after DR-TB diagnosis. The Crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratio was used to measure the strength of association whereas p-value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistically significant predictors.A total of 406 DR-TB patients were followed for 7084 person-months observations. Among the patients, 71 (17.5%) died and 32 (7.9%) were lost to follow up (LTF). The incidence density of death and LTF in the cohort was 9.8 and 4.5 per 1000 person-months, respectively. The median age of the study participants was 28 years (IQR: 27.1, 29.1). The overall cumulative survival probability of patients at the end of 24 months was 77.5% and 84.5% for the mortality and LTF, respectively. The independent predictors of death was chest radiographic findings (AHR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17-0.79) and HIV serostatus 2.98 (95% CI: 1.72-5.19). Drug adverse effect (AHR = 6.1; 95% CI: 2.5, 14.34) and culture test result (AHR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.3) were independent predictors of LTF.This study concluded that drug-resistant tuberculosis mortality and LTF remains high in the study area.

In this study, we aimed to 1) validate findings from a previous follow-up study by our team that examined the publication rates of animal studies from protocol to publication and 2) identify incentives for improving publication rates in animal research. Methods The researchers responsible for the animal proposals (n = 210) from our previous study were contacted as participants for a Web-based survey between October 2019 and April 2020. Question types varied between free text questions, answer options based on a 5-point Likert scale and closed yes/no questions. Results In total, 78 researchers responsible for 101 of 210 animal study proposals participated, yielding a response rate of 48.1%. Results showed that the publication rate increased from 67% in our follow-up study to 70%. According to a 5-point Likert scale (from 1 = “not relevant” to 5 = “extremely relevant”), the most widely accepted suggestions for increasing publication rates were “Publication costs for open access journals are fully covered by funders or universities” (mean 4.02, SD 1.01), “Performance-based allocation of intramural funds for results reporting of animal research not supporting the initial hypothesis (including preprints and repositories)” (mean 3.37, SD 1.05), and “Researchers receive more information from scientific journals that also publish non-significant results” (mean 3.30, SD 1.02).

Therefore, we combined the indigenous knowledge about culturally important therapeutic plants and climate change with experimental warming (open-top chambers) and manual clipping (simulated grazing effect) and compared the relative difference on aboveground biomass and percent cover of plant species at five alpine meadow sites on an elevation gradient (4696 m-3346 m) from 2016–2018. Experimental warming increased biomass and percent cover throughout the experiment. However, the interactive treatment effect (warming x clipping) was significant on biomass but not on percent cover. These responses were taxa specific. Warming induced an increase of 1 ± 0.6% in Bistorta officinalis percent cover while for Poa alpina it was 18.7 ± 4.9%. Contrastingly, clipping had a marginally significant effect in reducing the biomass and cover of all plant species. Clipping treatment reduced vegetation cover &amp; biomass by 2.3% and 6.26%, respectively, but that was not significant due to the high variability among taxa response at different sites. It was found that clipping decreased the effects of warming in interactive plots. Thus, warming may increase the availability of therapeutic plants for indigenous people while overgrazing would have deteriorating effects locally. The findings of this research illustrate that vegetation sensitivity to warming and overgrazing is likely to affect man–environment relationships, and traditional knowledge on a regional scale."

In this report, we describe the development and testing of three ostracism interventions, designed to help people cope with the negative effects of being excluded by one’s team. Across five studies, participants were assigned to a virtual ball toss game where they were either included or excluded by their teammates. Afterwards, they were given a task where they could earn money for themselves, for their entire team, or for an unrelated group (charity). Excluded participants worked less hard for their teams (even when this meant sacrificing their own earnings). This sabotage effect was specific , meaning that excluded individuals worked less hard on behalf of their teams, but not when they worked for themselves or for charity. We devised three intervention strategies—perspective, mentorship, and empowerment—to combat the negative effects of ostracism on people’s willingness to work for their teams. These interventions were successful; each increased people’s persistence in a team-based reward task, and in some cases, even raised the outcomes of excluded teammates to levels observed in included teammates. The effectiveness of these interventions also replicated successfully, using preregistered hypotheses, methods, and analyses. These studies add novel insights to a variety of fields that have examined the consequences of social exclusion, including social psychology, organizational behavior, and management science."

https://openalex.org/W3157955695,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent proinflammatory phospholipid mediator that elicits various cellular functions and promotes several pathological events, including anaphylaxis and neuropathic pain. PAF is biosynthesized by two types of lyso-PAF acetyltransferases: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) and LPCAT2, which are constitutive and inducible forms of lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, respectively. Because LPCAT2 mainly produces PAF under inflammatory stimuli, understanding the structure of LPCAT2 is important for developing specific drugs against PAF-related inflammatory diseases. Although the structure of LPCAT2 has not been determined, the crystal structure was reported for Thermotoga maritima PlsC, an enzyme in the same gene family as LPCAT2. Here, we identified residues in mouse LPCAT2 essential for its enzymatic activity and a potential acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-binding pocket, based on homology modeling of mouse LPCAT2 with PlsC. We also found that Ala115 of mouse LPCAT2 was important for acyl-CoA selectivity. In conclusion, these results predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure of mouse LPCAT2. Our findings have implications for the future development of new drugs against PAF-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3159242702,"At a time of growing interest in and awareness about the relationships between humans and animals, it is of relevance to scientifically analyse the intrinsic nature of these interactions. Reactions to emotional tears show our extraordinary capacity for detecting micro-nuances when judging another human's face. Regarding such behaviour, previous studies carried out in our laboratory have pointed to an adaptive function of emotional tears: i.e. their inhibitory influence on perceived aggressiveness. In the present work we aimed to further explore that hypothesis by extending our investigation from humans to animals, using pictures of five different animal faces (cat, dog, horse, chimpanzee, hamster) to which tears were added digitally. To this end, we conducted an online study of 403 participants recruited from different social networks and academic institutions. We questioned the participants about their perceptions of emotional intensity, aggressiveness and friendliness in the animal faces and analysed the comparisons they made between faces with and without tears. In addition, a latent variable referred to as ""passion for animals"" was measured using different indicators. By adding the results obtained in each species and breaking them down into different basic emotions, we found that the presence of tears was related to a higher absolute frequency of participants who perceived sadness, which endorsed our previous results obtained using images of humans. Regarding aggressiveness, the presence of tears favoured the perception of less aggressiveness. A structural equation model was also conducted to explore the relations among all the measured variables. The model confirmed that the presence of tears in the animal faces had a significant influence on the perception of higher emotional intensity and friendliness, and of lower aggressiveness."

Elongated X-ray image in the east-west direction with a comet-like structure reaches a Mpc-scale (Fig1.(a)). Previous radio observations detected the bent jets from MRC 0600-399, moving in same direction as the sub-cluster's motion against ram pressure.Here we report a new radio observation of a radio galaxy MRC 0600-399 which is 3.4 times and 11 times higher resolution and sensitivity than the previous results. Contrary to typical jets, the MRC 0600-399 shows a 90deg bend at the contact discontinuity and the collimated jets further extend over 100 kpc from the bend point. Diffuse, elongated emission named ""double-scythe"" structures were detected for the first time. The spectral index flattens downstream of the bend point, indicating cosmic-ray re-acceleration. High-resolution numerical simulations reveal that the ordered magnetic field along the discontinuity plays a significant role in the change in the jet direction. The morphology of the ""double-scythe"" bear remarkable similarities with the simulations, which strengthens our understanding of the interaction between relativistic electrons and intra-cluster magnetic field."

Methods The representative collection of 850 HPV-associated clinical samples (oral/nasopharyngeal/anal, archival specimens of oral/oropharyngeal/conjunctival/cervical/skin cancer, benign lesions of the larynx/conjunctiva/skin, and eyebrows), obtained from immunocompetent individuals, was tested for the presence of HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146 using type-specific real-time PCRs. To assess the genetic diversity of the HPVs investigated in the non-coding long control region (LCR), several highly sensitive nested PCR protocols were developed for each HPV type. The genetic diversity of HPV179 was additionally determined in 12 HPV179 isolates from different anatomical sites of an only immunocompromised patient included in the study. Results HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146 were detected in 1.4, 2.0, and 1.5% of the samples tested, respectively, with no preference for cutaneous or mucosal epithelial cells. One (with five single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs), four (with one to six SNPs), and four (with one to eight SNPs) genetic variants of HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146, respectively, were identified among eligible samples. HPV179 isolates from the immunocompromised patient exhibited the identical LCR nucleotide sequence, suggesting that HPV179 can cause generalized HPV infections. Conclusions HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146 have a mucocutaneous tissue tropism and are associated with sporadic infections in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Because the majority of mutations were found outside the major functional domains of the respective LCRs, we assume that HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146 genetic variants pathogenically do not differ from their prototypes. In addition, no association was found between specific HPV179, HPV135, and HPV146 genetic variants and anatomical sites of infection and/or specific neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W3159206402,"Previous research on the association between maternal HIV status and child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa was published between 2005-2011. Findings from these studies showed a higher child mortality risk among children born to HIV-positive mothers. While the population of women with disabilities is growing in developing countries, we found no research that examined the association between maternal disability in HIV-positive mothers, and child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. This study examined the potential compounding effect of maternal disability and HIV status on child mortality in South Africa.We analyzed data for women age 15-49 years from South Africa, using the nationally representative 2016 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios of child mortality indicators by maternal disability and maternal HIV using modified Poisson regressions.Children born to disabled mothers compared to their peers born to non-disabled mothers were at a higher risk for neonatal mortality (RR = 1.80, 95% CI:1.31-2.49), infant mortality (RR = 1.69, 95% CI:1.19-2.41), and under-five mortality (RR = 1.78, 95% CI:1.05-3.01). The joint risk of maternal disability and HIV-positive status on the selected child mortality indicators is compounded such that it is more than the sum of the risks from maternal disability or maternal HIV-positive status alone (RR = 3.97 vs. joint RR = 3.67 for neonatal mortality; RR = 3.57 vs. joint RR = 3.25 for infant mortality; RR = 6.44 vs. joint RR = 3.75 for under-five mortality).The findings suggest that children born to HIV-positive women with disabilities are at an exceptionally high risk of premature mortality. Established inequalities faced by women with disabilities may account for this increased risk. Given that maternal HIV and disability amplify each other's impact on child mortality, addressing disabled women's HIV-related needs and understanding the pathways and mechanisms contributing to these disparities is crucial."
