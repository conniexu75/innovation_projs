The other hand is virtually unaffected. Thus the change cannot be solely visuo-motor or visual. Other evidence suggests that it is a change in felt hand location, rather than motor learning. When the subject's adapted hand feels as if it is pointing straight ahead, for example, it is actually pointing off to one side."

https://openalex.org/W2134815843,"Hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline are absent in the calcified proteins of Mytilus. The organic matrices from the calcite layers have a consistently higher ratio of acidic to basic amino acids than the aragonitic shell units. The uncalcified shell units periostracum and outer ligament, have very few acidic residues, which may in part account for the lack of mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2042436857,"THE phenomenon of thymineless death in bacteria1 is of particular interest because of its apparent relationship to DNA replication, as shown by Maaloe and Hanawalt2. Only those bacterial cells which are synthesizing DNA at the time thymine is removed from the culture medium appear to be susceptible to thymineless killing under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition3. The 97 per cent susceptible fraction from an exponentially growing culture of strain TAU (E. coli 15T–A–U–, requiring thymine, arginine and uracil) succumbs to the lethality of thymine deficiency at about the same rate whether arginine and uracil are present or not2. Thus, little correlation exists between thymineless killing and cytoplasmic synthesis. Using E. coli B3 Gallant and Suskind4 also reported thymineless death under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition, but they found further that phosphate starvation prevented killing. They implicated RNA synthesis on the basis of this result and the finding that the inhibitory effect of 5-methyl tryptophan could be partially reversed (with respect to RNA synthesis and thymineless killing) by chloramphenicol. The investigations to be reported here provide evidence that messenger-RNA synthesis in particular is necessary for the killing event in thymine-deficient cultures."

The albumin can be replaced by linoleic acid, which occurs as a tightly bound component of most albumin preparations. Linolenic acid and corn oil can also replace albumin, while oleic acid and esters of linoleic and linolenic acids cannot."

Rats were run at fixed sound pressure levels, and their responses were partitioned so that operating characteristics could be constructed. Measures of detectability, (de)½, were calculated from the operating characteristics, and show that (de)½ is a function of sound pressure levels, rising as these levels rise."

https://openalex.org/W1550682336,"Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of rats exposed to a single acute dose (840 r) of whole--body irradiation at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours before they were killed, and from sham-treated controls. Mitochondrial protein fell to 75% of the control level within 6 hours after irradiation and returned to normal within 24 hours. The number of mitochondria decreased to some extent during the first 3 hours and then recovered, but the significance of these variations is questionable. Irradiated mitochondria show greater size variation and fragility. O/sub 2/ consumption varied considerably during the time period investigated. It was higher than the control rate with all four substrates 6 hours after irradiation, and returned to normal after 24 hours. The rate of synthesis of adenosine triphosphate was decreased by 20% after irradiation for 1 hour and remalned at this lower level for 12 hours. It had returned to the control level by 24 hours in most cases and by 48 hours in all. P: 0 ratios were reduced by 25% 3 hours after irradiation and remained so for 12 hours. Control levels were reached with three substrates within 24 hours, but with glutamate only after 48 hours.more » (auth)« less"

https://openalex.org/W2043976220,"SINCLAIR1 suggested in 1929 that phospholipids are obligatory intermediates in the absorption of fat. Later work by Zilversmit, Entenman and Chaikoff2 indicated, however, that there is little or no increase in turnover of the gross phospholipid fraction during absorption. Johnston and Bearden3 recently obtained evidence that a minor component, phosphatidic acid, has increased turnover during fat absorption in vitro. It seemed important, therefore, to examine the turnover of individual mucosal phospholipids during fat absorption in vivo, with special reference to phosphatidic acid."

The ratio of these two mean values is associated with a similar ratio of radium-226 to calcium found in the diet at the two locations. A plot of the radium-226 content of bone as a function of age indicates that there is no marked difference in levels of bone radium with age."
https://openalex.org/W2047259470,"SNAKE venom phospholipase A was shown by de Haas and van Deenen to release the fatty acid constituent present in the β-ester position of mixed-acid phospholipids obtained by a synthesis de novo1–3. This result confirmed those of Tattrie4 and Hanahan et al.5, who worked on fatty acid distribution in egg lecithin, using phospholipase A, phospholipase D and pancreatic lipase. Hence, the positional specificity of phospholipase A appeared to be settled. Recently Bennett and Tattrie6, however, reported, because of reacylation investigations of snake-venom-formed lysolecithin, that this enzyme may not invariably hydrolyse the β-fatty acid ester bonds. This assumption supports the interpretation previously made by Marinetti et al.7, indicating a preference of the enzyme for liberating long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids, irrespective of their position in the phospholipid molecule. For this reason further investigations into the mode of action of phospholipase A were made."

https://openalex.org/W2014707403,McILWAiN et al. have established that the content of extractable gangliosides (measured by their N-acetyl-neuraminic acid moiety) is directly related to the excit ability of the nervous tissue1. The N-acetylneuraminic acid is suggested to form a hydrophilic path for the passage of cations through the lipid membrane2. We wished to check whether the decreased metabolic response of rat brain cortex slices to electrical stimulation during ethanol intoxication3 could be accounted for by a decrease in the N-acetylneuraminic acid groups available.

Eye and respiratory irritation are reduced qualitatively. Iodine is more effective in suppressing ozone in a photochemical smog atmosphere than it is in purified air.
https://openalex.org/W2001963051,"BARBITURATES isolated from biological fluids and tissues are not sufficiently pure for characterization by crystal tests. Purification and separation, if one or more barbiturates are present in the isolated product, are prerequisites for such tests. Paper chromatography and sublimation techniques have been reported in numerous publications to attain sufficient purity of barbiturates for these purposes. Sublimation technique for purification is not consistently successful on barbiturates isolated from biological specimens. A combination of paper chromatography and sublimation was successfully applied to obtain the barbiturates in pure state for characterization by crystal tests. This method was used by us on micro-quantities of barbiturates isolated from blood and other tissue materials."

The in vivo observations were made in aestivating and hibernating mammals2–4 and with human blood from blood vessels where a differential in temperature had been demonstrated1. By contrast, Tadzer6, using the rat in a study of hypothermia of short duration and uncomplicated by shock, did not find prolonged thrombin times; Lasch et al.7, working with dogs, even obtained shorter clotting times on cooling, and a prolongation, due to an increase in heparin, on rewarming."
https://openalex.org/W1991861483,"IN their investigations on the fatty acid composition of butter-fat, Backderf and Brown1 deduced the presence of trans-octadec-16-enoic acid, an acid hitherto unknown in Nature. Later this acid was isolated from butter-fat by Hansen and Cooke2 and its physical and chemical charac teristics were established. The present communication reports the detection by gas-liquid chromatography of this acid in sheep and ox fats using as a basis for identi fication the gas-liquid chromatographic data previously obtained for the methyl esters of pure trans-octadec-16-enoic acid isolated from butter-fat. The methyl esters of both sheep and ox fats were analysed with a chromatograph fitted with a strontium-90 ioniza-tion detector and an 8 ft. × ¼ in. column. With a ‘Celite’ column impregnated with 20 per cent (w/w) polydiethylene glycol adipate at 207°a peak appeared in both fats with RF value 1.26 corresponding with that recorded for the methyl ester of trans-octadec-16-enoic acid2, but with a ‘Celite’ column containing 5 per cent (w/w) ‘Apiezon L’ at 207° this component was not apparent. As was earlier found with the polydiethylene glycol adipate stationary phase2, resolution from other cis and trans C18 isomers and from methyl stearate was complete whereas with a ‘Celite’ column impregnated with 5 per cent (w/w) ‘Apiezon L’ the methyl ester of trans-octadec-16-enoic acid was not separated from methyl stearate. To confirm the presence of trans-octadec-16-enoic acid and other trans acidsin sheep fat and ox fat, work is in progress which is designed to isolate and identify these fatty acid constituents."

Keith, in a recent communication1, indicated the losses of solvent through the walls of polythene ampoules. The experience of our laboratory is comparable in this respect, but it might be noted that the rate of loss was extremely high from concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions where apparently gaseous hydrochloric acid was being transferred through the walls. We believe that the following information on other types of losses will be of interest."
