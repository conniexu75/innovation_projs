https://openalex.org/W3116298071,"Physical distancing has been argued as one of the effective means to combat the spread of COVID-19 before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes available. How far people can be spatially separated is partly behavioral but partly constrained by population density. Most models developed to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. do not include population density explicitly. This study shows that population density is an effective predictor of cumulative infection cases in the U.S. at the county level. Daily cumulative cases by counties are converted into 7-day moving averages. Treating the weekly averages as the dependent variable and the county population density levels as the explanatory variable, both in logarithmic scale, this study assesses how population density has shaped the distributions of infection cases across the U.S. from early March to late May, 2020. Additional variables reflecting the percentages of African Americans, Hispanic-Latina, and older adults in logarithmic scale are also included. Spatial regression models with a spatial error specification are also used to account for the spatial spillover effect. Population density alone accounts for 57% of the variation (R-squared) in the aspatial models and up to 76% in the spatial models. Adding the three population subgroup percentage variables raised the R-squared of the aspatial models to 72% and the spatial model to 84%. The influences of the three population subgroups were substantial, but changed over time, while the contributions of population density have been quite stable after the first several weeks, ascertaining the importance of population density in shaping the spread of infection in individual counties, and in their neighboring counties. Thus, population density and sizes of vulnerable population subgroups should be explicitly included in transmission models that predict the impacts of COVID-19, particularly at the sub-county level."
https://openalex.org/W3117211004,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem, and patients who survive AKI have a high risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanism of CKD post-AKI, characterized by progressive renal fibrosis, is still unclear. Maladaptive tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after AKI are considered a leading cause of renal fibrosis post-AKI. TECs under maladaptive repair manifest characteristics of senescence. Removing senescent TECs by genetic ablation has been proven effective in reducing renal fibrosis. Senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells by pharmacological intervention, have been studied in a series of degenerative diseases. To our knowledge, the effects of senolytics on renal fibrosis post-AKI have not been verified before. Here, we confirmed renal senescence in the unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury murine model. Senescent TECs could activate fibroblasts and senolytics specifically induced apoptosis of senescent TECs. Next, we demonstrated that senolytics could reduce renal senescence and ameliorate renal fibrosis in both unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and multiple-cisplatin-treatment murine models. Our results indicate senescent TECs as a vital factor in renal fibrosis progression, and senolytic therapy might be promising for treating CKD post-AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3115511975,"Short term storage of extracellular vesicle (EV) solutions at +4°C is a common practice, but the stability of EVs during this procedure has not been fully understood yet. Using nanoparticle tracking analysis, we have shown that EVs isolated from the conditioned medium of HT-29 cells exhibit a pronounced concentration decrease when stored in PBS in ordinary polypropylene tubes within the range of (0.5–2.1) × 10 10 particles/ml. EV losses reach 51±3% for 0.5 ml of EVs in Eppendorf 2 ml tube at 48 hours of storage at +4°C. Around 2/3 of the observed losses have been attributed to the adsorption of vesicles onto tube walls. This result shows that the lower part (up to at least 2 × 10 10 particles/ml) of the practically relevant concentration range for purified EVs is prone to adsorption losses at +4°C. Total particle losses could be reduced to 18–21% at 48 hours by using either Eppendorf Protein LoBind tubes or ordinary tubes with the surface blocked with bovine serum albumin or EVs. Reduction of losses to 15% has been shown for isolated EVs dissolved in the supernatant after 100 000 g centrifugation as a model of conditioned medium. Also, a previously unknown feature of diffusion-controlled adsorption was revealed for EVs. In addition to the decrease in particle count, this process causes the predominant losses of smaller particles."
https://openalex.org/W3116992814,"The clinical condition COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Currently, there are more than 5 million cases worldwide, and the pandemic has increased exponentially in many countries, with different incidences and death rates among regions/ethnicities and, intriguingly, between sexes. In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences. In conclusion, there are ACE2 polymorphisms that could influence epidemiological discrepancies observed among ancestry and, moreover, between sexes."
https://openalex.org/W3114574308,"Inefficiency in urban land use is one of the problems caused by rapid urbanization. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicator 11.3.1 is designed to test urban land use efficiency. This study employed geospatial and statistical data to compute land use efficiencies from 1990 to 2015 with five 5-year and ten 15-year intervals in Wukang, center of Deqing County, China. A flowchart was designed to extract the built-up lands from multiple data sources. The produced built-up lands were demonstrated to provide good accuracy by constructing an error matrix between the extracted and manually interpreted built-up lands as classified and reference images, respectively. By using the model provided by UN metadata to calculate SDG 11.3.1, the land use efficiencies from 1990 to 2015 were identified in Wukang. Our results indicate that the land use efficiency in Deqing County center is lower than the average of cities around the world, primarily because our in-situ study focused on a county center with larger rural regions than urban areas. Over the long term, urban land use becomes denser as the population grows, which will have a positive impact on the sustainability of urban development. This work is helpful for the local government to balance urban land consumption and population growth."
https://openalex.org/W3114275125,"β-barrel outer membrane proteins (β-OMPs) play critical roles in nutrition acquisition, protein import/export, and other fundamental biological processes. The assembly of β-OMPs in Gram-negative bacteria is mediated by the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, yet its precise mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report two structures of the BAM complex in detergents and in nanodisks, and two crystal structures of the BAM complex with bound substrates. Structural analysis indicates that the membrane compositions surrounding the BAM complex could modulate its overall conformations, indicating low energy barriers between different conformational states and a highly dynamic nature of the BAM complex. Importantly, structures of the BAM complex with bound substrates and the related functional analysis show that the first β-strand of the BamA β-barrel (β1BamA ) in the BAM complex is associated with the last but not the first β-strand of a β-OMP substrate via antiparallel β-strand interactions. These observations are consistent with the β-signal hypothesis during β-OMP biogenesis, and suggest that the β1BamA strand in the BAM complex may interact with the last β-strand of an incoming β-OMP substrate upon their release from the chaperone-bound state."
https://openalex.org/W3116186430,"Background Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited lipid disorder that confers high risk for premature cardiovascular disease but remains undertreated. Causes are multifactorial and multilevel, ranging from underprescribing (at the clinician-level) to medication nonadherence (at the patient-level). We evaluated patient and clinician stakeholder barriers and facilitators for treatment of FH to explore possible solutions to the problem. Methods and results Semi-structured interviews and focus groups guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), were conducted with 33 patients and 17 clinician stakeholders across three healthcare systems. A total of14 patients and 9 clinician stakeholders participated in on-site focus groups and the remainder were individual interviews. Transcripts were coded using an iterative process to create a static codebook. We characterized patient and clinician stakeholder barriers into three categories: medical care-, medication-, and life-related. Feasibility of brainstormed solutions varied and was not always representative of the needs of all stakeholders. Patients suggested a need for childhood screening for FH and doctors being persistent about the importance of treating FH, creation of a patient peer group, data transparency, advocacy, and policy changes that would enable patients to receive better treatment. Clinician stakeholders suggested the need for clinical champions. Both groups of stakeholders discussed the need for education about FH. Conclusions Proposed solutions to improve treatment of FH proffered by participants in this study included resources for both patients and clinician stakeholders that clarify cardiovascular disease risks from FH, develop programs to screen for and identify FH at younger ages, and foster open conversations between patients and clinicians about treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3115630538,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe disruption of cognitive and motor functions, including changes in posture and gait. A number of HD mouse models have been engineered that display behavioral and neuropathological features of the disease, but gait alterations in these models are poorly characterized. Sensitive high-throughput tests of fine motor function and gait in mice might be informative in evaluating disease-modifying interventions. Here, we describe a hypothesis-free workflow that determines progressively changing locomotor patterns across 79 parameters in the R6/2 and Q175 mouse models of HD. R6/2 mice (120 CAG repeats) showed motor disturbances as early as at 4 weeks of age. Similar disturbances were observed in homozygous and heterozygous Q175 KI mice at 3 and 6 months of age, respectively. Interestingly, only the R6/2 mice developed forelimb ataxia. The principal components of the behavioral phenotypes produced two phenotypic scores of progressive postural instability based on kinematic parameters and trajectory waveform data, which were shared by both HD models. This approach adds to the available HD mouse model research toolbox and has a potential to facilitate the development of therapeutics for HD and other debilitating movement disorders with high unmet medical need."
https://openalex.org/W3115872486,"Stem cell-derived exosomes are emerging as novel and clinically relevant cell-free therapeutics for regenerative therapy. This work focused on investigating the stimulation of fibroblasts by exosomes derived from umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ucMSC) in a defined serum-free three-dimensional (3D) culture. 3D culture of ucMSC was carried out in medium supplemented with KnockOut serum replacement (KO-medium) using the Aggrewell system. ucMSC in KO-medium formed spheroids with maintained size and integrity throughout culture. This enabled the isolation of vesicles from ucMSC spheroids in KO-medium with sizes that fall within the exosomal size range and were positive for the expression of canonical exosomal markers CD63, CD9, CD81, Alix, and TSG101. The ucMSC-derived exosomes (ExoucMSC) were shown to significantly increase the migration and proliferation of murine fibroblasts in vitro. To conclude, 3D culture of ucMSC in defined serum-free KO-medium formed viable spheroids which enabled the isolation of ExoucMSC with the potential of accelerating wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W3092244835,"We compare and contrast the expected duration and number of infections and deaths averted among several designs for clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including traditional and adaptive randomized clinical trials and human challenge trials. Using epidemiological models calibrated to the current pandemic, we simulate the time course of each clinical trial design for 756 unique combinations of parameters, allowing us to determine which trial design is most effective for a given scenario. A human challenge trial provides maximal net benefits—averting an additional 1.1M infections and 8,000 deaths in the U.S. compared to the next best clinical trial design—if its set-up time is short or the pandemic spreads slowly. In most of the other cases, an adaptive trial provides greater net benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3117743506,"The use of bio-fertilizers in agro-ecosystems is considered to have the potential to improve plant growth in extreme environments featuring water shortages. However, while arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and bacteria bio-fertilizers have been used in other plants to enhance stress tolerance, little is known about their symbiotic effect on sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.) growth under drought stress conditions. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the inoculation of sorghum with Nitroxin and Glomus mosseae and their interaction effects on the agro-physiological characteristics and grain yield of sorghum under drought stress conditions. Nitroxin is a bio-fertilizer that consists of a mixture of Azospirillum and Azotobacter bacteria. The results showed that co-inoculation of sorghum seeds with Nitroxin and AMF improved the chlorophyll (a, b and total) content, soluble proteins, water use efficiency) WUE(, relative water content (RWC), nitrogen (N) content in the plant, AMF spore density, proline content, grain yield, panicle length, the number of panicles per plant, grain number per panicle, 1000-grain weight and decreased the electrolyte leakage and water saturation deficit (WSD) in drought stress and non-stress conditions. Under drought stress conditions, there was a 27% increase in grain yield under the synergistic effects of bacteria and fungi compared to the non-application of these microorganisms. The results of this experiment show that Nitroxin and AMF bio-fertilizers can mitigate the negative effects of stress on plants in drought stress conditions by increasing the amount of photosynthetic pigments, soluble proteins and osmotic regulation and decreasing electrolyte leakage. We found that the combination of bacteria and AMF for sorghum growth and yield increment is a promising method to cope with the stress caused by drought."
https://openalex.org/W3118009315,"Background Renal transplantation is the best modality of renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, it is associated with weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, which adversely impact transplant outcomes. Objective The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors of one-year weight gain after renal transplantation. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 374 patients that underwent kidney transplantation between January 2006 and July 2013. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected from electronic records, and the outcome of interest was weight gain during the first year after renal transplantation. The data were reported as mean ± standard deviation, median (interquartile range) or number of subjects (%). The association between variables were assessed via chi-square test and ANOVA. For analysis of risk factors related to the outcomes of interest, multivariable logistic regression models were used. Results There were 181 (48.4%) female patients, 334 (89.3%) with white ethnicity and the mean age was 44.4 ± 12.8 years. The mean BMI pre-transplant was 24.7 ± 4.1 kg/m 2 , and 35 (9.9%) patients were classified as obese; 119 (33.6%) as overweight; 187 (52.8%) as normal weight; and 13 (3.7%) as malnourished. After one year of follow-up, the mean BMI was 26.2 ± 5.0 kg/m 2 , and 61 (17.3%) patients were classified as obese; 133 (37.8%) as overweight; 148 (42.0%) as normal weight; and 10 (2.8%) as malnourished. Weight gain was observed in 72.7% patients, and the average increase was 7.12 ± 5.9 kg. The female gender, lower pre-transplant body weight, lower number of hospitalizations, and a kidney received from a living donor were associated with weight gain by more than 5% in the first year post-transplant. Conclusion Female gender and lower pre-transplant body weight were independently associated with weight gain by more than 5% in the first year after kidney transplantation; lower rates of hospitalization and donation from living donors were also risk factors for this outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3116805545,"Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process activated by fasting and caloric restriction. FXR, a receptor for primary bile acids, reverses the activity of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) on autophagy-related genes (Atg)s and terminates autophagy in the fed state. GPBAR1, a receptor for secondary bile acids, exerts its genomic effects via cAMP-CREB pathway. By genetic and pharmacological approaches, we have obtained evidence that GPBAR1 functions as a positive modulator of autophagy in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) in fasting. Mechanistically, we found that Gpbar1-/- mice lack the expression of Cyp2c70 a gene essential for generation of muricholic acids which are FXR antagonists, and have an FXR-biased bile acid pool. Because FXR represses autophagy, Gpbar1-/- mice show a defective regulation of autophagy in fasting. BAR501, a selective GPBAR1 agonist, induces autophagy in fed mice. Defective regulation of autophagy in Gpbar1-/- could be reversed by FXR antagonism, while repression of autophagy by feeding was partially abrogated by FXR gene ablation, and FXR activation repressed Atgs in the fast state. BAR501 reversed the negative regulatory effects of feeding and FXR agonism on autophagy and promoted the recruitment of CREB to a CRE on the LC3 promoter. In mice exposed to chronic high caloric intake, GPBAR1 agonism ameliorated insulin sensitivity and induced Atgs expression in the liver and WAT. In summary, GPBAR1 is required for positive regulation of autophagy in fasting and its ligands reverse the repressive effects exerted on liver and WAT autophagy flow by FXR in fed."
https://openalex.org/W3116041170,"The deposition of Aβ plaques in the brain leads to the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease. The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by α-secretase (non-amyloidogenic processing of APP), however increased cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) leads to the accumulation of Aβ peptides, which forms plaques. APP mutations mapping to exons 16 and 17 favor plaque accumulation and cause Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). However, a variant of the APP gene (A673T) originally found in an Icelandic population reduces BACE1 cleavage by 40%. A series of plasmids containing the APP gene, each with one of 29 different FAD mutations mapping to exon 16 and exon 17 was created. These plasmids were then replicated with the addition of the A673T mutation. Combined these formed the library of plasmids that was used in this study. The plasmids were transfected in neuroblastomas to assess the effect of this mutation on Aβ peptide production. The production of Aβ peptides was decreased for some FAD mutations due to the presence of the co-dominant A673T mutation. The reduction of Aβ peptide concentrations for the London mutation (V717I) even reached the same level as for A673T control in SH-SY5Y cells. These preliminary results suggest that the insertion of A673T in APP genes containing FAD mutations might confer a clinical benefit in preventing or delaying the onset of some FADs."
https://openalex.org/W3114055998,"The ultimate treatment for patients with end-stage heart failure is heart transplantation. The number of donor hearts which are primarily procured from donation after brain death (DBD) donors is limited, but donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor hearts can increase the heart donor pool. However, ischemia and reperfusion injuries associated with the DCD process causes myocardial damage, limiting the use of DCD hearts in transplantation. Addressing this problem is critical in the exploration of DCD hearts as suitable donor hearts for transplantation. In this study, rat hearts were procured following the control beating-heart donor (CBD) or DCD donation process. Changes in mitochondria and cardiac function from DCD hearts subjected to 25 or 35 minutes of ischemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion were compared to CBD hearts. Following ischemia, rates of oxidative phosphorylation and calcium retention capacity were progressively impaired in DCD hearts compared to CBD hearts. Reperfusion caused additional mitochondrial dysfunction in DCD hearts. Developed pressure, inotropy and lusitropy, were significantly reduced in DCD hearts compared to CBD hearts. We, therefore, suggest that interventional strategies targeted before the onset of ischemia and at reperfusion could protect mitochondria, thus potentially making DCD hearts suitable for heart transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3117288093,"Background Despite the prognostic importance of hypoalbuminemia, the prognostic implication of a change in albumin levels has not been fully investigated during hospitalization in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Methods Using the data from the Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure registry on 3160 patients who were discharged alive for acute heart failure hospitalization and in whom the change in albumin levels was calculated at discharge, we evaluated the association with an increase in serum albumin levels from admission to discharge and clinical outcomes by a multivariable Cox hazard model. The primary outcome measure was a composite of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure. Findings Patients with increased albumin levels (N = 1083, 34.3%) were younger and less often had smaller body mass index and renal dysfunction than those with no increase in albumin levels (N = 2077, 65.7%). Median follow-up was 475 days with a 96% 1-year follow-up rate. Relative to the group with no increase in albumin levels, the lower risk of the increased albumin group remained significant for the primary outcome measure (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.90: P = 0.0004) after adjusting for confounders including baseline albumin levels. When stratified by the quartiles of baseline albumin levels, the favorable effect of increased albumin was more pronounced in the lower quartiles of albumin levels, but without a significant interaction effect (interaction P = 0.49). Conclusions Independent of baseline albumin levels, an increase in albumin during index hospitalization was associated with a lower 1-year risk for a composite of all-cause death and hospitalization in patients with acute heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3113800186,"Introduction Rational use of medicines requires that patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs. Irrational prescription of antibiotics has been reported in many health systems across the world. In Uganda, mainly nurses and assistant medical officers (Clinical officers) prescribe for children at level III and IV primary care facilities (health center II and IV). Nurses are not primarily trained prescribers; their antibiotic prescription maybe associated with errors. There is a need to understand the practices of antibiotic prescription among prescribers in the public primary care facilities. We therefore determined antibiotic prescription practices of prescribers for children under five years at health center III and IV in Mbarara district, South Western Uganda. Methods This was a retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study. We reviewed outpatient records of children &lt;5 years of age retrospectively. Information obtained from the outpatient registers were captured in predesigned data abstraction form. Health care providers working at health centers III and IV were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. They provided information on socio-demographic, health facility, antibiotic prescription practices and availability of reference tools. Data was analyzed using STATA software version 13∙0. Results There were 1218 outpatients records of children under five years reviewed and 35 health care providers interviewed. The most common childhood illness diagnosed was upper respiratory tract infection. It received the most antibiotic prescription (53%). The most commonly prescribed oral antibiotics were cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone and benzyl penicillin were the commonest prescribed injectable antibiotics. Up to 68.4% of the antibiotic prescription was irrational. No prescriber or facility factors were associated with irrational antibiotic prescription practices. Conclusion Upper respiratory tract infection is the most diagnosed condition in children under five years with Cotrimoxazole and Amoxicillin being the most commonly prescribed antibiotics. Antibiotics are being prescribed irrationally at health centers III and IV in Mbarara District. Training and support supervision of prescribers at health centers III and IV in Mbarara district need to be prioritized by the district health team."
https://openalex.org/W3113972429,"Background A higher incidence of thrombotic events, mainly pulmonary embolism (PE), has been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The main objective was to assess clinical and laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. Methods This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset, were compared between PE and non-PE patients. Results Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD 13.7) vs 69.9 (SD 12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD 8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). No patients met ISTH DIC criteria. Any parameter was statistically significant or clinically relevant except for D-Dimer when comparing both groups. Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1–11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0–2382.2]; p = 0.004); week 3 (3893.1 [1388.2–6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8–2447.8]; p = 0.003); and week 4 (2736.3 [1202.1–8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5–2834.6]; p = 0.01). Median fold-increase of D-dimer between week 1 and 2 differed between groups (6.64 [3.02–23.05] vs 1.57 [0.64–2.71], p = 0.003); ROC curve AUC was 0.879 ( p = 0.003) with a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 86% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, D-dimer levels are higher at weeks 2, 3 and 4 after COVID-19 symptom onset in patients who develop PE. This difference is more pronounced when the fold increase between weeks 1 and 2 is compared."
https://openalex.org/W3116030164,"Cooperation is thought to be a necessary condition to solve collective action dilemmas such as climate change or the sustainable use of common pool resources. Yet, it is poorly understood how situations pervaded by thresholds shape the behaviour of people facing collective dilemmas. Here we provide empirical evidence that resource users facing thresholds maintain on average cooperative behaviours in the sense of maximising their individual earnings while ensuring future group opportunities. A framed field experiment in the form of a dynamic game with 256 Colombian fishers helped us investigate individual behavioural responses to the existence of thresholds, risk and uncertainty. Thresholds made fishers extract less fish compared to situation without thresholds, but risk had a stronger effect on reducing individual fishing effort. Contrary to previous expectations, cooperation did not break down. If cooperation can be maintained in the face of thresholds, then communicating uncertainty is more policy-relevant than estimating precisely where tipping points lay in social-ecological systems."
https://openalex.org/W3117403505,"Obese individuals often show low growth hormone (GH) secretion, which leads to reduced lipid mobilization and further fat accumulation. Pharmacological approaches to increase GH levels in obese individuals by GH injection or GH-releasing hormone receptor agonist showed promising effects on fat reduction. However, side effects on glucose metabolism and the heavy costs on making large peptides hindered their clinical application. Here, we tested whether stimulation of endogenous GH secretion by a synthetic GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR) agonist, hexarelin, improved the metabolism in a hyperphagic obese mouse model. Male melanocortin 4 receptor knockout mice (MC4RKO) were pair-fed and received continuous hexarelin (10.56 μg/day) or vehicle infusion by an osmotic pump for 3-4 weeks. Hexarelin treatment significantly increased the pulsatile GH secretion without detectable alteration on basal GH secretion in MC4RKO mice. The treated mice showed increased lipolysis and lipid oxidation in the adipose tissue, and reduced de novo lipogenesis in the liver, leading to reduced visceral fat mass, reduced triglyceride content in liver, and unchanged circulating free fatty acid levels. Importantly, hexarelin treatment improved the whole-body insulin sensitivity but did not alter glucose tolerance, insulin levels, or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. The metabolic effects of hexarelin were likely through the direct action of GH, as indicated by the increased expression level of genes involved in GH signaling pathways in visceral adipose tissues and liver. In conclusion, hexarelin treatment stimulated the pulsatile GH secretion and reduced the fat accumulation in visceral depots and liver in obese MC4RKO mice with improved insulin sensitivity without altered levels of insulin or IGF-1. It provides evidence for managing obesity by enhancing pulsatile GH secretion through activation of GHSR in the pituitary gland."
https://openalex.org/W3117673604,"Introduction Differences in academic qualifications are cited as the reason behind the documented gender gap in industry sponsorship to academic plastic surgeons. Gendered imbalances in academic metrics narrow among senior academic plastic surgeons. However, it is unknown whether this gender parity translates to industry payments. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of industry payments disbursed to plastic surgeons in 2018. Inclusion criteria encompassed (i) faculty with the rank of professor or a departmental leadership position. Exclusion criteria included faculty (i) who belonged to a speciality besides plastic surgery; (ii) whose gender could not be determined; or (iii) whose name could not be located on the Open Payment Database. Faculty and title were identified using departmental listings of ACGME plastic surgery residency programs. We extracted industry payment data through the Open Payment Database. We also collected details on H-index and time in practice. Statistical analysis included odds ratios (OR) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R). Results We identified 316 senior academic plastic surgeons. The cohort was predominately male (88%) and 91% held a leadership role. Among departmental leaders, women were more likely to be an assistant professor (OR 3.9, p = 0.0003) and heads of subdivision (OR 2.1, p = 0.0382) than men. Industry payments were distributed equally to male and female senior plastic surgeons except for speakerships where women received smaller amounts compared to their male counterparts (median payments of $3,675 vs $7,134 for women and men respectively, p&lt; 0.0001). Career length and H-index were positively associated with dollar value of total industry payments (R = 0.17, p = 0.0291, and R = 0.14, p = 0.0405, respectively). Conclusion Disparity in industry funding narrows at senior levels in academic plastic surgery. At higher academic levels, industry sponsorship may preferentially fund individuals based on academic productivity and career length. Increased transparency in selection criteria for speakerships is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3113752516,"Objective The main aim of the current study was to investigate what role perceived life stress, psychological capital (PsyCap), financial self-reliance and time perspective orientations play in explaining socioeconomic health inequalities, specifically self-perceived health and self-reported physical health conditions. Methods Individuals (total n = 600) aged 16+ years from a general Dutch population sample (LISS panel) completed an online questionnaire measuring three different SEP indicators (highest achieved educational level, personal monthly disposable income and being in paid employment), perceived life stress, PsyCap, financial self-reliance, time perspective, self-perceived health, and self-reported physical health conditions. Structural equation modelling using a cross-sectional design was used to test the mediation paths from SEP indicators to self-perceived health and self-reported physical health conditions through perceived life stress, PsyCap, financial self-reliance and time perspective orientations. Results Highest achieved educational level and being in paid employment showed to play a role in the social stratification within self-reported and self-perceived health outcomes, whereas this was not found for personal monthly disposable income. The association between a lower highest achieved educational level and lower self-perceived health was mediated by lower PsyCap and higher perceived life stress levels. The association between a lower highest achieved educational level and higher levels of self-reported physical health conditions was mediated by less financial self-reliance and higher perceived life stress levels. Although no mediating role was found for time perspective orientations in the association between the measured SEP indicators and health outcomes, negative time perspective orientations were associated with either self-perceived health or self-reported physical health conditions. Conclusions reserves (PsyCap and financial self-reliance) and perceived life stress seem to play a larger role in explaining the health gradient in achieved educational level than time perspective orientations. Prevention efforts trying to reduce the SEP-health gradient should focus on a) increasing reserves and lowering perceived life stress levels for individuals with a low achieved educational level, and b) reducing unemployment and narrowing opportunity gaps in education for people with a low SEP."
https://openalex.org/W3114297360,"The cycling and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is not well understood in estuarine systems. It is critical now more than ever given the increased ecosystem pressures on these critical coastal habitats. A budget of PAHs and cycling has been created for Galveston Bay (Texas) in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, an estuary surrounded by 30-50% of the US capacity of oil refineries and chemical industry. We estimate that approximately 3 to 4 mt per year of pyrogenic PAHs are introduced to Galveston Bay via gaseous exchange from the atmosphere (ca. 2 mt/year) in addition to numerous spills of petrogenic PAHs from oil and gas operations (ca. 1.0 to 1.9 mt/year). PAHs are cycled through and stored in the biota, and ca. 20 to 30% of the total (0.8 to 1.5 mt per year) are estimated to be buried in the sediments. Oysters concentrate PAHs to levels above their surroundings (water and sediments) and contain substantially greater concentrations than other fish catch (shrimp, blue crabs and fin fish). Smaller organisms (infaunal invertebrates, phytoplankton and zooplankton) might also retain a significant fraction of the total, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The amount of PAHs delivered to humans in seafood, based on reported landings, is trivially small compared to the total inputs, sediment accumulation and other possible fates (metabolic remineralization, export in tides, etc.), which remain poorly known. The generally higher concentrations in biota from Galveston Bay compared to other coastal habitats can be attributed to both intermittent spills of gas and oil and the bay's close proximity to high production of pyrogenic PAHs within the urban industrial complex of the city of Houston as well as periodic flood events that transport PAHs from land surfaces to the Bay."
https://openalex.org/W3115247077,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected, parasitic tropical disease caused by an intracellular protozoan from the genus Leishmania . Quinoline alkaloids, secondary metabolites found in plants from the Rutaceae family, have antiparasitic activity against Leishmania sp. N -methyl-8-methoxyflindersin ( 1 ), isolated from the leaves of Raputia heptaphylla and also known as 7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H,5H,6H-pyran[3,2-c]quinolin-5-one, shows antiparasitic activity against Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes. This study used in silico tools to identify synthetic quinoline alkaloids having structure similar to that of compound 1 and then tested these quinoline alkaloids for their in vitro antiparasitic activity against Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis , in vivo therapeutic response in hamsters suffering from experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and ex vivo immunomodulatory potential in healthy donors’ human peripheral blood (monocyte)-derived macrophages (hMDMs). Compounds 1 (natural), 2 (synthetic), and 8 (synthetic) were effective against intracellular promastigotes (9.9, 3.4, and 1.6 μg/mL medial effective concentration [EC 50 ], respectively) and amastigotes (5.07, 7.94, and 1.91 μg/mL EC 50 , respectively). Compound 1 increased nitric oxide production in infected hMDMs and triggered necrosis-related ultrastructural alterations in intracellular amastigotes, while compound 2 stimulated oxidative breakdown in hMDMs and caused ultrastructural alterations in the parasite 4 h posttreatment, and compound 8 failed to induce macrophage modulation but selectively induced apoptosis of infected hMDMs and alterations in the intracellular parasite ultrastructure. In addition, synthetic compounds 2 and 8 improved the health of hamsters suffering from experimental CL, without evidence of treatment-associated adverse toxic effects. Therefore, synthetic compounds 2 and 8 are potential therapeutic candidates for topical treatment of CL."
https://openalex.org/W3118032135,"The spliceosome assembles on pre-mRNA in a stepwise manner through five successive pre-spliceosome complexes. The spliceosome functions to remove introns from pre-mRNAs to generate mature mRNAs that encode functional proteins. Many small molecule inhibitors of the spliceosome have been identified and they are cytotoxic. However, little is known about genetic determinants of cell sensitivity. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a transcription factor that can stimulate apoptotic cell death in response to a variety of cellular stresses. Here, we used a genetic approach to determine if ATF3 was important in determining the sensitivity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to two splicing inhibitors: pladienolide B (PB) and isoginkgetin (IGG), that target different pre-spliceosome complexes. Both compounds led to increased ATF3 expression and apoptosis in control MEFs while ATF3 null cells were significantly protected from the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. Similarly, ATF3 was induced in response to IGG and PB in the two human tumour cell lines tested while knockdown of ATF3 protected cells from both drugs. Taken together, ATF3 appears to contribute to the cytotoxicity elicited by these spliceosome inhibitors in both murine and human cells."
https://openalex.org/W3114169745,"The excretion and reabsorption of uric acid both to and from urine are tightly regulated by uric acid transporters. Metabolic syndrome conditions, such as obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and insulin resistance, are believed to regulate the expression of uric acid transporters and decrease the excretion of uric acid. However, the mechanisms driving cholesterol impacts on uric acid transporters have been unknown. Here, we show that cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) upregulates the uric acid reabsorption transporter URAT1 encoded by SLC22A12 via estrogen receptors (ER). Transcriptional motif analysis showed that the SLC22A12 gene promoter has more estrogen response elements (EREs) than other uric acid reabsorption transporters such as SLC22A11 and SLC22A13, and 27HC-activated SLC22A12 gene promoter via ER through EREs. Furthermore, 27HC increased SLC22A12 gene expression in human kidney organoids. Our results suggest that in hypercholesterolemic conditions, elevated levels of 27HC derived from cholesterol induce URAT1/SLC22A12 expression to increase uric acid reabsorption, and thereby, could increase serum uric acid levels."
https://openalex.org/W3114783685,"Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the NOTCH pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of kidney damage. There is currently no information on the role of the Delta-like homologue 1 (DLK1), a NOTCH inhibitor, in the regulation of renal damage. Here, we investigated the contribution of DLK1 to experimental renal damage and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using a Dlk1-null mouse model in the experimental renal damage of unilateral ureteral obstruction, we found activation of NOTCH, as shown by increased nuclear translocation of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain, and upregulation of Dlk2/hey-1 expression compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. NOTCH1 over-activation in Dlk1-null injured kidneys was associated with a higher inflammatory response, characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells, mainly CD4/IL17A + lymphocytes, and activation of the Th17 immune response. Furthermore, pharmacological NOTCH blockade inhibited the transcription factors controlling Th17 differentiation and gene expression of the Th17 effector cytokine IL-17A and other related-inflammatory factors, linked to a diminution of inflammation in the injured kidneys. We propose that the non-canonical NOTCH ligand DLK1 acts as a NOTCH antagonist in renal injury regulating the Th17-mediated inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W3115488791,"Purpose Recent studies suggest that occupational inhalant exposures trigger exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but findings are conflicting. Methods We included 7,768 individuals with self-reported asthma (n = 3,215) and/or spirometric airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 )/ forced expiratory volume (FVC) &lt;0.70) (n = 5,275) who participated in The Copenhagen City Heart Study or The Copenhagen General Population Study from 2001–2016. Occupational exposure was assigned by linking job codes with job exposure matrices, and exacerbations were defined by register data on oral corticosteroid treatment, emergency care unit assessment or hospital admission. Associations between occupational inhalant exposure each year of follow-up and exacerbation were assessed by Cox regression with time varying exposure and age as the underlying time scale. Results Participants were followed for a median of 4.6 years (interquartile range, IQR 5.4), during which 870 exacerbations occurred. Exacerbations were not associated with any of the selected exposures (high molecular weight sensitizers, low molecular weight sensitizers, irritants or low and high levels of mineral dust, biological dust, gases &amp; fumes or the composite variable vapours, gases, dusts or fumes). Hazards ratios ranged from 0.8 (95% confidence interval: 0.7;1.0) to 1.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.9;1.7). Conclusion Exacerbations of obstructive airway disease were not associated with occupational inhalant exposures assigned by a job exposure matrix. Further studies with alternative exposure assessment are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3116017166,"Objectives Our previous study showed that long-term practitioners of Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) had around 7% larger grey matter volume (GMV) in the whole brain compared with healthy controls; however, when testing individual regions, only 5 small brain areas were statistically different between groups. Under the hypothesis that those results were statistically conservative, with the same dataset, we investigated in more detail the regional differences in GMV associated with the practice of SYM, with a different statistical approach. Design Twenty-three experienced practitioners of SYM and 23 healthy non-meditators matched on age, sex and education level, were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their GMV were extracted and compared using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM). Using a novel ad-hoc general linear model, statistical comparisons were made to observe if the GMV differences between meditators and controls were statistically significant. Results In the 16 lobe area subdivisions, GMV was statistically significantly different in 4 out of 16 areas: in right hemispheric temporal and frontal lobes, left frontal lobe and brainstem. In the 116 AAL area subdivisions, GMV difference was statistically significant in 11 areas. The GMV differences were statistically more significant in right hemispheric brain areas. Conclusions The study shows that long-term practice of SYM is associated with larger GMV overall, and with significant differences mainly in temporal and frontal areas of the right hemisphere and the brainstem. These neuroplastic changes may reflect emotional and attentional control mechanisms developed with SYM. On the other hand, our statistical ad-hoc method shows that there were more brain areas with statistical significance compared to the traditional methodology which we think is susceptible to conservative Type II errors."
https://openalex.org/W3116019271,"Identifying priority conservation areas plays a significant role in conserving biodiversity under climate change, but uncertainties create challenges for conservation planning. To reduce uncertainties in the conservation planning framework, we developed an adaptation index to assess the effect of topographic complexity on species adaptation to climate change, which was incorporated into the conservation framework as conservation costs. Meanwhile, the species distributions were predicted by the Maxent model, and the priority conservation areas were optimized during different periods in Sichuan province by the Marxan model. Our results showed that the effect of topographic complexity was critical for species adaptation, but the adaptation index decreased with the temperature increase. Based on the conservation targets and costs, the distributions of priority conservation areas were mainly concentrated in mountainous areas around the Sichuan Basin where may be robust to the adaptation to climate change. In the future, the distributions of priority conservation areas had no evident changes, accounting for about 26% and 28% of the study areas. Moreover, most species habitats could be conserved in terms of conservation targets in these priority conservation areas. Therefore, our approach could achieve biodiversity conservation goals and be highly practical. More importantly, quantifying the effect of topography also is critical for options for planning conservation areas in response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3118155546,"When cells with excess DNA, such as tetraploid cells, undergo cell division, it can contribute to cellular transformation via asymmetrical chromosome segregation-generated genetic diversity. Cell cycle progression of tetraploid cells is suppressed by large tumor suppressor 2 (LATS2) kinase-induced inhibitory phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP). We recently reported that the oncogene v-Src induces tetraploidy and promotes cell cycle progression of tetraploid cells by suppressing LATS2 activity. We explore here the mechanism by which v-Src suppresses LATS2 activity and the role of LATS2 in v-Src-expressing cells. LATS2 was directly phosphorylated by v-Src and the proto-oncogene c-Src, resulting in decreased LATS2 kinase activity. This kinase-deficient LATS2 accumulated in a YAP transcriptional activity-dependent manner, and knockdown of either LATS2 or the LATS2-binding partner moesin-ezrin-radixin-like protein (Merlin) accelerated v-Src-induced membrane bleb formation. Upon v-Src expression, the interaction of Merlin with LATS2 was increased possibly due to a decrease in Merlin phosphorylation at Ser518, the dephosphorylation of which is required for the open conformation of Merlin and interaction with LATS2. LATS2 was colocalized with Merlin at the plasma membrane in a manner that depends on the Merlin-binding region of LATS2. The bleb formation in v-Src-expressing and LATS2-knockdown cells was rescued by the reexpression of wild-type or kinase-dead LATS2 but not the LATS2 mutant lacking the Merlin-binding region. These results suggest that the kinase-deficient LATS2 plays a role with Merlin at the plasma membrane in the maintenance of cortical rigidity in v-Src-expressing cells, which may cause tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3115845085,"Background In real-world practice settings, there is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of antiplatelet drugs, including clopidogrel, aspirin, and ticlopidine, in stroke prevention. Purpose To compare the efficacies between aspirin and clopidogrel and aspirin and ticlopidine in stroke prevention. Methods This population-based case-cohort study utilized the data obtained from a randomized sample of one million subjects in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients who were hospitalized owing to the primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010 and treated with aspirin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel were included in the study. Propensity score matching with a 1:4 ratio was performed to compare aspirin with ticlopidine and clopidogrel. The criteria for inclusion were the use of one of the three antiplatelet drugs for more than 14 days within the first month after the stroke and then continued use of the antiplatelet drugs until the study endpoint of recurrent stroke. Results During the 3-year follow-up period, the recurrent stroke rates were 1.62% (42/2585), 1.48% (3/203), and 2.55% (8/314) in the aspirin, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel groups, respectively. Compared with the patients treated with aspirin, those treated with clopidogrel and ticlopidine showed competing risk-adjusted hazard ratios of recurrent stroke of 2.27 (1.02–5.07) and 0.62 (0.08–4.86), respectively. Conclusion Compared with the patients treated with aspirin, those treated with clopidogrel were at a higher risk of recurrent stroke. For stroke prevention, aspirin was superior to clopidogrel whereas ticlopidine was not inferior to aspirin."
https://openalex.org/W3116326314,"Cancer is responsible annually for around 27% of all deaths in Spain, 15% of which are caused by colorectal cancer. This malignancy has increased its incidence considerably over the past years, which surely impacts global productivity losses. The evaluation of lost productivity due to premature mortality provides valuable information that guides healthcare policies into the establishment of prevention and screening programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the productivity losses from premature deaths due to colorectal cancer over a ten year period (2008–2017). The costs derived from premature mortality due to this highly prevalent cancer were estimated using data on mortality, age- and sex-specific reference salaries and unemployment rates in Spain via the human capital approach. Between 2008 and 2017, 15,103 persons died per year from colorectal cancer, representing almost 15% of all cancer-related deaths. Annually, 25,333 years of potential productive life were estimated to be lost on average, 14,992 in males and 10,341 in females. Productivity losses summed €510.8 million in in 2017, and the cancers of the colon and rectum accounted for 9.6% of cancer-related productivity losses in 2017 in Spain. Colorectal cancer has an important weight in terms of productivity losses within the Spanish population, consequently, prevention and early detection programmes should be promoted and implemented to achieve significant reductions in mortality and productivity losses."
https://openalex.org/W3117359297,"Purpose Progressive Tinnitus Management (PTM) is an evidence-based interdisciplinary stepped-care approach to improving quality of life for patients with tinnitus. PTM was endorsed by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Audiology leadership in 2009. Factors affecting implementation of PTM are unknown. We conducted a study to: 1) estimate levels of PTM program implementation in VA Audiology and Mental Health clinics across the country; and 2) identify barriers and facilitators to PTM implementation based on the experiences of VA audiologists and mental health providers. Method We conducted an anonymous, web-based survey targeting Audiology and Mental Health leaders at 144 major VA facilities. Quantitative analyses summarized respondents’ facility characteristics and levels of program implementation (full PTM, partial PTM, or no PTM). Qualitative analyses identified themes in factors influencing the implementation of PTM across VA sites. Results Surveys from 87 audiologists and 66 mental health clinicians revealed that few facilities offered full PTM; the majority offered partial or no PTM. Inductive analysis of the open-ended survey responses identified seven factors influencing implementation of PTM: 1) available resources, 2) service collaboration, 3) prioritization, 4) Veterans’ preferences and needs, 5) clinician training, 6) awareness of (evidence-based) options, and 7) perceptions of scope of practice. Conclusion Results suggest wide variation in services provided, a need for greater engagement of mental health providers in tinnitus care, and an interest among both audiologists and mental health providers in receiving tinnitus-related training. Future research should address barriers to PTM implementation, including methods to: 1) improve understanding among mental health providers of their potential role in tinnitus management; 2) enhance coordination of tinnitus-related care between health care disciplines; and 3) collect empirical data on Veterans’ need for and interest in PTM, including delivery by telehealth modalities."
https://openalex.org/W3114971662,"Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSCs) are a class of immunosuppressive immune cells with prognostic value in many solid tumors. It is reported that the proportion of mMDSCs in the peripheral blood can be a predictive marker for response to cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we performed a correlation analysis of the proportion of mMDSCs in freshly-drawn peripheral blood, levels of plasma proteins, and demographic factors in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, to find factors that could be used to predict mMDSC proportions. Freshly-drawn mMDSCs were measured using flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n = 24) and CRC patients (n = 78). The plasma concentrations of 29 different cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and enzymes were measured using a multiplex assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation analysis to find mMDSC-associated factors was conducted using univariate and multivariate models. In univariate correlation analysis, there were no plasma proteins that were associated with mMDSC proportions in CRC patients. In multivariate analysis, considering all variables including age, sex, and plasma proteins, levels of inducible nitric acid synthase (iNOS) (p = 0.013) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (p = 0.035) were associated with mMDSC proportion in PBMCs (mMDSC proportion [%] = 0.2929 − 0.2389 * PDGF-BB + 0.3582 * iNOS) (p &lt; 0.005, r = 0.32). Measuring the plasma concentrations of iNOS and PDGF-BB may be useful in predicting the proportion of mMDSCs in CRC patients’ peripheral blood. Further research is required to establish and validate these predictive factors. Data registration Patient data were registered in an anonymization system at Tsukuba Clinical Research &amp; Development Organization (T-CReDO)."
https://openalex.org/W3115655869,"Numerous studies have confirmed that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to pesticides can lead to functional deficits in the developing brain. This study aimed to investigate whether combined exposure to paraquat (PQ) and maneb (MB) during puberty could cause permanent toxic effects in the neural system of rats. In addition, the neuroprotective function of taurine (T) and its possible mechanism were investigated. Rats were administered PQ + MB intragastrically for 12 continuous weeks, while taurine dissolved in water was fed to the rats for 24 continuous weeks. In the behavioral tests, the rats' trajectories became complex, and the reaction latencies and mistake frequencies increased. Significant changes were found in the hippocampal neurons of the PQ + MB groups but not in the taurine treatment groups. PQ + MB stimulated cAMP to reduce the production of protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibited the activation of other elements, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), phospho-CREB (p-CREB), immediate-early genes (IEGs)Arc, and c-Fos. Importantly, taurine regulated the level of cAMP and the expression of the abovementioned proteins. Together, our findings implied that adolescent exposure to PQ + MB may impact the behavior and cognitive function of rats via the cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway, while taurine may in turn exert neuroprotection by diminishing these impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3114184220,"Introduction Patients presenting with tears of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) can have ulnar positive variance, for which the clinical relevance to concomitant ulnar impaction syndrome (UIS) may be unclear. We hypothesized that maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), a semiquantitative single-photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) value, would distinguish between the traumatic TFCC tear and degenerative TFCC tear associated with the UIS. This study aimed to compare SUVmax between patients with TFCC tear only and patients with TFCC tear and UIS. Methods A total of 26 patients presenting with TFCC tears on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underwent semiquantitative SPECT/CT examinations. The diagnosis of concomitant UIS was made based on positive ulnar impaction tests and MRI findings. We compared the SUVmax between patients with and without concomitant UIS. We also calculated the cutoff value for the diagnosis of UIS using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results Of 26 patients, 14 had concomitant UIS, and 12 had TFCC tears only. The SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with concomitant UIS than in those without UIS (p = 0.048). With a SUVmax cutoff value of 4.09 for UIS, sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 82% were obtained. Conclusions In the semiquantitative SPECT/CT examinations of patients with TFCC tears, those with concomitant UIS had a higher SUVmax than those without UIS. Semiquantitative SPECT/CT can be helpful in confirming concomitant UIS in patients with TFCC tears."

This environment allows us to identify new determinants of conditional cooperation.

A random-effect linear panel regression analysis with an extensive set of controls confirms the findings."
https://openalex.org/W3114948426,"Podocytes have been proposed to be antigen presenting cells (APCs). In traditional APCs, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required for antigen presentation and global knockout of FcRn protects against glomerulonephritis. Since podocytes express FcRn, we sought to determine whether the absence of podocyte FcRn ameliorates immune-mediated disease. We examined MHCII and costimulatory markers expression in cultured wild type (WT) and FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) induced MHCII expression in both WT and KO podocytes but did not change CD80 expression. Neither WT nor KO expressed CD86 or inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) at baseline or with IFNγ. Using an antigen presentation assay, WT podocytes but not KO treated with immune complexes induced a modest increase in IL-2. Induction of the anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) model resulted in a significant decrease in glomerular crescents in podocyte-specific FcRn knockout mouse (podFcRn KO) versus controls but the overall percentage of crescents was low. To examine the effects of the podocyte-specific FcRn knockout in a model with a longer autologous phase, we used the nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTS) model. We found that the podFcRn KO mice had significantly reduced crescent formation and glomerulosclerosis compared to control mice. This study demonstrates that lack of podocyte FcRn is protective in immune mediated kidney disease that is dependent on an autologous phase. This study also highlights the difference between the anti-GBM model and NTS model of disease."
https://openalex.org/W3115162388,"Host defense peptides (HDPs) are an important first line of defense with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. Selection for increased body weight is hypothesized to be related to reduced immune response. We studied the relationships among body weight, age, and the HDP expression patterns in intestine and immune organs. We used chickens with marked differences of body sizes. The non-selected Daweishan mini chickens showed the highest indexes of immune organs and the lowest concentrations of the plasma immune parameters C3, C4, IgA, and IgY, while the commercial Avian broiler showed the opposite results. The Daweishan mini chickens showed the highest mRNA expressions of HDP genes in small intestine followed by the semi-selected Wuding chickens. Compared with local breeds, broiler chickens showed higher mRNA expression of HDP genes in spleen, thymus, and bursa. Body weight and HDP expression levels were negatively correlated in the intestine and positively in the immune organs. Our results indicated that the HDP immune regulatory roles in small intestine acted as first line of defense in innate immunity in local breeds, and as an adaptive immunity in broiler chickens. Selection was associated with different expression expressions of HDP genes in breed-, age-, and organ-specific manners."
https://openalex.org/W3115604138,"Background Job loss in patient with chronic illness like schizophrenia is the most serious public concern in the clinical and socio-economic terms worldwide. Patients with schizophrenia usually have unsatisfactory job termination like quitting or getting fired which results well-established negative outcomes. The complex interplay between one another has made job and mental illness the focus areas. In the developing nations, there is limited study on these areas in spite of higher rates of job loss. Objectives This study aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of job loss among schizophrenia outpatient units in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted at Saint Amanuel Mental Specialized Hospital among schizophrenia outpatient units in Addis Ababa from May to June 2018. A total of 421 study subjects were interviewed using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Perceived devaluation and discrimination scale. Out of the total study participants, female populations were slightly higher (50.4%) and the majorities (38.6%) were orthodox religion followers. Study characteristics was summarized using descriptive statistics and bi-variable and multivariable analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 24. Furthermore, those factors at p value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results The prevalence of job loss among patients with schizophrenia was 37.3%. Factors including unmarried [AOR = 2.42:95% CI (1.28, 4.54)], divorced [AOR = 2.34: 95% CI (1.16, 4.71)], severe positive symptoms [AOR = 2.03: 95% CI (1.15, 3.60)], severe general psychopathology [AOR = 1.76: 95% CI (1.01, 3.08)], and poor level of social and occupational functioning [AOR = 5.05: 95% CI (2.81, 9.09)] were significantly associated with job loss among schizophrenia people. Conclusion This study suggested that job loss among schizophrenia outpatients was high. There was significant association among people with unmarried, divorced, severe positive symptoms, poor functionality and higher general psychopathology. Therefore, clinical and psychosocial factors were responsible for job loss which warrant further attention and investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3115612629,"Among the fascinating adaptations to limiting oxygen conditions (hypoxia) is the suppression of food intake and weight loss. In humans, this phenomenon is called high-altitude anorexia and is observed in people suffering from acute mountain syndrome. The high-altitude anorexia appears to be conserved in evolution and has been seen in species across the animal kingdom. However, the mechanism underlying the recovery of eating behavior after hypoxia is still not known. Here, we show that the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein PITP-1 is essential for the fast recovery of eating behavior after hypoxia in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike the neuroglobin GLB-5 that accelerates the recovery of eating behavior through its function in the oxygen (O2 )-sensing neurons, PITP-1 appears to act downstream, in neurons that express the mod-1 serotonin receptor. Indeed, pitp-1 mutants display wild-type-like O2 -evoked-calcium responses in the URX O2 -sensing neuron. Intriguingly, loss-of-function of protein kinase C 1 (PKC-1) rescues pitp-1 mutants' recovery after hypoxia. Increased diacylglycerol (DAG), which activates PKC-1, attenuates the recovery of wild-type worms. Together, these data suggest that PITP-1 enables rapid recovery of eating behavior after hypoxia by limiting DAG's availability, thereby limiting PKC activity in mod-1-expressing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3116264453,"Engaging in facial emotion mimicry during social interactions encourages empathy and functions as a catalyst for interpersonal bonding. Decreased reflexive mirroring of facial expressions has been observed in individuals with different non-psychotic disorders, relative to healthy controls. Given reports of interpersonal relationship difficulties experienced by those who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), it is of interest to explore facial emotion mimicry in individuals with a history of this behaviour (HNSSI). Among other things, this will enable us to better understand their emotion regulation and social interaction challenges. Surface facial electromyography (fEMG) was used to record the reflexive facial mimicry of 30 HNSSI and 30 controls while they passively observed a series of dynamic facial stimuli showing various facial expressions of emotion. Beginning with a neutral expression, the stimuli quickly morphed to one of 6 prototypic emotional expressions (anger, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, or sadness). Mimicry was assessed by affixing surface electrodes to facial muscles known to exhibit a high degree of electrical activity in response to positive and negative emotions: the corrugator supercilii and the zygomaticus major. HNSSI participants, relative to controls, exhibited significantly less electrical activity in the corrugator muscle in response to viewing angry stimuli, and significantly less of an expected relaxation in muscle activity in response to viewing happy stimuli. Mirroring these results, greater endorsement of social influence as a motivator for engaging in NSSI was associated with less mimicry, and greater endorsement of emotion regulation as a motivator was associated with greater incongruent muscle response when viewing happy faces. These findings lend support to the theory that social interaction difficulties in HNSSI might be related to implicit violations of expected social rules exhibited through facial mimicry nonconformity."
https://openalex.org/W3116666898,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a multienzyme complex that plays a key role in energy metabolism by converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. An increase of nuclear PDC has been shown to be correlated with an increase of histone acetylation that requires acetyl-CoA. PDC has been reported to form a ~ 10 MDa macromolecular machine that is proficient in performing sequential catalytic reactions via its three components. In this study, we show that the PDC displays size versatility in an ionic strength-dependent manner using size exclusion chromatography of yeast cell extracts. Biochemical analysis in combination with mass spectrometry indicates that yeast PDC (yPDC) is a salt-labile complex that dissociates into sub-megadalton individual components even under physiological ionic strength. Interestingly, we find that each oligomeric component of yPDC displays a larger size than previously believed. In addition, we show that the mammalian PDC also displays this uncommon characteristic of salt-lability, although it has a somewhat different profile compared to yeast. We show that the activity of yPDC is reduced in higher ionic strength. Our results indicate that the structure of PDC may not always maintain its ~ 10 MDa organization, but is rather variable. We propose that the flexible nature of PDC may allow modulation of its activity."
https://openalex.org/W3114321352,"This paper examines recent changes in the life trajectories of Indian women. We use data from four major national population surveys that span the years 1998–2016. We look at several cohorts of women across the states and regions. We compare decisions related to education, marriage, childbearing and participation in the labor force. Though there is considerable diversity across states and regions, as well as religious groups, we find some consistent patterns that emerge everywhere. First, educational attainment and the age at marriage have been steadily increasing. Women who do not complete secondary school are more likely to marry early. Second, caste and religion (rather than education) play a significant role in decisions after marriage, such as the timing of births, the use of contraception and labor force participation. Third, women from disadvantaged communities continue to have very different life trajectories than other social groups. They are more likely to use contraception and participate in the labor force. Lower levels of schooling also appear to exacerbate the disadvantages of social identity. The pace of these changes varies sharply across states as well as regions of the country."
https://openalex.org/W3114714162,"The effort to understand the genetic basis of human sociality has been encouraged by the diversity and heritability of social traits like cooperation. This task has remained elusive largely because most studies of sociality and genetics use sample sizes that are often unable to detect the small effects that single genes may have on complex social behaviors. The lack of robust findings could also be a consequence of a poor characterization of social phenotypes. Here, we explore the latter possibility by testing whether refining measures of cooperative phenotypes can increase the replication of previously reported associations between genetic variants and cooperation in small samples. Unlike most previous studies of sociality and genetics, we characterize cooperative phenotypes based on strategies rather than actions. Measuring strategies help differentiate between similar actions with different underlaying social motivations while controlling for expectations and learning. In an admixed Latino sample (n = 188), we tested whether cooperative strategies were associated with three genetic variants thought to influence sociality in humans— MAOA -uVNTR, OXTR rs53576, and AVPR1 RS3. We found no association between cooperative strategies and any of the candidate genetic variants. Since we were unable to replicate previous observations our results suggest that refining measurements of cooperative phenotypes as strategies is not enough to overcome the inherent statistical power problem of candidate gene studies."
https://openalex.org/W3116520089,"Background In response to longstanding concerns around the quality of female sterilization services provided at public health facilities in India, the Government of India issued standards and quality assurance guidelines for female sterilization services in 2014. However, implementation remains a challenge. The Maternal and Child Survival Program rolled out a package of competency-based trainings, periodic mentoring, and easy-to-use job aids in parts of five states to increase service providers’ adherence to key practices identified in the guidelines. Methods The study employed a before-and-after quasi-experimental design with a matched comparison arm to examine the effect of the intervention on provider practices in two states: Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Direct observations of female sterilization services were conducted in selected public health facilities, using a checklist of 30 key practices, at two points in time. Changes in adherence to key practices from baseline to endline were compared at 12 intervention and 12 comparison facilities using a difference in difference analysis. Results Several key practices were well-established prior to the intervention, with adherence levels over 90% at baseline, including hemoglobin and urine testing, use of sterile surgical gloves and instruments, and recommended surgical technique. However, adherence to many other practices was extremely low at baseline. The program significantly increased adherence to nine practices, including those related to ascertaining client’s medical eligibility, client-provider interaction, the consent process, and post-operative care. The greatest improvement was observed in the provision of written instructions for clients prior to discharge. At endline, however, adherence remained below 50% for 14 practices. Conclusion Low adherence to key practices at baseline confirmed the need for quality improvement interventions in female sterilization services. While the intervention improved adherence to certain practices around admission and post-operative care, inadequate human resources and infrastructure, among other factors, may have blunted the impact of the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3113868082,"Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive inflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology. The number of reported AIH cases is increasing in the developed countries but the same cannot be said about sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Paediatric AIH diagnosis is usually missed and patients present with decompensated liver disease. Our study highlights the clinical profile of paediatric AIH cases at a referral hospital in Ghana. Methods This is a retrospective review of all cases of children diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis at the gastroenterology clinic in Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana. Data was extracted from the patients’ records from April 2016 to October 2019. These children were diagnosed based on the presence of autoantibodies, elevated immunoglobulin G and histologic presence of interphase hepatitis with the exclusion of hepatitis A, B, C and E depending on their clinical presentation, Wilson’s disease, HIV, Schistosomiasis and sickle cell disease. Results Thirteen patients aged between 5 years to 13 years with a mean age of 10 years were diagnosed with AIH. All the patients had type 1 AIH with majority 8 (61.5%) being females. Most of the children presented with advanced liver disease with complications. Three patients had other associated autoimmune diseases. The patients were treated with prednisolone with or without azathioprine depending on the severity of the liver disease. Conclusion Majority of paediatric AIH presents with advanced liver disease. There is the need for early detection to change the natural history of AIH in SSA."
https://openalex.org/W3116528062,"The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.4 is a crucial regulator of nociceptive signaling in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Moreover, Kv3.4 dysfunction has been linked to neuropathic pain. Although kinases and phosphatases can directly modulate Kv3.4 gating, the signaling mechanisms regulating the expression and stability of the Kv3.4 protein are generally unknown. We explored a potential role of PKCε and found an unexpected interaction that has a positive effect on Kv3.4 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical association between PKCε and Kv3.4 in both heterologous cells and rat DRG neurons. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type and constitutively active forms of PKCε, expression of a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme inhibits Kv3.4 expression and membrane localization through a dominant negative effect. Co-expression of Kv3.4 with the wild-type, constitutively active, or catalytically inactive forms of PKCε had no significant effects on Kv3.4 gating. These results suggest that a novel physical interaction of the Kv3.4 channel with functional PKCε primarily determines its stability and localization in DRG neurons. This interaction is akin to those of previously identified accessory ion channel proteins, which could be significant in neural tissues where Kv3.4 regulates electrical signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3118018628,"Etoposide-induced 2.4 (EI24) exerts tumor suppressor activity through participating in cell apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation. However, its role in renal diseases has not been elucidated. This study showed that the EI24 level decreased gradually in the kidneys of mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in another fibrosis model induced by diabetic kidney disease. The overexpression of EI24 was used to investigate the possible role both in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression 1 day after UUO through tail vein injection alleviated the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). EI24 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition, excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix, and activation of fibroblasts. Furthermore, administration of EI24-overexpressing plasmids restrained the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) through regulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of TRAF2, and then, inhibited the expression of downstream inflammation-associated cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in mouse kidney after UUO. In conclusion, the data indicated that EI24, a novel anti-fibrosis regulator, was important in the progression of RIF."
