https://openalex.org/W2963121203,"A re-analysis of intraclass correlation (ICC) theory is presented together with Monte Carlo simulations of ICC probability distributions. A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given."
https://openalex.org/W2921236268,"The current physical goods economy produces materials by extracting finite valuable resources without taking their end of the life and environmental impact into account. Mycelium-based materials offer an alternative fabrication paradigm, based on the growth of materials rather than on extraction. Agricultural residue fibres are inoculated with fungal mycelium, which form an interwoven three-dimensional filamentous network binding the feedstock into a lightweight material. The mycelium-based material is heat-killed after the growing process. In this paper, we investigate the production process, the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of mycelium-based composites made with different types of lignocellulosic reinforcement fibres combined with a white rot fungus, Trametes versicolor. This is the first study reporting the dry density, the Young’s modulus, the compressive stiffness, the stress-strain curves, the thermal conductivity, the water absorption rate and a FTIR analyse of mycelium-based composites by making use of a fully disclosed protocol with T. versicolor and five different type of fibres (hemp, flax, flax waste, softwood, straw) and fibre processings (loose, chopped, dust, pre-compressed and tow). The thermal conductivity and water absorption coefficient of the mycelium composites with flax, hemp, and straw have an overall good insulation behaviour in all the aspects compared to conventional materials such as rock wool, glass wool and extruded polystyrene. The conducted tests reveal that the mechanical performance of the mycelium-based composites depends more on the fibre processing (loose, chopped, pre-compressed, and tow), and size than on the chemical composition of the fibres. These experimental results show that mycelium-composites can fulfil the requirements of thermal insulation and have the potential to replace fosile-based composites. The methology used to evaluate the suitability and selection of organic waste-streams proved to be effective for the mycelium-material manufacturing applications."

Some mutations are under positive selection, conferring a competitive advantage over wild-type cells. We speculated that altering the selective pressure on mutant cell populations may cause them to expand or contract. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of oxidative stress from low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) on wild-type and p53 mutant cells in the transgenic mouse esophagus. We found that LDIR drives wild-type cells to stop proliferating and differentiate. p53 mutant cells are insensitive to LDIR and outcompete wild-type cells following exposure. Remarkably, combining antioxidant treatment and LDIR reverses this effect, promoting wild-type cell proliferation and p53 mutant differentiation, reducing the p53 mutant population. Thus, p53-mutant cells can be depleted from the normal esophagus by redox manipulation, showing that external interventions may be used to alter the mutational landscape of an aging tissue."

Objectives were to use compositional analyses to examine the combined and relative associations of sedentary time (ST), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA), and vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) with cardiometabolic biomarkers in a representative sample of children and youth. Methods This cross-sectional study included 2544 participants aged 6–17 years from the 2003–2006 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ST (<100 counts per minute), LPA (100 counts per minute to <4 METs; Freedson age-specific equation), MPA (4 to <7 METs), and VPA (≥7 METs) were accelerometer-derived. Cardiometabolic biomarkers included waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) z-score, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and blood pressure. Triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and LDL-cholesterol were measured in a fasting sub-sample of adolescents (n = 670). Compositional linear regression models were conducted. Results The composition of ST, LPA, MPA, and VPA was significantly associated with BMI z-score, log waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, and log plasma glucose (variance explained: 1–29%). Relative to the other three behaviors, VPA was negatively associated with BMI z-score (γVPA = -0.206, p = 0.005) and waist circumference (γVPA = -0.03, p = 0.001). Conversely, ST was positively associated with waist circumference (γST = 0.029, p = 0.013). ST and VPA were also positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (γST = 2.700, p = 0.018; γVPA = 1.246, p = 0.038), relative to the other behaviors, whereas negative associations were observed for LPA (γLPA = -2.892, p = 0.026). Finally, VPA was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol, relative to other behaviors (γVPA = 0.058, p<0.001). Conclusions The ST and physical activity composition appears important for many aspects of cardiometabolic health in children and youth. Compositions with more time in higher-intensity activities may be better for some aspects of cardiometabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W2963106019,"One mechanism through which S. cerevisiae may improve the performance of pigs is by altering the composition of the gut microbiota, a response that may be enhanced by early postnatal supplementation of probiotics. To test this hypothesis, newborn piglets (16 piglets/group) were treated with either S. cerevisiae yeast (5 x 109 cfu/pig: Low) or (2.5 x 1010 cfu/piglet: High) or equivalent volume of sterile water (Control) by oral gavage every other day starting from day 1 of age until weaning (28±1 days of age). Piglet body weight was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24 and 28 and average daily gain (ADG) calculated for the total period. At weaning, piglets were euthanized to collect cecum content for microbial profiling by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ADG was higher in both Low and High yeast groups than in Control group (P<0.05). Alpha diversity analyses indicated a more diverse microbiota in the Control group compared with Low yeast group; the High yeast being intermediate (P < 0.01). Similarly, Beta diversity analyses indicated differences among treatments (P = 0.03), mainly between Low yeast and Control groups (P = 0.02). The sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) indicated that Control group was discriminated by a higher abundance of Veillonella, Dorea, Oscillospira and Clostridium; Low yeast treated pigs by higher Blautia, Collinsella and Eubacterium; and High yeast treated pigs by higher Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Parabacteroides, Mogibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis showed that piglet ADG was positively correlated with genus Prevotella in High yeast group. Yeast supplementation significantly affected microbial diversity in cecal contents of suckling piglets associated with an improvement of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, yeast treatment improved piglet performance and shaped the piglet cecum microbiota composition in a dose dependent way."
https://openalex.org/W2962765391,"When the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used for aerial spraying, the downwash airflow generated by the UAV rotor will interact with the crop canopy and form a conical vortex shape in the crop plant. The size of the vortex will directly affect the outcome of the spraying operation. Six one-way spraying were performed by the UAV in a rice field with different but random flying altitude and velocities within the optimal operational range to form different vortex patterns. The spraying reagent was clear water, which was collected by water sensitive paper (WSP), and then the WSP was analyzed to study the droplets deposition effects in different vortex states. The results showed that the formation of the vortex significantly influenced the droplet deposition. To be specific, the droplet deposition amount in the obvious-vortex (OV) state was about 1.5 times of that in the small-scale (SV) vortex state, and 7 times of that in the non-vortex (NV) state. In the OV state, the droplets mainly deposited directly below and on both sides of the route. The deposition amount, coverage rate and droplet size increased from top to bottom of the crops with the deposition amount, coverage rate, and volume median diameter (VMD) ranging 0.204-0.470 μL/cm2, 3.31%-7.41%, and 306-367μm, respectively. In the SV state, droplets mainly deposited in the vortex area directly below the route. The deposition amount in the downwind direction was bigger than that in the upwind direction. The maximum of deposition amount, coverage rate and droplet size were found in the middle layer of the crops, the range are 0.177-0.334μL/cm2, 2.71%-5.30%, 295-370μm, respectively. In the NV state, the droplet mainly performed drifting motion, and the average droplet deposition amount in the downwind non-effective region was 29.4 times of that in the upwind non-effective region and 8.7 times of the effective vortex region directly below the route. The maximum of deposition amount, coverage rate and droplet size appeared in the upper layer of the crop, the range are 0.006-0.132μL/cm2, 0.17%-1.82%, 120-309μm, respectively, and almost no droplet deposited in the middle and lower part of the crop. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the droplet deposition amount was less than 40% in the state of obvious-vortex and small-scale vortex, and the worst penetration appeared in the non-vortex amounting to 65.97%. This work offers a basis for improving the spraying performance of UAV."
https://openalex.org/W2962792807,"X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA processing plays a crucial role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Upon accumulation of the UPR-converted XBP1 mRNA splicing from an unspliced (u) XBP1 (inactive) isoform to the spliced (s) XBP1 (active) isoform, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α) removes a 26-nucleotide intron from uXBP1 mRNA. Recent studies have reported the assessment of ER stress by examining the ratio of sXBP1 to uXBP1 mRNA (s/uXBP1 ratio) via densitometric analysis of PCR bands relative to increased levels of sXBP1 to uXBP1 using a housekeeping gene for normalization. However, this measurement is visualized by gel electrophoresis, making it very difficult to quantify differences between the two XBP1 bands and complicating data interpretation. Moreover, most commonly used housekeeping genes display an unacceptably high variable expression pattern of the s/uXBP1 ratio under different experimental conditions, such as various phases of development and different cell types, limiting their use as internal controls. For a more quantitative determination of XBP1 splicing activity, we measured the expression levels of total XBP1 (tXBP1: common region of s/uXBP1) and sXBP1 via real-time PCR using specific primer sets. We also designed universal real-time PCR primer sets capable of amplifying a portion of each u/s/tXBP1 mRNA that is highly conserved in eukaryotes, including humans, monkeys, cows, pigs, and mice. Therefore, we provide a more convenient and easily approachable quantitative real-time PCR method that can be used in various research fields to assess ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2962724279,"WRKY proteins are a large group of plant transcription factors that are involved in various biological processes, including biotic and abiotic stress responses, hormone response, plant development, and metabolism. WRKY proteins have been identified in several plants, but only a few have been identified in Capsicum annuum. Here, we identified a total of 62 WRKY genes in the latest pepper genome. These genes were classified into three groups (Groups 1–3) based on the structural features of their proteins. The structures of the encoded proteins, evolution, and expression under normal growth conditions were analyzed and 35 putative miRNA target sites were predicted in 20 CaWRKY genes. Moreover, the response to cold or CMV treatments of selected WRKY genes were examined to validate the roles under stresses. And alternative splicing (AS) events of some CaWRKYs were also identified under CMV infection. Promoter analysis confirmed that CaWRKY genes are involved in growth, development, and biotic or abiotic stress responses in hot pepper. The comprehensive analysis provides fundamental information for better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the WRKY-mediated regulation of developmental processes, as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2963310822,"Multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg isolates are frequently recovered in the Netherlands from poultry meat imported from South America. Our aim was to retrospectively assess the characteristics of the antimicrobial determinants, gene content and the clonal relatedness of 122 unique S. Heidelberg isolates from chicken meat from Brazil (n = 119) and Argentina (n = 3) that were imported between 2010 and 2015. These isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR and Illumina HiSeq2500 whole genome sequencing. Draft genomes were assembled to assess the gene content, and the phylogenetic relationships between isolates were determined using single nucleotide polymorphisms. Ciprofloxacin-resistance was identified in 98.4% of the isolates and 83.7% isolates showed resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime (83.6% and 82.8% respectively). Of the latter, 97.1% exhibited an AmpC phenotype and contained blaCMY-2, whereas the remaining three isolates contained an extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Of the 99 extended-spectrum cephalosporins-resistant isolates harboring CMY-2 plasmids, 56.6% contained the incompatibility group I1 replicon. Phylogenetic cluster analysis showed that all isolates from Brazil clustered together, with 49% occurring in clusters larger than 5 isolates that revealed intra-cluster similarities based on geographical location and/or resistance profiles. The remaining isolates were classified in smaller clusters or as singletons, highlighting the large diversity of S. Heidelberg in the poultry chain in Brazil that was revealed by this study. Considering the potential public health risk associated with multidrug-resistant S. Heidelberg in imported poultry, collaborative whole genome sequencing-based surveillance is needed to monitor the spread, pathogenic properties and epidemiological distribution of these isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2962856954,"Primate brains differ in size and architecture. Hypotheses to explain this variation are numerous and many tests have been carried out. However, after body size has been accounted for there is little left to explain. The proposed explanatory variables for the residual variation are many and covary, both with each other and with body size. Further, the data sets used in analyses have been small, especially in light of the many proposed predictors. Here we report the complete list of models that results from exhaustively combining six commonly used predictors of brain and neocortex size. This provides an overview of how the output from standard statistical analyses changes when the inclusion of different predictors is altered. By using both the most commonly tested brain data set and the inclusion of new data we show that the choice of included variables fundamentally changes the conclusions as to what drives primate brain evolution. Our analyses thus reveal why studies have had troubles replicating earlier results and instead have come to such different conclusions. Although our results are somewhat disheartening, they highlight the importance of scientific rigor when trying to answer difficult questions. It is our position that there is currently no empirical justification to highlight any particular hypotheses, of those adaptive hypotheses we have examined here, as the main determinant of primate brain evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2963051307,"Pearl millet is able to withstand dry and hot conditions and plays an important role for food security in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and India. However, low soil fertility and drought constrain pearl millet yield. One target to address these constraints through agricultural practices or breeding is root system architecture. In this study, in order to easily phenotype the root system in field conditions, we developed a model to predict root length density (RLD) of pearl millet plants from root intersection densities (RID) counted on a trench profile in field conditions. We identified root orientation as an important parameter to improve the relationship between RID and RLD. Root orientation was notably found to depend on soil depth and to differ between thick roots (more anisotropic with depth) and fine roots (isotropic at all depths). We used our model to study pearl millet root system response to drought and showed that pearl millet reorients its root growth toward deeper soil layers that retain more water in these conditions. Overall, this model opens ways for the characterization of the impact of environmental factors and management practices on pearl millet root system development."
https://openalex.org/W2963081987,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) by detoxifying superoxide. Three types of SOD are present in plants: FeSOD, CuSOD, and MnSOD. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three FeSOD genes, in which two (FSD2, and FSD3) are targeted to chloroplast thylakoids. Loss of FSD2 or FSD3 expression impairs growth and causes leaf bleaching. FSD2 and FSD3 form heterocomplexes present in chloroplast nucleoids, raising the question of whether FSD2 and FSD3 are functionally interchangeable. In this study, we examined how loss of FSD2 or FSD3 expression affects photosynthetic processes and whether overexpression of one compensates for loss of the other. Whereas loss of the cytosolic FSD1 had little effect, an fsd2 mutant exhibited increased superoxide production, reduced chlorophyll levels, lower PSII efficiency, a lower rate of CO2 assimilation, but elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). In contrast, fsd3 mutants failed to survive beyond the seedling stage and overexpression of FSD2 could not rescue the seedlings. Overexpression of FSD3 in an fsd2 mutant, however, partially reversed the fsd2 mutant phenotype resulting in improved growth characteristics. Overexpression of FSD2 or FSD3, either individually or together, had little effect. These results indicate that, despite functioning as FeSODs, FSD2 and FSD3 are functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2963870494,"The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for tooth loss in an extended age group of adults over 4 years. The prospective cohort study assessed adults (20–64 years old) in 2011 and 2015, from Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil. The sample selection was planned based on the adult population in the city. The inclusion criteria were randomly selected residences per census tract unit (one adult per household). The exclusion criteria comprised of a physical or psychological state that prevented the achievement of clinical procedures or understanding of the questionnaire. The home oral examination was performed using the index of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), the Community Periodontal Index according to the World Health Organization, and visible biofilm. Demographic and socio-economic data, information on health habits, and the use of dental services were obtained by questionnaire. The outcome was a presence incidence of tooth loss, assessed by the difference between Missing teeth (M>0) from DMFT in 2011 and that in 2015. The conceptual theoretical model ‘Ethnicity, aging and oral health outcomes’ was adapted for tooth loss and used in a Hierarchical multivariate Poisson Regression analysis (p<0.20). The reference category for the Poisson regression were individuals who had no missing teeth (M) due to caries or periodontal disease (p<0.05). There were a total of 143 (follow-up rate = 57.7%) participants in the four-year study, and there was incidence of tooth loss in 51 (35.7%) adults over this period. The risk factors for tooth loss were reason for seeking dental services by pain (RR = 2.72; 95.0% CI: 1.04–7.37), previous tooth loss (RR = 3.01; 95.0% CI: 1.18–7.73) and decayed teeth (RR = 2.87; 95.0% CI: 1.22–6.73). The risk factors for tooth loss were: reason for seeking dental services by pain, previous tooth loss and dental caries."
https://openalex.org/W2964310726,"Attending the veterinary clinic is an integral part of the physical welfare of every companion dog. However, some dogs experience their veterinary visits negatively, which poses a risk of injury to the veterinary staff, their guardian (owner) and themselves. It may also influence the regularity of non-urgent veterinary appointments. To date there have been conflicting reports relating to the proportion of dogs that show fear during their veterinary visits. In this study, we explored the risk factors associated with fear during veterinary examination and in novel situations (including first time at the veterinary clinic) from 26,555 responses in the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire database. According to their guardians, 41% of companion dogs displayed mild to moderate fearful behaviour when examined by a veterinarian, and 14% exhibited severe or extreme fear. A similar trend was observed with dogs responding fearfully when in unfamiliar situations, including the dog's first time at the veterinary clinic. Chi-squared tests showed every bivariate relationship between fear and the environmental and demographic factors measured was significant (p < 0.05). The most important predictors of fear in a veterinary examination were, in order: the dog's breed group (27.1%), their history of roles or activities (16.7%), where they were sourced (15.2%), their weight (12%), the age of other dogs in the household (9.5%) and dog owner experience (6.3%). However, combined these risk factors only explain a total of 7% of variance of fear observed during veterinary examination. This suggests that fear exhibited during veterinary visits is common in dogs, but that the environment or human-animal interactions are likely to contribute more to prevalence and severity of this problem than the demographic factors measured here. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for future research aimed at facilitating less stressful veterinary visits for dogs and their guardians."
https://openalex.org/W2963832561,"Despite the criticality of adherence to tuberculosis treatment, there is paucity of rigorous experimental research exploring the efficacy of interventions to promote adherence and a greater lack of inquiry addressing the integral role of adherence behaviour. The aim of this formative study was to examine the way in which the Wisepill evriMED Medication Event Reminder Monitor (MERM) was used among outpatients with drug susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis.In depth interviews were conducted with 20 outpatients receiving treatment from two public healthcare facilities in Thanh Hoa, a rural province in northern Viet Nam. Patients had been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of using the MERM device upon adherence for between 1-3 months. The control group used the device without an alert, while the intervention group used the device with a daily alert and scheduled dosing history review.All 20 patients interviewed were supportive of using the MERM device. Those able to be at home at the time that their treatment was due (50%) used the device as intended. Patients who worked all reported separating the time when the box was opened from the time at which they ingested their medication. Patients expressed fidelity to the prescribed medication taking time and concerns regarding the portability of the device. Limitations of the study surround the inclusion of a small sample population that did not experience factors that further compromise adherence.Data recorded by the box did not always accurately reflect usage patterns. The alert in the intervention arm was able to support adherence only in patients who did not work while completing their treatment. MERM implementation can be improved by better aligning prescriber instructions with patients' daily routines, and increasing the use of adherence data to guide adherence support practices. Healthcare staff need to be aware of potential barriers to optimal use of MERM devices. A rigorous qualitative approach to formative assessment is essential to inform the scale up of new digital technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2963064180,"A pair-matched longitudinal study conducted on three dairy farms in the U.S. High-Plains explored the temporal effects of two-dose ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (CCFA) treatment for metritis on third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistance among enteric E. coli in Holstein-Friesian cows. The current 13-day slaughter withholding period does not account for rising populations of third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) resistant bacteria in feces of animals following CCFA treatment. A total of 124 matched-pairs of cows were enrolled in the study. Cows diagnosed with postpartum metritis received the product twice at the labeled dose of 6.6 mg/kg subcutaneously at the base of alternating ears. Untreated cows-absent clinical metritis-were matched on lactation number and calving date. Feces were collected per rectum on days 0 (baseline), 6, 16, 28, and 56. Environmental samples, from watering troughs as well as surface manure from fresh-cow, hospital, maternity, and milking pens, and from the compost pile were collected prior to the animal sample collection period. Historical data on metritis rates and CCFA use were compiled from herd records. On day 0, cows exhibited an overall mean difference of over 4 log10 colony forming units (CFU) comparing 3GC resistant E. coli to the general E. coli population. At the first eligible slaughter date, the difference declined to 3.31 log10 CFU among cows in the CCFA group (P<0.01 compared to control cows). Such differences were no longer observed between the treated and control groups by day 28. Results suggest a 13-day withholding period following the final treatment is insufficient to allow levels of 3GC resistant E. coli to return to baseline. This effect varied by farm and was dependent upon the starting level of resistance. A farm-specific extended slaughter-withholding period could reduce the microbial risk to food products at slaughter."
https://openalex.org/W2963042295,"Background Knowledge of risk factors for drug-related hospitalizations (DRHs) is limited. Aim To examine the prevalence of DRHs and the relationships between DRHs and various variables in multimorbid patients admitted to an internal medicine ward. Methods Multimorbid patients ≥ 18 years, using minimum of four regular drugs from minimum two therapeutic classes, were included from the Internal Medicine ward, Oslo University Hospital, Norway, from August 2014 to March 2016. Clinical pharmacists prospectively conducted medicines reconciliations and reviews to reveal drug-related problems (DRPs). Blinded for identified DRPs, an interdisciplinary group retrospectively made comprehensive, clinical assessments of each patient case to classify hospitalizations as drug-related (DRH) or non-drug-related (non-DRH). Age, sex distribution, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), renal function, aberrant genotype frequencies, body-mass index, number of drugs, proportion of patients which received assistance for drug administration from the home care service, and/or through multidose-dispensed drugs, and occurrence of specific DRP subgroups, were compared separately between patients with DRHs versus non-DRHs, followed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Hospitalizations were classified as drug-related in 155 of the 404 included patients (38%). Factors significantly associated with DRHs were occurrence of adverse effect DRPs (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–8.0), adherence issues (OR 2.9, 1.1–7.2), home care (OR 1.9, 1.1–3.5), drug monitoring DRPs (OR 1.9, 1.2–3.0), and CCI score ≥6 (OR 0.33, 0.14–0.77). Frequencies of aberrant genotypes did not differ between the patient groups, but in 41 patients with DRHs (26.5%), gene-drug interactions influenced the assessments of DRHs. Conclusion DRHs are prevalent in multimorbid patients with adverse effect DRPs and adherence issues as the most important risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2962964668,"Garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) is a popular vegetable cultivated worldwide. The secondary metabolites in its shoot are helpful for human health. We analyzed A. officinalis transcriptomes and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the biosynthesis of rutin and protodioscin, which are health-promoting functional compounds, and determined their association with stem color. We sequenced the complete mRNA transcriptome using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform in one white, three green, and one purple asparagus cultivars. A gene set was generated by de novo assembly of the transcriptome sequences and annotated using a BLASTx search. To investigate the relationship between the contents of rutin and protodioscin and their gene expression levels, rutin and protodioscin were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. A secondary metabolite analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the rutin content was higher in green asparagus, while the protodioscin content was higher in white asparagus. We studied the genes associated with the biosynthesis of the rutin and protodioscin. The transcriptomes of the five cultivars generated 336 599 498 high-quality clean reads, which were assembled into 239 873 contigs with an average length of 694 bp, using the Trinity v2.4.0 program. The green and white asparagus cultivars showed 58 932 DEGs. A comparison of rutin and protodioscin biosynthesis genes revealed that 12 of the 57 genes associated with rutin and two of the 50 genes associated with protodioscin showed more than four-fold differences in expression. These DEGs might have caused a variation in the contents of these two metabolites between green and white asparagus. The present study is possibly the first to report transcriptomic gene sets in asparagus. The DEGs putatively involved in rutin and protodioscin biosynthesis might be useful for molecular engineering in asparagus."
https://openalex.org/W2963391400,"Background Sleep deprivation is a well-known risk factor for the performance of medical professionals. Solid organ transplantation (especially orthotopic liver transplantation (oLT)) appears to be vulnerable since it combines technically challenging operative procedures with an often unpredictable start time, frequently during the night. Aim of this study was to analyze whether night time oLT has an impact on one-year graft and patient survival. Material and methods Deceased donor oLTs between 2006 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed and stratified for recipients with a start time at day (8 a.m. and 6 p.m.) or at night (6 p.m. to 8 a.m.). We examined donor as well as recipient demographics and primary outcome measure was one-year patient and graft survival. Results 350 oLTs were conducted in the study period, 154 (44%) during daytime and 196 (56%) during nighttime. Donor and recipient variables were comparable. One-year patient survival (daytime 75.3% vs nighttime 76.5%, p = 0.85) as well as graft survival (daytime 69.5% vs nighttime 73.5%, p = 0.46) were similar between the two groups. Frequencies of reoperation (daytime 53.2% vs nighttime 55.1%, p = 0.74) were also not significantly different. Conclusion Our retrospective single center data derived from a German transplant center within the Eurotransplant region provides evidence that oLT is a safe procedure irrespective of the starting time. Our data demonstrate that compared to daytime surgery nighttime liver transplantation is not associated with a greater risk of surgical complications. In addition, one-year graft and patient survival do not display inferior results in patients undergoing nighttime transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2963053563,"Knowing what animals eat is fundamental to our ability to understand and manage biodiversity and ecosystems, but researchers often must rely on indirect methods to infer trophic position and food intake. Using an approach that combines evidence from stable isotope analysis and DNA metabarcoding, we assessed the diet and trophic position of Anthene usamba butterflies, for which there are no known direct observations of larval feeding. An earlier study that analyzed adults rather than caterpillars of A. usamba inferred that this butterfly was aphytophagous, but we found that the larval guts of A. usamba and two known herbivorous lycaenid species contain chloroplast 16S sequences. Moreover, chloroplast barcoding revealed high sequence similarity between chloroplasts found in A. usamba guts and the chloroplasts of the Vachellia drepanolobium trees on which the caterpillars live. Stable isotope analysis provided further evidence that A. usamba caterpillars feed on V. drepanolobium, and the possibilities of strict herbivory versus limited omnivory in this species are discussed. These results highlight the importance of combining multiple approaches and considering ontogeny when using stable isotopes to infer trophic ecology where direct observations are difficult or impossible."
https://openalex.org/W2963166931,"Prion diseases are members of neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases (NPMDs) that include Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tauopathies, traumatic brain injuries, and chronic traumatic encephalopathies. No known therapeutics extend survival or improve quality of life of humans afflicted with prion disease. We and others developed a new approach to NPMD therapy based on reducing the amount of the normal, host-encoded protein available as substrate for misfolding into pathologic forms, using RNA interference, a catabolic pathway that decreases levels of mRNA encoding a particular protein. We developed a therapeutic delivery system consisting of small interfering RNA (siRNA) complexed to liposomes and addressed to the central nervous system using a targeting peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein. These liposome-siRNA-peptide complexes (LSPCs) cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver PrP siRNA to neuronal cells to decrease expression of the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC, which acts as a substrate for prion replication. Here we show that LSPCs can extend survival and improve behavior of prion-infected mice that remain immunotolerant to treatment. LSPC treatment may be a viable therapy for prion and other NPMDs that can improve the quality of life of patients at terminal disease stages."
https://openalex.org/W2963264325,"Escherichia coli infection of the female reproductive tract is a significant cause of disease in humans and animals, but simple animal models are lacking. Here we report that vaginal inoculation of uropathogenic E. coli strains UTI89 and CFT073 in non-pregnant, estrogen-treated mice resulted in robust colonization of the vagina and uterine horns, whereas titers of the lab strain MG1655 were significantly lower. Non-estrogenized mice also became colonized, but there was more variation in titers. A dose of 104 colony-forming units (CFU) UTI89 was sufficient to result in colonization in all estrogenized mice, and we also observed bacterial transfer between inoculated and uninoculated estrogenized cage mates. UTI89 infection led to inflammation and leukocyte infiltration into the uterine horns as evidenced by tissue histology. Flow cytometry experiments revealed that neutrophil, monocyte and eosinophil populations were significantly increased in infected uterine horns. This model is a simple way to study host-pathogen interactions in E. coli vaginal colonization and uterine infection. There are immediate implications for investigators studying urinary tract infection using mouse models, as few E. coli are required to achieve reproductive colonization, resulting in an additional, underappreciated mucosal reservoir."
https://openalex.org/W2963751302,"Background Work-related back and lower extremity disorders often present remarkable health and economic burdens on societies. Occupational barbers are usually neglected in research and policy actions, mainly in developing countries, and are hence more vulnerable to the conditions. So far, information about the factors influencing back and lower extremity disorders among barbers in Ethiopia is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors affecting back and lower extremity disorders among barbers in Gondar town, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2017. A sample of 434 barbers recruited using the systematic random sampling technique. A pre-tested standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire was interviewer-administered for data collection. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 20. The significance of associations was evaluated at ≤0.05 p-value with a 95% confidence intervals (CI) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR). Results The response rate was 98.8% (N = 429). The mean age and mean length of employment were 26.38 (standard deviations (SD) ± 4.78) and 4.91 years, respectively. The prevalence of work-related low back pain in the previous 12 months and in the last 7 days was 55.7% (N = 239) [95% CI (51.0, 60.4)] and 32.6% (N = 140), respectively. About 40.6% (n = 97) of the participants with back pains indicated their activities were limited. The prevalence of knee/leg and ankle pain was 39.4% (N = 169) and 25.6% (N = 110), respectively. Out of the participants, 17% (n = 41) sought treatment services. Less than half, 40.6% (n = 97) said they perceived high disability, while 38.1% (n = 91) explained their pain was intense (severe). Age [AOR: 2.001; 95% CI (1.174, 4.346)], alcohol use [AOR: 2.283; 95% CI (1.376, 3.789)], lack of safety training [AOR: 0.110; 95% CI (0.032, 0.271], working posture [AOR: 0.142; 95% CI (0.045, 0.215)], and length of employment [AOR: 1.650.132; 95% CI (1.107, 2.140] were significantly associated factors. Conclusions Back and lower extremity musculoskeletal pain and disability were found to be prevalent among Ethiopian barbers and to be associated with age, alcohol use, safety training, work postures, and length of employment. We believe that programs for management of musculoskeletal disorders need to address these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2930778633,"Where readers move their eyes, while proceeding forward along lines of text, has long been assumed to be determined in a top-down word-based manner. According to this classical view, readers of alphabetic languages would invariably program their saccades towards the center of peripheral target words, as selected based on the (expected) needs of ongoing (word-identification) processing, and the variability in within-word landing positions would exclusively result from systematic and random errors. Here we put this predominant hypothesis to a strong test by estimating the respective influences of language-related variables (word frequency and word predictability) and lower-level visuo-motor factors (word length and saccadic launch-site distance to the beginning of words) on both word-skipping likelihood and within-word landing positions. Our eye-movement data were collected while forty participants read 316 pairs of sentences, that differed only by one word, the prime; this was either semantically related or unrelated to a following test word of variable frequency and length. We found that low-level visuo-motor variables largely predominated in determining which word would be fixated next, and where in a word the eye would land. In comparison, language-related variables only had tiny influences. Yet, linguistic variables affected both the likelihood of word skipping and within-word initial landing positions, all depending on the words’ length and how far on average the eye landed from the word boundaries, but pending the word could benefit from peripheral preview. These findings provide a strong case against the predominant word-based account of eye-movement guidance during reading, by showing that saccades are primarily driven by low-level visuo-motor processes, regardless of word boundaries, while being overall subject to subtle, one-off, language-based modulations. Our results also suggest that overall distributions of saccades’ landing positions, instead of truncated within-word landing-site distributions, should be used for a better understanding of eye-movement guidance during reading."
https://openalex.org/W2963097186,"Dengue is a public health concern in northern Queensland, Australia. This study aimed to explore spatial and temporal characteristics of dengue cases in Queensland, and to identify high-risk areas after a 2009 dengue outbreak at fine spatial scale and thereby help in planning resource allocation for dengue control measures. Notifications of dengue cases for Queensland at Statistical Local Area (SLA) level were obtained from Queensland Health for the period 2010 to 2015. Spatial and temporal analysis was performed, including plotting of seasonal distribution and decomposition of cases, using regression models and creating choropleth maps of cumulative incidence. Both the space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used to identify and visualise the space-time clusters of dengue cases at SLA level. A total of 1,773 dengue cases with 632 (35.65%) autochthonous cases and 1,141 (64.35%) overseas acquired cases were satisfied for the analysis in Queensland during the study period. Both autochthonous and overseas acquired cases occurred more frequently in autumn and showed a geographically expanding trend over the study period. The most likely cluster of autochthonous cases (Relative Risk, RR = 54.52, p<0.001) contained 50 SLAs in the north-east region of the state around Cairns occurred during 2013–2015. A cluster of overseas cases (RR of 60.81, p<0.001) occurred in a suburb of Brisbane during 2012 to 2013. These results show a clear spatiotemporal trend of recent dengue cases in Queensland, providing evidence in directing future investigations on risk factors of this disease and effective interventions in the high-risk areas."
https://openalex.org/W2963325513,"While the area of plantation forest increased globally between 2010 and 2015, more than twice the area of natural forests was lost over the same period (6.5 million ha natural forest lost per year versus 3.2 million ha plantation gained per year). Consequently, there is an increasing need to understand how plantation land use affects biodiversity. The relative conservation value of plantation forests is context dependent, being influenced by previous land use, management regimes and landscape composition. What is less well understood, and of importance to conservation management, is the consistency of diversity patterns across regions, and the degree to which useful generalisations can be provided within and among bioregions. Here, we analyse forest birds in Ireland, France and Portugal, representing distinct regions across the Atlantic biogeographic area of Europe. We compared taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities among conifer plantations and semi-natural oak forests, and assessed correlations between species traits and forest type across these regions. Although bird composition (assessed with NMDS ordination) differed consistently between plantation and oak forests across all three regions, species richness and Shannon diversity did not show a consistent pattern. In Ireland and France, metrics of taxonomic diversity (richness and Shannon diversity), functional diversity, functional dispersion and phylogenetic diversity were greater in oak forests than plantations. However, in Portugal taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity did not differ significantly between forest types, while functional diversity and dispersion were statistically significantly greater in plantations. No single bird trait-forest type association correlated in a consistent direction across the three study regions. Trait associations for the French bird communities appeared intermediate between those in Ireland and Portugal, and when trait correlations were significant in both Ireland and Portugal, the direction of the correlation was always opposite. The variation in response of bird communities to conifer plantations indicates that care is needed when generalising patterns of community diversity and assembly mechanisms across regions."
https://openalex.org/W2962879371,"To investigate the detrimental effects of prolonged overall radiotherapy duration (ORTD) on survival outcomes of stage IIIB/C NSCLC patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (C-CRT).The study cohort consisted of 956 patients who underwent C-CRT for stage IIIB/C NSCLC. Primary endpoint was the association between the ORTD and overall survival (OS) with locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS) and PFS comprising the secondary endpoints. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized for accessibility of the cut-off that interacts with survival outcomes. Multivariate Cox model was utilized to identify the independent associates of survival outcomes.The ROC curve analysis exhibited significance at 49 days of ORTD cut-off that dichotomized patients into ORTD<50 versus ORTD≥50 days groups for OS [area under the curve (AUC): 82.8%; sensitivity: 81.1%; specificity: 74.8%], LRPFS (AUC: 91.9%; sensitivity: 90.6%; specificity: 76.3%), and PFS (AUC: 76.1%; sensitivity: 72.4%; specificity: 68.2%), respectively. Accordingly, ORTD≥50 days group had significantly shorter median OS (P<0.001), LRPFS (P<0.001), and PFS (P<0.001); and 10-year actuarial locoregional control (P<0.001) and distant metastases-free (P<0.011) rates than the ORTD<50 days group. The ORTD retained its significant association with survival outcomes at multivariate analyses independent of the other favorable covariates (p<0.001, for OS, LRPFS, and PFS): Stage IIIB disease (versus IIIC), lymph node bulk <2 cm (versus ≥2 cm), and 2-3 chemotherapy cycles (versus 1). The higher sensitivity for LRPFS (90.6%) than PFS (72.4%) on ROC curve analysis suggested the prolonged ORTD-induced decrements in locoregional control rates as the major cause of the poor survival outcomes.Longer ORTD beyond ≥50 days was associated with significantly poorer OS, LRPFS and PFS outcomes, where reduced locoregional control rates appeared to be the main causative."
https://openalex.org/W2963677693,"The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is the basis of benefit allocations within the USDA's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which administers nearly $70 billion in benefits to over 42 million people annually. To produce the allocation of food within the TFP, the USDA uses a mathematical optimization model that solves for the daily apportionment across various food groups. The model is constrained by nutritional and consumption requirements to produce an ""optimal"" allocation. Despite the importance of the TFP, the computational solution developed by the USDA has received insufficient attention, with only a handful of articles written on the TFP optimization model. Here, we run three alternative objective functions that are simpler than the one used by USDA. Our first alternative objective function minimizes the sum of squared errors between the consumed market basket of goods and an allocated market basket of goods, the second alternative objective function minimizes the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the consumed market basket of goods and an allocated market basket of goods, and the third alternative objective function minimizes the weighted absolute deviation of allocations and actual consumption expressed as a proportion of observed consumption. A clear theoretical advantage of either of our methods is that they eliminate the need to arbitrarily set allocated consumption to nonzero values, as is the case for the logarithmic objective function used by USDA. In an operational sense, we find that our model formulations produce an allocation that fits actual consumption better than the objective function employed by the USDA."
https://openalex.org/W2963852883,"The Tibetan Plateau is an important component of the global carbon cycle due to the large permafrost carbon pool and its vulnerability to climate warming. The Tibetan Plateau has experienced a noticeable warming over the past few decades and is projected to continue warming in the future. However, the direction and magnitude of carbon fluxes responses to climate change and elevated CO2 concentration under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios in the Tibetan Plateau grassland are poorly known. Here, we used a calibrated and validated biogeochemistry model, CENTURY, to quantify the contributions of climate change and elevated CO2 on the future carbon budget in the alpine grassland under three RCP scenarios. Though the Tibetan Plateau grassland was projected a net carbon sink of 16 ~ 25 Tg C yr-1 in the 21st century, the capacity of carbon sequestration was predicted to decrease gradually because climate-driven increases in heterotrophic respiration (Rh) (with linear slopes 0.49 ~ 1.62 g C m-2 yr-1) was greater than the net primary production (NPP) (0.35 ~ 1.52 g C m-2 yr-1). However, the elevated CO2 contributed more to plant growth (1.9% ~ 7.3%) than decomposition (1.7% ~ 6.1%), which could offset the warming-induced carbon loss. The interannual and decadal-scale dynamics of the carbon fluxes in the alpine grassland were primarily controlled by temperature, while the role of precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon cycle. The strengthened correlation between precipitation and carbon budget suggested that further research should consider the performance of precipitation in evaluating carbon dynamics in a warmer climate scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2962770547,"Microvascular proliferation (MVP), an aberrant vascular structure containing multilayered mitotically active endothelial- and smooth-muscle cells/pericytes, is a histopathological hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Although MVP tends to be associated with high-grade glioma, it has also been detected in WHO grade I pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). However, little is known about the mechanism underlying its formation. Using TP53 point mutations as a marker for tumor-derived cells, we earlier reported that MVP was partially converted from tumor cells via mesenchymal transition. In the current study we used the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene as a marker to assess whether MVPs in PA contained tumor-derived cells and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers. cDNA synthesized from frozen tissue of six PA patients operated at our institute was analyzed to detect the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The breakpoint in the fusion gene was identified by long and accurate PCR (LA-PCR) and Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA. Distinct tumor cells and cellular components of MVP were obtained by laser microdissection. For the qualitative and quantitative detection of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene we performed genomic and digital PCR assays. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to assess gene fusion in cellular components of MVP. Samples from three PA patients harbored the KIAA1549 exon 15, BRAF exon 9 fusion gene. In two patient samples with abundant MVP, RT-PCR assay detected strong bands arising from the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene in both tumor cells and cellular components of MVP. Digital PCR showed that vis-à-vis tumor tissue, its relative expression in cellular components of MVP was 42% in one- and 76% in another sample. FISH revealed amplified signals in both tumor cells and cellular components of MVP indicative of tandem duplication. Our findings suggest that in patients with PA, some cellular components of MVP contained tumor derived cell and/or phenotypically distinct tumor cells expressing vascular markers."
https://openalex.org/W2963985459,"The apparent unpredictability of epileptic seizures has a major impact in the quality of life of people with pharmacologically resistant seizures. Here, we present initial results and a proof-of-concept of how focal seizures can be predicted early in advance based on intracortical signals recorded from small neocortical patches away from identified seizure onset areas. We show that machine learning algorithms can discriminate between interictal and preictal periods based on multiunit activity (i.e. thresholded action potential counts) and multi-frequency band local field potentials recorded via 4 X 4 mm2 microelectrode arrays. Microelectrode arrays were implanted in 5 patients undergoing neuromonitoring for resective surgery. Post-implant analysis revealed arrays were outside the seizure onset areas. Preictal periods were defined as the 1-hour period leading to a seizure. A 5-minute gap between the preictal period and the putative seizure onset was enforced to account for potential errors in the determination of actual seizure onset times. We used extreme gradient boosting and long short-term memory networks for prediction. Prediction accuracy based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves reached 90% for at least one feature type in each patient. Importantly, successful prediction could be achieved based exclusively on multiunit activity. This result indicates that preictal activity in the recorded neocortical patches involved not only subthreshold postsynaptic potentials, perhaps driven by the distal seizure onset areas, but also neuronal spiking in distal recurrent neocortical networks. Beyond the commonly identified seizure onset areas, our findings point to the engagement of large-scale neuronal networks in the neural dynamics building up toward a seizure. Our initial results obtained on currently available human intracortical microelectrode array recordings warrant new studies on larger datasets, and open new perspectives for seizure prediction and control by emphasizing the contribution of multiscale neural signals in large-scale neuronal networks."

https://openalex.org/W2962833790,"Adjunctive use of antibiotics in periodontal treatment have limitations and disadvantages including bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potential new agents that can combat bacterial infection. In this study, antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of conventional antibiotics minocycline (MH), doxycycline (DOX), and antimicrobial peptides LL-37, LL-31, Lactoferrin chimera (LFchimera) and Innate Defense Regulator Peptide 1018 (IDR-1018) against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 were determined using colony culturing assay. Subsequently, in vitro activity of the most effective drug and peptide combination was evaluated by checkerboard technique. Impact of the drug and peptide co-administration on biofilm at different stages, i.e., during adhesion and 1-day old biofilm was compared to each of the agents used alone. Results revealed that the killing effects of all AMPs range from 13-100%. In contrast, MH and DOX at 1 and 5 μM showed no killing activity and instead stimulated growth of bacteria. DOX has better killing activity than MH. LFchimera displayed the strongest killing amongst the peptides. Checkerboard technique revealed that combining DOX and LFchimera yielded synergism. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further showed that the combination of DOX and LFchimera caused significant reduction of bacterial adhesion and reduction of biomass, average biofilm thickness and substratum biofilm coverage of 1-day old biofilm compared to DOX and LFchimera alone. In conclusion, LFchimera alone and in combination with DOX exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-biofilm property against A. actinomycetemcomitans. The findings suggest that LFchimera should be considered for development as a new potential therapeutic agent that may be used as an adjunctive treatment for periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2963000529,"Background In 2016 the first African emergency care clinical practice guideline (CPG) was developed for national uptake in the prehospital sector in South Africa, with implementation starting in 2018. Comprehensive uptake of CPGs post development is not a given, as this requires effective and efficient dissemination and implementation strategies that take into account the perceptions, barriers and facilitators of the local end-users. This study aimed to identify prehospital end-users’ perceptions of the emergency care guidelines, including barriers and facilitators for national decision makers, to strengthen CPG uptake in South Africa. Methods Our study employed a descriptive qualitative research design, including nine focus groups with 56 operational emergency care providers across four major provinces in South Africa. Data was analysed using thematic analysis in ATLAS.ti. Ethics approval was provided by Stellenbosch University. Results Themes related to provider perceptions, expectations and guideline uptake emerging from the data was unofficial and unclear communication, broadening versus limiting guideline expectations, conflicted personal reactions and spreading the word. Challenges to dissemination and implementation included poor communication, changes to scope of practice, and limited capacity to upskill existing providers. Facilitators included using technology for end-user documents, local champions to support change, establishing online and modular training, and implementation by independent decision makers. Conclusion This study provides an overview of the perceptions of operational emergency care providers and how their experiences of hearing about and engaging with the guidelines, in their industry, can contribute to the dissemination, implementation and uptake of emergency care guidelines. In order to disseminate and implement an emergency care CPG, decision makers must take into account the perceptions, barriers, and facilitators of local end-users."

However, when exosomes are developed for therapeutic applications, a method to enhance their delivery is important. This study aimed to evaluate wheather calcium chloride (CaCl2) or other chloride compounds could enhance exosome delivery to various cells without causing toxicity. Exosomes were purified from human serum by using the ExoQuick exosome precipitation kit. Isolated exosomes were mixed with CaCl2 at concentrations ranging from 100 μM to 1 mM, and then washed using Amicon filter for treating the cells. The delivery efficiency of exosomes and the viability of the cells [HEK 293 (human kidney cells) and H9C2 (rat cardiomyocytes)] were evaluated. Cellular uptake of exosomes was observed using a confocal microscope based on PKH26 labeling of exosomes. CaCl2 increased the delivery of exosomes in a dose- and treatment time-dependent manner. In HEK 293 cells, a CaCl2 concentration of 400 μM and exposure time of 12 h increased the delivery of exosomes by >20 times compared with controls. In H9C2 cells, a CaCl2 concentration of 400 μM and exposure time of >24 h increased the delivery of exosomes by >400 times compared with controls. The viability of both cell lines was maintained up to a CaCl2 concentration of 1 mM. However, cobalt chloride, cupric chloride, and magnesium chloride did not change the delivery of exosomes in both cell lines. These results suggest that the use of CaCl2 treatment might be a useful method for enhancing the delivery of exosomes."

The current lack of a definitive diagnostic laboratory test to rule out this infection necessitates designing more specific diagnostic methods. Fatty acid and retinol-binding protein (FAR) plays a crucial role in the development and reproduction of nematodes. We generated a recombinant form of this protein and determined its applicability for immunodiagnosis of S. stercoralis. The L3 form of S. stercoralis was harvested and used for RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. The coding sequence of S. stercoralis FAR (SsFAR) was cloned into pET28a(+) vector, expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified. ELISA and immunoblotting were employed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of rSsFAR using a set of defined sera. In addition, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of SsFAR with different FAR sequences from other nematodes. The cloned SsFAR had an open reading frame of 447 bp encoding 147 amino acids, with a deduced molecular mass of 19 kD. The SsFAR amino acid sequence was 93% identical to FAR of S. ratti. For differential immunodiagnosis of strongyloidiasis, rSsFAR exhibited 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. However, cross-reactivity with FAR proteins of other parasites, namely Toxocara canis and Echinococcus granulosus, was noted. Our results provide a novel approach for immunodiagnosis of S. stercoralis infections using rSsFAR with reliable sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2962767715,"Ancestral state reconstruction models use genetic data to characterize a group of organisms' common ancestor. These models have been applied to salmonellosis outbreaks to estimate the number of transmissions between different animal species that share similar geographical locations, with animal host as the state. However, as far as we are aware, no studies have validated these models for outbreak analysis. In this study, salmonellosis outbreaks were simulated using a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, and the host population and transmission parameters of these simulated outbreaks were estimated using Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction models (discrete trait analysis (DTA) and structured coalescent (SC)). These models were unable to accurately estimate the number of transmissions between the host populations or the amount of time spent in each host population. The DTA model was inaccurate because it assumed the number of isolates sampled from each host population was proportional to the number of individuals infected within each host population. The SC model was inaccurate possibly because it assumed that each host population's effective population size was constant over the course of the simulated outbreaks. This study highlights the need for phylodynamic models that can take into consideration factors that influence the characteristics and behavior of outbreaks, e.g. changing effective population sizes, variation in infectious periods, intra-population transmissions, and disproportionate sampling of infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2962813349,"Cryopreservation is the most common method for long-term cell storage. Successful cryopreservation of cells depends on optimal freezing conditions, freezer storage and a proper thawing technique to minimize the cellular damage that can occur during the cryopreservation process. These factors are especially critical for sensitive stem cells with a consequential and significant impact on viability and functionality. Until now, slow-freezing has been the routine method of cryopreservation but, more recently rapid-cooling techniques have also been proposed. In this study, an ultra-rapid cooling technique [1] was performed for the first time on human mesenchymal stem cells and the effectiveness evaluated in comparison with the conventional slow-freezing procedure. A thin nylon-membrane carrier was used combined with different cryoprotective agents: dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol and/or trehalose. Various aspects of the low cryoprotective doses and the ultra-rapid cooling procedure of the human mesenchymal stem cells were examined including: the physical properties of the nylon-support, cells encumbrance, viability, proliferation and differentiation. The expression of cell surface markers and apoptosis were also investigated. The study used an ultra-rapid cooling/warming method and showed an overall cell integrity preservation (83–99%), with no significant differences between dimethyl sulfoxide or ethylene glycol treatment (83–87%) and a substantial cell viability of 68% and 51%, respectively. We confirmed a discrepancy also observed by other authors in cell viability and integrity, which implies that caution is necessary when assessing and reporting cell viability data."

An in-vitro study using bovine hepatocytes incubated for 7 days with phosphate (Pi) concentrations of 0.9, 1.8 or 2.7 mmol/L, and an in-vivo study feeding late pregnant dairy cows diets with either adequate (0.28% and 0.44% in DM ante-partum and post-partum respectively) or low P content (0.15% and 0.20% in DM ante-partum and post-partum respectively) from 4 weeks before to 4 weeks after calving were conducted to explore effects of P deprivation on liver function. In vitro the relative abundance of mRNA of key enzymes of the carbohydrate metabolism in incubated hepatocytes and liver metabolites in culture medium were determined. In vivo health and productivity of experimental cows on low and adequate dietary P supply were monitored, and liver tissue and blood samples were obtained repeatedly. Liver tissue was assayed for its triacylglycerol-, mineral and water content as well as for the relative abundance of mRNA of enzymes of the carbohydrate-, fat- and protein metabolism. Reduced Pi-availability was not associated with altered enzyme transcription rates or metabolic activity in-vitro. The most prominent clinical finding associated with P deprivation in-vivo was feed intake depression developing after the first week of lactation. Accordingly cows on low P diets had lower milk yield and showed more pronounced increases in liver triacylglycerol after calving. Although the liver P content decreased in P deficient cows, neither negative effects on enzyme transcription rates nor on blood parameters indicative of impaired liver metabolic activity or liver injury were identified. These results indicate the P deprivation only indirectly affects the liver through exacerbation of the negative energy balance occurring as P deficient cows become anorectic."
https://openalex.org/W2963444002,"Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) is a component of apoptosome, which regulates caspase-9 activity. In addition to apoptosis, Apaf-1 plays critical roles in the intra-S-phase checkpoint; therefore, impaired expression of Apaf-1 has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-resistant malignant melanoma and nuclear translocation of Apaf-1 has represented a favorable prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In contrast, increased levels of Apaf-1 protein are observed in the brain in Huntington’s disease. The regulation of Apaf-1 protein is not yet fully understood. In this study, we show that etoposide triggers the interaction of Apaf-1 with Cullin-4B, resulting in enhanced Apaf-1 ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated Apaf-1, which was degraded in healthy cells, binds p62 and forms aggregates in the cytosol. This complex of ubiquitinated Apaf-1 and p62 induces caspase-9 activation following MG132 treatment of HEK293T cells that stably express bcl-xl. These results show that ubiquitinated Apaf-1 may activate caspase-9 under conditions of proteasome impairment."

Mechanisms were annotated using Gene Ontology, and gene network/population-specific expression levels correlated with rupture state. We then used computational drug repurposing to identify plausible drug candidates for the prevention of aneurysm rupture.Network analysis of bulk tissue identified multiple immune mechanisms to be associated with aneurysm rupture. Targeting these processes with computational drug repurposing revealed multiple candidates for preventing rupture including Btk inhibitors and modulators of hypoxia inducible factor. In the macrophage-specific analysis, we identify rupture-associated mechanisms MHCII antigen processing, cholesterol efflux, and keratan sulfate catabolism. These processes map well onto several of highly ranked drug candidates, providing further validation.Our results are the first to demonstrate population-specific expression levels and intracranial aneurysm rupture, and propose novel drug candidates based on network-based transcriptomics."
https://openalex.org/W2964150132,"The present study recorded the population of the goby fish (Perciformes: Gobiidae), Eutaeniichthys cf. gilli Jordan & Snyder, 1901, from the tunnel burrowed by the mud shrimp Austinogebia edulis Ngo-Ho and Chan, 1992 in a mudflat in Shengang and Wangong of Changhua County, western Taiwan. This finding is not only a new record of the genus in Taiwan, it is also the first record of this species in a mudflat near an industrial park. In total, 56 individuals of E. cf. gilli were collected from June 2016 to September 2018. Morphological traits of males and females were measured. The resin casting method trapped bodies of E. cf. gilli that were present in the tunnel burrow and proved that the fish inhabits burrows of the mud shrimp A. edulis. In addition, a species of snapping shrimp was also found in the same tunnel. Symbiotic interaction may occur between E. cf. gilli, A. eduli and the snapping shrimp. The China Coastal Current (CCC) runs along the coastlines of Japan, Korea, China, and reaches western Taiwan during the northeast monsoon period. The CCC, therefore, might play an important role in the biogeographic distribution of E. cf. gilli in the western Pacific Ocean. Since E. cf. gilli is listed in the Red List as an endangered species of Japan for many years, Taiwan waters may provide a refuge for this fish species warranting a broader investigation. Since Taiwan is some distance away from the previously recorded locations in Japan, Korea, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohai Sea, a phylogenic analysis is warranted for population and species differentiation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2964327745,"Longitudinal studies of bone adaptation in mice using in vivo micro-computed tomography (μCT) have been commonly used for pre-clinical evaluation of physical and pharmacological interventions. The main advantage of this approach is to use each mouse as its own control, reducing considerably the sample size required by statistical power analysis. To date, multi-scale estimation of bone adaptations become essential since the bone activity that takes place at different scales may be associated with different bone mechanisms. Measures of bone adaptations at different time scales have been attempted in a previous study. This paper extends quantification of bone activity at different spatial scales with a proposition of a novel framework. The method involves applying level-set method (LSM) to track the geometric changes from the longitudinal in vivo μCT scans of mice tibia. Bone low- and high-spatial frequency patterns are then estimated using multi-resolution analysis. The accuracy of the framework is quantified by applying it to two times separated scanned images with synthetically manipulated global and/or local activity. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) was approximately 1.5 voxels or 0.7 voxels for the global low-spatial frequency or local high-spatial frequency changes, respectively. The framework is further applied to the study of bone changes in longitudinal datasets of wild-type mice tibiae over time and space. The results demonstrate the ability for the spatio-temporal quantification and visualisation of bone activity at different spatial scales in longitudinal studies thus providing further insight into bone adaptation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2962720828,"Bat wings are characterized by high endurance, and these mammals have developed a number of adaptations that protect them from falling into obstacles and potential injuries. However, in bat populations, there are individuals with visible fresh or healed injuries to the flight-enabling body parts. The aim of this research was to determine the differences in the occurrence of wing membrane damages among species of bats that differ in ecology and behavior. The study was conducted in southern and western Poland in the years 2000-2016 and included 3,525 individuals of six species: lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolopus hipposideros, Daubenton's bat Myotis daubentonii, Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri, greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis, western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus, and brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus. In all, 2.9% of the bats studied showed damage to the flight-enabling body parts. Natterer's bat was the species with the highest number of injured individuals (21.74%). The lowest number of injured individuals (0.3%) was found in the brown long-eared bat. The most frequently observed type of damage was loss of an edge of the wing membrane (29.3%). The bat species studied differed significantly in the occurrence and location of flight enabling body parts damages. Certain behavioral and ecological factors like foraging mode, foraging habitats and habitat types of bat species determine the number of wing and tail membrane damages."
https://openalex.org/W2963538149,"Transformation in chromatin organization is one of the most universal markers of carcinogenesis. Microscale chromatin alterations have been a staple of histopathological diagnosis of neoplasia, and nanoscale alterations have emerged as a promising marker for cancer prognostication and the detection of predysplastic changes. While numerous methods have been developed to detect these alterations, most methods for sample preparation remain largely validated via conventional microscopy and have not been examined with nanoscale sensitive imaging techniques. For these nanoscale sensitive techniques to become standard of care screening tools, new histological protocols must be developed that preserve nanoscale information. Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy has recently emerged as a novel imaging technique sensitive to length scales ranging between 20 and 200 nanometers. As a label-free, high-throughput, and non-invasive imaging technique, PWS microscopy is an ideal tool to quantify structural information during sample preparation. Therefore, in this work we applied PWS microscopy to systematically evaluate the effects of cytological preparation on the nanoscales changes of chromatin using two live cell models: a drug-based model of Hela cells differentially treated with daunorubicin and a cell line comparison model of two cells lines with inherently distinct chromatin organizations. Notably, we show that existing cytological preparation can be modified in order to maintain clinically relevant nanoscopic differences, paving the way for the emerging field of nanopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2963897003,"The outcomes of bargaining over losses, the subject of this paper, have rarely been studied. But experimental studies of related situations, such as those involving bankruptcies or bequests in which the sum of the legal claims that can be made against a bank or firm or estate are greater than their values, have produced strong support for the proportionality principle. To test whether this principle would find support in other situations involving losses we designed an experimental game in which four players start out with differing initial endowments of real money. They are then informed that a certain amount of this resource has to be given back to the experimenter. How should the loss be shared among the agents? This game was run at different locations and under different treatments over a period of almost three years. We found that the proportionality principle was rarely proposed and even less frequently accepted as a solution to this problem. One of the main reasons for this result was that the two players with the smallest endowments opposed most of the proposals which asked them to contribute at least some positive amount of their own initial resource."
https://openalex.org/W2964121478,"We examined the effect of increased anterior subject positioning toward the dynamometer's footplate during maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs) on the joint moment, rotation and rate of torque development (RTD). Fourteen subjects, with their hip flexed (110°) and knee fully extended (180°), underwent ramp maximal and rapid voluntary isometric plantar flexion contractions at 4 different positions (0, 3, 6 and 8 cm; randomized). At position ""0 cm"", the foot was in full contact with the footplate; at the additional positions, the chair was moved forward. Body kinematics (VICON) and kinetics (HUMAC Norm, PEDAR) were captured synchronously during MVCs and RTDs. The results showed that the maximal exerted joint moment was significantly (p<0.01) increased by >32% from the 0-cm to 8-cm position (126 and 172 Nm, respectively); however, at the ""6 cm"" and ""8 cm"" positions, no significant difference was found. The joint rotation was significantly (p<0.01) reduced by >50% (from 15.5 to 7.1°; 0-8 cm). The maxRTD was only significantly higher at ""6 cm"" compared with the ""0 cm"" position. The time to reach maxRTD showed shorter tendencies for the ""8 cm"" position than for all other positions. The results indicate an underestimation of the plantar flexor maximal force potential with the current measuring technique. This could be critical in pre-post study designs where a 2-cm alteration in the chair position can induce an error of ~9% in the joint moment. The joint rotation could be reduced but not completely eliminated. For position standardization purposes, a pressure >220 kPa under the subject's foot is needed to achieve the maximal joint moment. We discussed the possible origins (fascicle length, neural drive) of the increased joint moment."
https://openalex.org/W2962898910,"Thy28, also known as ThyN1, is a highly conserved nuclear protein. We previously showed that in a chicken mature B cell line, Thy28 binds to the promoter of the gene encoding Pax5, a transcription factor essential for B cell development, and positively regulates its expression. Here, we generated a Thy28-deficient mouse line to analyze its potential role in B cell development in mice. Thy28-deficient mice showed normal development of B cells, and the expression of Pax5 was comparable between wild-type and Thy28-deficient primary B cells. Thus, species-specific mechanisms regulate Pax5 expression and B cell development."
