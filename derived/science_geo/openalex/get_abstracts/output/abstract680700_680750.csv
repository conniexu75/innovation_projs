https://openalex.org/W3198514921,"Replacing or editing disease-causing mutations holds great promise for treating many human diseases. Yet, delivering therapeutic genetic modifiers to specific cells in vivo has been challenging, particularly in large, anatomically distributed tissues such as skeletal muscle. Here, we establish an in vivo strategy to evolve and stringently select capsid variants of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that enable potent delivery to desired tissues. Using this method, we identify a class of RGD motif-containing capsids that transduces muscle with superior efficiency and selectivity after intravenous injection in mice and non-human primates. We demonstrate substantially enhanced potency and therapeutic efficacy of these engineered vectors compared to naturally occurring AAV capsids in two mouse models of genetic muscle disease. The top capsid variants from our selection approach show conserved potency for delivery across a variety of inbred mouse strains, and in cynomolgus macaques and human primary myotubes, with transduction dependent on target cell expressed integrin heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W3196494203,"Neurons require mechanisms to maintain ATP homeostasis in axons, which are highly vulnerable to bioenergetic failure. Here, we elucidate a transcellular signaling mechanism by which oligodendrocytes support axonal energy metabolism via transcellular delivery of NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2. SIRT2 is undetectable in neurons but enriched in oligodendrocytes and released within exosomes. By deleting sirt2, knocking down SIRT2, or blocking exosome release, we demonstrate that transcellular delivery of SIRT2 is critical for axonal energy enhancement. Mass spectrometry and acetylation analyses indicate that neurons treated with oligodendrocyte-conditioned media from WT, but not sirt2-knockout, mice exhibit strong deacetylation of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocases 1 and 2 (ANT1/2). In vivo delivery of SIRT2-filled exosomes into myelinated axons rescues mitochondrial integrity in sirt2-knockout mouse spinal cords. Thus, our study reveals an oligodendrocyte-to-axon delivery of SIRT2, which enhances ATP production by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins, providing a target for boosting axonal bioenergetic metabolism in neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3199937649,"An inhibitory extracellular milieu and neuron-intrinsic processes prevent axons from regenerating in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Here we show how the two aspects are interwoven. Genetic loss-of-function experiments determine that the small GTPase RhoA relays extracellular inhibitory signals to the cytoskeleton by adapting mechanisms set in place during neuronal polarization. In response to extracellular inhibitors, neuronal RhoA restricts axon regeneration by activating myosin II to compact actin and, thereby, restrain microtubule protrusion. However, astrocytic RhoA restricts injury-induced astrogliosis through myosin II independent of microtubules by activating Yes-activated protein (YAP) signaling. Cell-type-specific deletion in spinal-cord-injured mice shows that neuronal RhoA activation prevents axon regeneration, whereas astrocytic RhoA is beneficial for regenerating axons. These data demonstrate how extracellular inhibitors regulate axon regeneration, shed light on the capacity of reactive astrocytes to be growth inhibitory after CNS injury, and reveal cell-specific RhoA targeting as a promising therapeutic avenue."
https://openalex.org/W3186343296,"The emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States (U.S.) went largely undetected due to inadequate testing. New Orleans experienced one of the earliest and fastest accelerating outbreaks, coinciding with Mardi Gras. To gain insight into the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and how large-scale events accelerate transmission, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Louisiana. We show that SARS-CoV-2 in Louisiana had limited diversity compared to other U.S. states and that one introduction of SARS-CoV-2 led to almost all of the early transmission in Louisiana. By analyzing mobility and genomic data, we show that SARS-CoV-2 was already present in New Orleans before Mardi Gras, and the festival dramatically accelerated transmission. Our study provides an understanding of how superspreading during large-scale events played a key role during the early outbreak in the U.S. and can greatly accelerate epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W3168399599,"Background Australia has maintained low rates of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) infection, due to geographic location and strict public health restrictions. However, the financial and social impacts of these restrictions can negatively affect parents’ and children’s mental health. In an existing cohort of mothers recruited for their experience of adversity, this study examined: 1) families’ experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health restrictions in terms of clinical exposure, financial hardship family stress, and family resilience (termed ‘COVID-19 impacts’); and 2) associations between COVID-19 impacts and maternal and child mental health. Methods Participants were mothers recruited during pregnancy (2013–14) across two Australian states (Victoria and Tasmania) for the ‘right@home’ trial. A COVID-19 survey was conducted from May-December 2020, when children were 5.9–7.2 years old. Mothers reported COVID-19 impacts, their own mental health (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales short-form) and their child’s mental health (CoRonavIruS Health and Impact Survey subscale). Associations between COVID-19 impacts and mental health were examined using regression models controlling for pre-COVID-19 characteristics. Results 319/406 (79%) mothers completed the COVID-19 survey. Only one reported having had COVID-19. Rates of self-quarantine (20%), job or income loss (27%) and family stress (e.g., difficulty managing children’s at-home learning (40%)) were high. Many mothers also reported family resilience (e.g., family found good ways of coping (49%)). COVID-19 impacts associated with poorer mental health (standardised coefficients) included self-quarantine (mother: β = 0.46, child: β = 0.46), financial hardship (mother: β = 0.27, child: β = 0.37) and family stress (mother: β = 0.49, child: β = 0.74). Family resilience was associated with better mental health (mother: β = -0.40, child: β = -0.46). Conclusions The financial and social impacts of Australia’s public health restrictions have substantially affected families experiencing adversity, and their mental health. These impacts are likely to exacerbate inequities arising from adversity. To recover from COVID-19, policy investment should include income support and universal access to family health services."
https://openalex.org/W3196520476,"Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can exhibit cell-type and cancer-type specific expression profiles, making them highly attractive as therapeutic targets. Pan-cancer RNA sequencing data revealed broad expression of the SAMMSON lncRNA in uveal melanoma (UM), the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Currently, there are no effective treatments for UM patients with metastatic disease, resulting in a median survival time of 6–12 months. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of SAMMSON inhibition in UM. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated SAMMSON inhibition impaired the growth and viability of a genetically diverse panel of uveal melanoma cell lines. These effects were accompanied by an induction of apoptosis and were recapitulated in two uveal melanoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models through subcutaneous ASO delivery. SAMMSON pulldown revealed several candidate interaction partners, including various proteins involved in mitochondrial translation. Consequently, inhibition of SAMMSON impaired global, mitochondrial and cytosolic protein translation levels and mitochondrial function in uveal melanoma cells. The present study demonstrates that SAMMSON expression is essential for uveal melanoma cell survival. ASO-mediated silencing of SAMMSON may provide an effective treatment strategy to treat primary and metastatic uveal melanoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W3198410291,"Cocaine addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by maladaptation in the brain mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine system. Although changes in the properties of D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) and connected striatal circuits following cocaine treatment are known, the contributions of altered D2-receptor (D2R) function in mediating the rewarding properties of cocaine remain unclear. Here, we describe how a 7-day exposure to cocaine alters dopamine signaling by selectively reducing the sensitivity, but not the expression, of nucleus accumbens D2-MSN D2Rs via an alteration in the relative expression and coupling of G protein subunits. This cocaine-induced reduction of D2R sensitivity facilitated the development of the rewarding effects of cocaine as blocking the reduction in G protein expression was sufficient to prevent cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations. These findings identify an initial maladaptive change in sensitivity by which mesolimbic dopamine signals are encoded by D2Rs following cocaine exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3200783478,"MAP4K4 is a Ste20 member and reported to play important roles in various pathologies, including in cancer. However, the mechanism by which MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer is not fully understood. It is suggested that MAP4K4 might function as a cancer promoter via specific downstream target(s) in an organ-specific manner. Here we identified MLK3 as a direct downstream target of MAP4K4. The MAP4K4 and MLK3 associates with each other, and MAP4K4 phosphorylates MLK3 on Thr738 and increases MLK3 kinase activity and downstream signaling. The phosphorylation of MLK3 by MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Moreover, MAP4K4 is overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors and directly correlates with the disease progression. The MAP4K4-specific pharmacological inhibitor, GNE-495, impedes pancreatic cancer cell growth, migration, induces cell death, and arrests cell cycle progression. Additionally, the GNE-495 reduced the tumor burden and extended survival of the KPC mice with pancreatic cancer. The MAP4K4 inhibitor also reduced MAP4K4 protein expression, tumor stroma, and induced cell death in murine pancreatic tumors. These findings collectively suggest that MLK3 phosphorylation by MAP4K4 promotes pancreatic cancer, and therefore therapies targeting MAP4K4 might alleviate the pancreatic cancer tumor burden in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3197537712,"MYCN drives aggressive behavior and refractoriness to chemotherapy, in several tumors. Since MYCN inactivation in clinical settings is not achievable, alternative vulnerabilities of MYCN-driven tumors need to be explored to identify more effective and less toxic therapies. We previously demonstrated that PARP inhibitors enhance MYCN-induced replication stress and promote mitotic catastrophe, counteracted by CHK1. Here, we showed that PARP and CHK1 inhibitors synergized to induce death in neuroblastoma cells and in primary cultures of SHH-dependent medulloblastoma, their combination being more effective in MYCN amplified and MYCN overexpressing cells compared to MYCN non-amplified cells. Although the MYCN amplified IMR-32 cell line carrying the p.Val2716Ala ATM mutation showed the highest sensitivity to the drug combination, this was not related to ATM status, as indicated by CRISPR/Cas9-based correction of the mutation. Suboptimal doses of the CHK1 inhibitor MK-8776 plus the PARP inhibitor olaparib led to a MYCN-dependent accumulation of DNA damage and cell death in vitro and significantly reduced the growth of four in vivo models of MYCN-driven tumors, without major toxicities. Our data highlight the combination of PARP and CHK1 inhibitors as a new potential chemo-free strategy to treat MYCN-driven tumors, which might be promptly translated into clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3201503580,"To assess the role of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in time coding, we recorded neuronal activity in rats tasked with comparing the durations of two sequential vibrations. Bayesian decoding of population activity revealed a representation of the unfolding of the trial across time. However, further analyses demonstrated a distinction between the encoding of trial time and perceived time. First, DLS did not show a privileged representation of the stimulus durations compared with other time spans. Second, higher intensity vibrations were perceived as longer; however, time decoded from DLS was unaffected by vibration intensity. Third, DLS did not encode stimulus duration differently on correct versus incorrect trials. Finally, in rats trained to compare the intensities of two sequential vibrations, stimulus duration was encoded even though it was a perceptually irrelevant feature. These findings lead us to posit that temporal information is inherent to DLS activity irrespective of the rat's ongoing percept."
https://openalex.org/W3198186923,"Molecular motors such as kinesin and myosin often work in groups to generate the directed movements and forces critical for many biological processes. Although much is known about how individual motors generate force and movement, surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the macroscopic mechanics generated by multiple motors. For example, the observation that a saturating number, N, of myosin heads move an actin filament at a rate that is influenced by actin-myosin attachment and detachment kinetics is accounted for neither experimentally nor theoretically. To better understand the emergent mechanics of actin-myosin mechanochemistry, we use an in vitro motility assay to measure and correlate the N-dependence of actin sliding velocities, actin-activated ATPase activity, force generation against a mechanical load, and the calcium sensitivity of thin filament velocities. Our results show that both velocity and ATPase activity are strain dependent and that velocity becomes maximized with the saturation of myosin-binding sites on actin at a value that is 40% dependent on attachment kinetics and 60% dependent on detachment kinetics. These results support a chemical thermodynamic model for ensemble motor mechanochemistry and imply molecularly explicit mechanisms within this framework, challenging the assumption of independent force generation."
https://openalex.org/W3200558159,"Background Prenatal care providers will play an important role in the acceptance of SARS-Cov-2 vaccination for pregnant women. Objective To determine the perceptions of French prenatal care providers: midwives, general practitioners (GPs) and obstetricians and gynaecologists (Ob-Gyn) regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy. Study design An anonymous online survey was sent to members of French professional societies representing prenatal practitioners. The participants were asked to answer questions on their characteristics and give their opinions of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for themselves and women who are pregnant or willing to become pregnant. Results Access to the survey was opened from January 11th, 2021, to March 1st, 2021. A total of 1,416 responses were collected from 749 Ob-Gyn, 598 midwives and 69 GPs. Most respondents (86.7% overall, 90.4% for Ob-GYN, 81.1% for GPs and 80.1% for midwives) agreed to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 would be offered to pregnant women by 49.4% 95%CI [48.1–50.8] of the participants. Midwives were less likely to recommend vaccination than GP and Ob-Gyn (37.5%, 50.7% and 58.8%, respectively). The multinomial logistic regression revealed that being an obstetrician, working in a group, usually offering a flu vaccine and wanting to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were positively associated with considering pregnant women for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Conclusion Most French prenatal healthcare providers are favourable towards vaccinating pregnant women, but a large minority express reservation. More evidence on safety and involvement by professional organisations will be important to encourage the access of pregnant women to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3198540846,"The hepatic carbohydrate-recognizing asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR1) mediates the endocytosis/lysosomal degradation of desialylated glycoproteins following binding to terminal galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine. Human heterozygote carriers of ASGR1 deletions exhibit ∼34% lower risk of coronary artery disease and ∼10% to 14% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol. Since the proprotein convertase PCSK9 is a major degrader of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), we investigated the degradation and functionality of LDLR and/or PCSK9 by endogenous/overexpressed ASGR1 using Western blot and immunofluorescence in HepG2-naïve and HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells. ASGR1, like PCSK9, targets LDLR, and both independently interact with/enhance the degradation of the receptor. This lack of cooperativity between PCSK9 and ASGR1 was confirmed in livers of wildtype (WT) and Pcsk9-/- mice. ASGR1 knockdown in HepG2-naïve cells significantly increased total (∼1.2-fold) and cell-surface (∼4-fold) LDLR protein. In HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells, ASGR1 silencing led to ∼2-fold higher levels of LDLR protein and DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate)-LDL uptake associated with ∼9-fold increased cell-surface LDLR. Overexpression of WT-ASGR1/2 primarily reduced levels of immature non-O-glycosylated LDLR (∼110 kDa), whereas the triple Ala-mutant of Gln240/Trp244/Glu253 (characterized by loss of carbohydrate binding) reduced expression of the mature form of LDLR (∼150 kDa), suggesting that ASGR1 binds the LDLR in both a sugar-dependent and -independent fashion. The protease furin cleaves ASGR1 at the RKMK103↓ motif into a secreted form, likely resulting in a loss of function on LDLR. Altogether, we demonstrate that LDLR is the first example of a liver-receptor ligand of ASGR1. We conclude that silencing of ASGR1 and PCSK9 may lead to higher LDL uptake by hepatocytes, thereby providing a novel approach to further reduce LDL cholesterol levels."
https://openalex.org/W3201322266,"Rationale and objectives This study aimed to compare the volume computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE), with the China and updated 2017 American College of Radiology (ACR) diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) in chest CT examinations of adults based on the water-equivalent diameter (Dw). Materials and methods All chest CT examinations conducted without contrast administration from January 2020 to July 2020 were retrospectively included in this study. The Dw and SSDE of all examinations were calculated automatically by “teamplay”. The CTDIvol and DLP were displayed on the DICOM-structured dose report in the console based on a 32cm phantom.The differences in patient CTDIvol, DLP, and SSDE values between groups were examined by the one-way ANOVA. The differences in patient CTDIvol, DLP, and SSDE values between the updated 2017 ACR and the China DRLs were examined with one sample t-tests. Results In total 14666 chest examinations were conducted in our study. Patients were divided into four groups based on Dw:270 (1.84%) in 15–20 cm group, 10287 (70.14%) in the 21–25 cm group, 4097 (27.94%) in the 26–30 cm group, and 12 (0.08%) patients had sizes larger than 30 cm. CTDIvol, DLP, and SSDE increased as a function of Dw ( p &lt;0.05). CTDIvol was smaller than SSDE among groups ( p &lt;0.05). The mean CTDIvol and DLP values were lower than the 25 th , 50 th , and 75 th percentile of the China DRLs (p &lt;0.05). The CTDIvol, DLP, and SSDE were lower than the 50 th and 75 th percentiles of the updated 2017 ACR DRLs (p &lt;0.05) among groups. Conclusions SSDE takes into account the influence of the scanning parameters, patient size, and X-ray attenuation on the radiation dose, which can give a more realistic estimate of radiation exposure dose for patients undergoing CT examinations. Establishing hospital’s own DRL according to CTDIvol and SSDE is very important even though the radiation dose is lower than the national DRLs."
https://openalex.org/W3201607478,"How do people balance concerns for general health and economic outcomes during a pandemic? And, how does the communication of this trade-off affect individual preferences? We address these questions using a field experiment involving around 2000 students enrolled in a large university in Italy. We design four treatments where the trade-off is communicated using different combinations of a positive framing that focuses on protective strategies and a negative framing which refers to potential costs. We find that positive framing on the health side induces students to give greater relevance to the health dimension. The effect is sizeable and highly effective among many different audiences, especially females. Importantly, this triggers a higher level of intention to adhere to social distancing and precautionary behaviors. Moreover, irrespective of the framing, we find a large heterogeneity in students’ preferences over the trade-off. Economics students and students who have directly experienced the economic impact of the pandemic are found to give greater value to economic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3196731139,"Introduction Misconception related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have been spread out broadly and the the World Health Organization declared these as a major challenge to fight against the pandemic. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related misconception among rural people in Bangladesh and associated socio-demographic and media related factors. Methods Multistage sampling method was used to collect data (n = 210) from three unions of Satkhira District, Bangladesh. The dependent variable was the presence of COVID-19 related misconception (Yes, No) which was generated based on respondents’ responses to a set of six questions on various types of misconception. Exposure variables were respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, mass media and social media exposure. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristics of the respondents. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 misconception. Results More than half of the study respondents had one or more COVID-19 related misconception. Over 50% of the total respondents considered this disease as a punishment from God. Besides, many of the respondents reported that they do not think the virus causing COVID-19 is dangerous (59%) and it is a disease (19%). Around 7% reported they believe the virus is the part of a virus war (7.2%). The bivariate analysis found the presence of socio-demographic factors of the respondents, as well as the factors related to social and mass media, were significantly associated with the COVID-19’s misconception. However, once all factors considered together in the multivariate model, misconception were found to be lower among secondary (AOR, 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13–0.84) and tertiary (AOR, 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09–0.92) educated respondents compared to the respondents with primary education. Conclusion This study obtained a very higher percentage of misconception about the COVID-19 among the respondents of Satkhira district in Bangladesh. This could be a potential challenge to fight against this pandemic which is now ongoing. Prioritizing mass and social media to disseminate evidence-based information as well as educate people about this disease are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3197135142,"Very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein. Beyond the function of the full-length VLDLR in lipid transport, the soluble ectodomain of VLDLR (sVLDLR) confers anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic roles in ocular tissues through inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling. However, it remains unknown how sVLDLR is shed into the extracellular space. In this study, we present the first evidence that a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is responsible for sVLDLR shedding in human retinal pigment epithelium cells using pharmacological and genetic approaches. Among selected proteinase inhibitors, an ADAM17 inhibitor demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect on sVLDLR shedding. siRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of ADAM17 diminished, whereas plasmid-mediated overexpression of ADAM17 promoted sVLDLR shedding. The amount of shed sVLDLR correlated with an inhibitory effect on the Wnt signaling pathway. Consistent with these in vitro findings, intravitreal injection of an ADAM17 inhibitor reduced sVLDLR levels in the extracellular matrix in the mouse retina. In addition, our results demonstrated that ADAM17 cleaved VLDLR only in cells coexpressing these proteins, suggesting that shedding occurs in a cis manner. Moreover, our study demonstrated that aberrant activation of Wnt signaling was associated with decreased sVLDLR levels, along with downregulation of ADAM17 in ocular tissues of an age-related macular degeneration model. Taken together, our observations reveal the mechanism underlying VLDLR cleavage and identify a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of disorders associated with dysregulation of Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3197792922,"We previously reported that dietary amino acid restriction induces the accumulation of triglycerides (TAG) in the liver of growing rats. However, differences in TAG accumulation in individual cell types or other tissues were not examined. In this study, we show that TAG also accumulates in the muscle and adipose tissues of rats fed a low amino acid (low-AA) diet. In addition, dietary lysine restriction (low-Lys) induces lipid accumulation in muscle and adipose tissues. In adjusting the nitrogen content to that of the control diet, we found that glutamic acid supplementation to the low-AA diet blocked lipid accumulation, but supplementation with the low-Lys diet did not, suggesting that a shortage of nitrogen caused lipids to accumulate in the skeletal muscle in the rats fed a low-AA diet. Serum amino acid measurement revealed that, in rats fed a low-Lys diet, serum lysine levels were decreased, while serum threonine levels were significantly increased compared with the control rats. When the threonine content was restricted in the low-Lys diet, TAG accumulation induced by the low-Lys diet was completely abolished in skeletal muscle. Moreover, in L6 myotubes cultured in medium containing high threonine and low lysine, fatty acid uptake was enhanced compared with that in cells cultured in control medium. These findings suggest that the increased serum threonine in rats fed a low-Lys diet resulted in lipid incorporation into skeletal muscle, leading to the formation of fatty muscle tissue. Collectively, we propose conceptual hypothesis that ""amino-acid signal"" based on lysine and threonine regulates lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3198830621,"Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) plays a vital role in regulating thiol metabolism and preserving oxygen homeostasis in humans by oxidizing the sulfur of cysteamine and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins to their corresponding sulfinic acids using O2 as a cosubstrate. However, as the only thiol dioxygenase that processes both small-molecule and protein substrates, how ADO handles diverse substrates of disparate sizes to achieve various reactions is not understood. The knowledge gap is mainly due to the three-dimensional structure not being solved, as ADO cannot be directly compared with other known thiol dioxygenases. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of human ADO at a resolution of 1.78 Å with a nickel-bound metal center. Crystallization was achieved through both metal substitution and C18S/C239S double mutations. The metal center resides in a tunnel close to an entry site flanked by loops. While ADO appears to use extensive flexibility to handle substrates of different sizes, it also employs proline and proline pairs to maintain the core protein structure and to retain the residues critical for catalysis in place. This feature distinguishes ADO from thiol dioxygenases that only oxidize small-molecule substrates, possibly explaining its divergent substrate specificity. Our findings also elucidate the structural basis for ADO functioning as an oxygen sensor by modifying N-degron substrates to transduce responses to hypoxia. Thus, this work fills a gap in structure-function relationships of the thiol dioxygenase family and provides a platform for further mechanistic investigation and therapeutic intervention targeting impaired oxygen sensing."
https://openalex.org/W3199883352,"Objective This study investigates the associations between maternal health and health-related behaviours (nutrition, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking) both during pregnancy and up to 15 months from childbirth and children’s health outcomes during infancy and adolescence (general health, presence of a chronic illness, and physical health outcome index). Methods This study used Wave 1 (2004) and Wave 7 (2016) data from the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Children (LSAC). We measured mothers’ general health, presence of a medical condition during pregnancy and mental health during pregnancy or in the year after childbirth. We subsequently measured the children’s general health, presence of a medical condition, and physical health outcome index at ages 0–1 (infancy) and 12–13 (adolescence). Binary logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to examine the association between the mothers’ health-related variables and their children’s health. Results Our results showed that poor general health of the mother in the year after childbirth was associated with higher odds of poor health in infants and adolescents in all three dimensions: poor general health (OR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.16–4.52 for infants; OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.95–2.04 for adolescents), presence of a chronic condition (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.19–1.81 for adolescents) and lower physical health score (b = −0.94, p-value &lt;0.05 for adolescents). Our study also revealed that the presence of a chronic condition in mothers during pregnancy significantly increased the likelihood of the presence of a chronic condition in their offspring during infancy (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12–1.54) and during adolescence (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20–1.75). The study found that stressful life events faced by mothers increase the odds of poor general health or any chronic illness during adolescence, while stress, anxiety or depression during pregnancy and psychological distress in the year after childbirth increase the odds of any chronic illness during infancy. Conclusions The present study found evidence that poor maternal physical and mental health during pregnancy or up to 15 months from childbirth has adverse health consequences for their offspring as measured by general health, presence of chronic health conditions, and physical health index scores. This suggests that initiatives to improve maternal physical and mental health would not only improve child health but would also reduce the national health burden."
https://openalex.org/W3197532372,"Background The dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) is only recommended for individuals with prior dengue infection (PDI). This study aimed to perform a serosurvey to inform decision-making for vaccine introduction and identify appropriate target populations. We also evaluated the performance of the serological tests using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) as a reference test in identifying PDI to determine suitability for pre-vaccination screening. Methods We enrolled 115 healthy individuals between 10 and 22 years of age living in the Ratchaburi province of Thailand. The serum samples were tested by PRNT to measure the prevalence and concentration of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. The performance of the IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT, SD Bioline, Korea) and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, EUROIMMUN, Germany) in identifying PDI were evaluated by using PRNT as a reference method. Results Ninety-four (81.7%) individuals neutralized one or more dengue serotypes at a titer threshold greater than or equal to 10. Multitypic profiles were observed in 70.4% of the samples which increased to 91.9% in subjects aged 19–22. Among monotypic samples, the highest proportion was reactive against DENV-1 followed by DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. The highest anti-dengue antibody titers were recorded against DENV-1 and increased with age to a geometric mean NT50 titer (GMT) of 188.6 in the 19–22 age group. While both RDT and ELISA exhibited 100% specificity, RDT demonstrated low sensitivity (35%) with ELISA displaying much greater sensitivity (87%). Conclusions Almost 80% of adolescents and youth in Ratchaburi province had already been exposed to one or more of the dengue virus serotypes. The dengue IgG RDT displayed low sensitivity and is likely not be suitable for dengue pre-vaccination screening. These results support the use of IgG ELISA test for dengue vaccination in endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W3198924522,"Zika virus (ZKV) infection in a pregnant woman, especially during the first trimester, often results in congenital anomalies. However, the pathogenic mechanism is unknown and one-third of ZKV infected pregnancies are asymptomatic. Neutralizing antibodies against ZKV has been reported in 70% of Thai adults, but the prevalence among pregnant women is unknown. Currently, vaccines and specific treatments for ZKV are under development. A better understanding of the immune status of pregnant women will increase the success of effective prevention guidelines. The prevalence of ZKV infection in pregnant women in antenatal care clinics was investigated during the rainy season from May to October 2019 at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. We recruited 650 pregnant women (39.42% first, 52.26% second and 7.36% third trimester) and found that 30.77% had ZKV-specific IgG, and 39.81% had neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against ZKV (titer ≥10). Specific and neutralizing antibody levels varied by maternal age, trimester, and month. We further characterized the cross-reaction between ZKV and the four Dengue virus (DENV) serotypes by focused reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and found that cross-reactions were common. In conclusion, about 60% of pregnant women who living in central Thailand may be at risk of ZKV infection due to the absence of neutralizing antibodies against ZKV. The functions of cross-reactive antibodies between related viral genotypes require further study.

Radio-resistance and cancer stem cell properties can cause therapeutic resistance, cancer heterogeneity, and poor prognoses in association with GBM. Furthermore, the GBM subtype transition from proneural to the most malignant mesenchymal subtype after radiation therapy also accounts for high resistance to conventional treatments. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) by 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP), a dual inhibitor targeting MIF and DDT, downregulates stemness phenotype, intracellular signaling cascades, mesenchymal trans-differentiation, and induces apoptosis in proneural glioma stem cells (GSCs). In an analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas, high MIF and DDT expression were associated with poor prognosis. GSC growth was effectively inhibited by 4-IPP in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and 4-IPP combined with radiation therapy led to significantly reduced proliferation compared with radiation therapy alone. The expression of stemness factors, such as Olig2 and SOX2, and the expression of pAKT, indicating PI3K signaling pathway activation, were decreased in association with both 4-IPP monotherapy and combination treatment. The expression of mesenchymal markers, TGM2 and NF-κB, and expression of pERK (indicating MAPK signaling pathway activation) increased in association with radiation therapy alone but not with 4-IPP monotherapy and combination therapy. In addition, the combination of 4-IPP and radiation therapy significantly induced apoptosis compared to the monotherapy of 4-IPP or radiation. In vivo results demonstrated a significant tumor-suppressing effect of 4-IPP when combined with radiation therapy. Collectively, our results showed that the targeted inhibition of MIF and DDT has the potential to strengthen current clinical strategies by enhancing the anticancer effects of radiation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3199985847,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 ( IDH1/2 ) mutations and their key effector 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) have been reported to promote oncogenesis in various human cancers. To elucidate molecular mechanism(s) associated with IDH1/2 mutations, we established mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells and human colorectal cancer cells stably expressing cancer-associated IDH1 R132C or IDH2 R172S , and analyzed the change in metabolic characteristics of the these cells. We found that IDH1/2 mutants induced intracellular 2-HG accumulation and inhibited cell proliferation. Expression profile analysis by RNA-seq unveiled that glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) was induced by the IDH1/2 mutants or treatment with 2-HG in the MEF cells. Consistently, glucose uptake and lactate production were increased by the mutants, suggesting the deregulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and Hif1α expression were involved in the up-regulation of Glut1. Together, these results suggest that Glut1 is a potential target regulated by cancer-associated IDH1/2 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3197514870,"During vascular interventions, oxidized low-density lipoprotein and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) accumulate at the site of arterial injury, inhibiting endothelial cell (EC) migration and arterial healing. LysoPC activates canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels, leading to a prolonged increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration that inhibits EC migration. However, an initial increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration is required to activate TRPC6, and this mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that lysoPC activates the lipid-cleaving enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which releases arachidonic acid (AA) from the cellular membrane to open arachidonate-regulated calcium channels, allowing calcium influx that promotes externalization and activation of TRPC6 channels. The focus of this study was to identify the roles of calcium-dependent and/or calcium-independent PLA2 in lysoPC-induced TRPC6 externalization. We show that lysoPC induced PLA2 enzymatic activity and caused AA release in bovine aortic ECs. To identify the specific subgroup and the isoform(s) of PLA2 involved in lysoPC-induced TRPC6 activation, transient knockdown studies were performed in the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 using siRNA to inhibit the expression of genes encoding cPLA2α, cPLA2γ, iPLA2β, or iPLA2γ. Downregulation of the β isoform of iPLA2 blocked lysoPC-induced release of AA from EC membranes and TRPC6 externalization, as well as preserved EC migration in the presence of lysoPC. We propose that blocking TRPC6 activation and promoting endothelial healing could improve the outcomes for patients undergoing cardiovascular interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3197886185,"We learn and remember multiple new experiences throughout the day. The neural principles enabling continuous rapid learning and formation of distinct representations of numerous sequential experiences without major interference are not understood. To understand this process, here we interrogated ensembles of hippocampal place cells as rats explored 15 novel linear environments interleaved with sleep sessions over continuous 16 h periods. Remarkably, we found that a population of place cells were selective to environment orientation and topology. This orientation selectivity property biased the network-level discrimination and re/mapping between multiple environments. Novel environmental representations emerged rapidly as more generic, but repeated experience within the environments subsequently enhanced their discriminability. Generalization of prior experience with different environments consequently improved network predictability of future novel environmental representations via strengthened generative predictive codes. These coding schemes reveal a high-capacity, high-efficiency neuronal framework for rapid representation of numerous sequential experiences with optimal discrimination-generalization balance and reduced interference."
https://openalex.org/W3199090138,"Seabirds play a vital role in marine ecosystems and the long-term study of their responses to environmental variations can be used to monitor the effects of climate change on marine fauna. However, slight differences in similar seabird species result in a range of responses which complicates our understanding of the effects of environmental changes to marine ecosystems. The present study investigated inter-annual differences in the breeding biology (breeding phenology, chick growth rates and breeding success) and environmental conditions (seasonal sea surface temperatures) of important foraging areas in two sympatric small Procellariiform species, the fairy prion ( Pachyptila turtur ) and the common diving petrel ( Pelecanoides urinatrix ), over four reproductive seasons (2017–2020) in Bass Strait, south-eastern Australia. Marine heatwaves occurred during the years of 2018/19 and 2019/20 and coincided with years of delayed laying dates, slower chick growth and reduced breeding success, in both species. While fairy prions maintained a relatively high breeding success and broadly constant breeding phenology, common diving petrels delayed the start of the breeding season by up to 50 days and experienced dramatic collapses in breeding success in years of high marine heat wave occurrence. The difference in foraging ecology and physiological capacity (largely in the production of stomach oils and fasting abilities of adults and chicks) between both species are likely to influence the variability and phenology in the observed breeding seasons."
https://openalex.org/W3199340483,"Purpose Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease related mortality, and only 10% of the infected individuals develop active disease. The likelihood of progression of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to active TB disease is high in HIV infected individuals. Identification of HIV+ individuals at risk would allow treating targeted population, facilitating completion of therapy for LTBI and prevention of TB development. NK cells have an important role in T cell independent immunity against TB, but the exact role of NK cell subsets in LTBI and HIV is not well characterized. Methods In this study, we compared the expansion and function of memory like NK cells from HIV-LTBI+ individuals and treatment naïve HIV+LTBI+ patients in response to Mtb antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Results In freshly isolated PBMCs, percentages of CD3 - CD56 + NK cells were similar in HIV+LTBI+ patients and healthy HIV-LTBI+ individuals. However, percentages of CD3 - CD56 + CD16 + NK cells were higher in healthy HIV-LTBI+ individuals compared to HIV+LTBI+ patients. HIV infection also inhibited the expansion of memory like NK cells, production of IL-32α, IL-15 and IFN-γ in response to Mtb antigens in LTBI+ individuals. Conclusion We studied phenotypic, functional subsets and activation of memory like-NK cells during HIV infection and LTBI. We observed that HIV+LTBI+ patients demonstrated suboptimal NK cell and monocyte interactions in response to Mtb, leading to reduced IL-15, IFN-γ and granzyme B and increased CCL5 production. Our study highlights the effect of HIV and LTBI on modulation of NK cell activity to understand their role in development of interventions to prevent progression to TB in high risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3199423054,"Cardiac dysrhythmias (CD) affect millions of Americans in the United States (US), and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. New strategies to combat this growing problem are urgently needed.Predicting CD using electronic health record (EHR) data would allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment of the condition, thus improving overall cardiovascular outcomes. The Guideline Advantage (TGA) is an American Heart Association ambulatory quality clinical data registry of EHR data representing 70 clinics distributed throughout the US, and has been used to monitor outpatient prevention and disease management outcome measures across populations and for longitudinal research on the impact of preventative care.For this study, we represented all time-series cardiovascular health (CVH) measures and the corresponding data collection time points for each patient by numerical embedding vectors. We then employed a deep learning technique-long-short term memory (LSTM) model-to predict CD from the vector of time-series CVH measures by 5-fold cross validation and compared the performance of this model to the results of deep neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, and Naïve Bayes models.We demonstrated that the LSTM model outperformed other traditional machine learning models and achieved the best prediction performance as measured by the average area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC): 0.76 for LSTM, 0.71 for deep neural networks, 0.66 for logistic regression, 0.67 for random forest, and 0.59 for Naïve Bayes. The most influential feature from the LSTM model were blood pressure.These findings may be used to prevent CD in the outpatient setting by encouraging appropriate surveillance and management of CVH."
https://openalex.org/W3200100599,"Background Previous studies showed the possible association between obesity, dietary pattern, and depressive symptoms. Due to the lack of enough data to confirm the association of obesity and depression in the Middle East, here, we aimed to explore the possible mediatory role of adipokines Galectin-3, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) in the association between low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and depressive symptoms. Methods A total of 256 women aged 17–56 years old were grouped based on their LCD score. Depression anxiety stress scales-21 (DASS-21) self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the three negative emotional states of stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. Body composition and dietary intake were assessed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the serum levels of Galectin-3, TGF-β, and PAI-1. Results No significant difference was observed regarding Galectin-3, TGF-β, and PAI-1 levels between the groups with dissimilar adherence to LCD or the groups with different levels of depressive symptoms (P&gt;0.05). However, there was a negative association between LCD score as a covariant and depressive symptoms as an independent variable (P = 0.02) and remarkably, a regression model linear analysis using Galectin-3, TGF-β, and PAI-1 as confounding variables indicated the mediatory role of these adipokines in this association (P&gt;0.05). In other words, adipokines eliminated the significance of the relationship between adherence to LCD and depressive symptoms. Conclusion It seems that higher adherence to LCD is probably associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in obese adults through the mediatory role of adipokines."
https://openalex.org/W3198021163,"The deubiquitinating enzyme USP37 is known to contribute to timely onset of S phase and progression of mitosis. However, it is not clear if USP37 is required beyond S-phase entry despite expression and activity of USP37 peaking within S phase. We have utilized flow cytometry and microscopy to analyze populations of replicating cells labeled with thymidine analogs and monitored mitotic entry in synchronized cells to determine that USP37-depleted cells exhibited altered S-phase kinetics. Further analysis revealed that cells depleted of USP37 harbored increased levels of the replication stress and DNA damage markers γH2AX and 53BP1 in response to perturbed replication. Depletion of USP37 also reduced cellular proliferation and led to increased sensitivity to agents that induce replication stress. Underlying the increased sensitivity, we found that the checkpoint kinase 1 is destabilized in the absence of USP37, attenuating its function. We further demonstrated that USP37 deubiquitinates checkpoint kinase 1, promoting its stability. Together, our results establish that USP37 is required beyond S-phase entry to promote the efficiency and fidelity of replication. These data further define the role of USP37 in the regulation of cell proliferation and contribute to an evolving understanding of USP37 as a multifaceted regulator of genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W3198193602,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of oscillating crude protein (CP) concentration diet on the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of calves and determine its mechanism. Twelve Holstein calves were assigned randomly into static protein diet (SP, 149 g/kg CP) and oscillating protein diet (OP, 125 and 173 g/kg CP diets oscillated at 2-d intervals) groups. After 60 days of feeding, the weights of total stomach, rumen and omasum tended to increase in calves fed OP. The apparent crude fat digestibility, NUE and energy metabolism also increased. In terms of urea-N kinetics evaluated by urea-15N15N isotope labeling method, the urea-N production and that entry to gastrointestinal tended to increase, and urea-N reused for anabolism increased significantly in calves fed OP during the low protein phase. These data indicate that urea-N recycling contributed to improving NUE when dietary protein concentration was low. In addition, the differentially expressed genes in rumen epithelium and the rumen bacteria involved in protein and energy metabolism promoted the utilization of dietary protein in calves fed OP."
https://openalex.org/W3199732518,"Timely care is essential to increase breast cancer survival. However, patients in Ethiopia still face multilevel barriers on their pathway to timely treatment initiation. This cross-sectional study at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital Oncology Unit in Addis Ababa assessed systemic treatment initiation intervals of breast cancer patients and quantified the impact of socio-demographic and clinical factors, perceived barriers, and the patients´ perceived social support status on timely systemic treatment initiation (chemotherapy or hormonal therapy). A structured questionnaire was designed based on Pechansky´s “Concept of Access”. Applying simple and multivariate logistic regression we analysed the influence of patients´ characteristics as well as their perceived barriers on timely treatment initiation. We measured social support with the Multidimensional Score of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to assess its relationship with timely treatment initiation. Of 196 patients included into the study, 53% received systemic treatment within 90 days of their pathological diagnosis–the median treatment initiation interval was 85 days (IQR 123.5). Older women and patients diagnosed at late stages had higher odds of timely treatment initiation. Not being able to pay for services and lack of transport were most often perceived as barriers towards timely care. However, none of the perceived barriers showed a substantial influence on timely treatment initiation in the multivariate regression model. The patients´ perceived social support was found to be high, with an average MSPSS score of 73 out of 84 (SD 13,63). No impact of the perceived social support status on timely treatment initiation was found. The percentage of breast cancer patients waiting longer than 90 days from pathological diagnosis to systemic treatment initiation in Ethiopia remains unacceptably high. While women generally feel well supported by their social environment, costs and accessibility of treatment are perceived to be major barriers towards timely treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3201236203,"Backgrounds We demonstrated that coronary adventitial inflammation plays important roles in the pathogenesis of drug-eluting stent (DES)-induced coronary hyperconstricting responses in pigs in vivo. However, no therapy is yet available to treat coronary adventitial inflammation. We thus developed the low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy that ameliorates myocardial ischemia by enhancing angiogenesis. Aims We aimed to examine whether our LIPUS therapy suppresses DES-induced coronary hyperconstricting responses in pigs in vivo, and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Methods Sixteen normal male pigs were randomly assigned to the LIPUS or the sham therapy groups after DES implantation into the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. In the LIPUS group, LIPUS (32 cycles, 193 mW/cm 2 ) was applied to the heart at 3 different levels (segments proximal and distal to the stent edges and middle of the stent) for 20 min at each level for every other day for 2 weeks. The sham therapy group was treated in the same manner but without LIPUS. At 4 weeks after stent implantation, we performed coronary angiography, followed by immunohistological analysis. Results Coronary vasoconstricting responses to serotonin in LAD at DES edges were significantly suppressed in the LIPUS group compared with the sham group. Furthermore, lymph transport speed in vivo was significantly faster in the LIPUS group than in the sham group. Histological analysis at DES edges showed that inflammatory changes and Rho-kinase activity were significantly suppressed in the LIPUS group, associated with eNOS up-regulation and enhanced lymph-angiogenesis. Conclusions These results suggest that our non-invasive LIPUS therapy is useful to treat coronary functional abnormalities caused by coronary adventitial inflammation, indicating its potential for the novel and safe therapeutic approach of coronary artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W3197102426,"Meiosis is a complex process involving the expression and interaction of numerous genes in a series of highly orchestrated molecular events. Fam9b localized in Xp22.3 has been found to be expressed in testes. However, FAM9B expression, localization, and its role in meiosis have not been previously reported. In this study, FAM9B expression was evaluated in the human testes and ovaries by RT-PCR, qPCR, and western blotting. FAM9B was found in the nuclei of primary spermatocytes in testes and specifically localized in the synaptonemal complex (SC) region of spermatocytes. FAM9B was also evident in the follicle cell nuclei and diffusely dispersed in the granular cell cytoplasm. FAM9B was partly co-localized with SYCP3, which is essential for both formation and maintenance of lateral SC elements. In addition, FAM9B had a similar distribution pattern and co-localization as γH2AX, which is a novel biomarker for DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis. All results indicate that FAM9B is a novel meiosis-associated protein that is co-localized with SYCP3 and γH2AX and may play an important role in SC formation and DNA recombination during meiosis. These findings offer a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in meiosis of human gametogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3197444462,"Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2)-deficient mice develop spontaneous seizures in early life because of a marked reduction in M currents, which regulate neuronal membrane excitability. We have previously shown that hyper-SUMOylation of the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels is critically involved in the regulation of the M currents conducted by these potassium voltage-gated channels. Here, we show that hyper-SUMOylation of the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 proteins reduced binding to the lipid secondary messenger PIP2. CaM1 has been shown to be tethered to the Kv7 subunits via hydrophobic motifs in its C termini and implicated in the channel assembly. Mutation of the SUMOylation sites on Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 specifically resulted in decreased binding to CaM1 and enhanced CaM1-mediated assembly of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, whereas hyper-SUMOylation of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 inhibited channel assembly. SENP2-deficient mice exhibited increased acetylcholine levels in the brain and the heart tissue because of increases in the vagal tone induced by recurrent seizures. The SENP2-deficient mice develop seizures followed by a period of sinus pauses or atrioventricular conduction blocks. Chronic administration of the parasympathetic blocker atropine or unilateral vagotomy significantly prolonged the life of the SENP2-deficient mice. Furthermore, we showed that retigabine, an M-current opener, reduced the transcription of SUMO-activating enzyme SAE1 and inhibited SUMOylation of the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels, and also prolonged the life of SENP2-deficient mice. Taken together, the previously demonstrated roles of PIP2, CaM1, and retigabine on the regulation of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channel function can be explained by their roles in regulating SUMOylation of this critical potassium channel."
https://openalex.org/W3199928509,"Various definitions of fitness are essentially based on the number of descendants of an allele or a phenotype after a sufficiently long time. However, these different definitions do not explicate the continuous evolution of life histories. Herein, we focus on the eigenfunction of an age-structured population model as fitness. The function generates an equation, called the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, that achieves adaptive control of life history in terms of both the presence and absence of the density effect. Further, we introduce a perturbation method that applies the solution of this equation to the long-term logarithmic growth rate of a stochastic structured population model. We adopt this method to realize the adaptive control of heterogeneity for an optimal foraging problem in a variable environment as the analyzable example. The result indicates that the eigenfunction is involved in adaptive strategies under all the environments listed herein. Thus, we aim to systematize adaptive life histories in the presence of density effects and variable environments using the proposed objective function as a universal fitness candidate."

The following outcomes were evaluated: changes in the entropy value per unit area (pixel2) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on the B-scan image; changes in the entropy value in each stratified layer (retina, RPE, choroid) based on the ETDRS grid circle overlaid with en face entropy mapping, not only the whole ETDRS grid area but also a sector irradiated by the SMPL; and the relationship between edema reduction and entropy changes.A total of 11 eyes of 11 consecutive DME patients were enrolled. No visible signs of SMPL treatment were detected on PS-OCT images. The entropy value per unit area (pixel2) in the RPE tended to decrease at 3 and 6 months from baseline (35.8 ± 17.0 vs 26.1 ± 9.8, P = 0.14; vs 28.2 ± 18.3, P = 0.14). Based on the en face entropy mapping, the overall entropy value did not change in each layer in the whole ETDRS grid; however, decrease of entropy in the RPE was observed at 2, 3, and 6 months post-treatment within the SMPL-irradiated sectors (P < 0.01, each). There was a positive correlation between the change rate of retinal thickness and that of entropy in the RPE within the SMPL-irradiated sector at 6 months (r2 = 0.19, P = 0.039).Entropy measured using PS-OCT may be a new parameter that facilitates objective monitoring of SMPL-induced functional changes in the RPE that could not previously be assessed directly. This may contribute to a more promising therapeutic evaluation of DME.This clinical study was registered in UMIN-CTR (ID: UMIN000042420)."

https://openalex.org/W3200764754,"Patent valuation is required to revitalize patent transactions, but calculating a reasonable value that consumers and suppliers could satisfy is difficult. When machine learning is used, a quantitative evaluation based on a large volume of data is possible, and evaluation can be conducted quickly and inexpensively, contributing to the activation of patent transactions. However, due to patent characteristics, securing the necessary training data is challenging because most patents are traded privately to prevent technical information leaks. In this study, the derived marketable value of a patent through event study is used for patent value evaluation, matching it with the semantic information from the patent calculated using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based topic modeling. In addition, an ensemble learning methodology that combines the predicted values of multiple predictive models was used to determine the prediction stability. Base learners with high predictive power for each fold were different, but the ensemble model that was trained on the base learners’ predicted values exceeded the predictive power of the individual models. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that the superiority of the accuracy of the ensemble model was statistically significant at the 95% significance level."
https://openalex.org/W3201203070,"Specific changes identified in the otolith macrostructure of Northeast Arctic cod as “spawning zones” are presumed to represent spawning events, but recent experimental studies have challenged this relationship. Because these zones are not routinely recorded outside of Norway, otoliths from multiple Atlantic cod populations with different life history and environmental traits were first examined to see if spawning zones could be identified as a general characteristic of cod. Then, a large archival collection of cod otoliths was used to investigate temporal changes in the occurrence of spawning zones and test for correlations between maturity at age derived from otolith spawning zones and gonad maturity stages. This study shows that spawning zones likely are a universal trait of Atlantic cod and not limited to certain environments or migratory behaviors as previously proposed. Maturity at age derived from spawning zone data showed trends consistent with those from gonad examinations. However, spawning zones appear to form with a one- or two-year lag with sexual maturity, which is suspected to reflect a stabilizing of energy partitioning after the first spawning events. Our results illustrate the potential for use of spawning zones, for example in species or populations with limited available maturity data, and highlights the need for addressing the physiological processes behind their formation."

https://openalex.org/W3197491720,"Wheat is a major staple food and has been extensively grown around the globe. Sessile nature of plants has exposed them to a lot of biotic and abiotic stresses including fungal pathogen attack. Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici causes stem rust in the wheat crop and leads to 70% decrease in its production. Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins provide plants with defense against different fungal pathogens as these proteins have antifungal activities. This study was designed to screen Pakistani wheat varieties for PR2 and PR3 proteins and their in silico characterization. PR2 and PR3 genes were screened and isolated by PCR amplification from wheat variety Chenab-70 and Frontana, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of PR2 and PR3 genes were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MT303867 and MZ766118, respectively. Physicochemical properties, secondary and tertiary structure predictions, and molecular docking of protein sequences of PR2 and PR3 were performed using different bioinformatics tools and software. PR2 and PR3 genes were identified to encode β–1,3–glucanase and chitinase proteins, respectively. Molecular docking of both PR2 and PR3 proteins with beta-glucan and chitin (i.e. their respective ligands) showed crucial amino acid residues involved in molecular interactions. Conclusively, molecular docking analysis of β–1,3–glucanase and chitinase proteins revealed crucial amino acid residues which are involved in ligand binding and important interactions which might have important role in plant defense against fungal pathogens. Moreover, the active residues in the active sties of these proteins can be identified through mutational studies and resulting information might help understanding how these proteins are involved in plant defense mechanisms."

A previous pilot study of a social network-based 'microclinic' intervention, including group health education and facilitated HIV status disclosure, reduced disengagement from HIV care. We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial to evaluate microclinic effectiveness.In nine rural health facilities in western Kenya, we randomized HIV-positive adults with a recent missed clinic visit to either participation in a microclinic or usual care (NCT02474992). We collected visit data at all clinics where participants accessed care and evaluated intervention effect on disengagement from care (≥90-day absence from care after a missed visit) and the proportion of time patients were adherent to clinic visits ('time-in-care'). We also evaluated changes in social support, HIV status disclosure, and HIV-associated stigma.Of 350 eligible patients, 304 (87%) enrolled, with 154 randomized to intervention and 150 to control. Over one year of follow-up, disengagement from care was similar in intervention and control (18% vs 17%, hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.61-1.75), as was time-in-care (risk difference -2.8%, 95% CI -10.0% to +4.5%). The intervention improved social support for attending clinic appointments (+0.4 units on 5-point scale, 95% CI 0.08-0.63), HIV status disclosure to close social supports (+0.3 persons, 95% CI 0.2-0.5), and reduced stigma (-0.3 units on 5-point scale, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.17).The data from our pragmatic randomized trial in rural western Kenya are compatible with the null hypothesis of no difference in HIV care engagement between those who participated in a microclinic intervention and those who did not, despite improvements in proposed intervention mechanisms of action. However, some benefit or harm cannot be ruled out because the confidence intervals were wide. Results differ from a prior quasi-experimental pilot study, highlighting important implementation considerations when evaluating complex social interventions for HIV care.Clinical trial number: NCT02474992."
https://openalex.org/W3200348841,"Clostridioides difficile infection is the most common cause of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. C. difficile treatment is increasingly likely to fail, and the recurrence rate is high. Antimicrobial peptides are considered an alternative treatment for many infectious diseases, including those caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. In the present study, we identified a CM peptide, a hybrid of cecropin A and melittin, and its derivative which possesses potent antimicrobial activity against C. difficile strain 630. CM peptide exhibited antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration of 3.906 μg/ml (2.21 μM). A modified derivative of CM, CM-A, exhibited even greater activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.953 μg/ml (1.06 μM) and a minimum bactericidal concentration of 7.8125 μg/ml (4.24 μM), which indicates that CM-A peptide is more efficient than its parent peptide. A fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the membrane of C. difficile 630 could be an important target for CM-A. This peptide induced high levels of cell depolarization and cell permeability on C. difficile cell membrane. Moreover, electron microscopy imaging showed that CM-A interferes with the C. difficile cell membrane. Hence, the antimicrobial peptide CM-A may represent a promising novel approach for the treatment of C. difficile infections."
https://openalex.org/W3200388103,"Objectives A novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan protocol is presented on the basis of ultra-short time to echo (UTE). By this MRI cephalometric projections (MCPs) can be acquired without the need of post processing in one shot. Different technical parameterizations of the protocol are performed. Their impact on the performance of MCPs is evaluated in comparison to the gold standard–the lateral cephalometric radiography (LCR) for cephalometric analysis (CA) in orthodontics. Methods Seven MCPs with various scan parameters influencing the scan duration and one LCR are used from one subject. 40 expert assessors performed CA for 14 predefined cephalometric landmarks. Relative metric distances and absolute angular measurements were calculated. Statistical analysis is presented and the deviations are highlighted to demonstrate the potential of the method for further analysis. Results The MCPs are acquired in 5–154 seconds, depending on resolution and contrast. Mean relative distances were 2.4–2.7 mm in MCPs and 1.6 mm in LCR, which demonstrate the accuracy and level of agreement of the expert assessors in identifying anatomical landmarks. In comparison to other studies, the presented MCP performed similar in angular analysis and demonstrated on average deviation of 1.2° ±1.1° in comparison to LCR. Despite the point articulare (Ar) and the related gonial angle the calculate distances and angles show outcomes in the range of ±2°/2mm. Conclusions MCPs can be acquired much faster in comparison to other techniques known from literature for CA. This study demonstrated the potential of the new method and showed first feasible results. Further research is needed to analyze the performance on a broad range of patients."

Despite the high incidence of abortion around the globe, the synthesis of known economic outcomes of abortion care and policies is lacking. Using data from a systematic scoping review, we synthesized the literature on the economics of abortion at the microeconomic, mesoeconomic, and mesoeconomic levels and presented the results in a collection of studies. This article describes the history and scientific background for collection, presents the scoping review framework, and discusses the value of this knowledge base.We conducted a scoping review using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies reporting on qualitative and/or quantitative data from any world region were considered. For inclusion, studies must have examined one of the following outcomes: costs, impacts, benefits, and/or value of abortion-related care or policies. Our searches yielded 19,653 unique items, of which 365 items were included in our final inventory. Studies most often reported costs (n = 262), followed by impacts (n = 140), benefits (n = 58), and values (n = 40). Approximately one quarter (89/365) of studies contained information on the secondary outcome on stigma. Economic factors can lead to a delay in abortion care-seeking and can restrict health systems from adequately meeting the demand for abortion services. Provision of post-abortion care (PAC) services requires more resources then safe abortion services. Lack of insurance or public funding for abortion services can increase the cost of services and the overall economic impact on individuals both seeking and providing care.Consistent economic themes emerge from research on abortion, though evidence gaps remain that need to be addressed through more standardized methods and consideration to framing of abortion issues in economics terms. Given the highly charged political nature of abortion around the world, it is imperative that researchers continue to build the evidence base on economic outcomes of abortion services and regulations."
