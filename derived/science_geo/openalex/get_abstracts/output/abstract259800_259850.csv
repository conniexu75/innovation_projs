https://openalex.org/W2002962459,"We have developed a nanowire nanogenerator that is driven by an ultrasonic wave to produce continuous direct-current output. The nanogenerator was fabricated with vertically aligned zinc oxide nanowire arrays that were placed beneath a zigzag metal electrode with a small gap. The wave drives the electrode up and down to bend and/or vibrate the nanowires. A piezoelectric-semiconducting coupling process converts mechanical energy into electricity. The zigzag electrode acts as an array of parallel integrated metal tips that simultaneously and continuously create, collect, and output electricity from all of the nanowires. The approach presents an adaptable, mobile, and cost-effective technology for harvesting energy from the environment, and it offers a potential solution for powering nanodevices and nanosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2083070320,"How anthropogenic climate change will affect hydroclimate in the arid regions of southwestern North America has implications for the allocation of water resources and the course of regional development. Here we show that there is a broad consensus among climate models that this region will dry in the 21st century and that the transition to a more arid climate should already be under way. If these models are correct, the levels of aridity of the recent multiyear drought or the Dust Bowl and the 1950s droughts will become the new climatology of the American Southwest within a time frame of years to decades."

https://openalex.org/W2092124750,"The rich set of interactions between individuals in society results in complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends, families or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and self-optimization of society as a whole. We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency-the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions."

https://openalex.org/W2067765425,"Memory encoding occurs rapidly, but the consolidation of memory in the neocortex has long been held to be a more gradual process. We now report, however, that systems consolidation can occur extremely quickly if an associative “schema” into which new information is incorporated has previously been created. In experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative neocortical schema gradually developed. New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning. The concept of neocortical schemas may unite psychological accounts of knowledge structures with neurobiological theories of systems memory consolidation."

https://openalex.org/W1983899252,"Although many enzymes can promote chemical reactions by tuning substrate properties purely through the electrostatic environment of a docking cavity, this strategy has proven challenging to mimic in synthetic host-guest systems. Here, we report a highly charged, water-soluble, metal-ligand assembly with a hydrophobic interior cavity that thermodynamically stabilizes protonated substrates and consequently catalyzes the normally acidic hydrolysis of orthoformates in basic solution, with rate accelerations of up to 890-fold. The catalysis reaction obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and exhibits competitive inhibition, and the substrate scope displays size selectivity, consistent with the constrained binding environment of the molecular host."
https://openalex.org/W2114907977,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a developmental and cancer-predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in genes controlling DNA interstrand crosslink repair. Several FA proteins form a ubiquitin ligase that controls monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein in an ATR-dependent manner. Here we describe the FA protein FANCI, identified as an ATM/ATR kinase substrate required for resistance to mitomycin C. FANCI shares sequence similarity with FANCD2, likely evolving from a common ancestral gene. The FANCI protein associates with FANCD2 and, together, as the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID) complex, localize to chromatin in response to DNA damage. Like FANCD2, FANCI is monoubiquitinated and unexpectedly, ubiquitination of each protein is important for the maintenance of ubiquitin on the other, indicating the existence of a dual ubiquitin-locking mechanism required for ID complex function. Mutation in FANCI is responsible for loss of a functional FA pathway in a patient with Fanconi anemia complementation group I."
https://openalex.org/W2017219759,"The domestic dog exhibits greater diversity in body size than any other terrestrial vertebrate. We used a strategy that exploits the breed structure of dogs to investigate the genetic basis of size. First, through a genome-wide scan, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 15 influencing size variation within a single breed. Second, we examined genetic variation in the 15-megabase interval surrounding the QTL in small and giant breeds and found marked evidence for a selective sweep spanning a single gene ( IGF1 ), encoding insulin-like growth factor 1. A single IGF1 single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype is common to all small breeds and nearly absent from giant breeds, suggesting that the same causal sequence variant is a major contributor to body size in all small dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2033797646,"The formation of a metaphase spindle, a bipolar microtubule array with centrally aligned chromosomes, is a prerequisite for the faithful segregation of a cell's genetic material. Using a full-genome RNA interference screen of Drosophila S2 cells, we identified about 200 genes that contribute to spindle assembly, more than half of which were unexpected. The screen, in combination with a variety of secondary assays, led to new insights into how spindle microtubules are generated; how centrosomes are positioned; and how centrioles, centrosomes, and kinetochores are assembled."

https://openalex.org/W2028443916,"The circulation of the deep Atlantic Ocean during the height of the last ice age appears to have been quite different from today. We review observations implying that Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the Last Glacial Maximum was neither extremely sluggish nor an enhanced version of present-day circulation. The distribution of the decay products of uranium in sediments is consistent with a residence time for deep waters in the Atlantic only slightly greater than today. However, evidence from multiple water-mass tracers supports a different distribution of deep-water properties, including density, which is dynamically linked to circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2035924763,"We demonstrate entanglement distribution between two remote quantum nodes located 3 meters apart. This distribution involves the asynchronous preparation of two pairs of atomic memories and the coherent mapping of stored atomic states into light fields in an effective state of near maximum polarization entanglement. Entanglement is verified by way of the measured violation of a Bell inequality, and can be used for communication protocols such as quantum cryptography. The demonstrated quantum nodes and channels can be used as segments of a quantum repeater, providing an essential tool for robust long-distance quantum communication."

https://openalex.org/W1964998879,"Clusterin is an extracellular chaperone present in all disease-associated extracellular amyloid deposits, but its roles in amyloid formation and protein deposition in vivo are poorly understood. The current study initially aimed to characterize the effects of clusterin on amyloid formation in vitro by a panel of eight protein substrates. Two of the substrates (Alzheimer's beta peptide and a PI3-SH3 domain) were then used in further experiments to examine the effects of clusterin on amyloid cytotoxicity and to probe the mechanism of clusterin action. We show that clusterin exerts potent effects on amyloid formation, the nature and extent of which vary greatly with the clusterin:substrate ratio, and provide evidence that these effects are exerted via interactions with prefibrillar species that share common structural features. Proamyloidogenic effects of clusterin appear to be restricted to conditions in which the substrate protein is present at a very large molar excess; under these same conditions, clusterin coincorporates with substrate protein into insoluble aggregates. However, when clusterin is present at much higher but still substoichiometric levels (e.g., a molar ratio of clusterin:substrate=1:10), it potently inhibits amyloid formation and provides substantial cytoprotection. These findings suggest that clusterin is an important element in the control of extracellular protein misfolding."
https://openalex.org/W2044593393,"In budding yeast, phosphate starvation triggers inhibition of the Pho80-Pho85 cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex by the CDK inhibitor Pho81, leading to expression of genes involved in nutrient homeostasis. We isolated myo - d -inositol heptakisphosphate (IP 7 ) as a cellular component that stimulates Pho81-dependent inhibition of Pho80-Pho85. IP 7 is necessary for Pho81-dependent inhibition of Pho80-Pho85 in vitro. Moreover, intracellular concentrations of IP 7 increased upon phosphate starvation, and yeast mutants defective in IP 7 production failed to inhibit Pho80-Pho85 in response to phosphate starvation. These observations reveal regulation of a cyclin-CDK complex by a metabolite and suggest that a complex metabolic network mediates signaling of phosphate availability."
https://openalex.org/W1964365069,"Inositol pyrophosphates are a diverse group of high-energy signaling molecules whose cellular roles remain an active area of study. We report a previously uncharacterized class of inositol pyrophosphate synthase and find it is identical to yeast Vip1 and Asp1 proteins, regulators of actin-related protein-2/3 (ARP 2/3) complexes. Vip1 and Asp1 acted as enzymes that encode inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and inositol heptakisphosphate (IP7) kinase activities. Alterations in kinase activity led to defects in cell growth, morphology, and interactions with ARP complex members. The functionality of Asp1 and Vip1 may provide cells with increased signaling capacity through metabolism of IP6."

We charted multiple regions of frequency entrainment or synchronization by their corresponding Arnold's tongue diagrams as the oscillator was driven at subharmonic and rational commensurate frequencies. Demonstration of multiple synchronized regions could be fundamentally important to neurocomputing with mechanical oscillator networks and nanomechanical signal processing for microwave communication.
https://openalex.org/W1976058251,"Information on responses of higher organisms to climate change is dominated by events in spring. Far less is known about autumnal events and virtually nothing about communities of microorganisms. We analyzed autumnal fruiting patterns of macrofungi over the past 56 years and found that average first fruiting date of 315 species is earlier, while last fruiting date is later. Fruiting of mycorrhizal species that associate with both deciduous and coniferous trees is delayed in deciduous, but not in coniferous, forests. Many species are now fruiting twice a year, indicating increased mycelial activity and possibly greater decay rates in ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W1990925961,"The carbon skeletons of over 55,000 naturally occurring isoprenoid compounds are constructed from four fundamental coupling reactions: chain elongation, cyclopropanation, branching, and cyclobutanation. Enzymes that catalyze chain elongation and cyclopropanation are well studied, whereas those that catalyze branching and cyclobutanation are unknown. We have catalyzed the four reactions with chimeric proteins generated by replacing segments of a chain-elongation enzyme with corresponding sequences from a cyclopropanation enzyme. Stereochemical and mechanistic considerations suggest that the four coupling enzymes could have evolved from a common ancestor through relatively small changes in the catalytic site."

https://openalex.org/W2065212177,"Sex-determining region Y-box (SOX) 6 negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from β-cells and is a down-regulated transcription factor in the pancreatic islet cells of hyperinsulinemic obese mice. To determine the contribution of SOX6 to insulin resistance, we analyzed the effects of SOX6 on cell proliferation. Small interfering RNA-mediated attenuation of SOX6 expression stimulated the proliferation of insulinoma INS-1E and NIH-3T3 cells, whereas retroviral overexpression resulted in inhibition of cell growth. Quantitative real time-PCR analysis revealed that the levels of cyclin D1 transcripts were markedly decreased by SOX6 overexpression. Luciferase-reporter assay with β-catenin showed that SOX6 suppresses cyclin D1 promoter activities. In vitro binding experiments showed that the LZ/Q domain of SOX6 physically interacts with armadillo repeats 1-4 of β-catenin. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that increased SOX6 expression significantly reduced the levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 at the cyclin D1 promoter. By using a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that SOX6 suppressed cyclin D1 activities by interacting withβ-catenin and HDAC1.

In obesity-related insulin resistance, pancreatic islets compensate for chronic insulin insensitivity by expanding β-cell mass and increasing insulin secretory capacity (1Butler A.E. Janson J.

We also showed that SOX6 directly binds with pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor 1 (PDX1) and negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (3Iguchi H. Ikeda Y. Okamura M. Tanaka T.

Based on the role of PDX1 in the development and proliferation of β-cells, insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways, and the onset of type 2 diabetes (4Kulkarni R.N.

Investig. 2004; 114: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we suggested that the attenuated expression of SOX6 may contribute to β-cell adaptation in obesity-related insulin resistance.SOX6 is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors containing a DNA-binding high mobility group (HMG) domain that is highly conserved among species (5Schepers G.E. Teasdale R.D. Koopman P. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 167-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). SOX6 and closely related SOX5 are co-expressed during mouse chondrogenesis (6Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both SOX6 and SOX5 exhibit impaired chondrogenesis and die in utero (7Smits P. Li P. Mandel J. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 277-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In adult mice, relatively high levels of SOX6 protein are present in β-cells. The levels of SOX6 expression in the pancreatic islets are not regulated by fasting and subsequent refeeding but are reduced by feeding a high fat diet and by defects in the leptin gene. In addition to the suppression of PDX1, SOX6 also negatively regulates genes involved in ATP production in insulinoma MIN6 cells; these include NADH dehydrogenase complex subunit (complex I), the cytochrome c1 complex subunit (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase complex subunit (complex IV), and the ATP synthetase subunit (complex V). Consistent with the suppression of genes involved in ATP production, overexpression of SOX6 in MIN6 cells suppresses the induction of ATP content and the ATP/ADP ratio by high glucose (3Iguchi H.

In this paper, we demonstrate the mechanism by which SOX6 suppresses cell proliferation. Our current studies reveal that SOX6 binds with β-catenin and recruits histone deacetylase 1 for suppression of cyclin D1 promoter activities induced by β-catenin. Together with the stimulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the induced cell proliferation by attenuation of SOX6 expression may account for the hyperinsulinemia and hyperplasia characteristic of insulin resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Rabbit polyclonal anti-β-catenin (H-102) (sc-7199) and anti-HDAC1 (H51) (sc-7872) antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (F3165) antibody was from Sigma; monoclonal anti-RGS-His (34610) was from Qiagen; a rabbit polyclonal anti-SOX6 (Ab-12054) and monoclonal anti-β-actin (Ab-8226) were from Abcam Ltd.

Mammalian expression plasmid for human TCF4 (pcDNA/myc-mTCF4) was a kind gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center). Luciferase reporter plasmids of mouse cyclin D1 promoter and Tcf/LEF were generously provided by Dr. Johan Auwerx (CNRS/INSERM/Université Louis Pasteur).The following plasmids were constructed by standard methods (16Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector pCMV-β-catenin, which encodes full-length mouse β-catenin (amino acids 1-781) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was constructed by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from mouse liver as a template and by insertion of the full-length coding sequence into pcDNA3. pCMV-β-catenin(S33Y), which encodes a mutant β-catenin where serine 33 is mutated to tyrosine, was generated with a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To create the deletion mutants encoding amino acids 1-468, 1-134, 135-300, and the internal deletion (Δ135-387) of β-catenin, corresponding sequences were amplified by PCR with suitable restriction endonucleases and ligated into pcDNA3. pCMV-β-catenin-His, which encodes full-length mouse β-catenin followed by three tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope and six histidine residues, was constructed with pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen) as the parent vector. pCMV-β-catenin(S33Y)-His is identical to pCMV-β-catenin-His except that serine 33 is changed to tyrosine. pCMV-FLAG-SOX6 and pCMV-FLAG-SOX9, which encode full-length mouse SOX6 (amino acids 1-827) and full-length human SOX9 (amino acids 1-509), respectively, containing FLAG-epitope at the N terminus, were constructed with pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene) as the parent vector. pBIND-β-catenin, which encodes GAL4-β-catenin fusion protein, was constructed by inserting the full length of mouse β-catenin cDNA fragment into a poly-linker site of pBIND (Clontech), which contains the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 protein. For in vitro transcription and translation, full-length and deletion sequences of HDAC1 (amino acids 1-482, 1-139, and 140-482) were generated by PCR amplification using pCIneo mouse HDAC1-myc (a kind gift from Dr. Christian Seiser, University of Vienna) as a template and inserted into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen).

GST or GST fusion vectors for full-length mouse SOX6 (amino acids 1-827), mouse β-catenin (amino acids 1-781), and mouse HDAC1 (amino acids 1-482) were created in bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). For in vitro binding competition assay, the cDNAs encoding N-terminal histidine-tagged SOX6 and SOX9 fusion proteins were created in pET15b (Takara, Kyoto, Japan), and the proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and used for the assays. The purity and size of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE.Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, followed by passing through a 22.5-gauge needle 15 times to shear cellular DNA as described previously (13Sakai J.

After the cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at top speed in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (13Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L.

Two secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse IgG, and anti-rabbit IgG) were each used at a dilution of 1:3,000. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL-PlusR system (Amersham Biosciences), and luminescent images were analyzed by a LuminoImager (LAS-3000; Fuji Film Inc.).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was performed using a kit from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA) as described previously (3Iguchi H. Ikeda Y. Okamura M. Tanaka T. Urashima Y. Ohguchi H. Takayasu S. Kojima N. Iwasaki S. Ohashi R. Jiang S. Hasegawa G. Ioka R.X. Magoori K. Sumi K. Maejima T. Uchida A. Naito M. Osborne T.F.

Briefly, DNA was cross-linked to protein with formaldehyde. Cellular lysate was obtained by scraping, followed by pulse ultrasonication to shear cellular DNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the following antibodies (1.0 μg): anti-acetylated histone H3, anti-acetylated histone H4, anti-β-catenin, and anti-FLAG for epitope-tagged SOX6. Subsequently, cross-links were reversed, and bound DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction. QRT-PCR was performed using the primers specific for human cyclin D1 promoter as follows: 5′-CCGACTGGTCAAGGTAGGAA-3′ and 5′-CCAAGGGGGTAACCCTAAAA-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions -996 to -977 and -836 to -817 with respect to the first ATG codon of cyclin D1. QRT-PCR data are presented as a percentage of input DNA recovered.RESULTSEffects of SOX6 Expression on Cell Proliferation—In a previous study, we showed that SOX6 expression is down-regulated in hyperinsulinemic obese mice and that this attenuation led to increased insulin secretion from cultured β-cells (3Iguchi H. Ikeda Y. Okamura M. Tanaka T. Urashima Y. Ohguchi H. Takayasu S. Kojima N. Iwasaki S. Ohashi R. Jiang S. Hasegawa G. Ioka R.X. Magoori K. Sumi K. Maejima T. Uchida A. Naito M. Osborne T.F. Yanagisawa M. Yamamoto T.T. Kodama T. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37669-37680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the attenuation of SOX6 may account for hyperinsulinemia in obese animals and type 2 diabetes. To further evaluate the role of SOX6 in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the effects of SOX6 expression on cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SOX6 increased cell proliferation of insulinoma INS-1E and NIH-3T3 cells. Furthermore, in MIN6 and HIT-T15 cells, which are derived from β-cells, the application of siRNA specific for SOX6 stimulated cell growth (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that SOX6 attenuates cell proliferation of β-cells. In a complementary manner to the results of siRNA experiments, retroviral overexpression of SOX6 inhibited cell proliferation of INS-1E and NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Similarly, cell growth of MIN6 cells was suppressed by forced expression of SOX6 (supplemental Fig. 2). The expression level of SOX6 induced by retroviral transduction was 6-7-fold higher than endogenous SOX6 in the cells (data not shown). Consistent with the inhibition of cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, as determined by BrdUrd incorporation, was also significantly reduced in NIH-3T3 cells retrovirally transfected with SOX6 compared with those transduced with control virus encoding GFP (Fig. 1E). Although retroviral transfection of SOX6 inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, it did not induce morphological changes of NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1F, top panel). Quantitative analysis of cell cycle distribution showed that the percentage of G2 phase cells was largely reduced when SOX6 was retrovirally transfected into NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1F, bottom panel).SOX6-mediated Suppression of Cyclin D1 Promoter Activity—Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of representative cell cycle-regulating proteins revealed that the levels of cyclin D1 transcripts were the most significantly decreased in SOX6-expressing cells 12 h after induction of cell proliferation by serum addition; the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA in NIH-3T3 cells retrovirally transfected with SOX6 were ∼30% of those in the cells transfected with GFP, whereas those of other cell cycle-regulating proteins, including cyclins A2, D2, D3, and E1, were decreased by ∼50% (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the induction of SOX6 leads to G1 arrest by blocking cyclin-dependent entry into G2 phase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.FIGURE 2Expression of genes involved in the cell cycle in SOX6-transduced NIH-3T3 cells. On day 0, NIH-3T3 cells were prepared for experiments and infected with retrovirus encoding either GFP or SOX6, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 12 h after serum addition, cells were harvested for isolation of total RNA and used for reverse transcription and QRT-PCR. Mouse cyclophilin mRNA was used as the invariant control. The mRNA values are depicted relative to mRNA in GFP-transduced NIH-3T3 cells, which are arbitrarily defined as 1.

The cyclin D1 promoter contains a typical T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid-enhancer factor (Lef)-1-binding site, and its activity is largely dependent on β-catenin (17Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I.

Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of SOX6 expression on the cyclin D1 promoter, we used cyclin D1 promoter fused with luciferase and an artificial luciferase reporter construct, TOPFLASH, containing multiple Tcf/Lef1-binding sites upstream of the c-fos promoter (19Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). In this assay, we co-transfected with normal β-catenin and a mutant form S33Y, a constitutively active form in which serine 33 was substituted with tyrosine. This mutant β-catenin is not phosphorylated at Ser-33 by glycogen synthetase kinase 3β and is resistant to proteolytic degradation. As shown in Fig. 3A, normal and S33Y β-catenin activated TOPFLASH activity in the absence of SOX6. In contrast, β-catenin-induced TOP-FLASH activity was completely blocked by SOX6 expression. Furthermore, SOX6 overexpression inhibited cyclin D1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B), suggesting that SOX6 inhibited transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 promoter activated by β-catenin (Fig. 3, A and B). It also suggests that SOX6, like SOX9, binds to β-catenin (20Akiyama H. Lyons J.P. Mori-Akiyama Y. Yang X. Zhang R. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Taketo M.M. Nakamura T. Behringer R.R.

To confirm this possibility, we carried out co-transfection of SOX6 with β-catenin fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-β-catenin). A"

Many Bcl-2 family proteins modulate the permeability state of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming homo- and hetero-oligomers. The structure and dynamics of the homodimeric transmembrane domain of BNip3 were investigated with the aid of solution NMR in lipid bicelles and molecular dynamics energy relaxation in an explicit lipid bilayer. The right-handed parallel helix-helix structure of the domain with a hydrogen bond-rich His-Ser node in the middle of the membrane, accessibility of the node for water, and continuous hydrophilic track across the membrane suggest that the domain can provide an ion-conducting pathway through the membrane. Incorporation of the BNip3 transmembrane domain into an artificial lipid bilayer resulted in pH-dependent conductivity increase.

Mitochondria hold a crucial role in programmed cell death required to control cell development and to maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms (1.Green D.R. Reed J.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria-mediated cell death is both promoted and suppressed by apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, most of which contain a C-terminal hydrophobic domain essential for membrane targeting (2.Aouacheria A. Brunet F. Gouy M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 2395-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A major function of Bcl-2 family proteins is to regulate the permeability state of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming homo- and hetero-oligomers inside the membrane that determine cell fate (3.Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4.Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell.

The pro-apoptotic protein BNip3 (Bcl-2 Nineteen-kDa interacting protein 3) with a single Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain is one of the most intensively studied members of the family (6.Chen G. Cizeau J. Vande Velde C. Park J.H. Bozek G. Bolton J. Shi L. Dubik D. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). BNip3 and its homologues belong to an independent monophyletic branch with individual evolutionary history (2.Aouacheria A. Brunet F. Gouy M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 2395-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and are essentially different from other BH3-only proteins such as Bid/Bik not only in that they do not require BH3 domain for their function but also because they directly cause changes of mitochondrial potential (7.Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). BNip3-induced cell death is independent of caspases and cytochrome c release; it is believed to represent a novel form of programmed cell death, resembling necrosis rather than classical apoptosis (8.Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar).For all cells, loss of nutrient supply represents a potent signal for programmed death. BNip3 plays an important role in hypoxic cell death of normal and malignant cells (9.Lee H. Paik S.G. Mol. Cells. 2006; 28: 1-6Google Scholar). Hypoxia induces expression and accumulation of cytoplasmic or loosely membrane-bound BNip3; however, in order to activate cell death pathway acidosis is required (10.Webster K.A. Graham R.M. Bishopric N.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Transition from respiratory to glycolytic metabolism with increased glucose consumption, lactic acid production, and decrease of cytosolic pH causes redistribution of BNip3 to the outer mitochondrial membrane and integration of homodimeric BNip3 into it, triggering a cell death cascade, which ultimately leads to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (8.Vande Velde C.

Jaszewski T.M. Mackenzie K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51950-51956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). So far, the structure of the transmembrane domain of a representative of the Bcl-2 family in the lipid environment has not been reported. We describe the spatial structure and internal dynamics of the homodimeric TM domain of human pro-apoptotic protein BNip3 in a membrane-mimicking lipid environment obtained with the aid of a combination of NMR spectroscopic technique and molecular dynamics (MD) energy relaxation. The structure suggests a possibility that the BNip3 TM domain alone can form an ion-conducting pathway in the membrane, as supported by direct measurements on the bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs). This property of the TM domain can help to explain the mechanism of BNip3 action, in particular in hypoxia acidosis-induced cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruct Design, Cloning, and Expression−The DNA sequence encoding human BNip3 fragment 146–190 (BNip3tm) was synthesized from six oligonucleotides via PCR. The TrxA-BNip3tm fusion protein was constructed by fusing the gene for thioredoxin of Escherichia coli with an N terminus His tag extension to the gene for BNip3tm in the pGEMEX1 (Promega) vector. To facilitate purification, a His tag and enterokinase cleavage site were placed between the genes for the thioredoxin and BNip3tm fragment. The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and grown in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing (15NH4)2SO4 (CIL) or (15NH4)2SO4/[U-13C]glucose (CIL) for the production of uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein samples. After induction with 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and an additional 40 h of growth at 13 °C, the cells were harvested and stored at –20 °C.Protein Purification−Cell pellets (1-liter equivalents) were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 15 mm Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by ultrasonication. Centrifugally clarified lysate was applied to chelating Sepharose FF beads (Amersham Biosciences) pre-treated with NiSO4 and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. After overnight incubation with recombinant light chain of human enterokinase, the cleaved BNip3tm fragment was passed through chelating Sepharose FF, loaded onto an SP-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted by gradient of NaCl. Yields of ∼10 mg of protein/liter of cell culture could be obtained by this procedure. Protein concentration was determined by A280 values. Protein identity and purity were confirmed by gel electrophoreses, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy in a methanol/chloroform (1/1) mixture containing 5–10% of water. The unlabeled human glycophorin A fragment 61–98 (GpAtm), including a GpA TM segment with adjacent N- and C-terminal regions, was obtained in a similar way as the BNip3tm fragment.NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculations−Four BNip3tm samples were prepared: uniformly 15N/13C-labeled; 15N-labeled; unlabeled; and a 1:1 mixture of uniformly 15N/13C-labeled and unlabeled protein (“heterodimer” sample). The lyophilized protein was solubilized in the form of an aqueous suspension of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC)/dihexanoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DHPC) lipid (Avanti Polar Lipids) bicelles prepared with a lipid molar ratio of 0.25, and then the samples were subjected to several freeze/thaw cycles resulting in uniform protein distribution among the lipid bicelles. To verify the validity of NMR experimental conditions, circular dichroism spectra of BNip3tm in the DMPC/DHPC bicelles and in DMPC monolamellar liposomes (phospholipid bilayer) were recorded. After base-line substraction, the spectra proved virtually identical (for results and experimental procedures, see the supplemental data).NMR experiments were performed on a 600-MHz (1H) Varian Unity spectrometer equipped with a pulsed field gradient unit and triple resonance probe. NMR spectra were acquired at 40 °C using 1-mm samples of BNip3tm incorporated into lipid bicelles (with a lipid/protein molar ratio of 40) dissolved in buffer solution (pH 5.0) containing 20 mm deuterated sodium acetate, 0.15 μm sodium azide, 1 mm EDTA, and either 5 or 99.9% D2O unless otherwise specified.The backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of BNip3tm were assigned using standard triple resonance techniques (14.Sattler M.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar) performed for 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples in H2O and D2O, respectively. Two-dimensional 1H NOESY (60-ms mixing time) spectrum acquired for the unlabeled sample was used as an additional source of the structural information concerning aromatic ring protons. Intermonomeric distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional 15N,13C F1-filtered/F3-edited-NOESY and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited-NOESY spectra (20.Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar) acquired with an 80-ms mixing time for the “heterodimer” sample in H2O and D2O, respectively. Protein-lipid NOE contacts were identified from two-dimensional 15N, 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited-NOESY and three-dimensional 13C F1-filtered/F3-edited-NOESY spectra acquired with an 80-ms mixing time for the 15N/13C-labeled sample. Stereospecific assignments and torsion angle restraints for ϕ, ψ, and χ1 were obtained by the analysis of local conformation in CYANA using sequential NOE data and the available 3JHNα and 3JNβ coupling constants evaluated quantitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHA and qualitatively from three-dimensional 1H-15N HNHB experiments (15.Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice.2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were also estimated based on the assigned chemical shifts using TALOS (21.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The slowly exchanging amide protons were assigned as hydrogen bond donors with related hydrogen-acceptor partners on the basis of preliminary structure calculations. Corresponding hydrogen bond restraints were employed in subsequent calculations for d(O,N), d(O,HN), d(C,HN) distances according to Ref. (22.Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The standard CYANA simulated annealing protocol was applied to 200 random structures, and the resulting 16 structures with the lowest target function were selected. Constrained energy relaxation of the 16 best CYANA structures of the BNip3tm dimer was performed using available distance restraints by MD in the explicit DMPC bilayer.Structure Refinement via MD Energy Relaxation−MD energy relaxation calculations were performed using the GRO-MACS package (23.Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) at a temperature of 315 K, with a time step of 2 fs, imposed three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, in the NPT ensemble with an isotropic pressure of 1 bar. A twin range (12/20 Å) spherical cutoff and PME algorithm were used to treat van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, respectively. In total, 16 NMR structures of the BNip3tm dimer with different tautomeric forms of His173 were refined: 12 εHis173-BNip3tm and 4 δHis173-BNip3tm dimers with a protonated Nε or Nδ group of the imidazole ring, respectively. In each case, a 5-ns collection MD run with applied intra- and intermonomeric NOE distance restraints was carried out. Furthermore, two additional MD simulations were performed starting from coordinates of the resulting systems. In the former one, a 5-ns continuation MD run without restraints was carried out in order to check the stability of the dimer. The latter simulation (1-ns MD with NMR distance restraints followed by 5-ns free MD) was done with protonated His173 in one subunit of the δεHis173/εHis173-BNip3tm dimer in order to assess the effect of the ionization state of His173 on the dimeric structure. Equilibrium parts of MD trajectories (last 2 ns) were analyzed using original software developed by the authors and utilities supplied with the GROMACS package. Hydrophobic properties of α-helices were calculated using the molecular hydrophobicity potential approach as described elsewhere (24.Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting structures of the BNip3tm dimer were visualized with MOLMOL (25.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar) and PYMOL (www.pymol.org). Other details of MD calculations are described in the supplemental data.Electrochemical Measurements−Bilayers were formed either on 1–1.2-mm aperture in a vertical or on 200-μm aperture in a horizontal teflon partition with the aid of the Mueller-Rudin method. The membranes were formed from a 20-mg/ml solution of diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC; Avanti Polar Lipids) in decane. The measurements were performed at 23 °C in 100- or 10-mm KCl solutions containing 1 mm EDTA and buffered with 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.0 or 30 mm MES at pH 4.0. BNip3tm and GpAtm were added either into water solution in the form of solution in Me2SO (1 μg/μl) or directly into the solution of the lipid in decane used for formation of the membranes (to the final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl).For electrical measurements, silver chloride electrodes with standard agar-salt bridges with the total resistance not exceeding 50 kOm were used. The capacitance of BLM was determined from the electric current under applied alternating voltage with the aid of homemade software. The voltage was applied from analog output of a ADC-DAC board (Lcard L780). Conductivity to direct current was determined by applying constant voltage to the membrane for a period significantly exceeding the RC constant of the membrane and recording the current.RESULTSStructure Determination of the BNip3tm Dimer−The 45-residue BNip3 fragment 146–190 (BNip3tm), including the BNip3 TM segment with adjacent N- and C-terminal regions, was solubilized in an aqueous suspension of DMPC/DHPC lipid bicelles, and the standard heteronuclear NMR techniques were applied to determine the spatial structure and to describe the internal dynamics. Directly identified intra- and intermonomeric NOE contacts (a representative strip is shown on Fig. 1B) confirmed the dimeric helical structure of the BNip3 TM domain in the bicelles and demonstrated that the dimer subunits are in a parallel mutual arrangement. The presence of the single cross-peak set in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1A) implies that the BNip3tm dimer is symmetrical on the NMR time scale. Therefore, the dihedral angle restraints and both intra- and intermonomeric distance restraints were symmetrically doubled for each dimer subunit that resulted in a dimer with 2-fold symmetry averaged over the ensemble of calculated NMR structures. The full set of input data for NMR structure calculation included 608/28 intra/intermonomeric unambiguous NOE distance restraints, distance restraints for 38 hydrogen bonds, and 162 backbone (ϕ, ψ) and side chain (χ1) dihedral angle restraints. From the observed protein-lipid NOE contacts (Fig. 1C, supplemental Fig. S1) with lipid polar heads and hydrophobic tails we can conclude, similarly to Ref. (26.Fernandez C. Hilty C. Wider H. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13533-13537Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) where analogous contacts have been analyzed, that the DMPC/DHPC bicelles mimic the embedding of the BNip3 TM domain into a double layer lipid membrane reasonably well. As for the protein-lipid interaction, around the central part of the molecular surface of the BNip3tm dimer we identified many protein-lipid NOE contacts with lipid hydrophobic tails, whereas the protein-lipid NOE contacts with lipid polar heads were found only in the N- and C-terminal parts of the dimer helices. Thus, the dimer spans the hydrophobic phase of the bicelle.The resulting NMR structures of the BNip3tm dimers were subjected to energy relaxation using MD in an explicit hydrated lipid bilayer with the imposed experimentally derived distance restraints. The MD energy relaxation allowed adapting the structure to the lipid environment, with improvement of the quality (distribution of the torsion angles of the side chains, backbone conformation), while the geometry of interaction of the TM fragments remained practically unchanged. Moreover, a 5-ns continuation of MD without NMR restraints did not cause any change of the dimer structure or violations of the restraints. Hence, the obtained structure of the BNip3tm dimer is stable in the membrane. A survey of the structural statistics for the final ensemble of the 16 structures of the BNip3tm dimer (Fig. 2A) is provided in Table 1.FIGURE 2Spatial structure of the BNip3tm dimer.

Open table in a new tab Tertiary Fold of the BNip3tm Dimer in Lipid Bicelles−Analysis of the calculated spatial structure revealed that the BNip3tm integrated in the lipid bicelles mostly adopted an α-helical structure. The membrane-spanning α-helices cross at the angle θ of –45 ± 5° with the distance d = 5.7 ± 0.5 Å between helix axes and form a right-handed parallel symmetric dimer (Fig. 2) typical for membrane-soluble helical pairs (27.Walters R.F.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For the BNip3tm dimer, the overall rotation correlation time τR, estimated from a T1/T2 ratio and averaged over 15N nuclei with 1H{15N} NOE higher than 0.6, is ∼18 ns (Fig. 3). Based on the empirical dependence (28.Daragan V.A. Mayo K.H. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 63-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (221) Google Scholar), this τR value corresponds to the effective molecular mass of ∼50 kDa that almost exactly coincides with the size of the DMPC/DHPC bicelle (29.Andersson A. Maler L. Langmuir. 2005; 21: 7702-7709Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) composed of the BNip3tm dimer surrounded by 80 lipid molecules.FIGURE 3BNip3tm backbone dynamics. A–C, experimental steady-state 15N{1H} NOE, 15N longitudinal T1, and transverse T2 relaxation times for the backbone 15N nuclei of the BNip3tm dimer, respectively. D, effective rotation correlation times, τR, calculated from the T1/T2 ratio. Uncertainties are shown by bars. The BNip3tm sequence is presented below. Broken lines separate the unfolded regions 146–158 and 188–190 from the α-helical regions 159–165, 166–184, and 185–187 regions that have different flexibility.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 15N{1H} NOE, 15N T1, and T2 values (Fig. 3) measured for the backbone 15N nuclei exhibit significant variations along the protein sequence and are indicative of a stable TM α-helical region (residues 166–184) adjacent to more flexible N- and C-terminal α-helices (residues 159–165 and 185–187, respectively) located in the membrane/water interface. The TM helix has the highest positive 15N{1H} NOEs, which suggests restricted internal mobility for the NH vectors in a pico-nano-second time scale. In contrast, the residues 146–158 and 188–190 from the N- and C termini, respectively, have nearly unrestricted mobility, resulting in low and negative 15N{1H} NOEs and decreased local rotation correlation times τR, estimated from the T1/T2 ratio (Fig. 3). For more detailed discussion of the stable and transitory structures of the BNip3tm dimer see the supplemental data.BNip3tm Dimerization Interface−The TM domain, though generally hydrophobic, contains certain relatively hydrophilic regions. The dimerization interface includes both polar and non-polar residues. A convenient parameter for visualization of spatial distribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties is molecular hydrophobicity potential (MHP) (24.Efremov R.G. Vergoten G. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 10658-10666Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On Fig. 4A, contour isolines on a two-dimensional hydrophobicity map for the BNip3tm helices encircle hydrophobic regions with high values of MHP, and the red-hatched area (∼650 Å2) indicates the helix-packing interface of the symmetrical BNip3 dimer. It can be seen that the N-terminal helices interact exclusively through hydrophobic regions (Fig. 4). The dimerization interface on the TM helices is mostly polar with some hydrophobic segments on the outer surface. All the stable intermonomeric contacts (preserved over the MD energy relaxation) in the dimer are observed along the TM helices, whereas the less stable ones are along the mobile N-terminal helices, where the intermonomeric stacking in"

We present structural and biochemical analyses of hPrp31-15.5K-U4 snRNA complexes that show how the conserved Nop domain in hPrp31 maintains high RNP binding selectivity despite relaxed RNA sequence requirements. The Nop domain is a genuine RNP binding module, exhibiting RNA and protein binding surfaces. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a link between retinitis pigmentosa and an aberrant hPrp31-hPrp6 interaction that blocks U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP formation."

https://openalex.org/W2089928442,"Little is known about dislocation core structures in oxides, despite their central importance in controlling electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. It has often been assumed, on the basis of charge considerations, that a nonstoichiometric core structure could not exist. We report atomic-resolution images that directly resolve the cation and anion sublattices in alumina (alpha-Al2O3). A dissociated basal edge dislocation is seen to consist of two cores; an aluminum column terminates one partial, and an oxygen column terminates the second partial. Each partial core is locally nonstoichiometric due to the excess of aluminum or oxygen at the core. The implication for mechanical properties is that the mobile high-temperature dislocation core structure consists of two closely spaced partial dislocations. For basal slip to occur, synchronized motion of the partials on adjacent planes is required."
https://openalex.org/W2048354751,"Kinesin-1 is a two-headed molecular motor that walks along microtubules, with each step gated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Existing models for the gating mechanism propose a role for the microtubule lattice. We show that unpolymerized tubulin binds to kinesin-1, causing tubulin-activated release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). With no added nucleotide, each kinesin-1 dimer binds one tubulin heterodimer. In adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, each kinesin-1 dimer binds two tubulin heterodimers. The data reveal an ATP gate that operates independently of the microtubule lattice, by ATP-dependent release of a steric or allosteric block on the tubulin binding site of the tethered kinesin-ADP head."
https://openalex.org/W2067086438,"In the presence of formamide, crystal phosphate minerals may act as phosphate donors to nucleosides, yielding both 5′- and, to a lesser extent, 3′-phosphorylated forms. With the mineral Libethenite the formation of 5′-AMP can be as high as 6% of the adenosine input and last for at least 103 h. At high concentrations, soluble non-mineral phosphate donors (KH2PO4 or 5′-CMP) afford 2′- and 2′:3′-cyclic AMP in addition to 5′-and 3′-AMP. The phosphate minerals analyzed were Herderite Ca[BePO4F], Hureaulite Mn2+5(PO3(OH)2(PO4)2(H2O)4, Libethenite Cu2+2(PO4)(OH), Pyromorphite Pb5(PO4)3Cl, Turquoise Cu2+Al6(PO4)4(OH)8(H2O)4, Fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F, Hydroxylapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH, Vivianite Fe2+3(PO4)2(H2O)8, Cornetite Cu2+3(PO4)(OH)3, Pseudomalachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, Reichenbachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, and Ludjibaite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4). Based on their behavior in the formamide-driven nucleoside phosphorylation reaction, these minerals can be characterized as: 1) inactive, 2) low level phosphorylating agents, or 3) active phosphorylating agents. Instances were detected (Libethenite and Hydroxylapatite) in which phosphorylation occurs on the mineral surface, followed by release of the phosphorylated compounds. Libethenite and Cornetite markedly protect the β-glycosidic bond. Thus, activated nucleic monomers can form in a liquid non-aqueous environment in conditions compatible with the thermodynamics of polymerization, providing a solution to the standard-state Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°') problem, the major obstacle for polymerizations in the liquid phase in plausible prebiotic scenarios.

Thus, activated nucleic monomers can form in a liquid non-aqueous environment in conditions compatible with the thermodynamics of polymerization, providing a solution to the standard-state Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°') problem, the major obstacle for polymerizations in the liquid phase in plausible prebiotic scenarios. In prebiotic scenarios biopolymers can be thought of as condensation products of abiotically formed monomers. Polymers (polysaccharides, peptides, and polynucleotides) will not spontaneously form in an aqueous solution from their monomers because of the standard-state Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG°'), as critically reviewed in Ref. (1van Holde K. Halvorson H.O. van Holde K.E. The Origins of Life and Evolution. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1980: 31Google Scholar). Thermodynamic considerations impose that amino acid polymerization or the formation of phosphodiester or glycosidic linkages will be spontaneous only under highly dehydrating conditions. Thus, either (i) life did not arise in aqueous environments, or (ii) pre-genetic polymerizations required activated monomers. In the polymerization process of nucleic acids extant organisms activate the monomers by converting them to phosphorylated derivatives and then utilize the favorable free energy of phosphate hydrolysis to drive the reaction. Does this present day process mimic spontaneously occurring prebiotic reactions, thus representing a sort of biochemiomimesis descending from ancient pathways, or should it be considered a fully novel cellular invention? The Source of Phosphate Is a Problem—Early studies on the condensation of water-soluble phosphates to polyphosphates and on the phosphorylation, condensation, or polymerization of biomolecules with polyphosphates have been reviewed (2Schwartz A. Origins Life Evol. Biosph. 1997; 27: 505-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yamagata Y. Watanabe H. Saitoh M. Namba T. Nature. 1991; 352: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Most of the phosphorus in the early Earth would have been in the form of water-insoluble minerals like apatites. Therefore, the origin of the water-soluble (poly)phosphates required for prebiotic evolution has long been a mystery (2Schwartz A. Origins Life Evol. Biosph. 1997; 27: 505-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yamagata et al. (3Yamagata Y. Watanabe H. Saitoh M. Namba T. Nature. 1991; 352: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) showed that volcanic activity produces water-soluble phosphates through partial hydrolysis of P4O10, providing at least a partial solution to their origin. However, as pointed out, phosphates from hydrolysis of polyphosphate would precipitate to the sea bed as insoluble salts. The phosphorylation of biological molecules has been explored through several different routes. Phosphonic acids have been proposed as a source of biophosphates (4De Graaf R.M. Visscher J. Schwartz A.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the phosphorylation of nucleosides, two early reports described the preparation of uridine phosphates by heating uridine with inorganic phosphates in an aqueous environment (5Beck A. Lohrmann R. Orgel L.E. Science. 1967; 157: 952Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the effects of condensing agents on this reaction (6Lohrmann R. Orgel L.E. Science. 1968; 161: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the inefficiency of the system due to the competition of water with the nucleoside was pointed out by the authors. Additionally, cyclization of uridine 2′:3′-phosphate occurred under the same conditions but in much greater yield (6Lohrmann R. Orgel L.E. Science. 1968; 161: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by efficient intramolecular esterification. A possible solution to abiotic nucleotide formation provided by solid state chemistry was also proposed (7Reimann R. Zubay G. Origins Life Evol. Biosph. 1999; 29: 229-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Zubay G. Mui T. Origins Life Evol. Biosph. 2001; 31: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The alternative offered by phosphorylation in organic solvents, notably in formamide, was described in a series of pioneering studies by Schoffstal (9Schoffstall A.M. Orig. Life. 1976; 7: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Schoffstall A.M. Barto R.J. Ramos D.L. Orig. Life. 1982; 12: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Schoffstall A.M.

Building on these latter observations and on the large availability of phosphates in mineral form, we report the efficient phosphorylation of nucleosides occurring in formamide on numerous phosphate minerals. Consequently, the two alternatives mentioned above are not necessarily in contradiction: activated monomers can form in prebiotic conditions in a liquid, non-aqueous environment in the presence of phosphate minerals in conditions compatible with the thermodynamics of polymerization. The minerals studied were: Herderite Ca[BePO4F], Hureaulite Mn2+5(PO3(OH)2(PO4)2(H2O)4, Libethenite Cu2+2(PO4)(OH), Pyromorphite Pb5(PO4)3Cl, Turquoise Cu2+Al6(PO4)4(OH)8(H2O)4, Fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F, Hydroxylapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH, Vivianite Fe2+3(PO4)2(H2O)8, Cornetite Cu2+3(PO4)(OH)3, Pseudomalachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, Reichenbachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, and Ludjibaite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4. The minerals were provided by Ezio Curti, former provider and consultant of the Collection of Minerals of the Department of Mineralogy (University La Sapienza, Rome). Pure crystals were isolated (except for Hydroxylapatite) under the microscope, washed twice, first with ethanol and then with analytical grade distilled water, air dried, and manually ground in a ceramic mortar. “High Resolution” grade Hydroxylapatite was obtained from Fluka. Adenine, adenosine, cytosine, cytidine, and their monophosphorylated forms (5′-AMP, 3′-AMP, 2′-AMP, 2′:3′-cyclic AMP, 5′-CMP, 3′-CMP, 2′-CMP, 2′:3′-cyclic CMP, and 3′:5′-cyclic CMP) were from Sigma Aldrich, analytical grade. Formamide (≥99.5%, H2O ≤ 0.1%) was from Fluka, and KH2PO4 was from Merck. Phosphorylation Procedure and Analysis—Adenosine was dissolved in formamide and reacted at the concentration of 0.025 m in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, final volume 1 ml. The reaction was carried out in formamide at 90 °C in the presence of the indicated phosphate donor: KH2PO4 (final concentration 0.05 m) or 5′-CMP (final concentration 0.05 m) or one of the indicated phosphate minerals (10 mg/ml, ground as indicated). Phosphates were added to adenosine from concentrated solution in formamide. Where indicated the mineral was pretreated at 130 °C for 72 h in formamide. After the indicated reaction time, the samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). 2The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. HPLC Analysis—8-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were diluted with an equal volume of water to a final concentration of 50% formamide and injected into a SupelcosilTM LC 18-S 5-μm HPLC column (Supelco) 15 cm × 4.6 mm. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature with methanol:30 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.3 (2.5:97.5), UV irradiation 254 nm, on a HPLC Beckman System Gold instrument. Identification of the peaks was performed by comparison with standards. In this HPLC system 3′:5′-cyclic AMP migrates very close to the large unreacted adenosine peak, thus preventing its precise evaluation. As for the cytosine system, four peaks are resolved, consisting of cytosine, cytidine, (5′-CMP + 3′-CMP + 2′-CMP + 2′:3′-cyclic CMP), and 3′:5′-cyclic CMP. Thus, the meaning of the assays on cytidine phosphorylation is limited to the evaluation of the overall phosphorylation of the nucleoside. Measurement of Phosphate Release in Formamide—The crystal minerals were ground to a fine powder in a ceramic mortar. A suspension of the powder was diluted (1 mg/ml) in formamide, washed, and centrifuged four times. Samples were incubated at 130 °C for the indicated times, and then 100-μl aliquots were evaporated in an oven at 250 °C for 20 min, resuspended in 100 μl of ultrapure water, and analyzed for phosphate by the molybdenum blue-method, which detects only orthophosphate (PO 3–4) (13Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Adenosine by KH2PO4 or 5′-CMP in Formamide—The phosphorylation of adenosine by two different phosphate donors was analyzed for the sake of comparison with previously reported nucleoside phosphorylation systems (5Beck A.

Science. 1971; 171: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and to define the kinetics and the product regioselectivity of the phosphate reactions in formamide. Adenosine was reacted in water or in formamide at 90 °C for increasing times in the presence of the appropriate phosphate donor (KH2PO4 or 5′-CMP). The products were analyzed by HPLC. In water no phosphorylated forms were observed (data not shown), and the only reaction that took place was the cleavage of the β-glycosidic bond and the consequent release of adenine. As reported (15Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the half-life of this bond at 90 °C in water is 4.5 × 102 h. Fig. 1A shows the formation of different nucleotides in KH2PO4-containing formamide. The half-life of adenosine under this condition is ∼103 h, with its degradation following first order kinetics (15Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (data not shown). After 330 h 17% of the adenosine starting material was transformed into phosphorylated products. Of the products, 16% were identified as 5′-AMP, 3′-AMP, 2′-AMP, 2′:3′-cyclic AMP, and adenine (in order of appearance). Only traces of additional unidentified compounds were observed. Thus, by default the amount of the unidentifiable (see “Methods”) 3′:5′-cyclic AMP formed could not have been higher than 1.0%. Fig. 1B shows the same reaction in 5′-CMP-containing formamide. The overall behavior is quite similar to that observed with KH2PO4. The values are given as the percentage of each AMP nucleotide relative to the adenosine input. The only difference between the KH2PO4- and the 5′-CMP-fed phosphorylation is the initial rate of formation of AMPs, as shown by the comparison of the formation of 5′-AMP from KH2PO4 or from 5′-CMP (Fig. 1C). The lag in the 5′-CMP-fed reaction corresponds to the time necessary to make the phosphate moiety available by releasing it from the 5′-CMP donor. The kinetics of nucleotide dephosphorylation in these conditions is reported in Ref. (15Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is in full kinetic agreement. The half-lives of the components of the reaction and of its products in formamide at 90 °C were separately measured by HPLC (data not shown) and were (min): adenine > 105, 5′-AMP 1.10 × 103; 3′-AMP 0.40 × 103; 2′-AMP 0.21 × 103; 2′:3′-cyclic AMP 7.0 × 104. These data show that adenosine is phosphorylated in different positions and that the order of appearance of each species is governed by its rate of formation, with the last to form being the 2′:3′-cyclic species. The differential rates of degradation (2′-AMP > 3′-AMP > 5′-AMP > 2′:3′-cyclic AMP), measured on the order of minutes, and the species-specific rates of rephosphorylation, measured on the order of hours, determine the steady state equilibrium of the pool of phosphorylated nucleosides. The cleavage of the β-glycosidic bond causes the progressive increase of adenine, deriving both from adenosine and from the phosphorylated forms. The 10-fold protective effect on the β-glycosidic bond exerted by the presence of a phosphate moiety bound at 5′ was reported (15Saladino R. Crestini C. Ciciriello F. Di Mauro E. Costanzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5790-5796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, adenine is mostly formed from unreacted, unphosphorylated adenosine. At longer times the 2′:3′-cyclic species prevails. Eventually (∼2 × 103 h) only adenine will remain (data not shown). A similar overall behavior is observed in the specular system of cytidine phosphorylation by KH2PO4 or by 5′-AMP. The primary difference is the higher total amount of phosphorylated forms in the cytosine system (21%) relative to the adenine system (16%). Thus, the overall rate of phosphorylation is determined more by the acceptor than by the donor. For either system, no phosphorylated forms are observed in water. Thus, the active component of the phosphorylation reaction is formamide. Release of Phosphate by Formamide—As a prerequisite to the analysis of the phosphorylation (or otherwise) of adenosine by phosphate minerals, the kinetics of free phosphate release (or its absence) were determined. The molybdenum-blue colorimetric assay allowing only the detection of orthophosphate (13Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar) was the selected method. Given that all of the phosphate minerals studied contain single phosphorus units, the method is adequate. The ground mineral material was reacted at 130 °C in formamide, and samples were analyzed at various time intervals. Fig. 2 shows examples of the two typical different behaviors: Herderite Ca[BePO4F], which did not release phosphate, and Hureaulite Mn2+5(PO3(OH)2(PO4)2(H2O)4, which steadily released phosphate as a function of time. The phosphate release by the other 10 minerals analyzed is listed below. The amount of phosphate released refers to assays containing 1 mg/ml of mineral and is given as μg/ml, h–1. The number in square brackets refers to the number of hours in which the release of phosphate proceeded linearly before progressively reaching a plateau, which is interpreted as being due to exhaustion and/or clogging of the reactive surfaces by reaction products. Minerals are ordered according to increasing elemental complexity. The minerals release as follows: Herderite Ca[BePO4F], no release; Hureaulite Mn2+5(PO3(OH)2(PO4)2(H2O)4, 0.255 [5]; Libethenite Cu2+2(PO4)(OH), 0.306 [2.5]; Pyromorphite Pb5(PO4)3Cl, no release; Turquoise Cu2+Al6(PO4)4(OH)8(H2O)4, 0.01 [1]; Fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F, no release; Hydroxylapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH, 0.102 [5]; Vivianite Fe2+3(PO4)2(H2O)8, no release; Cornetite Cu2+3(PO4)(OH)3, 0.81 [3]; Pseudomalachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, 0.170 [2]; Reichenbachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, 0.765 [0.5]; Ludjibaite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, 0.72 [0.5]. Phosphorylation of Adenosine by Phosphate Minerals—Minerals were pretreated (130 °C, 72 h, in formamide), and then the temperature was lowered to 90 °C and adenosine was added. Samples were taken at various times, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC. Three different classes of activity were identified. Class 1: no phosphorylation, as shown by Herderite, Pyromorphite, Turquoise, Fluorapatite, Vivianite. Minerals of Class 1 release no or minimal (≤0.01 μg/ml) amounts of phosphate. Class 2: phosphorylation at very low levels, as exemplified by Hureaulite Mn2+5(PO3(OH)2(PO4)2(H2O)4 (Fig. 3) and Pseudomalachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4 (data not shown). In this case the products identified are limited to the most abundant 5′-AMP, while only traces of other compounds were observed. Class 2 minerals do not presumably take active part in the phosphorylation process, their function being quite likely limited to a passive release of phosphate into the medium. Class 3: a group of minerals was identified that are characterized by an active behavior: Libethenite Cu2+2(PO4)(OH), Ludjibaite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, Reichenbachite Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4, Cornetite Cu2+3(PO4)(OH)3, and Hydroxylapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH. Fig. 4 shows the phosphorylation reactions, carried out as for the previous samples, with an additional analytical step. Two parallel samples were treated as follows. Both were pretreated at 130 °C (72 h). One sample was then centrifuged three times to remove the mineral, leaving the released phosphate in the formamide supernatant (dubbed as “solute”), while the other sample still contained 1 mg of the mineral/1 ml of formamide. Adenosine was then added to each sample and reacted as before in the standard conditions (90 °C, formamide). The two samples were analyzed separately. Fig. 4A shows that for Libethenite the mineral-containing fraction affords a major production and release of 5′-AMP, continuous over ∼1000 h. At the end of the experiment the mineral was treated with a solution of sodium pyrophosphate to wash out possible surface-bound compounds. The release of adenine (4.0%), 3′-AMP (1.3%), and 2′:3′-cyclic AMP (0.92%) was detected. Thus, Libethenite actively promotes phosphorylation, selectively releasing from its surface one of the formed compounds (5′-AMP) and keeping in bound, but releasable, form other products of the reaction. The solute-containing supernatant from Libethenite yields only trace amounts of 5′-AMP, as observed for Class 2 minerals (not shown). Cornetite behaved similarly but was characterized by lower yield and no surface retention (Fig. 4B). Only marginal amounts of adenine were detected in Libethenite and Cornetite, which therefore protected the β-glycosidic bond of adenosine from cleavage. Ludjibaite and Reichenbachite were analyzed similarly. The mineral-deprived part of the samples behaved like Libethenite (i.e. minor production of 5′-AMP, not shown). The products of the mineral-containing samples of Ludjibaite and Reichenbachite are shown in Fig. 4, C and D, respectively. Aggregates started forming after 100 h for Ludjibaite and after 50 h for Reichenbachite. Thus, the reactions could not be analyzed for longer times. Both minerals yield both the 5′- and 3′-forms with initial rates that are roughly comparable with that of Libethenite. Notably, the yield of 5′-AMP by Reichenbachite at 50 h is the highest observed (1.7%), which is twice that by Libethenite and three times that by Ludjibaite. A sodium pyrophosphate wash did not release additional compounds. The four minerals identified as Class 3 display pseudo-catalytic activity. The mineral must be present for the phosphorylation reaction to occur. Here, mineral surface phenomena are a requirement of the reaction, as shown by the fact that the prereleased phosphates (solute) are almost inert and that the presence of the mineral is necessary for the phosphorylation process to occur at a high pace. However, given that the phosphate component of the mineral is transferred to the recipient adenosine, these minerals cannot be classified as catalysts. The catalyst function is exerted by formamide. Class 3 minerals are all Cu2+ phosphates with very similar chemical compositions. Two of them (Ludjibaite and Reichenbachite) are chemically identical (both Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4) Nevertheless, their effects on the kinetics of the reaction differ. The third chemically identical mineral Pseudomalachite (also Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4) displays, as mentioned above, a totally different behavior characterized by minimal reactivity. The likely explanation and interest of these differences lies in their different crystallographic structures. The structures of the three polymorphs of Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4 are all based on sheets of octahedra that are linked by (PO4) tetrahedra. The sheets of octahedra are somewhat unusual in that they are not close-packed octahedra interspersed with vacancies (as is common in this type of structure). The structures of the three polymorphs of Cu2+5(PO4)2(OH)4 and their differences have been described in detail (19Huminicki D.M.C. Hawthorne F.C. Kohn M.L. Rakovan J. Hughes J.M. Phosphates, Geochemical, Geobiological, and Materials Importance. Vol. 48. The Mineralogical Society of America, Washington, D.C.2002: 123-135Crossref Google Scholar). However, in the absence of direct structural analysis of the interaction of their surfaces with adenosine and formamide, no correlation between differential crystal structure and differential phosphorylation activity is possible. Hydroxylapatite, analyzed as for the Class 3 minerals, showed an intermediate behavior (Fig. 5): moderate production of 5′-AMP with 2.5% at 580 h on the mineral, 1.0% with the solute fraction; minor production of 3′-AMP; no release by pyrophosphate wash; and enhancement of the β-glycosidic bond cleavage (8% after 580 h) with fast degradation (data not shown) of adenosine. Typical catalyst behavior was observed for the non-phosphate mineral Malachite Cu 2+2(CO3)(OH)2. At 24 h in the presence of added KH2PO4 (assays as in Fig. 1), the yield of 5′-AMP was 7% and that of 3′-AMP was 4.2%. A consistent formation of the 2′:3′-cyclic AMP was observed at later times (2.7% at 130 h). Overall degradation started at ∼200 h (data not shown). In conclusion, Class 1 and 2 crystal minerals are intrinsically very stable and release, upon the treatments we describe, no or limited amounts of phosphate, respectively. Class 3 are all copper phosphate minerals, with the exception of hydroxylapatite. Interestingly, these compounds are chemically very similar (and in one case identical), yet their crystallographic structure and their behavior in phosphorylation differ. These minerals do at the same time release phosphate and copper ions, as shown by the intense blue coloration of the solution. Copper ions can act as catalysts in the phosphorylation reactions: the phosphorylation of a variety of sugars and structurally related compounds is catalyzed by copper salts (16Jones R. Burt J.R. Analyst. 1960; 85: 810-814Crossref Google Scholar), and copper ions interact with the phosphate moiety activating it toward nucleophilic additions (17Scheller-Krattiger V. Sigel H. Inorganic Chemistry. 1986; 25: 2628-2634Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, copper ions are involved in the nucleoside phosphorylation activity of enzymes as purine nucleoside phosphorylase, a key enzyme in the purine-salvage pathway (18Grenha R. Levdikov V.M. Fogg M.J. Blagova E.V. Brannigan J.A. Wilkinson A.J. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystalliz. Comm. 2005; 61: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In two selected minerals, Hureaulite and Pseudomalachite, the variation of concentration of the mineral (1, 2, and 4×) did not cause variation of the slope or of the yield of 5′-AMP (the only recovered product), suggesting that the concentration of the phosphate source is not a crucial parameter for the reaction. These data are confirmed by the analysis of phosphorylation performed with Libethenite, the most efficient mineral in the phosphorylation process, and with Cornetite. In these instances, in the conversion range studied (6 and 2% conversion of substrate, respectively, after more than 20 days) a linear regression is observed, in agreement with a “zero order” kinetics, independent of the concentration of reagents. The synthesis of non-ionic backbones and the evaluation of their possible biological relevance have been the focus of major efforts, beginning with the pioneering observations by Pitha (20Pitha J. Pitha P.M. Ts'o P.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 204: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Schneider and Benner (21Schneider K.C. Benner S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 453-455Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but concentrated mostly in the last decade (22Benner S.A. Sismour A.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, two properties of anionic polymers are difficult to surrogate: the avoidance of complex folding and the possibility to replace their variable components (i.e. the nucleic bases) without losing the dominant genetic character. Why nature chose phosphate has been clearly defined (23Westheimer F.H. Science. 1987; 235: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). The series of the phosphate negative charges keeps the linear molecule unfolded, facilitating its replication. Given the intrinsic instability of a pre-genetic polymer, replication is largely equivalent to survival. Thus, despite the numerous interesting results on non-phosphate backbones (22Benner S.A. Sismour A.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 24Bean H.D. Anet F.A. Gould I.R. Hud N.V. Origins Life Evol.

Science. 1991; 254: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of nucleosides and their subsequent polymerization into phosphodiester chains, as exists today, should be considered an ab initio Darwinian success in genetic evolution, hence the interest of prebiotic spontaneous phosphorylation processes. Here we have described the phosphorylation of nucleosides in abiotic conditions, carried out by numerous phosphate minerals in formamide. Minerals and their surfaces have long been examined for the roles that they play in the synthesis of polymers. For instance, mineral surfaces have been suggested to provide substrates to support the catalytic assembly of organic and biochemical molecules (26Hartman H. Origins Life Evol.

Their possible active role in origin-of-life processes was soon pointed out (28Cairns-Smith A.G. J. Theor. Biol. 1966; 10: 53-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and mineral theories for the origin of informational polymers were elaborated (i.e. as exemplified by the iron sulfide system 29Cairns-Smith A.G.

The recruitment of many PH domains is controlled through production and turnover of their membrane ligand, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ). We show that phosphorylation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) into inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP 4 ) establishes another mode of PH domain regulation through a soluble ligand. At physiological concentrations, IP 4 promoted PH domain binding to PIP 3 . In primary mouse CD4 + CD8 + thymocytes, this was required for full activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Itk after T cell receptor engagement. Our data suggest that IP 4 establishes a feedback loop of phospholipase C–γ1 activation through Itk that is essential for T cell development."

Biochem. 2002; 269: 6195-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that the undecapeptide plays an important role in mediating the interaction of the CDCs with the cholesterol-rich membrane surface. Sekino-Suzuki et al. (20Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K.I. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) also showed that mutation of the conserved tryptophan residues in the undecapeptide significantly decreased its affinity for cholesterol-rich erythrocyte membranes. Interestingly, even though the monomers bound at a decreased rate, they still formed the typical doughnut-shaped oligomeric complexes. However, these complexes did not form pores. Instead, these mutants appeared to be trapped in the prepore structure that forms prior to the insertion of the transmembrane β-barrel pore (4Hotze E.M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W.

Yet it was not possible to isolate and study specific contributions of the undecapeptide to various stages of the CDC pore-forming mechanism because modifications of the undecapeptide sequence typically also affected the binding of most CDCs to the membrane. ILY shares most of the above properties with other members of the CDC family but differs from those CDCs in two respects: first, ILY is specific for human cells because it binds only to human CD59 (huCD59) (23Giddings K.S. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar); second, ILY contains a variant undecapeptide (GATGLAWEPWR) (compare to the consensus sequence (ECTGLAWEWWR)). The evolution of ILY specificity for huCD59 required at least two structural changes: first, structural alterations in the undecapeptide were necessary to prevent the binding of ILY directly to cholesterol-rich membranes; second, mutations in D4, but not the undecapeptide, were necessary to provide the binding site for huCD59 (2Polekhina G.

These observations suggested the ability of ILY to bind huCD59 functionally replaced the role of the undecapeptide and D4 loops in membrane binding and anchoring the toxin to the cell surface. Are the D4 loops and undecapeptide of ILY still important to the cytolytic mechanism of ILY? Apparently yes, since Polekhina et al. (2Polekhina G. Giddings K.S. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown that mutations within the ILY undecapeptide have a dramatic affect on the cytolytic mechanism of ILY. Furthermore, mutation of ILY Trp-491 to alanine resulted in a mutant that was defective in prepore to pore conversion. This observation suggested the ILY undecapeptide is important for pore formation, even though it is not required for the binding of ILY to the cell surface. In this study we have performed a detailed examination of the contributions of the D4 loops to the cytolytic mechanism of ILY. Our studies revealed that the D4 loops of ILY are critical for pore formation and that each polypeptide segment is required for the proper progression of ILY through specific stages of oligomer assembly and pore formation. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Chemicals—The gene for ILY was cloned into pTrcHisA (Invitrogen) as described previously (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). ILYH242C (cysteine-containing derivative) is similar in activity to native ILY but contains a single engineered cysteine at residue His-242, which is used for site-specific labeling with various sulfhydryl-specific probes. All other mutations that were introduced into ILY were made in the cysteine-less native ILY background unless otherwise stated. All chemicals and enzymes were obtained from Sigma, VWR, and Research Organics except where noted. All fluorescent probes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Generation and Purification of ILY and Its Derivatives—Various amino acid substitutions in the gene for ILY were generated by PCR QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) and each derivative sequenced (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Core DNA sequencing facility). The expression and purification of recombinant His-tagged ILY and its derivatives from Escherichia coli were carried out as described (12Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) with the following differences. The crude protein lysate was loaded onto a cobalt loaded metal chelate column (GE Healthcare) and washed with 30 ml of buffer A (10 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). The column was then washed with a 20-120 mm gradient of imidazole (in buffer A) in a total volume of 40 ml. The histidine-tagged protein was eluted from the column with 36 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole. The cationic exchange step was not performed. The eluted protein was dialyzed into buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) overnight at 4 °C. The toxin was then stored in 5 mm dithiothreitol and 10% (v/v) sterile glycerol at -80 °C until used. To determine whether the mutants displayed any structural changes due to the mutations, each was subjected to trypsin digestion and the proteolytic cleavage pattern compared with that of wild type ILY. Wild type and mutant ILY (90 pmol) were incubated with serial 10-fold dilutions from 800 pM to 80 fM trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation the digest was denatured by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie R-250. Peptide cleavage patterns were then compared with wild type. All mutants used in the present study exhibited identical cleavage patterns to native ILY. Hemolytic Activity—The hemolytic activity of each labeled or unlabeled ILY derivative on human red blood cells (hRBCs) was determined as described previously (12Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The HD50 is defined as the concentration of toxin required to lyse 50% of the hRBCs. Modification of ILY with Fluorescent Probes—The labeling of ILY cysteine-containing mutants with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe iodoacetamido-N,N′-dimethyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl)ethylene diamine (NBD; Molecular Probes) via the sulfhydryl was carried out as described previously (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The dye-labeled protein samples were made 10% (v/v) in sterile glycerol, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Proteins were typically labeled at an efficiency of 60-100%. Human Erythrocyte Ghost Membrane Preparation and Doxyl Stearate Incorporation—Human erythrocyte ghost membranes were prepared and quantified for protein content as described (12Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For the collisional quenching experiments, 5- and 16-doxyl-stearic acid was prepared by dissolving the doxyl compounds in MeOH to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. A stock of 5- and 16-doxyl-stearic acid at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) was made. The hRBC ghost membranes were equilibrated with 200 μg of probe/1 mg of ghost membrane protein. The stearic acid quencher was allowed to partition into the membrane at room temperature for 1 h with periodic mixing (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed of unincorporated probe. Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorescence intensity measurements were performed using an SLM-8100 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter as described previously (12Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 540 nm were used for NBD with a bandpass of 4 nm. Emission scans from 500 to 600 nm for each sample were carried out at a resolution of 1 nm with an integration time of 1 s. Samples containing 180 pmol of total toxin were incubated with hRBC ghost membranes (equivalent to 303.25 μg of membrane protein) or hRBC ghost membranes incorporated with doxyl-stearic acid in PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl (pH 7.5)) at 37 °C for 5-10 min before making spectral measurements. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was used to detect the intermolecular interaction of ILY monomers on the membrane surface of hRBCs by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as described previously (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, ILY or derivatives thereof were labeled via cysteine-substituted Asp-66 in domain 1 of ILY. ILY was then modified via the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (donor dye (D)) or tetramethylrhodamine (acceptor dye (A)). Approximately 1 × 106 hRBCs were incubated with 18 pmol of total toxin for 30 min on ice. Total toxin is defined as a 1:1 molar ratio of donor-labeled (D) and unlabeled (U) toxin or donor-labeled and acceptor (A)-labeled toxin. The mixtures were analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center) and FLOWJO software (Treestar). Changes in the donor fluorescence due to FRET with the acceptor were determined by comparing donor emission intensity in the presence of unlabeled toxin (D + U) to that of donor emission intensity in the presence of acceptor-labeled toxin (D + A). SDS-Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (AGE) and Immunoblot Analyses—Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (12Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14563-14574Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, toxin (250 ng) was incubated alone or with hRBCs (1.5 × 106 cells) for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were solubilized with SDS sample buffer (without heating) and then the monomeric and oligomeric complexes were resolved on a 1.5% SDS-AGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Protein bands were recognized by rabbit anti-ILY antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) and autoradiography. The ILY L1-L3 Loops Insert into the Membrane—We previously showed the loops L1, L2, and L3 of PFO insert into the membrane surface and proposed that these loops, along with the undecapeptide of PFO, formed a binding site that recognized and inserted into cholesterol-rich membranes, thereby anchoring PFO to the membrane surface (15Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827PubMed Google Scholar). However, since ILY binding to the membrane surface is mediated by an interaction with huCD59 (23Giddings K.S. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the nature and extent of ILY D4 loop insertion into the bilayer was unknown. To assess D4 loop insertion into the membrane, a unique cysteine residue was substituted for residues Leu-518, Ala-428, and Ala-464 located, respectively, in loops L1, L2, and L3 of native ILY (Fig. 1). These residues are conserved in both ILY and PFO and have been shown in PFO to insert into the membrane surface (15Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827PubMed Google Scholar). Each cysteine-substituted mutant was derivatized with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe, NBD. Hemolytic activity of either the cysteine-substituted mutants or their NBD modified forms was similar to native ILY (data not shown). Since NBD emission intensity and lifetime are very different in aqueous and nonaqueous environments, we have frequently used this dye to determine whether the residue to which the dye is attached is exposed to an aqueous milieu or to the nonpolar environment of the membrane bilayer (4Hotze E.M.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When a single probe was positioned in each of the three D4 loops of native ILY, a significant increase in emission intensity was observed upon addition of hRBC ghost membranes (Fig. 2, left panels). The presence of the probe in the hRBC membrane was confirmed by the introduction of a membrane-restricted collisional quencher (a mixture of 5- and 16-doxyl-stearic acid quenched the NBD fluorescence (data not shown). This result is similar to that previously observed for PFO (15Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 823-827PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that L1-L3 of ILY insert into the membrane, suggesting that ILY binding to the cell surface is not solely stabilized by ILY binding to huCD59. L1-L3 Insertion Does Not Occur in the ILYW491A Undecapeptide Mutant—Previous studies have shown that the ILY undecapeptide is involved in prepore to pore conversion (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether this mutation affected the insertion of the L1-L3 loops. The same studies as shown in Fig. 2(left panels) were repeated, but in the background of the ILYW491A mutation (Fig. 2, right panels). In stark contrast to native ILY, the presence of the W491A mutation abolished the membrane insertion of L1-L3, even though ILY still binds to the membrane surface via huCD59 (data not shown and Ref. 25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Since this mutation of Trp-491 prevents the insertion of the neighboring D4 loops, it appears the structural state of the undecapeptide dictates whether L1-L3 insert into the membrane. Mutation of Loops L1-L3 Disrupts Pore Forming Activity—We next determined whether mutations in loops L1, L2, and/or L3 would prevent pore formation. Individual mutants were generated in which an aspartate was substituted for residues Leu-518, Ala-428, or Ala-464, which reside in loops L1, L2, and L3, respectively, in native ILY. Charged aspartate is rarely found in the bilayer, and most aspartate carboxylates are deprotonated at pH 7.4 (pKa 3.7). Hence, one would predict that an Asp in a loop would inhibit its insertion into the membrane. The substitution of a single aspartate into each of the L1, L2, and L3 loops reduced ILY cytolytic activity by >98% (Table 1). The introduction of a charged group for each loop did not prevent binding of the toxin to the cell surface via its receptor, as determined by flow cytometry (shown below in the section entitled “FRET-detected monomer-monomer association”). Also, the insertion of the undecapeptide of ILYA464D could not occur if the toxin was not bound to the cell surface (shown below in the section entitled “Membrane insertion of the undecapeptide is required for prepore oligomer formation”).TABLE 1Hemolytic activity of ILY D4 aspartate loop mutants The HD50 (hemolytic dose for 50% lysis) was determined for native ILY and the D4 loop mutants. Shown is the relative hemolytic activity of each mutant compared with native toxin.Hemolytic activityCDC% native ILYILY100ILYW491A0.3ILYA428D0.1ILYA464D1.3ILYL518D0.3 Open table in a new tab Membrane Insertion of the D4 Loops Is Coordinated—The above analyses demonstrated that a dramatic decrease in hemolytic activity occurred if residues Leu-518, Ala-428, and Ala-464 were substituted with aspartate. Since a single aspartate mutation in any single loop blocked pore formation, it is possible that all three loops insert coordinately. Furthermore, having two of three loops intact cannot overcome the disruption of the other loop by mutation. This interdependency suggests that the insertion of the loops is coupled and possibly cooperative. We therefore determined whether an aspartate substitution in one loop interfered with the membrane insertion of the other two loops. Experimentally, one loop residue was substituted with an aspartate to prevent its insertion. A cysteine residue was then introduced into one of the other two D4 loops and labeled with NBD, and its insertion into the membrane was assessed spectroscopically. For example, two double mutants, ILYL518D/A428C-NBD and ILYL518D/A464C-NBD, were generated so that the insertion (or not) of loops L2 and L3 (containing cysteine substituted Ala-428 or Ala-464) could be detected in the presence of the Leu-518 to aspartate mutation. The membrane-dependent change in the fluorescence intensity of each double mutant was then compared with that of a mutant lacking an aspartate substitution (e.g. ILYA428C-NBD or ILYA464C-NBD; Fig. 2). The results in Fig. 3 show that if the L518D mutation is present, the insertion of L2 and L3 does not occur. The same results were obtained for the ILYA428D and ILYA464D double mutants (Fig. 3). Hence, by disrupting the insertion of one loop the insertion of all loops is prevented. Since the effect of the aspartate substitutions was the same when these experiments were repeated in high salt (0.5 m NaCl) (data not shown), an electrostatic repulsion between an Asp and negative charges at the surface does not appear to be a major factor in preventing insertion of the loop residues. Instead, it seems most likely that an Asp-containing loop is not exposed to the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer because of the energetic difficulty of inserting a charged carboxyl group into a non-aqueous nonpolar milieu. Since blocking the insertion of one loop prevents the insertion of the other loop residues, loop insertion is apparently coupled and coordinated conformationally. This also extends to the undecapeptide loop because the insertion of L1, L2, or L3 is blocked by the undecapeptide ILYW491A mutation. The insertion of all four loops at the tip of D4 therefore appears to be coupled. The D4 Loop Mutants Are Conformationally Prepared for Oligomerization—A key structural change that prepares the CDCs for oligomerization is the movement of one β-strand (β5) away from another (β4) in the core β-sheet of domain 3 (D3). This conformational change occurs more than 60 Å above the membrane surface (16Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7139-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but is triggered by interaction of the tip of D4 with the membrane (28Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When β5 disengages from β4, interstrand hydrogen bond formation can occur between β1 and β4 of adjacent monomers, thus initiating oligomer formation. We have previously shown that an NBD probe located at the cysteine-substituted Val-322 in β4 of PFO is buried under β5 in the soluble monomer (28Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Upon binding to a membrane, this residue is exposed to the aqueous environment and the fluorescence emission of the NBD is quenched by water. NBD at this site therefore detects the exposure of β4 and its availability for oligomerization. To determine whether β5 was moving away from β 4 in the various mutants, we introduced a cysteine for Val-349 (analogous to Val-322 in PFO) in native and mutant ILY and then labeled each with NBD. When each of these proteins bound to the membrane, the extent of NBD quenching was nearly identical (Fig. 4). Thus, the conformational change required for monomer oligomerization was not affected by mutations that block the insertion of the D4 loops. Receptor binding alone is therefore sufficient to trigger this conformational change in ILY, preparing the ILY toxin monomers for oligomerization. Mutation of the D4 Loops of ILY Affect Both Oligomer Assembly and Prepore-to-Pore Conversion—Since monomer binding to the receptor primes ILY for oligomerization via β4 exposure, we next examined whether the insertion of the D4 loops was necessary for oligomerization. SDS-AGE was used to detect the formation of the SDS-resistant prepore oligomer (5Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for each D4 loop mutant on hRBCs (Fig. 5). An SDS-resistant prepore complex was formed by ILYA464D and ILYW491A, whereas SDS-resistant prepores were not detected for ILYA428D and were barely detected for ILYL518D. Thus, the ILYA428D and ILYL518D mutations affected assembly of the oligomer, while the ILYA464D and ILYW491A mutation blocked the conversion of the prepore to pore (cf. Table 1). FRET-detected Monomer-Monomer Association—Since ILYA428D and ILYL518D may form an oligomer that is sensitive to SDS, we determined whether ILY monomers associate using FRET on intact hRBCs. This is a non-destructive approach for evaluating the proximity of CDC monomers to each other (29Harris R.W. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6936-6941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously developed a flow cytometry-based FRET assay to measure monomer-monomer association on intact hRBCs (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and here use the same approach to determine whether the monomers of native ILY and the various mutants associated on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 6, native ILY, ILYW491A, and ILYA464D exhibited donor quenching due to FRET, as expected from the data in Fig. 5, whereas ILYA428D and ILYL518D did not exhibit detectable FRET. Hence, receptor-bound monomers of ILYA428D and ILYL518D do not form appreciable levels of either SDS-resistant or SDS-sensitive oligomer on the membrane surface. Membrane Insertion of the Undecapeptide Is Required for Prepore Oligomer Formation—The above studies show that two classes of D4 loop mutants exist: mutation of Trp-491 to alanine or Ala-464 to aspartate blocks the prepore to pore transition, whereas mutation of either Ala-428 or Leu-518 to aspartate blocks formation of the prepore oligomer. In all cases, the insertion of L1, L2, and L3 was blocked by the mutations. The structural basis for these two phenotypic effects was therefore not due to the insertion state of L1, L2, L3. However, the insertion state of the undecapeptide in the L1, L2, and L3 mutants had not been resolved. We therefore determined whether the undecapeptide inserted into the membrane for each mutant and native ILY. The membrane insertion of the undecapeptide was monitored by introducing a cysteine residue for Ala-486 of the undecapeptide, modifying it with NBD, and assessing if its emission intensity increased (i.e. entered a nonpolar environment). As shown in Fig. 7, the NBD emission intensity increased significantly when ILYA486C-NBD was incubated with hRBC ghost membranes. The introduction of the membrane-restricted collisional quencher, doxyl-stearic acid, into the membrane (25Giddings K.S. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11315-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) significantly quenched NBD fluorescence, confirming its membrane location (Fig. 7, inset). Similar results were observed for the ILYW491A and ILYA464D mutants. In contrast, no change in the NBD emission was observed for ILYA428D and ILYL518D. Hence, membrane insertion of the undecapeptide correlates with prepore oligomer formation, while insertion of the L1-L3 loops correlates with prepore to pore conversion. Most CDCs are thought to bind to the cell surface via cholesterol-rich domains (reviewed in (30Alouf J.E. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)), and this interaction is mediated by the short hydrophobic loops and the undecapeptide at the tip of domain 4 (6Heuck A.P. Hotze E. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Ramachandran R. Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct.

Mitsui K.I. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ILY is unlike most CDCs in that it specifically binds to huCD59 and does not bind to cholesterol-rich cell membranes in the absence of huCD59 (23Giddings K.S. Zhao J. Sims P.J. Tweten R.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 12: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not clear whether the D4 loops, which bind and anchor PFO to the cholesterol-rich membrane surface, were still required for ILY pore formation. Here we have shown that receptor binding by ILY localizes it on the cell surface and triggers the structural change in D3 required for oligomerization. These steps, however, are not sufficient to generate a functional pore. Membrane insertion of the D4 loops also must occur to assemble and form a functional membrane oligomer and pore. Therefore the D4 loops appear to be involved in the pore forming mechanism of all CDCs. Since binding to a protein receptor localizes ILY at the membrane surface, the D4 loops of ILY are not required for membrane recognition and binding, as is the case with other CDCs. The exposure of β4 in ILY D3, which is necessary for the oligomerization of membrane bound monomers (28Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), did not require the membrane insertion of the D4 loops. ILY binding to huCD59 was sufficient to trigger the disengagement of β5 from β4, thereby making the receptor-bound monomers available for oligomerization via the interaction of β1 and β4 of adjacent monomers. However, subsequent steps in pore formation, the assembly of the prepore oligomer and conversion of the prepore complex to a functional pore, were accompanied by the insertion of ILY D4 loops. ILY molecules mutated in the undecapeptide or in L3 could oligomerize into an SDS-resistant prepore complex but could not make the structural transition to a functional pore. Mutations in either L1 or L2 blocked association of the receptor-bound ILY molecules and the formation of the prepore complex. These two classes of mutants therefore exhibited two distinct phenotypes affecting two major steps in pore formation. Interestingly, these two phenotypes differ in the extent of undecapeptide insertion into the membrane. In the mutants that formed little or no oligomer (ILYA428D and ILYL518D), perhaps because β5 did not move sufficiently far from β4 in these two mutants, neither the undecapeptide nor the D4 loops inserted into the membrane. In contrast, in mutants that oligomerized into a SDS-resistant prepore complex (ILYW491A and ILYA464D), the undecapeptide, but not L1-L3, inserted into the membrane. Thus the formation of an SDS-stable oligomer was accompanied by the insertion of the undecapeptide into the membrane, but this structural change was not sufficient to effect pore formation. Pore formation only occurs if L1, L2, and L3 are also exposed to the nonpolar core of the bilayer. A possible mechanism for L1-L3 and undecapeptide involvement in oligomer assembly and prepore to pore conversion is revealed by studies with PFO. Following oligomerization of PFO monomers into a prepore complex, the cooperative (or concerted) membrane insertion of two D3 amphipathic β-hairpins per monomer occurs to form a transmembrane β-barrel (4Hotze E.M.

The formation of in-register hydrogen bonds between β1 of one PFO monomer and β4 (Fig. 1) of an adjacent monomer is critical for the membrane insertion of these two β-hairpins (10Hotze E.M.

Mutations in PFO β1 or β4 that alter the correct pairing of the hydrogen bonds between these strands blocks the prepore to pore conversion of PFO (10Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z.

Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The prepore oligomer can apparently tolerate a fraction of incorrectly paired hydrogen bonds between β1 and β4 (10Hotze E.M.

However, if the fraction of monomers with incorrectly paired hydrogen bonds exceeds a certain threshold, the prepore cannot make the transition to the pore (10Hotze E.M. Heuck A.P. Czajkowsky D.M. Shao Z. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11597-11605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These combined data suggest that membrane insertion of the D4 loops (L1-L3 and the undecapeptide) may play a role in properly orienting the monomers at the membrane surface, thereby increasing the probability of correctly pairing hydrogen bonds between β1 and β4 of adjacent monomers. If this model is correct, the ILY mutants that lack all D4 loop contacts with the membrane surface presumably fail to oligomerize because the probability is low that two monomers bound only to the receptor will contact each other in such a way that allows β1-β4 hydrogen bonding. The membrane insertion of the undecapeptide presumably stabilizes the monomer on the membrane sufficiently so that ILY monomers can form inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between β1 and β4. Although intermolecular hydrogen bonds can form, the extent of out-of-register hydrogen bonding may be sufficiently high to prevent the prepore to pore transition. In this scenario, ILY is then correctly oriented at the membrane only by simultaneous interactions with huCD59, L1, L2, L3, and undecapeptide that allow adjacent monomers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the proper register to spontaneously generate a transmembrane β-barrel. At this point, we do not know whether the interactions of the D4 loops with the bilayer actively trigger the transitions of ILY from one state to another in pore formation. It is also possible that D4 loop insertion into the membrane is a passive or secondary result of other structural changes elsewhere in ILY. However, given both the active recognition and binding of most CDCs to membrane surfaces via D4 (6Heuck A.P. Hotze E. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Mol.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the insertion of the D4 loops into the bilayer is required for oligomerization and actively triggers the insertion of the β-hairpins into the bilayer. In summary, ILY has diverged from the other CDCs by taking advantage of a protein-protein interaction to effect membrane targeting. However, our data suggest that many of the interactions required for pore formation have been retained, including the requirement for specific D4 loop interactions with the membrane to promote oligomerization and pore formation."

We demonstrated previously that, in response to growth factor platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB stimulation, p68 is phosphorylated at Tyr593, and the phosphorylation of p68 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition via promoting β-catenin nuclear translocation (Yang, L., Lin, C., and Liu, Z.

The PDGFRs are prototypical receptor tyrosine kinases (6Perona R. Clin. Transl. Oncol. 2006; 8: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The receptor dimer interacts with a number of Src homology domain 2-containing proteins that are connected to various cellular signal transduction pathways, such as phospholipase Cγ, Ras GTPase-active protein, and Src family tyrosine kinases (7DeMali K.A.

Abnormally high levels of PDGF or PDGFR activity are also associated with cancer progression, including invasive gastric carcinomas and gliomas (13Shih A.H. Holland E.C.

The molecular mechanism by which PDGF stimulates cell proliferation is not well understood. Recent works have demonstrated that c-Abl plays a role in cellular response to PDGF stimulation. PDGF stimulation activates the membrane pool of c-Abl mediated by Src family of kinases in fibroblast cells. The activation of c-Abl consequently leads to c-Myc expression and DNA synthesis in cells (19Furstoss O. Dorey K. Simon V. Barila D. Superti-Furga G. Roche S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which is important for mitogenesis. It has also been suggested that the same signaling cascade promotes cell morphology changes (20Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M.

Because of the important role in tumor progression, PDGFR and the PDGF autocrine loop are important targets for designing the anticancer therapies. However, efforts are impeded by the limited knowledge about the functions of the PDGF autocrine loop in tumor progression at the molecular level.

We show here that tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 at Tyr593 also mediates the effects of PDGF in stimulating cell proliferation. The phosphorylated p68 promotes cell proliferation by activating the transcription of cyclin D1 and c-Myc genes. We show that the ATPase/helicase activities of p68 are required for the activation of cyclin D1 transcription. The phospho-p68 participates in the complex assembled at the cyclin D1 and c-Myc promoters, which strongly suggests a direct role in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the phosphorylation of p68 at Tyr593 is required for the effects of the PDGF autocrine, suggesting an important role for p68 phosphorylation in cell proliferation. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant PDGF-BB and Wnt-1 were purchased from PeproTech. Both polyclonal antibody PAbp68 and monoclonal antibody p68-rgg against human p68 were raised against bacterially expressed His-tagged C-terminal domain of p68 (Invitrogen). Commercial antibodies used in this study were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (p-Tyr-100, against phosphotyrosine; DCS6, against cyclin D1; c-Myc; Lamin A/C; and 27E8, against His-tag ChIP grade), Calbiochem (7A7 and 9G10, against β-catenin at amino acids 35–50; and core armadillo repeats, respectively), Chemicon (6C5, against GAPDH), Covance Research (HA.11, against HA tag), Roche Applied Science (12CA5, against HA tag ChIP grade), and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (8E4, against β-catenin). Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfection—Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, Human T98G, A549, HCT-116, A549, HEK, and U-2OS cells were purchased from ATCC and grown by following vendor's instructions. DNA plasmid transfection was performed using FuGENE HD transfection kit (Roche Applied Science). The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the siRNA experiment, the cells were grown to 50% confluence and transfected with siRNA (200 pmol of RNA duplex) using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The duplex RNA oligonucleotides for RNAi were purchased from Dharmacon siGENOME™. The siRNA oligonucleotides against p68 RNA helicase (Sense sequence, GCAAGUAGCUGCUGAAUAUUU; antisense sequence, 5′-pAUAUUCAGCAGCUACUUGCUU). For co-transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNA 24 h after the siRNA transfection and harvested an additional 48 h later. The HA-tagged p68 expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning of wt p68 full-length cDNA (75Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) into pHM6 vector (Roche Applied Science). The various p68 mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid for luciferase reporter of the cyclin D1 promoter (CD1(-962)luc) and its TCF-binding site mutant (TCF1–4mt) were provided by Dr. Osamu Tetsu and Frank McCormick (57Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). Subcellular Extracts Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analyses—All of the nuclear extracts, cytoplasm, or whole cell extracts were made freshly after appropriate treatments (indicated in figures) using nuclear extraction, cytoplasm, and cell extract kits (Qiagen). The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, lysates or extracts were mixed with antibodies (1 μg) and incubated for 2 h followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein G plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation for an additional 2 h at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Upstate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and boiled in loading buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoblottings were performed via standard procedures and visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate detection system (Pierce). Luciferase Reporter and Cell Proliferation Assays—Before the cells were appropriately treated (indicated in figures), the cells were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid and 0.01 μg of pRL null, which expresses Renilla luciferase from Renilla reniformis as an internal control. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3-β-galactosidase. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega). The data are represented as firefly luciferase activity normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. For analyses of cell proliferation, a cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) that measures BrdUrd incorporation was used. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 18 h in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd under different conditions (indicated in figures). The cells were fixed after incubation and washed three times. The fixed cells were detected by anti-BrdUrd-POD antibody and secondary antibody. The nuclei incorporations of BrdUrd were measured by chemiluminescence emission (Victor 3TM; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The ChIP experiments were performed using a ChIP-IT™ kit (Activemotif). The cells were treated as indicated in the figures. The precipitation of cyclin D1 promoter by the indicated antibodies was determined by PCR using primers spanning the TCF-binding sites (nucleotides –190 to +57) (sense, 5′-CTATGAAAACCGGACTACAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTCTGCAGTAGGGGAG-3′) or non-TCF-binding site (nucleotides –550 to –300) (sense, 5′-AATGAAAATGAAAGAAGATGCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTCTGCAGTAGGGGAC-3′). Precipitation of the c-Myc promoter was detected using PCR primers spanning the TCF-binding sites (nucleotides –1160 to –580) (sense, 5′-AGTTAACGGTTTTTTCACAAGG-3′; antisense, 5′-ATAACCCAGCAACGCATTGC-3′). TFIIB antibody and mouse IgG were included in the kit as positive/negative controls. The primers for the TFIIB-binding site at GAPDH promoter (sense, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′; antisense, 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′) were provided by the vendor. The control ChIP experiments gave a 166-bp band. Protein Delivery—The recombinant proteins or antibodies (indicated) were delivered into HT-29 cells using the Chariot protein delivery kit (Active motif). Briefly, 1 μg of protein (in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) was mixed with 6 μl of Chariot (in 100 μl of H2O). The mixture was incubated at room temperature to allow complex to form. The cells were washed with serum-free medium. The Chariot·protein complex was added to the cells with an additional 400 μl of serum free medium. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow for protein internalization. The Phospho-p68 Up-regulates Cyclin D1 and c-Myc and Promotes Cell Proliferation upon PDGF Stimulation—We previously reported that p68 RNA helicase became phosphorylated at Tyr593 in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells by c-Abl upon PDGF-BB treatment. The phospho-p68 promotes EMT by facilitating β-catenin nuclear translocation (54Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Cell. 2006; 127: 139-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We noted in our studies that the cell growth rate appeared to be dramatically increased upon PDGF treatment (data not shown). To test whether the phospho-p68 also mediates the effects of PDGF in stimulating cell proliferation, we carried out cell proliferation assays using a commercially available cell proliferation kit that measures the incorporation of BrdUrd into cellular DNA in the proliferated cells. The endogenous p68 RNA helicase was knocked down by RNAi. The p68 wt or Y593F mutant was transiently expressed in the p68 knockdown cells by mutating four nucleotides within the RNAi targeted sequence in the p68 expression vector (54Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Cell. 2006; 127: 139-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The mutations did not change the amino acid sequence of p68. Cell proliferation assays showed that HT-29 cells proliferated under treatment of PDGF without p68 knockdown. The PDGF-stimulated proliferation of the cells was largely inhibited by p68 knockdown. The inhibitory effects were relieved by transient expression of wild type p68. In fact, the cells proliferated even more quickly under exogenous expression of wt p68 (Fig. 1A). However, the cells demonstrated a much lower level of BrdUrd incorporation if the Y593F mutant was transiently expressed compared with that in the cells where p68 wild type was expressed (Fig. 1A). Thus, it is clear that phosphorylation of p68 at Tyr593 mediates the effects of PDGF in stimulating cell proliferation. Our previous data demonstrated that the phospho-p68 promoted β-catenin nuclear translocation (54Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Cell. 2006; 127: 139-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two of the immediate downstream targets of nuclear β-catenin in complex with LEF/TCF are cyclin D1 and c-Myc genes. Substantial evidence suggests that elevated cellular levels of cyclin D1 and c-Myc often lead to cell proliferation (55Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 56Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the nuclear translocation of β-catenin promoted by the phospho-p68 affected cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression. We carried out immunoblotting experiments with cell extracts made from PDGF-treated/untreated HT-29 cells using commercially available antibodies against cyclin D1 and c-Myc. It was evident that the cellular levels of both cyclin D1 and c-Myc were elevated in HT-29 cells upon PDGF treatments (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effects of Tyr593 phosphorylation of p68 on the expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Knockdown of p68 by RNAi abolished the effects of PDGF on the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression. We then exogenously expressed HA-p68s (wt or Y593F mutant) in the p68 knockdown cells. Expression of wt p68 after RNAi knockdown restored the effects of PDGF on the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression. However, expression of Y593F mutant did not restore the effects of PDGF (Fig. 1C). In fact, the cyclin D1 and c-Myc expressions were further suppressed by the expression of Y593F mutant. These results indicated that phosphorylation of p68 at Tyr593 was required for the elevation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression under the stimulation of PDGF. The Phospho-p68 Up-regulates Cyclin D1 and c-Myc Expression by Activating Transcription of Both Genes—To understand the molecular mechanism by which the phospho-p68 mediated the effects of PDGF in up-regulating the cellular levels of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, we examined whether the phospho-p68 played a role in regulating cyclin D1 transcription. We employed luciferase assays using a transcription template that fused a luciferase gene with a cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 2A) (57Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). It was clear that transcription activity of the cyclin D1 promoter was over 7-fold increased under PDGF treatment (Fig. 2A). The timing of activation of cyclin D1 transcription correlated with the β-catenin nucleus translocation (data not shown). Knockdown of p68 RNA helicase by RNAi repressed cyclin D1 transcription and completely diminished activation of cyclin D1 transcription by PDGF treatment (Fig. 2A). The transcription activation of cyclin D1 under PDGF stimulation could be restored by transient expression of wild type p68 after RNAi knockdown but not by expression of p68 Y593F mutant (Fig. 2A). In fact, the transcription activity of the cyclin D1 promoter was increased over 15-fold when the wild type p68 was transiently overexpressed after RNAi knockdown (Fig. 2A, comparing with and without HA-p68 expression under condition of p68 knockdown). The activation of the transcription of cyclin D1 promoter is β-catenin/TCF-specific because the activation was not observed with the mutated cyclin D1 promoter (TCF1–4mt) (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the ATPase activity of p68 was also required for the transcription activation, because the lack of ATPase mutants of p68 (HLIGR and LGLD) (58Lin C. Yang L. Yang J.J. Huang Y. Liu Z.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7484-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) could not activate the transcription of the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the phospho-p68 played a direct role in regulating cyclin D1 transcription, we probed the interaction of p68 with the cyclin D1 promoter by ChIP assay. The exogenously expressed wild type HA-p68 was co-immunoprecipitated with the cyclin D1 promoter as demonstrated by amplification of precipitated DNA fragments by polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 2B). However, the cyclin D1 promoter did not co-precipitate with the HA-Y593F mutant (Fig. 2B). We also carried out the same ChIP experiments with c-Myc promoter. Similarly, the exogenously expressed wild type HA-p68 was co-immunoprecipitated with the c-Myc promoter. The c-Myc promoter did not co-precipitate with the HA-Y593F mutant (Fig. 2C). Taken together, our data demonstrated that phosphorylation of p68 at Tyr593 up-regulates cyclin D1 and c-Myc transcription. The phospho-p68 directly participated in both the cyclin D1 and c-Myc promoters, indicating a direct role in the transcriptional regulation. Both Nuclear Phospho-p68 and β-Catenin Are Required for Activation of Cyclin D1 and c-Myc Transcription—We further asked whether the p68 phosphorylation is sufficient to promote cyclin D1 transcription. To this end, we delivered in vitro phosphorylated (via c-Abl) His-p68 to HT-29 cells using the Chariot protein delivery kit. Most of the His-p68 delivered to HT-29 cells localized to the cell nucleus (54Yang L. Lin C. Liu Z.R. Cell. 2006; 127: 139-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We then measured the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter by luciferase assay. Delivery of unphosphorylated wt p68 to the cells did not result in an increase in the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter. Delivery of the in vitro phosphorylated p68 increased the cyclin D1 promoter activity by over 10-fold (Fig. 3A, comparing β-Gal with WT*). However, delivery of c-Abl-treated Y593F mutant did not lead to an increase in the promoter activity (Fig. 3A). The results suggested that the phospho-p68 is sufficient to promote cyclin D1 transcription. In the Wnt signaling pathway, nuclear β-catenin in complex with LEF/TCF activates cyclin D1 and c-Myc transcription (59Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar, 60Rowlands T.M. Pechenkina I.V. Hatsell S. Cowin P. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1983546040,"Adaptor proteins are important mediators in signal transduction. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel adaptor protein, XB130. This gene is located on human chromosome 10q25.3 and encodes a protein of 818 amino acids. It contains several Src homology (SH)2- and SH3-binding motifs, two pleckstrin homology domains, a coiled-coil region, and a number of potential tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation sites. Endogenous XB130 interacts with c-Src tyrosine kinase. Their co-expression in COS-7 cells resulted in activation of c-Src and elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including XB130 itself. XB130 expression in HEK293 cells enhanced serum response element- and AP-1-dependent transcriptional activation mediated by c-Src. XB130ΔN, an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking a putative SH3-binding motif and several putative SH2-binding sites, reduced its ability to mediate Src signal transduction. Down-regulation of endogenous XB130 with siRNA reduced c-Src activity, IL-8 production, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β, and altered cell cycles in human lung epithelial cells. These data suggest that XB130 as an adaptor may play an important role in the regulation of signal transduction and cellular functions.

These data suggest that XB130 as an adaptor may play an important role in the regulation of signal transduction and cellular functions. Adaptor proteins are a unique group of protein-binding partners that are devoid of enzymatic activity but contain at least two modular domains, through which they link signaling components to form macromolecular complexes and propagate cellular signals (1.Flynn D.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6270-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Depending on the functional role of the interacting partner and the specific biological event that is triggered by these interactions, adaptor proteins can participate in the regulation of different signaling pathways. One of the good examples of how adaptor proteins are involved in signal transduction is the activation of c-Src protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 3The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; UTR, untranslated region; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PH, pleckstrin homology; AFAP, actin filament-associated protein; Sin, Src-interacting/signal-integrating protein; CAS, Crk-associated substrate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH, Src homology; KD, kinase-deficient; SRE, serum response element.3The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; UTR, untranslated region; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PH, pleckstrin homology; AFAP, actin filament-associated protein; Sin, Src-interacting/signal-integrating protein; CAS, Crk-associated substrate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH, Src homology; KD, kinase-deficient; SRE, serum response element. by adaptor proteins via protein-protein interactions. Like other members of the Src PTKs, c-Src contains an N-terminal myristoylation sequence, Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory tail (2.Williams J.C.

The N-terminal region targets c-Src protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. The intramolecular interactions mediated through the SH2 and SH3 domains are thought to maintain the inactivity of c-Src kinase (3.Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain associates with the proline-rich motif between the SH2 and the kinase domains; whereas the SH2 domain binds to a conserved phosphotyrosine residue (Tyr527) catalyzed by another tyrosine kinase, the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) (4.Okada M.

An accumulating number of adaptor proteins, including actin filament-associated protein (AFAP), Src interacting/Signal integrating protein (Sin), and Crk-associated substrate (CAS), have been demonstrated to activate c-Src through coordinated binding of both SH3 and SH2 domains (7.Alexandropoulos K.

During our cloning process of human AFAP (hAFAP), we identified a novel gene and designated it as xb130, because the apparent molecular size of the encoded protein is ∼130 kDa. We further explored its potential roles as an adaptor protein by determine its interaction with c-Src via specific functional domain(s) and motif(s).

The PCR product was digested with EcoR I and XbaI, purified, and ligated into a modified pcDNA3 vector that has a His tag at the C terminus. Mutant XB130 with N-terminal deletion (XB130ΔN) was generated by PCR, using pcDNA3-XB130/His as a template, and 5′-CCG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG GCA TCG AGC TGA TGC GT-3′ and 5′-TCA AGC CTC TCC TTC TCC TCT GTG TAC CG-3′ as the forward and reverse primers. The PCR product was digested and ligated into EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pcDNA3-XB130/His construct. To further determine the specific binding sites between XB130 and Src, we generated six single amino acid mutants in the N terminus of XB130 (see details under supplementary data). The nucleotide sequence of XB130 from all constructs was verified by sequencing analysis. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays−For protein-protein interaction and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation studies in COS-7 cells, Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were transiently transfected at ∼50–80% confluence in serum-free medium for 5 h and then maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 2 days. For the 6-well plate, 1.2 μg of pCMV-c-Src and 0.8 μg of pcDNA3-XB130/His were used, and the empty vector was added to maintain the total DNA at 2 μg per well. For 100-mm Petri dishes, a total of 14 μg of DNA were used for each well. For reporter activation assay, the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method was used. HEK293 cells were transfected in 24-well plates in triplicate, with a total of 2.1 μg of DNA (for 3 well) in 75 μl of 250 mm CaCl2 mixed with 75 μl of 2× HBS buffer (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, and 1.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.05). The constructs used included c-Src or its mutants (0.3 μg), XB130 or its mutants (0.18 μg), either alone or in combination, β-galactosidase (0.15 μg), and a reporter (0.18 μg) (SRE-Luc, AP-1-Luc, NF-kB-Luc, SBE-Luc, or IL-8-Luc). The total amount of DNA was kept constant by addition of pcDNA3 vector. After 15–20 min of incubation at room temperature, 50 μl of the precipitate were added into each well with 0.5 ml of cell culture medium and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were washed and changed to HG-DMEM containing 10% FBS for 40–48 h. In certain experiments, cells were stimulated with EGF (5 or 10 ng/ml) for 8 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the Berthold luminometer (Lumat LB 9507) (Oak Ridge, TN) and normalized for transfection efficiency with β-galactosidase activity. Generation of XB130 Monoclonal Antibody−The coding sequences of XB130 was subcloned into His-tagged prokaryotic expression vector pEQ30 (Qiagen) at EcoRI and XbaI sites and transformed into the Escherichia coli M15 strain. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 100 μm) for 4 h, the recombinant His-tagged XB130 was purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen). BalB/C mice (Charles River Laboratories, St. Constant, Canada) were immunized monthly with 100 μg of recombinant XB130 over a period of three months. Animals were sacrificed. Harvested splenocytes were fused with myeloma cells (Inno Biotech, Toronto, Canada) to generate hybridoma. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to select antibody-expressing hybridoma clones. The subclass of XB130 monoclonal antibody was determined using mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagent (Sigma). The quality of mAbs for Western blotting, immunofluorescent staining, and immunoprecipitation was tested (see supplemental data). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Immunostaining Microscopy−The protocols for preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting have been described previously in detail (18.Han B.

For immunofluorescence staining and microscopy, cells were seeded on 4-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with an anti-His or anti-XB130 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC or Alexa 549 conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1.5 h. Slides were then mounted with an anti-fading reagent (SlowFade, Molecular Probes), and distribution of XB130 proteins was examined by microscopy as described previously (18.Han B. Bai X.H. Lodyga M.

Expression, Purification of GST Fusion Protein, and GST Pull-down Assay−Bacteria expressing GST fusion proteins containing SH2 or SH3 domain from different proteins were cultured in LB broth and induced by 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads from the soluble fraction of sonicated bacterial lysates. Cell lysates expressing His-tagged XB130 or hAFAP were incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on the beads. The precipitates were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, eluted in SDS sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblotting to detect XB130 or hAFAP. Src Kinase Activity Assay−The protocols for Src kinase activity assay has been published (18.Han B. Bai X.H. Lodyga M. Xu J. Yang B.B. Keshavjee S. Post M. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54793-54801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether XB130 can directly activate c-Src, an in vitro reconstitution assay was performed (18.Han B. Bai X.H. Lodyga M. Xu J. Yang B.B. Keshavjee S. Post M. Liu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54793-54801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recombinant XB130 protein (150 ng) was incubated with Csk-inactivated c-Src (20 ng) (a gift from Dr. X. Huang, Cornell University) in Src kinase buffer containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 10 μm ATP. Together with 2 μg of Src substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000Ci/mm), the reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min, and terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated substrate was autoradiographed on x-ray film and quantified by densitometry (GS-690, Bio-Rad). Cytokine Assays−BEAS-2B cells (2 × 105) were seeded on 6-well plates. The next day, DMEM plus 10% FBS (1 ml) with or without Src inhibitors, PP2 (10 μm) or SU6656 (2 μm) (VWR, Mississauga, Canada), was added into each well. Culture medium was collected after 8 h for cytokine measurement. For siRNA transfection, 75 nm of XB130 siRNA or scrambled double-stranded RNA (5′-NNG AAU CCG CUG AUA AGU GAC-3′, Dharmacon Inc, Dallas, TX) was used as we described (18.Han B. Bai X.H. Lodyga M.

Two siRNAs were designed: 1) sequence is 5′-NNG AUU CUU GAC CAG GAG AAC-3′, and 2) is 5′-NNC UAC GAG UCC UAC GAU GAA-3′. The medium containing siRNA was replaced with fresh medium after 72 h. The cell lysate was prepared for Western analysis. IL-8 released into the culture media was determined using ELISA kits from BIOSOURCE, following the manufacturer’s instruction (23.dos Santos C.C. Han B. Andrade C.F. Bai X. Uhlig S. Hubmayr R. Tsang M. Lodyga M. Keshavjee S. Slutsky A.S. Liu M. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 19: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LiquiChip cytokine assay was performed by Host Defense Research Center (Toronto, Canada) to analyze multiple cytokines in the culture media, using a LiquiChip Work station (Qiagen). Cell Cycle Analysis−A549 cells were transfected with 50 nm pooled XB130 siRNAs for 48 h. Cells were subjected to serum starvation overnight and then stimulated with EGF (50 ng/ml) for 2 h. Cells were collected and fixed with 70% EtOH, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with 50 mg/ml propidium iodine for 30 min. Cells from different cell cycle stages were counted by flow cytometer (Coulter FC500, Beckman Coulter). Statistical Analyses−Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments and analyzed by Student’s t test with significance defined as p < 0.05. Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis of XB130−While searching for the human AFAP gene in GenBank™, several human EST clones that share similarities with chicken AFAP were found. One of the clones (GenBank™ accession number: 1154093) contains a partial C-terminal open reading frame and 1.2 kb of 3′-UTR. Following 5′-RACE using mRNA isolated from human lung alveolar epithelial cells as a template, an mRNA transcript with novel nucleotide sequence was obtained (Fig. 1). The canonical start codon, ATG, was identified based on Kozak consensus context (24.Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Sequence structure analysis revealed 23 putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The N-terminal portion of XB130 protein contains one proline-rich motif (PDLPPPKMIP), which is followed by two tyrosine-containing sites (YEEA and YDEE). In addition, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains were identified, which were designated as PH1 and PH2. Following the PH2 domain, there is another tyrosine motif (YDYV). The C-terminal portion of XB130 contains a coiled-coil region that might be important for membrane trafficking or multimerization (25.Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26.Lappin T.R. Mullan R.N. Stewart J.P. Morgan N.A. Thompson A. Maxwell A.P. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2002; 43: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are 27 putative phosphorylation targets for serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and casein kinase 2. In the 3′-UTR, there are two consensus AU-rich elements (AREs), which have been suggested to play a critical role in the regulation of translation and mRNA stability (27.Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 28.Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The first ARE is a pentamer (AUUUA) located 656-bp downstream of the stop codon; the second, an enneamer (UUAUUUAUA), is 124-bp downstream of the first ARE. XB130 encodes a protein of 818 amino acids, and the molecular mass measured by immunoblotting is ∼130 kDa. Therefore we designated the newly identified protein as XB130. As XB130 does not contain any recognizable enzymatic domain, but is composed of numerous protein modules for protein-protein interactions, we defined it as an adaptor type protein. The sequence was deposited into GenBank™ data base (accession number: 442952). Chromosomal Localization, mRNA Expression, and Subcellular Distribution of XB130−To determine the chromosomal localization of XB130, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed using a fluorescence dye-labeled cDNA probe of XB130 sequence. XB130 is localized on human chromosome 10q25.3. A GenBank™ data base search confirmed this location and revealed that XB130 gene contains 19 exons, which are separated by 18 introns over 40 kb in length. Northern blot analysis showed that XB130 mRNA transcript is ∼4 kb, and is highly expressed in human spleen, thyroid, and relatively lower expression in the kidney, brain, lung, and pancreas (data not shown). To determine the subcellular distribution of XB130 protein, we expressed His-tagged XB130 in 3Y1 cells. Immunofluorescent staining with an anti-His antibody demonstrated that XB130 was distributed primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). We raised monoclonal antibodies against XB130 (see supplemental Fig. S1). Similar subcellular distribution of endogenous XB130 was confirmed with confocal microscopy in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 2B), and similar distribution pattern was observed in multiple cell lines, such as TPC-1 and WRO cells (Fig. 2C). Although XB130 was identified using chicken AFAP as a search query, the overall amino acid sequence similarity shared between these two proteins was 45%. Yet, their structural compositions are quite similar; both contain a proline-rich motif, several potential SH2-binding sites, and two PH domains. However, in the C terminus, AFAP contains a leucine zipper as well as an actin-binding motif, whereas XB130 has a coiled-coil region. Consistent with this particular structural difference, when BEAS-2B cells were double-stained for XB130 and F-actin, XB130 was not associated with actin filaments (Fig. 2D). To compare the intracellular localization between XB130 and AFAP, we double-stained BEAS-2B cells with XB130 mAb and a polyclonal antibody for AFAP. The distribution of AFAP appeared to be along the stress fiber (Fig. 2E, right), whereas XB130 did not (Fig. 2E, left). XB130 Interacts with c-Src Both in Vitro and in Vivo−XB130 contains several potential Src SH2/SH3-binding motifs (Fig. 1). To determine whether XB130 interacts with SH2 or SH3 domain-containing proteins, cellular extracts from XB130-transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with GST fusion proteins containing either an SH2 or SH3 domain from Src, GAP, and Nck. XB130 was able to interact with either SH2 or SH3 domain of Src or GAP, but not of Nck (Fig. 3A, upper panel). In contrast to XB130, hAFAP was able to bind the SH2 or SH3 domain of Src, GAP or Nck fused with GST (data not shown). These results suggested that SH2/SH3-binding motifs of XB130 interact specifically with some, but not all, SH2/SH3 domain-containing proteins. When FLAG-tagged c-Src and His-XB130 were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitation of Src, using an anti-FLAG or anti-Src antibody, allowed detection of XB130 by immunoblotting with an anti-His antibody (Fig. 3B). To confirm the Src-XB130 interaction, we also transfected cells with non-tagged c-Src and XB130, used the anti-His antibody to pull-down XB130, and then blotted for Src. Binding of these two proteins was seen in cells co-expressing Src and XB130, but not in cells expressing XB130 alone (Fig. 3C, upper panel). In the anti-Src blot of whole cell lysates, a weak signal was detected in cells transfected with XB130 alone, which probably reflected the level of endogenous Src. Similar levels of XB130 proteins in XB130 transfection alone or XB130/Src co-transfections were demonstrated in both whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 3C, lower panel). The interaction between endogenously expressed XB130 and c-Src was shown in BEAS-2B cells, as detected by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-XB130 mAb followed by immunoblotting with anti-Src antibody (GD11) (Fig. 3D). Co-expression of XB130 with c-Src Activates c-Src−It has been demonstrated that disruption of intramolecular interactions of c-Src by heterologous binding partners, through SH2 or SH3 domain-mediated interactions, is able to activate Src tyrosine kinase (7.Alexandropoulos K.

To investigate whether XB130/c-Src interaction plays a role in the regulation of Src activity, we expressed c-Src, with or without XB130, in COS-7 cells.

VOLUME 277 (2002) PAGES 1662-1668Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 282Issue 39PreviewRETRACTION Full-Text PDF Open Access The internalization of receptors is a critical process for eukaryotic cells. Receptors can be internalized from the plasma membrane by a variety of well described mechanisms, including via clathrin-coated pits, independently of clathrin, and through caveolae (1.Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). Once internalized, the small vesicles containing the internalized cargo fuse with early endosomes (also known as sorting endosomes), and the receptors are then either sent to late endosomes and on to the lysosomal pathway for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane, where they may participate in additional rounds of internalization (2.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Receptor recycling occurs either directly from the sorting endosomes in a process known as “fast recycling” or indirectly in a process termed “slow” or “regulated” recycling (3.Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Slow recycling has been better characterized and traverses a complex series of tubular and vesicular membrane structures that emerge from the microtubule-organizing center and is collectively known as the endocytic recycling compartment (3.Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 4.Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Despite advances in recent years, the process of recycling is not as well understood as internalization. Among the key regulatory proteins that control endocytic transport and recycling are the Rab family of GTP-binding proteins (5.Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J.

Over 60 different mammalian Rab proteins have been identified thus far, and their highly regulated GTP binding and subsequent hydrolysis lead to recruitment of a wide array of effector proteins that are important for vesicular transport and fusion processes within the endocytic pathways. For example, Rab5 has a well defined role in controlling transport through and fusion of early endosomes (8.Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

The Eps15 homology (EH) domain-containing family of proteins also has a well documented role in the regulation of endocytic transport and recycling. These proteins contain at least one copy of the EH domain, a highly conserved ∼100-amino acid stretch. The EH domain was originally identified in three copies at the N terminus of the protein Eps15 (17.Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell.

Despite the wide variation of other functional domains found in EH domain-containing proteins, most of these proteins have a defined regulatory role in endocytic membrane transport (reviewed in Refs. 22.Miliaras N.B.

Although no direct interaction has been demonstrated between EHD proteins and Rab proteins, recent studies have shown that EHD1 interacts directly with certain Rab effectors. For example, the divalent Rab4/Rab5 effector, Rabenosyn-5, interacts with the EH domain of EHD1 via several of its five NPF motifs (37.Naslavsky N. Boehm M. Backlund Jr., P.S. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2410-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Rab11 effector Rab11-FIP2, which contains three NPF motifs, interacts with EHD1 through NPF-EH domain interactions and plays a role in recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment (33.Naslavsky N. Rahajeng J. Sharma M. Jovic M. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One of the interesting features of EHD1 is that despite not having a hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning region, it localizes to an array of vesicular and tubular membrane structures. Membrane localization depends upon the ability of the EHD1 P-loop to bind nucleotides (35.Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 36.Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, EHD1 mutants incapable of oligomerizing become cytosolic in their subcellular localization, suggesting that oligomerization is a requirement for membrane association (32.Lee D.W. Zhao X. Scarselletta S. Schweinsberg P.J. Eisenberg E. Grant B.D. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 280-290Google Scholar, 33.Naslavsky N. Rahajeng J. Sharma M. Jovic M. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and EHD1 function is severely compromised when these cytosolic mutants are expressed (34.Grant B. Zhang Y. Paupard M.C. Lin S.X. Hall D.H. Hirsh D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 35.Lin S.X. Grant B. Hirsh D. Maxfield F.R. Nat.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, the mode by which EHD1 and other C-terminal EHD proteins associate with membranes has remained unknown. Indeed, until now, the question as to whether EHD1 associates indirectly with lipids through its various interaction partners or whether it directly binds to membranes has not been determined. In the study herein, we demonstrate that EHD1 is capable of directly interacting with membranes, by preferentially binding to phosphatidylinositols with a phosphate at position 3 via its EH domain. Our data lead to the conclusion that EH domains from other C-terminal EHD proteins, such as EHD4, as well as an N-terminal EH domain-containing protein (Eps15) are also capable of lipid binding. Moreover, we have identified an EHD1 residue (Lys-483) localized to the third helix of the EH domain as being critical for the interaction with the phosphatidylinositols. Overall, we describe phosphoinositide-binding as a new function for EH domains, which may in part explain the association of EHD proteins with membranes. Recombinant DNA Constructs−Full-length EHD1 and EHD3, the second EH domain of Eps15, and the EH domains of EHD4 and EHD1 were subcloned into the GST fusion bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (GE Life Sciences). Wild-type Myc-EHD1 and Myc-EHD1 ΔEH have been previously described (36.Caplan S. Naslavsky N. Hartnell L.M. Lodge R. Polishchuk R.S. Donaldson J.G. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Myc-EHD1 K483E was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Phosphatidylinositols and Other Lipids−18:1 Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), 8:0 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate) (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), 8:0 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,5-bisphosphate) (PtdIns(3,5)P2), 8:0 phosphatidic acid, and 16:0 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol)) (LPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 8:0 octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (BOG) was obtained from Calbiochem. Each lipid was received as a lyophilized powder and all were completely soluble in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) buffer. Critical micelle concentration (CMC) measurements are not available for eight-carbon phosphatidylinositol phosphates, and LPPG and would be cost-prohibitive to determine (44.Campbell R.B. Liu F. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33617-33620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the CMC for PtdIns is 60 μm, and the addition of phosphates to the inositol ring is expected to increase the head group size, charge, and therefore the CMC (44.Campbell R.B. Liu F. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33617-33620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For example, the CMC of di-C8-phosphatidylserine has been measured at 2.28 mm (45.Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 994-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the 0.75 mm concentration utilized of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and BOG (CMC 20-25 mm) is expected to render them monodispersed and unable to form micelles or membranes. Antibodies−Peptide-specific affinity-purified polyclonal anti-EHD1 antibodies have been previously described (33.Naslavsky N. Rahajeng J. Sharma M. Jovic M. Caplan S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), goat anti-GST-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was purchased from GE Life Sciences, and anti-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (46.Chen R. Kang V.H.

Cytochem. 2002; 50: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Alexa fluorochromes conjugated to secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). Protein Purification−GST fusion proteins were generated by standard methods. For NMR studies, 15N labeling was done as previously described (47.Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the GST was cleaved from the EH domains with PreScission Protease (GE Life Sciences) and concentrated as previously described (47.Duffy H.S. Sorgen P.L. Girvin M.E. O'Donnell P. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Spray D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36706-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Protein-Lipid Binding Assay−PIP (phosphatidylinositol) strips, PIP (phosphatidylinositol) arrays, and SphingoStrips (Echelon Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) were blocked in TBST-BSA (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) supplemented with 3% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 1 μg/ml GST fusion protein diluted in TBST-BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washes with TBST-BSA, the membranes were blotted with goat anti-GST conjugated to HRP and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis was applied to determine the relative affinity of EHD1 binding to the various phosphatidylinositols. Numerical densitometric values were attributed to each of the five concentrations measured after subtracting backgrounds, and the total additive value for all five measurements was used as an indication of affinity. The highest value, for EHD1 binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2, was arbitrarily assigned “100% binding,” and all other phosphatidylinositols were normalized compared with PtdIns(3,5)P2. Protein-Liposome Binding Assay−PolyPIPosomes (Echelon) contain phosphatidylcholine (65 mol %), PE (29 mol %), biotin-PE (1 mol %), and phosphatidylinositol (5 mol %). The phosphatidylinositols used in this assay were PtdIns, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.15 μmol of PolyPIPosomes were diluted in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 20 mm iodoacetamide) and incubated 15 min at room temperature with 10 μg of GST fusion protein. Liposome-protein complexes were recovered by 10 min centrifugation at room temperature (11,356 × g), and pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer and further incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated liposomes bound to GST proteins were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 20 mm iodoacetamide) and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-GST-HRP (as described under “Protein-Lipid Binding Assay”). To negate liposome-independent pull-down of GST proteins, a control sample comprising the streptavidin-agarose and GST proteins (without liposomes) was also included. Protein-Lipid Bead Binding Assays−Bead Binding assays were done essentially as described by Rao and co-workers (48.Rao V.R. Corradetti M.N. Chen J. Peng J. Yuan J. Prestwich G.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37893-37900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, streptavidin-agarose beads bound to biotinylated DiC6-PtdIns or -PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon) were used to bind and isolate full-length GST fusion proteins. A 10-μl slurry of beads was washed once in 500 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in the same buffer, supplemented with 5 μg of full-length GST fusion protein, rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with binding buffer, beads were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-GST-HRP. Two-dimensional Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation (HSQC) Analysis−NMR data were acquired at 25 °C using a 600-MHz Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer fitted with a cryoprobe at the University of Nebraska Medical Center NMR Shared Resource Facility. Gradient-enhanced two-dimensional 15N HSQC experiments (49.Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar) were used to observe all backbone amide resonances in 15N-labeled EH domains. Data were acquired with 1024 complex points in the direct dimension and 128 complex points in the indirect dimension. Sweep widths were 10,000 Hz in the proton dimension and 2500 Hz in the nitrogen dimension. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (50.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (51.Johnson B.A. Bevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). EHD1 Associates Directly with Phosphatidylinositol Lipids−To determine whether EHD1 is capable of directly interacting with lipids, we first utilized an assay in which a wide variety of lipids, immobilized on nitrocellulose, were probed with GST as a control (data not shown) or with a GST-EHD1 fusion protein. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, A and B, GST-EHD1 bound to a series of phosphatidylinositol moieties, including phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but showed no binding to various other lipids, including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingosine, cholesterol, ceramide, and others (Fig. 1, A and B). To quantitatively assess the binding specificity of these lipids for EHD1, GST-EHD1 was used to probe an array of phosphatidylinositol moieties immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes in decreasing concentrations from 100 to 6.2 pmol (Fig. 1C) and quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1D). As demonstrated, phosphatidylinositol moieties with a phosphate at position 3 of the inositol ring, including PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, showed binding even at 25 and 12.5 pmol, respectively. These data indicate that EHD1 can directly bind to phosphatidylinositols with phosphates on the inositol ring. To further validate our findings that EHD1 can interact directly with phospholipids, we used a pull-down assay, whereby streptavidin beads coated with either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns were then incubated with GST-EHD1, GST-EHD3 (the closest mammalian homolog to EHD1 at 85% identity), or GST alone. By this in vitro assay, we again demonstrated that EHD1 as well as EHD3 bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns (Fig. 2A). To determine whether EHD1 interacts directly with phospholipids in the context of a monolayer more closely resembling physiological membrane composition, we utilized liposomes composed of 1% biotinylated PE, 29% PE, and 65% phosphatidylcholine with either 5% PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,5)P2, or PtdIns (PolyPIPosomes; Echelon). The liposomes were incubated with GST-EHD1, GST-EHD3, or GST alone as a control. Isolated complexes of biotinylated liposomes bound to GST proteins were further purified by precipitation with streptavidin-coated Sepharose beads (Fig. 2B). Approximately 10-20% of both GST-EHD1 and GST-EHD3 that was incubated with the liposomes precipitated with liposomes containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,5)P2, whereas less than 3% precipitated with PtdIns. The GST-only control did not bind to any of the liposome compositions. Additional control experiments with streptavidin beads but without liposomes demonstrated that the efficient pull-down of GST-EHD1 and GST-EHD3 was entirely dependent on the presence of the liposomes. Moreover, the preferential binding to PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as compared with PtdIns is consistent with our findings in Fig. 1. Taken together, our data support a direct interaction between EHD1 and phosphoinositol lipids. Inhibition of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) Activity Affects the Subcellular Distribution of EHD1−Within cells, EHD1 resides on tubular and vesicular membrane-bound organelles. Although efficient/specific antibodies are not available for many of the phospholipids, commercial antibodies suitable for immune fluorescence are available for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (46.Chen R. Kang V.H.

Cytochem. 2002; 50: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), one of the phospholipids to which EHD1 displayed relatively high affinity (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine whether EHD1 localizes in vivo to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing membranes, we fixed and incubated HeLa cells with antibodies directed against endogenous EHD1 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3). As shown, EHD1 localizes to an array of"
https://openalex.org/W2087677532,"Increased tissue permeability is commonly associated with hypoxia of many origins. Since hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) represents a predominant hypoxia signaling mechanism, we compared hypoxia-elicited changes in tissue barrier function in mice conditionally lacking intestinal epithelial hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (hif1a). Somewhat surprisingly, these studies revealed that mutant hif1a mice were protected from hypoxia-induced increases in intestinal permeability in vivo. Guided by microarray analysis of tissues derived from these mutant hif1a mice, we identified HIF-1-dependent repression of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a molecule known to be important in the control of cytoskeletal dynamics, including barrier function. Studies at the mRNA and protein level confirmed hypoxia-elicited repression of VASP in murine tissue, cultured epithelia and endothelia, as well as human saphenous vein ex vivo. Targeted repression of VASP by siRNA recapitulated our findings with hypoxia and directed overexpression of VASP abolished hypoxia-induced barrier dysfunction. Studies in the cloned human VASP promoter revealed hypoxia-dependent transcriptional repression, and functional studies by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and site-directed mutagenesis revealed hypoxia-dependent binding of HIF-1alpha to the human VASP promoter. These studies identify HIF-1-dependent repression of VASP as a control point for hypoxia-regulated barrier dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2081429892,"An experimental protocol for folding the mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease is presented that facilitates NMR studies at a low protein concentration of ∼20 μm. Under these conditions, NMR spectra show that the mature protease lacking its terminal β-sheet residues 1-4 and 96-99 (PR5-95) exhibits a stable monomer fold spanning the region 10-90 that is similar to that of the single subunit of the wild-type dimer and the dimer bearing a D25N mutation (PRD25N).

Assigned backbone chemical shifts were used to elucidate differences in the stability of the PRT26A (U50 = 2.5 m) and SFNFPRD25N monomers and compared with PRD25N/T26A monomer. Discernible differences in the backbone chemical shifts were observed for N-terminal protease residues 3-6 of SFNFPRD25N that may relate to the increase in the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the very low catalytic activity of the protease prior to its autoprocessing at its N terminus from the Gag-Pol precursor.

In addition to catalyzing its own release from the Gag-Pol polyprotein via cleavage at its N and C termini to produce the mature protease (PR) domain, the protease is responsible for cleaving the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins at specific sites to produce the mature structural (matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid) and functional proteins (reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and integrase) crucial for virus maturation and propagation (1Oroszlan S. Luftig R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 157: 153-185PubMed Google Scholar, 2Louis J.M. Weber I.T. Tozser J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 49: 111-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indispensable role played by the protease in the viral replication cycle motivated extensive studies of structure-based drug design of active site inhibitors of the mature protease (3Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Vondrasek J. van Buskirk C.P. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Various protease inhibitors are currently being used and developed for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, effective long term treatment of AIDS patients has been hampered by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants that are less susceptible to inhibition even under highly active antiviral therapy (5Temesgen Z. Warnke D. Kasten M.J. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother. 2006; 7: 1541-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Rodriguez-Barrios F. Gago F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent second generation inhibitors of the PR, designed to overcome resistance (i) by reducing the size of their hydrophobic groups so that mutation of the active site residues will have less effect on inhibitor affinity and (ii) by optimizing favorable polar interactions with main chain atoms and to conserved residues, have been shown to curtail drug resistance (7Kovalevsky A.Y. Liu F. Leshchenko S. Ghosh A.K. Louis J.M. Harrison R.H. Weber I.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The initial steps in the maturation of the protease (Gag-Pol precursor) involve the folding and dimerization of the protease domain when it is in the form of the large Gag-Pol precursor. Previous studies using a mini-precursor, in which the protease is flanked by sequences corresponding to the cleavage sites at its termini, showed that the processing at the N terminus of the protease, which is concomitant with the appearance of catalytic activity, precedes the C-terminal cleavage (8Louis J.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23437-23442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further examination of protease precursor containing the flanking transframe region sequences (Fig. 1) by kinetics and NMR revealed that the very low catalytic activity of the protease precursor prior to the cleavage at the N terminus is due to a much higher dimer dissociation constant (Kd) as compared with the mature protease (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Upon intramolecular cleavage at the N terminus, the protease forms a stable dimer and exhibits a very low Kd (<10 × 10-9 m in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, at 25 °C (8Louis J.M. Nashed N.T. Parris K.D. Kimmel A.R. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7970-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Wondrak E.M. Louis J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). This suggests that inhibition of the protease function either by preventing or by disrupting dimer formation prior to its maturation provides an attractive avenue for inhibitor design. For the mature wild-type protease, protein folding appears to be concomitant with dimerization at a concentration of 5 nm and above (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Z.Y. Poorman R.A. Maggiora L.L. Heinrikson R.L. Kezdy F.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, a systematic understanding of the folding and dimerization events and the properties of the protease both as a monomer and as a dimer in its precursor and mature forms is essential for the rational design of inhibitors of dimerization. There have been several studies reporting the development of dimerization inhibitors toward the mature HIV-1 protease based on the terminal interface conformation, but to date, the structures of these complexes have not been verified. The low Kd of the mature protease had also precluded detailed studies of the protease monomer until it was observed that subtle mutations of conserved residues involved in interface contacts increase the Kd by several orders of magnitude, thus allowing NMR studies of the monomer to be performed at 0.2-0.3 mm concentrations. The conserved intra-monomer contact between Asp-29 and Arg-87 residues and the active site inter-monomer (interface) contact of Asp-25 and Thr-26 residues play a key role in stabilizing dimer formation with T26A exhibiting the largest increase in Kd (Table 1 and Fig. 2) (17Ishima R.

In addition, interface contacts between the terminal 1-4 and 96-99 residues are also critical for dimerization (20Weber I.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10492-10496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inter-subunit β-sheet contacts between the C-terminal strands (96-99/96′-99′, the prime indicates the second subunit) have a larger influence on dimerization than those between the N- and C-terminal β-strands (1-4/96′-99′ (17Ishima R.

Thus, the construct bearing the 4-residue deletion at the C terminus of the mature protease, which does not significantly dimerize even up to 1 mm concentration, facilitated the determination of the first three-dimensional structure of the protease monomer by NMR (Fig. 2) (21Ishima R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1836-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the native transframe region, which flanks the N terminus of the protease in the Gag-Pol precursor, drastically influences the dimer stability of the protease indicated by the very low catalytic activity of the protease prior to its maturation at its N terminus (Fig. 1) (10Louis J.M. Wondrak E.M. Kimmel A.R. Wingfield P.T. Nashed N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23437-23442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Even a two to four residue extension at the N terminus of the protease significantly impairs dimerization similar to the 4-residue N-terminal deletion construct PR5-99 (21Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Lynch S.M. Gronenborn A.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal extensions destabilize the dimer, our NMR investigation of the protease precursor flanked by 56 amino acids of the native transframe region at the N terminus revealed that although the transframe region is mainly unstructured, the protease domain adopts a monomer fold that is similar to that of the mature protease monomer PR1-95 (21Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Lynch S.M. Gronenborn A.M. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43311-43319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite our extensive studies to characterize the monomer, the propensity for these monomers to aggregate at 0.2-0.3 mm concentrations had precluded further studies to determine the stability of the monomer fold as compared with the dimer, and importantly, to use the monomer to reliably access the binding of potential inhibitors of dimerization. Herein to facilitate these studies, we initially optimized conditions for protein folding and for acquiring 1H-15N HSQC spectra at ∼20 μm concentration using the high sensitivity cryogenic NMR probe. Optimizing the NMR experiments at low protein concentration notably allowed studies of the urea-induced unfolding of the monomer and dimer by monitoring protein fluorescence under similar equilibrium conditions. Under these optimized conditions, the minimal sequence required for monomer folding was accessed by successive terminal deletions. Subsequently, urea-induced unfolding was monitored both by fluorescence and by NMR, and backbone chemical shifts of the monomers were assigned to characterize the effect of the mutation on the stability of the fold and the monomer-dimer equilibrium. Finally, 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the monomer and the dimer were acquired in the presence of excess putative dimerization inhibitors of the mature protease. Contrary to the results that suggest that these peptides dissociate the dimer (6Rodriguez-Barrios F. Gago F. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Sluis-Cremer N. Tachedjian G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5103-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), there was no change in the chemical shifts of residues at the termini or the active site. These observations indicate the lack of interaction between either the monomer or the dimer with the inhibitor under the conditions tested. Protease Constructs—The mature PR (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) domain in all constructs, optimized for NMR and kinetic studies, bears 5 mutations, Q7K, L33I, L63I to minimize autoproteolysis and C67A and C95A to prevent cysteine-thiol oxidation. Plasmid DNA (pET11a, Novagen, Madison, WI) encoding PR (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used with the appropriate oligonucleotide primers to generate the constructs PRD25N and PRD25N/T26A. The PR encoding plasmid was sequentially extended one codon at a time to produce SFNFPR. SFNFPR template was then used to introduce a D25N mutation. Construction of PR5-99 and PR1-95 has been described before (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17Ishima R.

A stop codon was engineered into constructs PR5-99 to produce PR5-90 and PR5-95 and in PR1-95 to produce PR1-90. All constructs were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To express PR10-90, the region encoding residues 10-90 was amplified using PR template and appropriate forward and reverse primers and cloned into pET11a vector between NdeI and BamH1 sites. A Gly residue was included at the N terminus of PR10-90 to allow nearly complete excision of the N-terminal methionine and attain N-terminal homogeneity. All constructs were verified both by DNA sequencing and by mass spectrometry. Protein Preparation—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were grown in minimal media containing 15N ammonium chloride with or without 13C glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively, at 37 °C and induced for expression. Proteins were purified from inclusion bodies using an established protocol as described previously involving size-exclusion chromatography under denaturing conditions followed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Peak fractions (∼0.5 mg/ml) were stored in aliquots at -70 °C. Proteins were dialyzed extensively against 30 mm formic acid and concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml using Millipore YM-10 Centriprep and Centricon concentrators (Millipore, Beford, MA) and stored at 4 °C. Samples were folded for NMR, kinetics, and fluorescence studies freshly when needed using the protocol described in Fig. 3. Concentrations of PR and its mutants are given for a monomer, unless noted otherwise. Fluorescence and Kinetics—Intrinsic fluorescence was recorded using FluoroMax-3 fitted with a Peltier temperature controller (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ) over a period of 30 min at 20 °C with an excitation and emission wavelength of 285 and 350 nm, respectively, and a bandwidth of 2 nm. Protein maintained in 30 mm formic acid was diluted to a volume of 1.5 ml in 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, and the resulting solution was then 2-fold diluted with either 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5 (solution A: folded) or 10 m urea, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5 (solution B: unfolded) to achieve a final protein concentration of ∼10 μm in 3 ml. Solution A was transferred into a 4-ml cuvette and allowed to equilibrate in the instrument for 5-10 min, and the fluorescence reading was acquired over a period of 30 min. Normally a stable reading was achieved in about 15 min. For urea denaturation studies, fluorescence was measured in increments of 0.25 m urea by removing solution A from the cuvette and adding an equal volume of solution B up to a final concentration of 4.75 m urea. Protease activity was monitored using the substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-(4-nitrophenylalanine)-Glu-Ala-Nle-NH2 (California Peptide Research, Napa, CA) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, at 25 °C. Proteins were folded in the same manner as prepared either for fluorescence or for NMR experiments. Protein concentrations were determined both spectrophotometrically (absorbance at 280 nm) and by Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Specific cleavages giving rise to products due to the autoprocessing of active precursor proteases and autoproteolysis of active mature proteases were accessed both by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for acquiring NMR spectra were prepared by mixing 40-45 μl of protein with 105-110 μl of 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6, and subsequently either with 150 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5, or with the same buffer containing urea. All 1H-15N-correlation spectra were recorded using 20-25 μm protein (in monomer) in 50 mm acetate buffer at pH 5 in 95% H2O/5% D2O and a sample volume of ∼321 μlin a 5-mm Shigemi tube (Shigemi, Inc., Allison Park, PA). Putative dimerization inhibitors (California Peptide Research) were either mixed with 5 mm acetate buffer (pH adjusted to 6) prior to the protein folding step or mixed with 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH adjusted to 5) when the pH is set (Fig. 3, Quench protocol). Backbone chemical shifts of Cα and N were determined using HNCA experiments (33Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 89: 496-514Google Scholar) for 0.2-0.3 mm proteins in the same buffer condition as above. Spectra were acquired on DMX500 spectrometers with a CryoProbe (Bruker Instruments, Billerica, MA) at 20 °C. NMR data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe, nmrDraw, and PIPP software (34Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 95: 214-220Google Scholar, 35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). Rationale and Experimental Design—The wild-type mature protease catalyzes its own cleavage rapidly (termed autoproteolysis), leading to severe loss in catalytic activity even at low nm concentrations. Thus, solution NMR studies of the uninhibited dimeric protease are feasible for a limited period of time only by using an optimized PR construct, to limit autoproteolysis, and by conducting experiments at pH 5.8, which is above the optimal pH for catalytic activity. The optimized PR construct for expression bears the mutations Q7K, L33I, L63I, C67A, and C95A, the first 3 to limit autoproteolysis and the latter 2 to avoid cysteine-thiol oxidation, leading to protein aggregation (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Rose J.R. Salto R. Craik C.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9405-9413Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because these mutations do not discernibly affect either the Kd or the kinetics of PR as compared with the wild-type protease, PR has been used as a pseudo wild-type for successive mutational studies and for comparison of the fold, stability, and catalytic properties of the mature protease and its precursor forms (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Mildner A.M. Rothrock D.J. Leone J.W. Bannow C.A. Lull J.M. Reardon I.M. Sarcich J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5458-5463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An active site D25N mutation, to abolish catalytic activity, was introduced into PR to permit long term studies of either the free or the substrate-bound protease dimer in solution (28Katoh E. Louis J.M. Yamazaki T. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Ishima R. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This mutation, however, increases the Kd by >50-fold as compared with PR, which is ∼1000-fold less than other interface and non-interface mutations (Table 1). Studies of protease monomers at 0.2-0.3 mm concentration require suppressing both the autoproteolysis in mutants, where there is significant dimer formation in NMR experimental conditions, as well as the propensity of the folded monomers to aggregate. In addition, previous monomer studies required a starting protein amount of ∼2 mg, two dialysis steps, and concentrating the protein to ∼0.3 mm; together these steps consume about6hof total preparation time (Fig. 3, Dialysis protocol). To minimize both aggregation and autoproteolysis, we have performed NMR studies of mutant proteases at ∼20 μm in monomer concentration using high sensitivity cryogenic probes. We have also devised a simpler folding scheme that is accomplished within 5 min (quench protocol) with reproducible monomer folding efficiency of >90% and negligible signal loss, even 3 months after sample preparation. Thus, 1 mg of protein is sufficient for at least seven NMR samples at a final monomer concentration of ∼20 μm. Specific extension, substitution, and deletion mutations were created in PR (Table 1) to access folding and stability of these mutants monitored both by NMR and by fluorescence measurements. Autoproteolysis was almost non-existent in all of the mutants studied because of the high Kd (>2 orders of magnitude as compared with PR) except for PR5-99, which exhibits minor amounts of degradation products even at 20 μm concentration. The autoproteolysis observed for PR5-99 is consistent with our earlier studies showing that it exhibits significant dimer formation and catalytic activity assayed using the chromogenic substrate (11Louis J.M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Additionally, a D25N mutation was introduced in some constructs to totally abolish catalytic activity to allow acquiring data for extended periods of time. Protein folding, stabilities, and Kd values were accessed and compared for three substitution, six deletion, and one extension mutants (Table 1, constructs marked with an asterisk). PR Lacking the Terminal Residues 1-4 and 96-99 Exhibits a Stable Monomer Fold—In previous studies, we had shown that a 4-residue deletion at either the N terminus (PR5-99) or the C terminus (PR1-95) of the protease shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward the monomer. In 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded using 0.2-0.3 mm protein, PR5-99 exhibited signals characteristic of a mixture of monomers and dimers, whereas PR1-95 was almost exclusively monomer (17Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, previous assessment of the mutant bearing 4-residue deletions at both termini (PR5-95) of the mature PR was deemed unreliable due to a large decrease in the observed signal intensities of the HSQC spectrum immediately after protein preparation using the dialysis protocol (18Louis J.M. Ishima R. Nesheiwat I. Pannell L.K. Lynch S.M. Torchia D.A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6085-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Now we have re-examined PR5-95 that was prepared using the quench protocol at a final concentration of ∼20 μm, thus avoiding the step for concentrating the protein after protein folding as in the case of the dialysis protocol. Comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of PR5-99 and PR5-95 (Fig. 4, A and B) indicates that PR5-95 exhibits a monomer fold similar to that of PR5-99 with negligible aggregation. These two spectra are nearly identical to that of other monomer constructs described previously (17Ishima R. Ghirlando R. Tozser J. Gronenborn A.M. Torchia D.A. Louis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49110-49116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Louis J.M. Ishima R. Nesheiwat I. Pannell L.K. Lynch S.M. Torchia D.A. Gronenborn A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6085-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although peaks that correspond to the dimer were not observed in the PR5-99 spectrum at ∼20 μm, the minor signals in the center of the spectrum of PR5-99 (Fig. 4A, 8.0-8.5 ppm for 1H and 108-128 ppm for 15N) most likely arise from unstructured fragments of the protease due to autoproteolysis and a very small fraction of unfolded protein. Subjecting PR5-99 to SDS-PAGE analysis after acquiring the HSQC spectrum reveals fragments of the protease resulting from autoproteolysis. Based on the observations that no catalytic activity was detectable for PR5-95 at 1-2 μm protein using a sensitive chromogenic substrate (29Richards A.D. Phylip L.H. Farmerie W.G. Scarborough P.E. Alvarez A. Dunn B.M. Hirel P.H. Konvalinka J. Strop P. Pavlickova L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7733-7736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and no fragments resulting from autoproteolysis were detectable by SDS-PAGE after acquiring NMR spectra at 20 μm concentration, very minor signals observed in the PR5-95 spectrum corresponding to the narrow region of 8-8.5 ppm for 1H and 108-128 ppm for 15N most likely represent the unfolded fraction of the protein (<5%). Although an increase in the Kd of some mutants (e.g. PRR87K, PRT26A, Table 1) is offset by enhancing the dimer interface contacts through the addition of an inhibitor, the Kd for PR5-95 is expected to be the same or higher than PR1-95, which does not significantly dimerize at concentrations up to 1 mm even in the presence of the potent inhibitor DMP323 (21Ishima R.

In contrast to PR5-99 and PR5-95, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum recorded using PR10-90 (Fig. 4C) exhibited weak signals that are characteristic of an unstructured protein. The loss in signal intensities suggests that the majority of the protein undergoes aggregation even at a low protein concentration of 20 μm. Analysis of two other constructs, PR1-90 and PR5-90, showed significant portions of both proteins existing both in aggregated and in folded monomer forms. These results indicate that the reg"

Using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer in 3T3L1 adipocytes, co-immunoprecipitation, and in vitro binding assays, we provide data to indicate that Munc18c also associates with nearly equal affinity to a mutant of syntaxin 4 in a constitutively open (unfolded) state (L173A/E174A; LE). To bind to the open conformation of syntaxin 4, we found that Munc18c requires an interaction with the N terminus of syntaxin 4, which resembles Sly1 interaction with the N terminus of ER/Golgi syntaxins. However, both N and C termini of syntaxin 4 are required for Munc18c binding, since a mutation in the syntaxin 4 SNARE domain (I241A) reduces the interaction, irrespective of syntaxin 4 conformation. Using an optical reporter for syntaxin 4-SNARE pairings in vivo, we demonstrate that Munc18c blocks recruitment of SNAP23 to wild type syntaxin 4 yet associates with syntaxin 4LE-SNAP23 Q-SNARE complexes. Fluorescent imaging of GLUT4 vesicles in 3T3L1 adipocytes revealed that syntaxin 4LE expressed with Munc18c bypasses the requirement of insulin for GLUT4 vesicle plasma membrane docking. This effect was attenuated by reducing the Munc18c-syntaxin 4LE interaction with the I241A mutation, indicating that Munc18c facilitates vesicle docking. Therefore, in contradiction to previous models, our data indicates that the conformational “opening” of syntaxin 4 rather than the dissociation of Munc18c is the critical event required for GLUT4 vesicle docking.

SNARE proteins anchored to both transport vesicles and their target membranes overcome the forces necessary for fusion by binding with high affinity in a ternary core complex (1.Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Although formation of SNARE core complexes is sufficient for membrane fusion (2.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B.

Seven vertebrate SM gene family members (Munc18a/b/c, Sly1, Vps45, and Vps33a/b) have been described, which affect membrane trafficking in distinct subcellular pathways, predominantly through their association with specific syntaxin Q-SNAREs (4.Toonen R.F.

Of the varied SM-syntaxin partners, Munc18c-syntaxin 4 interactions are believed to exert a critically important role in the temporal control of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 storage vesicle exocytosis in muscle and adipose tissue (5.Tellam J.T.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The delivery of GLUT4 to the cell surface occurs by distinct signaling processes: 1) GLUT4 vesicle recruitment to the plasma membrane, followed by 2) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent vesicle docking and fusion mediated by syntaxin 4-containing SNARE complexes (9.Bose A.

Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1627-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on overexpression studies, Munc18c was initially proposed to function as a negative regulator of GLUT4 vesicle translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes (5.Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6.Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the failure of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin to suppress GLUT4 externalization in adipocytes derived from Munc18c-null mice suggests that Munc18c inhibits docking and/or fusion under the control of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (11.Kanda H.

Although the exact mechanism for this inhibition is not fully understood, Munc18c has been proposed to preclude the binding of syntaxin 4 to its cognate SNAREs, VAMP2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) and SNAP23 (synaptosome-associated protein of 23 kDa), preventing GLUT4 externalization in the absence of insulin (5.Tellam J.T.

In the absence of fine structural information, a model of Munc18c control over syntaxin 4-SNARE complex formation is not easily predicted by other SM-syntaxin interactions due to the diversity in their modes of action. For example, the Munc18a-syntaxin 1A complex participates in regulated neuroexocytosis and has high sequence homology to Munc18c-syntaxin 4. Analysis of the syntaxin 1A structure showed that an autonomously folded N-terminal three-helix bundle, termed the Habc domain, reversibly folds over a helical H3 domain containing the SNARE motif (13.Margittai M. Widengren J. Schweinberger E. Schroder G.F. Felekyan S. Haustein E. Konig M. Fasshauer D. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. Seidel C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). These two helical domains are separated by a short structured linker proposed to allow syntaxin 1A to rapidly fluctuate between a folded (closed) conformation and an unfolded (open) conformation (13.Margittai M. Widengren J. Schweinberger E. Schroder G.F. Felekyan S. Haustein E. Konig M. Fasshauer D. Grubmuller H. Jahn R. Seidel C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15516-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The open conformation facilitates SNARE-SNARE pairing resulting from accessibility of the SNARE motif. The closed (SNARE pairing inactive) conformation of syntaxin 1A is stabilized by interaction with Munc18a (15.Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), precluding interactions with other SNAREs (16.Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 17.Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the association of Munc18 suggests a mechanism for the regulation of the syntaxin SNARE motif through the control of syntaxin conformation. However, there is a lack of general correlation between SM function and a particular conformation of syntaxin. The situation is further complicated, because not all syntaxins assume folded conformations. For instance, the SM proteins Sly1 and Vps45, which regulate trafficking of intracellular transport vesicles, bind to a conserved N-terminal domain found upstream of the Habc domain in their cognate syntaxins (Sly1 to syntaxins 5 and 18, and Vps45 to syntaxin 16) (18.Bryant N.J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19.Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Gao Y. Min S.W. Huryeva I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Comparatively, the yeast Munc18 homologue Sec1p stimulates fusion through its interaction with the ternary SNARE complex, only binding weakly to monomeric Sso1p/syntaxin (22.Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23.Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). By analogy to the Munc18a-syntaxin 1A interaction shown in the crystal structure (14.Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), the most prevalent model for Munc18c regulation of SNARE complex formation equates the association of Munc18c with a closed syntaxin 4 conformation to the inhibition of GLUT4 vesicle externalization. However, recent evidence suggests that exocytotic SM-syntaxin interactions may possess multiple binding and functional states. For example, Munc18a has been shown to bind to SNARE complexes and facilitate SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro (24.Shen J. Tareste D.C. Paumet F. Rothman J.E. Melia T.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 183-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), the basis of which is probably a binding mode for the SM protein utilizing both the N terminus of syntaxin 1A and interactions with the SNARE bundle (25.Dulubova I.

Comparatively, in vitro Munc18c associates with the ternary SNARE complex (26.Widberg C.H. Bryant N.J. Girotti M. Rea S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35093-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27.Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L. Westbury E. Blair D.H. Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Martin J.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1408-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, Munc18c possesses an interaction site for the N-terminal amino acids of syntaxin 4 resembling the syntaxin binding sites on Sly1 and Vps45 (27.Latham C.F. Lopez J.A. Hu S.H. Gee C.L.

However, genetic studies suggest that the mechanism of Munc18c action may be different from Munc18a. For example, the insulin-induced fusion of GLUT4 vesicles was enhanced in adipocytes prepared from Munc18c-null mice (11.Kanda H. Tamori Y. Shinoda H. Yoshikawa M. Sakaue M. Udagawa J. Otani H. Tashiro F. Miyazaki J. Kasuga M. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas Munc18a deficiency was demonstrated to eliminate both evoked and spontaneous synaptic exocytosis (28.Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Additionally, insulin (6.Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) as well as N-ethylmaleimide (26.Widberg C.H. Bryant N.J. Girotti M. Rea S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35093-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which inhibits NSF-mediated SNARE core complex disassembly, have been reported to dissociate Munc18c from syntaxin 4. Thus, it is not yet evident how the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 interaction fits with other models for SM-syntaxin interactions. The purpose of this study was to define the molecular properties of the Munc18c interaction with syntaxin 4, specifically how the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complex influences SNARE core complex formation in the pathway of GLUT4 cycling. Our investigations utilized quantitative optical techniques, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and biochemical approaches, to directly report the state of the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 interaction in vivo. Using mutational analyses, we address the mode of Munc18c binding to syntaxin 4, including where and when the interaction occurs and which structural motifs are important for function. Our findings indicate that syntaxin 4 exists in a closed conformation that is stabilized by Munc18c, thus rendering the syntaxin 4 SNARE domain unavailable for SNARE complex formation. Using the system of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis, we furthermore demonstrate that the binding of Munc18c to an open conformation of syntaxin 4 facilitates GLUT4 vesicle docking. Therefore, the change in the Munc18c-syntaxin 4 binding state precipitated by conformational opening of syntaxin is probably the critical regulatory point in the temporal sequence for the initiation of vesicle docking and fusion events. Chemicals and Expression Constructs−The following antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting: anti-syntaxin 4 rabbit polyclonal (Sigma), anti-syntaxin 1A mouse monoclonal HPC-1 (Sigma), anti-SNAP23 polyclonal (Synaptic Systems), anti-FLAG polyclonal (Sigma), and anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal 9B11 (Cell Signaling). To generate N-terminal fluoroprotein-labeled constructs, the following cDNAs were subcloned into the SalI-XbaI sites of pDNR-dual for use with the Cre recombinase-mediated Creator System (Clontech): rat Munc18a (pGex-KG-Munc18a), rat syntaxin 1A (pGEX-syntaxin 1A11), rat Munc18c (pcDNA3-FLAG-Munc18c), human syntaxin 4 (pcDNA4/TO/syntaxin 4-Myc2-His), and human SNAP23 (pcDNA3-SNAP23) (gifts from J. Pevsner, R. Scheller, J. Pessin, and T. Weimbs (syntaxin 4 and SNAP23), respectively). The recipient vectors pLoxP-ECFP-C1 and pLoxP-EcYFP-C1 (Q39M mutant of pEYFP-C1; citrine) were generated and mutated to their monomeric forms (A206K) from pLoxP-EGFP-C1 (Clontech) as described previously (17.Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55924-55936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To prepare pLoxP-mRFP1-C1, the cYFP sequence from pLoxP-EcYFP-C1 was replaced with mRFP1 (monomeric form) from pRSETB-mRFP1 (a gift from R. Tsien) by PCR cloning. cDNAs in pDNR-dual were subcloned into the indicated recipient vectors using Cre recombinase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To prepare recombinant fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, syntaxin 4-(1-275) and Munc18c were PCR-amplified and cloned downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) cDNA contained in the pGEX-KG plasmid; pGEX-syntaxin 1A11 (syntaxin 1A-(1-267)) was a gift from R. Scheller. pGex-KG-FLAG-loxP-Munc18c was created using a pGex-KG construct modified to include a loxP site suitable for use with the Clontech Creator system and an N-terminal FLAG epitope. The PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to construct the following mutants: EGFP-SNAP23C/A, a cytosolic mutant lacking cysteine palmitoylation sites at 80, 83, 85, and 87, which were mutated to alanine; Munc18c (R240L); syntaxin 1A (L165A/E166A, LE; I209A; and I233A), and the homologous mutations in syntaxin 4 (L173A/E174A, LE; I217A; and I241A). Syntaxin 4-(1-188) (ΔH3/TM) and syntaxin 1A-(1-181) were created by inserting an XbaI site with the TAG stop codon in frame at Leu189 and Ile182, respectively. The same XbaI site along with a SalI site upstream of the start codon was used to facilitate construction of the following syntaxin chimeras: syntaxin 41 (syntaxin 4-(1-188) + syntaxin 1A-(182-288)) and syntaxin 14 (syntaxin 1A-(1-181) + syntaxin 4-(189-297)). Before use, the XbaI restriction sites were back-mutated in the syntaxin 14 and syntaxin 41 plasmids to eliminate the stop codon and restore the Leu189 in the syntaxin 4 fragments and the Ile182 in the syntaxin 1A fragments. The sequence fidelity of all expression constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). Cell Culture and Transfection−3T3L1 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% bovine serum (Invitrogen). Following 2 days of confluence, differentiation was induced by the addition of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing 167 nm insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 3 days, followed by DMEM/FBS containing insulin for 2 days and subsequent removal of insulin for 2 days. Adipocytes were transfected by electroporation (0.16 kV, 950 micro-farads) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen), with 50-200 μg of each plasmid. After electroporation, cells were allowed to adhere to coverglass for 18-24 h in DMEM/FBS prior to imaging. In selected experiments, cells were exposed to 100 nm insulin after 3 h of serum starvation in DMEM low glucose (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% FBS. HEK293-S3 cells, which contain a stably transfected N-type calcium channel (17.Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

Cells were plated on coverglass affixed to the bottom of 35-mm plates 12-24 h prior to transfection using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). Before live cell imaging, cells were transferred to physiologic saline solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Homology Modeling of Munc18c-Syntaxin 4 Complex−Rat Munc18c (Stxbp3; GenBank™ accession number NP_446089) and syntaxin 4 (STX4; GenBank™ accession number NP_112387) sequences were threaded into the Munc18a-syntaxin 1A structure (Protein Data Bank code 1DN1) using O, based on a ClustalW alignment. Helical register, assessed using PredictProtein, was comparable; sequence gaps and insertions were not modeled. Figures were made with MOL-SCRIPT, RASTER 3D version 2.1.2, and GIMP. GST Fusion Proteins−Chemically competent BL21DE3(RIPL) E. coli (Invitrogen) containing pGex-KG-syntaxin 4-(1-275), pGex-KG-syntaxin 4-(1-275)LE, or pGEX-KG-Munc18c were cultured and induced with 100 nm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5-6 h at 27 °C. Bacteria were lysed by French press (15,000 p.s.i. pressure differential), and the eluent was solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice. Proteins were subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Cleavage of the GST moiety from the fusion protein was accomplished by treatment with 1.4 NIH units of human thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. Purity of all isolated fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE fractionation and subsequent visualization with Coomassie Blue or Western blotting. Protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) against a bovine serum albumin standard (Sigma). Trypsin Proteolysis Assay−Trypsin digest of recombinant GST-syntaxin 4-(1-275) and GST-syntaxin 4-(1-275)LE was modeled after Graham et al. (29.Graham M.E. Barclay J.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32751-32760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Proteins were incubated at 5 μm concentration in a total volume of 50 μl containing 60 nm trypsin (Type IX-S; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for the times indicated. During trypsin incubation, GST fusion proteins remained bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and immediate boiling. After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE, the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed for syntaxin 1A or syntaxin 4. Proteins were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation−For each treatment, a 6-well plate of confluent HEK293-S3 cells was transiently transfected with the indicated constructs. After a 2-day expression period, cells were rinsed twice in physiologic saline solution and lysed in a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 2% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5). After the homogenate was centrifuged (300 × g for 3 min) to pellet the nuclei, the supernatant was diluted 1:1 in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100). Samples were normalized for lysate volume and concentration (2-3 μg/μl) and incubated with 10 μg of anti-Myc 9B11 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) for 4 h at 4 °C. The samples were then incubated with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 1 h, and washed in immunoprecipitation buffer. Finally the pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subject to fractionation by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Binding Assay−For all binding reactions in vitro, the GST moiety was cleaved from purified GST-syntaxin 4-(1-275), GST-syntaxin 4-(1-275)LE, and GST-Munc18c. Reactions used 0.03-30 pmol of Munc18c in a dilution series spotted in quadruplicate on nitrocellulose (BA-83; Schleicher and Schuell). After blocking in 2% milk, the blots were incubated with 500 nm syntaxin 4-(1-275) or syntaxin 4-(1-275)LE for ≥12 h at 4 °C. Syntaxin 4 proteins were visualized using an anti-syntaxin 4 polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as described above. Integrated intensity (area·intensity) was quantified using Metamorph (version 6.3r5; Universal Imaging, Inc., Malvern, PA). Measurement of FRET Stoichiometry by Sensitized Emission−Live cell imaging of FRET was performed on transfected 3T3L1 adipocytes and HEK293 cells 24 h after transfection. Since false positive FRET signals have been observed when cytoplasmic donors come into contact with membrane-compartmentalized acceptors (30.Vogel S.S. Thaler C. Koushik S.V. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re2PubMed Google Scholar), syntaxin 4 was purposely tagged with CFP. However, performing the experiments using CFP-Munc18c and cYFP-syntaxin 4 resulted in similar FRET efficiency values (data not shown). Measurement of sensitized emission FRET was carried out as previously described (17.Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol.

The methodology employed an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX71) equipped with the following components: a TILL-Photonics Polychrome IV xenon lamp-based monochrometer (TILL-Photonics, Grafelfing, Germany), a polychroic mirror that allowed excitation of multiple fluorophores (436-500 nm; Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT), a Planapo ×60 water immersion objective (1.2 numerical aperture), a multispec microimager (Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM) containing dichroic splitter (505dcxr) and emission filters (D465/30 and HQ535/30) to allow simultaneous two-channel monitoring of emission fluorescence, and a cooled digital CCD camera (TILL IMAGO QE). The multispec microimager hardware was calibrated to allow pixel-by-pixel alignment of images, and offline adjustments were made using the TILL-Vision software. All analyses of the acquired images were performed using Metamorph image-processing software as previously described (17.Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q.

The apparent efficiency of acceptor (monomeric cYFP) in complex (EA), the apparent efficiency of donor (monomeric ECFP) in complex (ED), and the mole fraction of acceptor to donor (RATIO) values were determined using the following equations: EA = γ[((DA - β·DD)/α·AA) - 1](1/EC); ED = [1 - (DD/((DA - α·AA - β·DD)·(ξ/γ) + DD))](1/EC); and RATIO = (ξ/γ2)·[α·AA/((DA - α·AA - β·DD)·(ξ/γ) + DD)] (31.Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), where images are abbreviated as follows: DD, donor excitation-donor emission; DA, donor excitation-donor emission; AA, acceptor excitation-acceptor emission; EC, characteristic efficiency (0.37 (31.Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)). Donor and acceptor excitations were 436 and 500 nm, respectively. Empirically determined constants were established in HEK293 cells: α, 0.017; β, 0.9406; γ, 0.0658; ξ, 0.0147. For all measurements, EA values were determined in regions of the cell where the mole fraction between cYFP-Munc18c and CFP-syntaxin 4 (RATIO) was between 0.9 and 1.1; ED is comparable with EA over this RATIO range. Resolution of SNAP23C/A-SNARE Interactions by Cytosolic Photobleach and Membrane FRAP−GFP-SNAP23C/A bound to syntaxin 4 at the plasma membrane was observed by expression of the proteins when viewed with the FV500 Olympus FluoView laser-scanning confocal microscope. In order to resolve the relative amount of plasmalemmal GFP-SNAP23C/A, images were taken before and after 1 min of cytosolic photobleach (>90% bleach) using the 488-nm laser line of the argon laser. The localization of GFP-SNAP23C/A fluorescence intensity remaining after photobleach was quantified using linescans averaged over a 10-pixel width (∼1/8 cell diameter) normalized to peak intensity for each cell. For FRAP experiments, cytosolic photobleach was followed by a 10-s photobleach (>50%) of the cell membrane using simultaneous excitation with the 488-nm line of the Argon laser and 543-nm line of the helium neon laser to facilitate simultaneous bleach of GFP and RFP, respe"
https://openalex.org/W2035184032,"The Coulomb drag in a system of two parallel layers is the result of electron-electron interaction between the layers. We have observed reproducible fluctuations of the drag, both as a function of magnetic field and electron concentration, which are a manifestation of quantum interference of electrons in the layers. At low temperatures the fluctuations exceed the average drag, giving rise to random changes of the sign of the drag. The fluctuations are found to be much larger than previously expected, and we propose a model that explains their enhancement by considering fluctuations of local electron properties."

Qβ replicase is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the RNA genome of coliphage Qβ (1Calendar R. The Bacteriophages.2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford2006: 175-196Google Scholar) that plays a key role in the life cycle of the Qβ phage (2Haruna I. Spiegelman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of a β subunit encoded on the phage genome and three host proteins: ribosomal protein S1, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and Ts (EF-Ts) (4Brown D. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The replication reaction proceeds first by binding of the enzyme to the 3′-end of single-stranded RNA (plus strand), and synthesizes its complementary single-stranded RNA (minus strand), which then becomes the template for synthesis of another plus strand (5Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Luce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Not all RNAs can be amplified by the Qβ replicase. The requirements for amplifiable RNAs are known to be the presence of a poly(C) sequence at the 3′-end of the RNA (6Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Tretheway D.M. Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas these are not sufficient for designing amplifiable RNAs (9Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ugarov V.I. Demidenko A.A. Chetverin A.B. J. Biol.

Using the replicase, RNA can be amplified exponentially from a single copy to 1012 copies in less than 30 min without the need for any oligonucleotide primer (de novo initiation) (3Chetverin A.B. Spirin A.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 225-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Qβ replicase has been recognized as a representative single-stranded RNA replicase and has been used for various purposes, such as to investigate the kinetics of single-stranded RNA replication (11Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Gardiner Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2544-2559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nonhomologous RNA recombination (12Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and to study various aspects of molecular evolution (13Mills D.R. Peterson R.L. Spiegelman S. Proc. Natl.

In addition, it has also been used as a tool for molecular biology (e.g. for the amplification of a particular RNA (16Morozov I.Y. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. Spirin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lett. 2006; 107: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Therefore, it is important to understand the basis of the replication reaction. However, at present, there is no kinetic model to account for the entire RNA amplification process by Qβ replicase, whereas the requirements for amplifiable RNAs have been studied in detail. To date, the RNA amplification process has been segregated into individual steps, such as binding (21Werner M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5832-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Preuss R. Dapprich J. Walter N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 600-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and double-stranded production (23Priano C. Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 321-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Axelrod V.D. Brown E. Priano C. Mills D.R. Virology. 1991; 184: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which have been analyzed kinetically to determine the rate or equilibrium constants. On the other hand, kinetic models to explain the entire amplification process have been studied mainly by computer simulation (5Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Luce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Gardiner Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2544-2559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Gardiner Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3186-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and these studies have not resolved the following three observations: (i) the replication of the phage genome RNA is somehow inhibited by the genomic RNA itself (26Kondo M. Weissmann C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 530-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15339-15345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), (ii) the reaction velocity decreases in the late phase of the reaction (5Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Luce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Palmenberg A. Kaesberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) the catalytic constant seems to differ between the earlier and later phases of the amplification process (5Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Luce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The bases of these observations are still unclear. Moreover, kinetic studies have been carried out using only short template RNAs (about 200 nucleotides (nt) 2The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide(s); ROX, 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine. in length). Furthermore, the kinetic constants, such as polymerization rate and Michaelis-Menten constant, have not been determined. The kinetics of Qβ replicase provide important information not only for understanding the basis of Qβ phage amplification but also for applications using Qβ replicase. In this study, we performed kinetic analyses of the entire process of RNA amplification by Qβ replicase based on a simple kinetic model. The key in our proposed kinetic model is the consideration of nonproductive binding (i.e. binding of an enzyme to the RNA where the enzyme cannot initiate the reaction). Nonproductive binding will reduce the amount of enzyme for productive binding (i.e. binding to the appropriate position of the RNA for initiation of the reaction). Here, we used RNAs varying widely in length, and measured the replication reaction in real time with high accuracy using SYBR® Green II (29Nakaishi T. Iio K. Yamamoto K. Urabe I. Yomo T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our model was able to account for all of the results of the entire amplification process and the previously unresolved observations. Moreover, we obtained the kinetic constants directly from the experiments. In addition, we found a notable inactivation pattern of the enzyme, which can be regulated by GDP as an accelerator of inactivation and NTPs as inhibitors of GDP-dependent inactivation. Finally, we discuss the important information obtained in this study both for understanding the basis of Qβ phage amplification and for applications using Qβ replicase. Qβ Replicase—Qβ replicase was purified as described previously (30Kita H. Cho J. Matsuura T. Nakaishi T. Taniguchi I. Ichikawa T. Shima Y. Urabe I. Yomo T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2006; 101: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After purification, the enzyme solution was dialyzed against the storage buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% (v/v) glycerol). SDS-PAGE showed the purified enzyme to be composed of EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and β subunit. The purified enzyme seemed to contain two different types of enzyme, as revealed by preincubation experiments: one with high and another with low thermostability. In this study, the enzyme solution was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to carrying out the replication reaction, which removed the less stable fraction of the enzyme. The observation that the enzyme solution consists of enzymes with distinct thermostability was made with different batches of the S1-less enzyme, enzyme with S1 subunit (29Nakaishi T. Iio K. Yamamoto K. Urabe I. Yomo T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), fusion enzyme (30Kita H. Cho J. Matsuura T. Nakaishi T. Taniguchi I. Ichikawa T. Shima Y. Urabe I. Yomo T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2006; 101: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and commercially available enzyme (Epicenter, Madison, WI). It should be noted that the ratio between high and low thermostable enzymes was different among batches (data not shown); therefore, we worked with the enzyme from a single batch. Plasmids—Plasmid pUC-MDV-LR (31Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. Hirashima A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Inokuchi (Teikyo University), was used to produce MDV-poly RNA. The plasmid carries the sequence of MDV-poly RNA downstream of the T7 promoter sequence, a SmaI restriction site at the 3′-end of the MDV-poly sequence, and a BglII site within the MDV-poly RNA sequence for cloning (32Lizardi P.M. Guerra C.E. Lomeli H. Tussie-Luna I. Russell Kramer F. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1197-1202Crossref Google Scholar). Plasmids for synthesis of MDV-T12, MDV-CAT, MDV-dBETA, and MDV-BETA RNAs were constructed by inserting the 27-base sequence (5′-GATCATTTTTTTTTTTTGTTTTTTTTA), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, the Qβ replicase β subunit gene lacking the 1072-nt segment between the two StyI sites of the gene, and the complementary strand of the Qβ replicase β subunit gene, respectively, into the BglII sites of pUC-MDV-LR. S222 RNA is a mutant of the complementary strand of MDV-1 RNA, which contains six mutations, three insertions, and two deletions. S130 RNA is a 130-nt fragment of the 5′ terminal part of S222 RNA containing two deletions, seven mutations, and the addition of CCA at its 3′ terminus. These two RNAs were isolated in our laboratory as a product of spontaneous RNA amplification (33Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Munishkin A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), their sequences were inserted into the pUC19 vector (ATCC 37254) under the control of the T7 promoter, and an AlwI cleavage site was placed at the 3′-end. All sequences of the transcript RNAs are shown in the supplemental materials. Preparation of Template RNAs—Template RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription from a plasmid DNA linearized with AlwI (for S130 and S222 RNAs) or SmaI (for the other RNAs), using T7 RNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the template DNA was digested with DNase I (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). RNA was purified with RNeasy mini (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in distilled water. The RNA solution was heated at 70 °C for 2 min and placed at room temperature for more than 5 min before use. Real Time Detection of the Replication Reaction—The replication reaction (20 μl) was carried out at 37 °C by adding template RNA and 1 μl of Qβ replicase to the reaction buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mm each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, 500 nm (for ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector) or 200 nm (for Mx3005P™ QPCR System) 5-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) reference dye (Invitrogen), 1× concentration of SYBR® Green II (Invitrogen), 5 mg/ml Triton X-100). ROX was added as an internal marker to normalize the difference among the tubes. For analysis of the exponential phase and the saturation point, the reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of various concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 nm) of the enzyme and 0.004 nm (for S130, S222, MDV-poly, and MDV-T12 RNA) or 0.4 nm (for MDV-CAT, MDV-dBETA, and MDV-BETA RNA) template RNA. For analysis of the linear phase, the reactions were monitored at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of a 10 nm concentration of the enzyme and 100 nm (for S130 and S222 RNA), 200 nm (for MDV-poly and MDV-T12 RNA), or 60 nm (for MDV-CAT, MDV-dBETA, and MDV-BETA RNA) template RNA. The reaction mixtures were monitored at 37°C using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems) for analysis of exponential phase and saturation point or an Mx3005P™ QPCR System (Stratagene) for analysis of the linear phase. The output fluorescence spectrum excited at 488 nm from ABI7700 was decomposed to the spectrum of SYBR® Green II and ROX by the least squares method. The ratio of the peak value of the spectrum of SYBR® Green II to that of ROX, obtained by spectral decomposition, was employed as the signal intensity. For monitoring by Mx3005P, the ratio of the value of fluorescence emission at 516 nm (excitation at 492 nm) to that at 610 nm (excitation at 585 nm) was employed as the signal intensity. The RNA concentration in the reaction was quantified using a standard curve of known concentration of the RNA determined by the absorbance versus the signal intensity for both instruments. The data intervals of ABI7700 and Mx3005P were ∼6 and 30 s, respectively. The ABI7700 has high sensitivity and accuracy but a narrow dynamic range, whereas the Mx3005P has low sensitivity and accuracy but a broad dynamic range. Analysis of the Exponential Phase—When the enzyme is in excess to the RNA, RNA is amplified exponentially with the rate kobs. Here, the reaction can be assumed to be a continuous stirred tank reactor steady-state reaction (11Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Gardiner Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2544-2559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is an assumption that the concentrations of all components in the reactor increase autocatalytically at the same rate, and the concentrations of Rt, E-Rp, and E-Rn (total RNA, enzyme bound to productive binding site of the RNA, and enzyme bound to nonproductive binding site of the RNA, respectively) can be written as follows. d[Rt]dt⋅1[Rt]=d[E-Rp]dt⋅1[E-Rp]=d[E-Rn]dt⋅1[E-Rn]=kobs(Eq. 1) The rate equation for [Rt] and [E-Rp] in our model (Scheme 1) can be written as follows,d[Rt]dt=kcat[E-Rp](Eq. 2) d[E-Rp]dt=k1[E][Rp]-(k-1+kcat)(E-Rp)(Eq. 3) where E represents free enzyme (i.e. [E] = [Et] - [E-Rp] - [E-Rn], Et is total active enzyme), Rp is free productive binding sites of the RNA, k1 and k-1 are the association and dissociation rates between the enzyme and productive binding site of the RNA, respectively, and kcat is the catalytic rate constant. When [E] ≈ [Et] (which is the case at exponential phase), kobs can be solved from Equations 1, 2, and 3 as follows. kobs=2kcat[Et]k-1+kcatk1+[Et]+4[Et]kcatk1+([Et]+k-1+kcatk1)2(Eq. 4) We assumed k-1 >> kcat or k-1 << kcat to reduce the parameter for fitting as follows. When k-1 is >>kcat and k-1 is <<kcat, we obtained the following, respectively,kobs=kcat[E280][E280]+Km/α(Eq. 5) andkobs=2kcat[E280]km/α+[E280]+4[E280]Km/α+([E280]+Km/α)2(Eq. 6) where Km is (k-1 + kcat)/k1 and [E280] is the enzyme concentration determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. α is the fraction of active enzyme ([Et]) in [E280](i.e. α = [Et]/[E280]), which was found to differ significantly among batches of the enzyme preparation (data not shown). Therefore, we worked with enzyme from a single batch in this study. Both Equations 5 and 6 can give the values of kcat and Km; however, by computational simulation, kcat was found to be estimated accurately regardless of the relation between kcat and k-1, and Km was found with a difference of at most 50%. Analysis of the Saturation Point—The saturation point is the end of the exponential phase, and we used the same assumption as the exponential phase that the reaction is at continuous stirred tank reactor steady state (as described above; see Equation 1). The rate equation for [E-Rn] in our model can be written as follows,d[E-Rn]dt=k2[E][Rn]-k-2[E-Rn]-kcat[E-Rn][E-Rp][Rt](Eq. 7) where Rn is free nonproductive binding sites of the RNA ([Rn] = n·[Rt] - [E-Rn], where n is the number of nonproductive binding sites on a single RNA), and k2 and k-2 are the association and dissociation rates between the enzyme and nonproductive binding sites of the RNA, respectively. The third term of Equation 7 represents the dissociation of E-Rn caused by the interaction with the elongating enzyme on the same template RNA. As in the exponential phase, we assumed [E] ≈ [Et]. To reduce the parameter, we also assumed [E-Rp] ≈ [Rt], which can then be used to convert Equation 7 to the following,[E-Rn]=n[Et][Rt]Km2+[Et](Eq. 8) where Km2 is (k-2 + 2kcat)/k2. At the saturation point ([Rt] = [Rsat]), the enzyme can be assumed to be saturated by binding to either the productive or the nonproductive binding site of RNA (i.e. [Et] ≈ [E-Rp] + [E-Rn]) (11Biebricher C.K.

Biol. 1987; 52: 321-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we then obtained the following. [Rsat][E280]=α⋅Km2/α+[E280]Km2/α+(n+1)[E280](Eq. 9) The assumption that the enzyme is in excess to RNA ([E] ≈ [Et]) is in conflict with the assumption that the enzyme is saturated with RNA ([Et] ≈ [E-Rp] + [E-Rn]). Nevertheless, the values of n and Km2 can be determined by fitting the data using Equation 9 with high accuracy as described below. [Rsat] was determined by fitting the time course of [Rt] to the following equation,ln[Rt]=Boole[t<tsat]⋅(k(t-tsat)+ln(atsat+b))+Boole[tsat≤t]⋅ln(at+b)(Eq. 10) using Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc.), where a, b, k, and tsat are the fitting parameters. tsat is the reaction time at the saturation point. The Boole function (Boole[ϕ]) is also called Iverson's convention (34Knuth D.E. Am. Math. Mon. 1992; 99: 403-422Crossref Google Scholar), which yields 1 if ϕ is true and 0 if ϕ is false. Therefore, the total RNA concentration ([Rt]) in Equation 10 increases exponentially over time when t < tsat and increases linearly over time when tsat < t. The reaction times used to obtain [Rsat] were 2-4, 2-5, 3-7, 3-7, 2-6, 3-7, and 2-9 min for S130, S222, MDV-poly, MDV-T12, MDV-CAT, MDV-dBETA, and MDV-BETA, respectively. To test the fitting accuracy, we simulated the reaction based on the reaction scheme (Scheme 1) with various values of constants, including n and Km2, with the enzyme concentrations used in the experiment and then estimated [Rsat] values using the Boole function. In all cases, as with the experimental results (Fig. 3A), the relationship between [Rsat]/[E280], and [E280] obeyed Equation 9. When we then fitted the results of the simulation using Equation 9, the values of both n and Km2 could be determined with at most 50% error, which justified our strategy of estimating these values. Analysis of the Linear Phase—In the reaction initiated immediately from the linear phase, it can be assumed that the RNA is present in excess relative to the enzyme (i.e. [Rp] ≈ [Rt] and [Rn] ≈ n·[Rt]). First, we assumed that the association of productive binding is much faster than that of nonproductive binding (i.e. k1 >> n·k2), and the productive binding, including the catalytic process (i.e. E + Rp ⇌ E-Rp → E + 2Rfree in Scheme 1), can be described as steady-state. Based on the assumptions, [E-Rp] can be written as follows.[E-Rp]=([Et]-[E-Rn])[Rt]Km+[Rt](Eq. 11) Then we assumed that only a single molecule of enzyme can bind to each molecule of template RNA because the RNA is present in excess relative to the enzyme. In this case, the dissociation of E-Rn caused by the interaction with the elongating enzyme (the third term in Equation 7) is negligible. Based on this assumption, the rate equation for [E-Rn] can be described as follows.d[E-Rn]dt=k2[E]n[Rt]-k-2[E-Rn](Eq. 12) From Equations 11 and 12, and by assuming [Rt] >> Km, we obtained the reaction velocity at time t without consideration of the enzyme inactivation (Vcor(t)) as follows,Vcor(t)=kcat[Et](e-(k-2+nk2km)t+KinKm)1+KinKm(Eq. 13) where Ki is k-2/k2. In consideration of the enzyme inactivation (i.e. [Et(t)] = [Et(0)]·exp(-kinact·t), kinact is the rate of enzyme inactivation, and Et(t) is the total active enzyme at reaction time t), we obtained the reaction velocity at time t (V(t)) as follows.V(t)=kcatα[E280](e-(k-2+nk2km)⋅t+KinKm)1+KinKm⋅e-kinact⋅t(Eq. 14) Equation 14 could not provide good fits for RNAs except S130 and S222 for two reasons. First, the initial enzyme concentration is much less than that of the initial RNA. This results in less of an increase in the signal intensity (i.e. lower velocity), in particular for RNAs amplified at low efficiency. Therefore, the error becomes larger relative to the increase in the signal. Second, the spontaneous RNA (33Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Munishkin A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) emerges in the middle of the reaction and precludes homogeneous RNA amplification, particularly for RNAs amplified at low efficiency. Therefore, the real time data are plausible only until the emergence of the spontaneous RNA. It should be noted that the emergence of the spontaneous RNA could be detected not only by gel electrophoresis but also by real time measurement as a marked increase in signal intensity (velocity). We determined the values of Vcor(0) and Vcor(∞) as the mean value of Vcor(t) for the reaction time of 2-10 min and as the minimum value of Vcor(t) averaged for 15 min, respectively. Since the occurrence of spontaneous RNA induced a sudden increase in the reaction velocity, we used the minimum value as Vcor(∞). Enzyme Inactivation—The enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for various times under the buffer conditions described under “Results” and subsequently placed on ice for 5 min. Then the lacking NTPs were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C to start the reaction. The fraction of the active enzyme was obtained as the ratio of the initial velocity after preincubation to the initial velocity without preincubation. The inactivation rate was determined by fitting the time course of the enzyme inactivation to a single exponential curve. The values of Ki(NTP) were determined using the equation, Ki(NTP) = [It] kinact_inh/(kinact_MAX - kinact_inh), where kinact_MAX and kinact_inh are the inactivation rate in the presence of 1.25 mm GDP without and with NTPs, respectively, and [It] is the total concentration of NTPs. Real Time Measurement and the Two Phases of the RNA Amplification Process—Qβ replicase can amplify RNA exponentially starting from a small number of copies of the template RNA. In this study, RNA amplification was measured in real time using the fluorescent intercalating dye SYBR® Green II (29Nakaishi T. Iio K. Yamamoto K. Urabe I. Yomo T. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2002; 93: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), as opposed to gel electrophoresis used mainly in previous studies, and this enabled us to perform detailed kinetic analysis. Fig. 1 shows a typical result of RNA amplification detected by real time measurement. The time courses of changes in RNA concentration and the reaction velocity are shown as closed and open circles, respectively. The velocity was determined from the slope of the RNA amplification curve. We confirmed that SYBR® Green II does not affect the replication reaction and that the lag time of fluorescence and photobleaching of the fluorescence were negligible by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The RNA amplification process can be decomposed into two phases (i.e. the exponential and linear phases) (5Biebricher C.K. Eigen M. Luce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 148: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Priano C. Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 321-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the two phases: a steep increase in velocity, which corresponds to the exponential phase (about the first 3 min), and a decrease in velocity, which corresponds to the linear phase. We refer to the transition point of these two phases as the saturation point (around 3 min). The exponential phase is observed when the enzyme is present in excess relative to the RNA in molar ratio. Under such conditions, the RNA is amplified exponentially over time, because the RNA itself, which increases over time, is rate-limiting (i.e. it is autocatalytic). The linear phase is observed after the amplified RNA copy number reaches that of the working enzyme. Under such conditions, the RNA is amplified linearly over time, because the enzyme, which does not increase (but can decrease by inactivation or competitive inhibition as described later) over time, is rate-limiting. At the transition point from the exponential phase to the linear phase, the enzyme is saturated by the RNA (and vice versa), and we thus refer to this transition point as the saturation point. In this study, we analyzed the reaction individually for each phase: exponential phase, saturation point, and linear phase. Proposal of a Kinetic Model—We proposed a simple kinetic model based on previous reports to determine the kinetic constants directly from the experiments. The presence of a poly(C) sequence at the 3′-end of the RNA (6Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Tretheway D.M. Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11373-11383Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and unique secondary structures at both 3′- and 5′-ends (8Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are known to be necessary for amplifiable RNAs. Here, binding of the enzyme to such template RNA at an appropriate location where the replication reaction can be initiated is interpreted as productive binding. On the other hand, Qβ replicase is known to bind various RNAs, regardless of whether the RNA is amplifiable or not (22Preuss R. Dapprich J. Walter N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 600-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that replication of the phage genome RNA is somehow inhibited by itself (26Kondo M. Weissmann C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 24: 530-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Inokuchi Y. Kajitani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15339-15345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We also observed that a 30-base oligo-RNA, which is not amplifiable, competitively inhibited the replication reaction (not shown). These observations led us to pr"

However, the molecular mechanism underlying its role in angiogenesis remains essentially unknown. Herein we demonstrate the subcellular localization of Id1 to be altered depending on the cellular context of vascular endothelial cells. Id1 was localized in the nuclei of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on uncoated plates, whereas it was translocated to the cytoplasm in HUVECs on Matrigel along with the formation of capillary-like structures. Treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B and mutagenesis analysis using green fluorescent protein-fused Id1 revealed CRM1/exportin-dependent nuclear export of Id1 in HUVECs on Matrigel. This nuclear export of Id1 was inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) activation by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin but was promoted by PKA inactivation by H-89 and MDL-12,330A. Mutagenesis analysis of Id1 showed the phosphorylation of Ser-5 to possibly mediate the effect of PKA. These results suggest the function of Id1 as a transcriptional factor to be controlled by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling during angiogenesis and that PKA might be involved in this process. This may serve as a novel mechanism regulating angiogenesis and as a possible target for therapeutic vascular regeneration.

Angiogenesis is a complex process involving various cellular events such as growth, differentiation, migration, and morphogenesis (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (ECs) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HLH, helix-loop-helix; PKA, protein kinase A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; NES, nuclear export sequence; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcriptase; LMB, leptomycin B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; CHX, cycloheximide. play a principal role in angiogenesis, giving rise to vascular extensions from the existing vasculature by sprouting and intussusception (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). ECs receive extracellular signals such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin with their receptors, thereby responding via intracellular signaling pathways and leading to changes in cellular behavior appropriate for vascular network formation (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4866) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, various transcriptional factors function to control gene expression, which contributes to the angiogenic property of ECs (1Risau W.

Id proteins, a subfamily of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional factors, have been implicated in regulating a variety of cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation and neoplastic transformation (3Norton J.D.

Id lacks a basic DNA binding domain and acts primarily as a transcriptional inhibitor of basic HLH transcriptional factors by inhibiting DNA binding and subsequent activation of transcription via heterodimerization (3Norton J.D.

Nucleocytoplamic shuttling serves to modulate the functions of many signaling molecules and transcriptional proteins (19Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp.

Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that Id proteins possess both NLS and NES and can be actively transported between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in an importin- and CRM1/exportin-dependent manner (23Trausch-Azar J.S.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We report herein that the subcellular localization of Id1 in ECs is regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling during angiogenesis. Id1 is translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm in vascular ECs forming capillary-like structures in a CRM1/exportin-dependent manner. Interestingly, protein kinase A (PKA) appears to block the nuclear export of Id1, possibly via phosphorylation of Ser-5. These findings indicate that the function of Id1 as a transcription factor may be regulated by nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, which is under the control of PKA activity, during angiogenesis. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-Id1 and Id3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Rabbit anti-GFP anti-body was obtained from Medical & Biological Laboratories, rabbit anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody from Sigma, biotinylated antibody against rabbit immunoglobulins from Immuno-Biological Laboratories, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse immunoglobulins and rabbit immunoglobulins from Dako. Plasmids and Construction of Id1 Mutants—The mouse Id1 cDNA was cloned as described previously (5Nishiyama K. Takaji K. Kataoka K. Kurihara Y. Yoshimura M. Kato A. Ogawa H. Kurihara H. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2840-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For construction of the N- or C-terminally GFP-tagged Id1, an Id1 cDNA fragment was inserted into the XhoI/EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C2 expression vector (Clontech) or the XhoI/BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N3 expression vector (Clontech). Mutations in the NES-like region and putative PKA phosphorylation site were created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics, maintained in EBM medium (Clonetics, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions, and used at three to five passages for all experiments. EOMA cells (a cell line obtained from murine hemangioma) were maintained in Dullbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (10 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin). Transient transfection was performed with the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the cells were used 17-24 h later for experiments. Cells transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-derivatives were observed by fluorescent microscopy. Transfection efficiency in HUVECs was 30-40% using this method. Matrigel Tube Formation Assay—Formation of capillary-like structures by HUVECs was assessed on growth factor-reduced Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix preparation (BD Biosciences) (5Nishiyama K. Takaji K. Kataoka K. Kurihara Y. Yoshimura M. Kato A. Ogawa H. Kurihara H. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2840-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HUVECs (EOMA cells) were plated onto Matrigel-coated culture slides (Nunc) or dishes (Falcon) to a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 and incubated in medium-199 containing 5% FCS and 10 ng/ml human VEGF for appropriate times. HUVECs were also plated onto culture slides or dishes as controls and incubated in medium-199 containing 5% FCS and 10 ng/ml VEGF. For RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, Matrigel was liquefied using cell recovery solution (BD Sciences) according to the supplier's instruction, and the HUVECs contained in the Matrigel solution were then collected and used. Cultured HUVECs on culture plates were collected by treatment with trypsin. For a subset of experiments, HUVECs cultured on Matrigel for 20 to 24 h were treated with 10 nm of a specific inhibitor of CRM1/exportin, leptomycin B (LMB) (LC Laboratories), for 1 h and used in the following experiments. Preliminary experiments showed the dosage used and the duration of LMB treatment to be optimal for nuclear accumulation of Id1 in HUVECs. RT-PCR—Gene expression was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). After DNase I (Qiagen) treatment, total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the resultant cDNAs were amplified with Taq polymerase (Takara) in a thermocycler. The primer pairs used were as follows: for human Id1, 5′-AACCGCAAGGTGAGCAAGGT/GCGCTTCAGCGACACAAGAT-3′ (218 base pair PCR product for Id1 and 457 base pair PCR product for Id1′); for human Id1′, 5′-GCTGCTCTACGACATGAACG/TGGTCGGATCTGGATCTCAC-3′ (255-base pair PCR product); and for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCGGGCCTCCGAAACCATGA/GAACCAGATCTCTCACCAGG-3′ (318-base pair PCR product). Thermal cycling was performed for 22-30 cycles to maintain PCR conditions within the linear range of amplification before reaching saturation. Each cycle consisted of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 60 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C. Cell Fractionation and Western Blotting—Collected HUVECs were washed twice with cold PBS and suspended in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.3 mg/ml pepstatin, 7.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF). After centrifugation at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was used as a total cell extract. For extraction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, HUVECs were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 26% glycerol, 2.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.3 mg/ml pepstatin, 7.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF), and the suspension was vortexed and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The soluble fractions were used as the cytoplasmic extracts. The pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The soluble fractions were used as the nuclear extracts. Similar quantities of the soluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with an appropriate first antibody. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the signals were visualized using ECL or ECL plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). After detection of Id1 protein, the β-actin protein levels were assayed using the same membrane. For cell fractionation analysis, acetylated histone H3 and α-tubulin were probed as nuclear and cytoplasmic markers, respectively. Immunocytochemistry and Microscopic Analysis—Cultured HUVECs on Matrigel were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. HUVECs and COS7 cells on culture slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in 2% skim milk/0.05% Triton X-100/PBS including 20 pg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with the appropriate first antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS, the cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with biotin, and the signal was subsequently detected with FITC-conjugated streptavidin (Dako). Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) and then observed using a computer-assisted confocal microscope (Nikon D-ECLIPSE C1). Photomicrographs were obtained at 1-μm intervals and reconstituted using EZ-C1 software (Nikon). The dominant subcellular localization of Id1 was determined based on differences in fluorescent intensity between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. For quantitative analysis of subcellular localization of exogenous Id1, percentages of cells with nuclear localization of transfection were calculated. For analysis of dynamic time-lapse imaging of Id1, HUVECs transfected with Id1-EGFP were treated with 10 nm LMB and then imaged every 10 min on a TE300 microscope (Nikon) using a 20× Nikon objective lens (NA = 0.45) and an ORCA 100 cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and then analyzed using AquaCosmos imaging software (Hamamatsu). Stimulation and Inhibition of Protein Kinase A—To stimulate the PKA pathway, HUVECs were treated with an analogue of cAMP N6, 2′-O-dibutyryladenosine-3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt (Bt2cAMP, 500 μm) (Nacalai Tesque) or forskolin, a stimulator of adenylyl cyclase, (100 μm) (Sigma) (26Whelan M.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) for 2 h, 20-24 h after cultivation on Matrigel. To inhibit the PKA pathway, HUVECs cultured on culture slides were treated with H-89, a selective inhibitor of PKA (1 μm) (Sigma), or MDL 12,330A, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (30 μm) (Calbiochem), (26Whelan M.C. Senger D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for 4 h. In a subset of experiments, HUVECs were pretreated with an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX, 100 ng/ml) (Wako), and a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (20 μm) (Biomol) (23Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), for 30 min prior to PKA stimulation or inhibition. Statistical Analysis—Each assay experiment was carried out at least two times. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used to compare continuous values between two groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to represent statistically significant differences. Id1 Localization Is Predominantly Cytoplasmic in Vascular Endothelial Cells during Angiogenesis—To examine molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Id1 in angiogenesis, we used an in vitro angiogenesis model: HUVECs on Matrigel (5Nishiyama K. Takaji K. Kataoka K. Kurihara Y. Yoshimura M. Kato A. Ogawa H. Kurihara H. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2840-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous studies (5Nishiyama K. Takaji K.

Kobata T. Takahashi K. Tokunaga K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5801-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have shown overexpression of Id1 to augment angiogenesis while its knockdown inhibited angiogenesis in an in vitro angiogenesis model. With our assay system, following attachment to the Matrigel, ECs start to gradually form networks with each other, resulting in capillary-like structures (data not shown). The expression of TAL-1/SCL, another HLH factor involved in angiogenesis, was reported to be up-regulated during the formation of these capillary-like structures (29Lazrak M. Deleuze V. Noel D. Haouzi D. Chalhoub E. Dohet C. Robbins I. Mathieu D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we initially evaluated the expression levels of Id1 in HUVECs on Matrigel. RT-PCR analysis with a primer pair spanning exons 1 and 2 of Id1 showed Id1 mRNA levels to be comparable among different culture conditions, i.e. on uncoated slides and on Matrigel, both 3 and 24 h after plating (Fig. 1A). In addition to the expected 218-bp band for Id1 transcript, RT-PCR with this primer pair amplified another 457-bp band corresponding to Id1′, a splice variant of human Id1 (30Nehlin J.O. Hara E. Kuo W.L. Collins C. Campisi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Tamura Y. Sugimoto M. Ohnishi K. Sakai T. Hara E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR with its specific primers also confirmed the expression of Id1′ at similar levels among different conditions (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that mRNA levels of Id1 and Id1′ did not change significantly during angiogenesis. Furthermore, Western blot analysis, which detected Id1 but hardly Id1′ (data not shown), showed Id1 protein contents to also be comparable among the different conditions (Fig. 1B). In the following experiments, we focused on the behavior of Id1. To explore other Id1 regulatory mechanisms during angiogenesis, we next evaluated the subcellular localization of Id1 in HUVECs on Matrigel. Immunocytochemical analyses showed Id1 to be localized predominantly in the nucleus with seeding onto Matrigel (data not shown). Id1 subsequently showed gradual translocation into the cytoplasm of HUVECs along with capillary-like structure formation (Fig. 2, C-F), whereas in HUVECs cultured on uncoated slides Id1 remained in the nucleus throughout the assay (Fig. 2, A and B). These observations indicate that cytoplsamic translocation of Id1 is characteristic of HUVECs forming capillary-like structures. In contrast to Id1, Id3 remained in the nucleus during capillary-like structure formation (Fig. 2, G and H). Findings were similar in EOMA cells, a murine EC line (data not shown). We further biochemically evaluated the subcellular localization of Id1 in HUVECs during capillary-like structure formation. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared and qualified using specific antibodies for acetylated histone H3 and α-tubulin, respectively (Fig. 2I). Consistent with the immunostaining, Id1 was found mostly in the nuclei of HUVECs cultured on uncoated slides but shifted to the cytoplasmic fraction in HUVECs forming capillary-like structures (Fig. 2I). Taken together, these results suggest that Id1 is translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm during in vitro angiogenesis on Matrigel. Id1 Is Exported from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm in a CRM1/Exportin-dependent Manner—Recent studies have suggested nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Id proteins to be involved in the regulation of cellular functions (12Tu X.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7293-7297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that the same mechanism might operate during angiogenesis. To test our hypothesis, we first treated HUVECs with a CRM1/exportin inhibitor LMB for 1 h during capillary-like structure formation and analyzed the subcellular localization of Id1 by immunostaining. As expected, with LMB treatment, Id1 accumulated in the nucleus in most HUVECs forming capillary-like structures (Fig. 3). This result suggests that Id1 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a CRM1/exportin-dependent manner during capillary-like structure formation. To confirm the results for endogenous Id1, we examined the subcellular localization of exogenous Id1 tagged with EGFP in HUVECs. For this purpose, we generated two constructs of Id1: one in which EGFP was fused to the N terminus (EGFP-Id1) and the other the C terminus (Id1-EGFP) (Fig. 4A). When expression vectors encoding EGFP-Id1 or Id1-EGFP were transfected into HUVECs, intense EGFP signals tended to be detected in the cytoplasm in cells with high expression level even on uncoated plates, possibly due to saturated expression. Therefore, we analyzed the localization of exogenous Id1 in low expressing cells using both EGFP fluorescent signals and immunostaining with anti-EGFP antibody, and obtained essentially the same results. In accordance with the subcellular localization of endogenous Id1, Id1-EGFP was recognized mainly in the nuclei of transfected HUVECs on uncoated slides (94%). However, less EGFP-Id1 was localized in the nucleus (46%) (Fig. 4A). In HUVECs on Matrigel, Id1-EGFP was translocated to the cytoplasm, as was the case with endogenous Id1 (Fig. 4B). Quantitative analysis showed the percentage of cells with predominantly nuclear localization of Id1-EGFP to be significantly greater in the transfected HUVECs on uncoated slides than in those on Matrigel (Fig. 4C). The subcellular distribution pattern of EGFP expressed in HUVECs was not altered at any point in the assay. These results indicate that Id1-EGFP dynamics likely recapitulate those of endogenous Id1 in HUVECs during angiogenesis. Next, we analyzed the nuclear export of Id1 using EGFP-Id1, which tends to be localized in the cytoplasm even on uncoated slides. When treated with LMB, EGFP-Id1 accumulated in the nucleus in nearly all (99%) transfected HUVECs (Fig. 5B). Because Id1 contains a putative NES-like region (92-102) (Fig. 5A), we tested whether this sequence mediated the nucl"

Heterologous expression of GC-rich genes in E. coli poses a unique set of challenges, in comparison with other DNA. Overcoming these problems will generate increased flexibility in the production of proteins and metabolites in this host. Although most efforts for recombinant expression in this host are achieved using E. coli promoters and optimal ribosome-binding sites (RBS), 2The abbreviations used are: RBS, ribosome-binding site; Km, kanamycin; Cm, chloramphenicol; SD, Shine-Dalgarno; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; OB fold, oligonucleotide-binding fold; ORF, open reading frame; PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; UTR, untranslated region. 2The abbreviations used are: RBS, ribosome-binding site; Km, kanamycin; Cm, chloramphenicol; SD, Shine-Dalgarno; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; OB fold, oligonucleotide-binding fold; ORF, open reading frame; PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; UTR, untranslated region. it would be advantageous to express large pathways, consisting of many genes, without needing to change each promoter and RBS. Such a strategy would enable hybrid functionalities from multiple organisms using technology such as the fusing of two genomes (6Itaya M. Tsuge K. Koizumi M. Fujita K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15971-15976Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or transformation-associated recombination (7Leem S.H. Noskov V.N. Park J.E. Kim S.I. Larionov V. Kouprina N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e29Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we assess the ability of E. coli to express native DNA, including transcription and translation initiation regions, from the high GC α-bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris (8Larimer F.W. Chain P. Hauser L. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Do L. Land M.L. Pelletier D.A. Beatty J.T. Lang A.S. Tabita F.R. Gibson J.L. Hanson T.E. Bobst C. Torres J.L. Peres C. Harrison F.H. Gibson J. Harwood C.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), and we propose a novel method for enhancing expression of foreign transcripts, altering E. coli ribosomal protein S1 by directed evolution. A number of studies have examined the ability of E. coli to express high GC DNA. One in vitro study directly linked inefficient translation to the GC content from various organisms (9Voges D. Watzele M. Nemetz C. Wizemann S. Buchberger B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 601-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Others have discussed implications of secondary structure and its ability to regulate and control the strength of protein expression (10Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 361: 13-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 11Laursen B.S. Sorensen H.P. Mortensen K.K. Sperling-Petersen H.U. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The destruction of stable stem-loops by site-directed mutagenesis in the region of translation initiation of high GC genes has been shown to enhance protein expression (12Ishida M. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2767-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another method introduced a short leader ORF preceding a high GC gene to improve its expression, and suggested that it is beneficial to include an AT-rich translation termination region in the leader ORF that overlaps with the start codon of the high GC target gene (13Ishida M. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Finally, replacing GC-rich codons from one bacterium with those more commonly used by E. coli enabled a 10-fold increase in expression of a recombinant protein for crystallization purposes (14Heinz C. Karosi S. Niederweis M. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 790: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To improve expression from high GC heterologous mRNAs in E. coli, it is important to consider features involved in translation. Upstream of the start codon is the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), which contains the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence that is able to base pair with a complementary sequence on the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA (15Shine J. Dalgarno L. Nature. 1975; 254: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). However, the SD interaction was found to be nonessential for correct initiation (16Calogero R.A. Pon C.L.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating that prokaryotic ribosomes have other capacities for start site selection. Ribosomal protein S1, encoded by rpsA, has been shown to play critical roles in translation initiation and elongation (18Tzareva N.V. Makhno V.I. Boni I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Potapov A.P. Subramanian A.R. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 745-753PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been shown to promote transcriptional cycling in vitro (20Sukhodolets M.V. Garges S. Adhya S. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1505-1513Google Scholar). S1 interacts with mRNA upstream of the SD sequence (21Sengupta J. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11991-11996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and translation efficiency has been positively correlated to the presence of AU-rich sequences at this position of the UTR (22Komarova A.V. Tchufistova L.S. Supina E.V. Boni I.V. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2002; 8: 1137-1147Google Scholar, 23Komarova A.V. Tchufistova L.S. Dreyfus M. Boni I.V. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1344-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The requirement for S1 in translating mRNAs with a weak or no SD sequence has also been detailed (24Farwell M.A. Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3375-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). S1 is an essential protein required for the translation of most transcripts within E. coli (25Sorensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and it contains six repeats of the oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold, contained in other RNA-binding proteins, which raise the nonspecific affinity of the ribosome to single-stranded RNA (26Draper D.E. Reynaldo L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this regard, ribosomal protein S1 is an attractive target for improving the expression of GC-rich genes that cannot be efficiently translated in E. coli. We therefore employed directed evolution methods to S1 to generate S1 variants that can recognize GC-rich sequences. Media and Chemicals—Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and was supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate. Ampicillin was at 100 μg/μl, kanamycin was at 75 μg/μl, and chloramphenicol (Cm) was at 75 μg/μl. Oligonucleotides were from Invitrogen or from Alpha DNA (Montreal, Canada) and are listed in supplemental Table 1. o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid Constructs—To create plasmid pJRB320, E. coli rpsA under the control of its native promoter was amplified from the genome using KOD Hot Start Polymerase (Novagen). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned pZS*24MCS-1, a low copy plasmid (27Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). A mutation -2 bp upstream of the rpsA ATG start codon installed a unique BspHI restriction site upstream of the coding sequence. All constructs described herein were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MCLab). To generate pTB120, part of the lactose repressor gene lacI and the Ptac promoter was removed from pJF118EH (28Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and replaced with the E. coli rrnB terminator. The truncated lacZ gene missing its first 9 amino acids from pRS414 (29Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) was inserted downstream from the terminator. This plasmid allows for protein fusions to the BamHI site at the start of lacZ.To generate pTB130, the CAT gene was amplified from pACYC184 (New England Biolabs) by changing the start codon to CAG (30Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was inserted into pTB120 replacing the truncated lacZ gene to generate pTB130, which allows for protein fusions to CAT. Protein fusions listed in Table 2 were inserted into pTB120, and fusions to the CAT gene used for selection were inserted into pTB130. pJRB202 was created to study transcriptional fusions to lacZ. The plasmid is derived from pJF118EH (28Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and contains an rrnB terminator followed by the PlacO1 promoter and UTR upstream of the complete lacZ gene. The PlacO1 promoter can be removed using XmaI and EcoRI restriction sites and replaced with the promoter and UTR sequence from another gene, maintaining 27 bp of sequence from expression vector UTR upstream of the ATG start codon, including the SD region.

Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar), and the truncated lacZ from pTB120 was amplified by PCR and cloned downstream of PlacO1 to create pJRB40. An XbaI cut site was added to this construct upstream of the transcription start site using oligonucleotides annealed and cloned into Xho and EcoRI restriction sites. β-Galactosidase Measurements—β-Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate for each sample using flat bottom 96-well polypropylene plates (Grenier). 20 μl of overnight culture was diluted in 280 μl of Z-Buffer, and subsequently 4 μl of 0.1% SDS and 8 μl of chloroform were added. Plates were covered with aluminum seal film (Corning Glass) and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 s in a plate incubator/shaker (Eppendorf). After centrifugation, 50 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (dissolved in Z-buffer) was added to each well, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured in a plate reader (Bio-Tek) at 420 nm for ∼5 min at 30 °C. Slopes from the linear portion of the curve were obtained using KC Junior software. Activity was determined as described previously (31Arvidson D.N. Youderian P. Schneider T.D. Stormo G.D. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar). badD UTR Comparison—To compare various features of the BadD-LacZ protein fusion, we used either the 47 bp preceding the badD gene (Rpal UTR) or the 47 bp of the PlacO1 expression vector (E. coli UTR). Additionally, we compared either the first 19 native R. palustris badD codons fused to lacZ or the same amino acid sequence optimized for the most commonly used E. coli codons (32Grote A. Hiller K. Scheer M. Munch R. Nortemann B. Hempel D.C. Jahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Finally, to test the differences in the SD sequence between the R. palustris and PlacO1 expression vector UTRs, we replaced the 14 bp preceding the ATG start from the badD UTR with the corresponding sequence from the PlacO1 expression vector (Ec RBS). Constructs were generated by annealing complementary oligonucleotides with restriction site overhangs in 1× annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and slowly cooling to room temperature from 95 °C. Annealed oligonucleotides were then diluted in ligation buffer (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and were ligated into the appropriate vector generated from pJRB40xba. To test the expression from these clones, constructs were transformed to BW25113-Z1, and two independent colonies per construct were grown overnight in LB plus 0.2% glucose. The following day, 15 μl were used to inoculate 3 ml of LB plus 0.2% glucose with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were grown at 37 °C for 4 h until the A600 was 0.4 to 0.9, and cells were then placed on ice and used in a β-galactosidase assay as described above. Error-prone PCR—Mutagenic PCR was performed using the Gene Morph II mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 350 ng of plasmid pJRB320 or mutant variant was used as template, and the reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol to obtain medium mutagenesis rates of ∼20-fold amplification of the target sequence. Cloning and Mutant Library Generation—The mutant PCR product was purified using agarose gel electrophoresis and QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). Remaining parent template was removed using DpnI enzyme, and the purified digested product was ligated into an open vector of pJRB320 using Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). 10 μl of the ligation reaction was used to transform 100 μl of XL10 Gold Ultracompetent cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resultant library size was calculated (∼8,000–12,000 colonies), and clones were washed from each plate using 2.8 ml of LB medium and a sterile hockey stick. The washed library was vortexed miniprepped using QIAprep Spin Miniprep columns (Qiagen) and eluted using 1/10 concentration elution buffer. The library was subsequently concentrated under vacuum (Labconco). Mutant Selection and Screening—Approximately 125 ng of both rpsA library plasmid and selection plasmid containing the R. palustris DNA sequence fused to CAT (derived from pTB130) were electroporated into E. coli BW25113. Cells were plated onto LB containing appropriate antibiotics and variable Cm concentrations to restrict background growth of the library. The transformation efficiency was estimated using LB plates lacking Cm, with a target of ∼10,000 clones tested per selection plate. Approximately 20–24 potential positive clones were identified 48 h post-transformation. Cultures were miniprepped (Qiagen) and eluted in 1/10 elution buffer and dried to ∼5 μl. 2 μl of the potential positive plasmid preparation were digested using NotI (New England Biolabs), which cuts the CAT fusion selection plasmid without digesting the rpsA mutant plasmid. The reaction was heat-inactivated, and 2 μl was used to transform BW25113 with addition of 1 μl of the reporter plasmid (∼100 ng/μl) containing the R. palustris protein fusion to lacZ. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on these cells as stated above. The best new mutant identified by β-galactosidase assay was miniprepped and transformed into E. coli Top 10 (Invitrogen) using kanamycin selection to remove the reporter plasmid (confirmed by ampicillin susceptibility), and template was isolated for subsequent rounds of mutagenesis and DNA sequencing. Two independent colonies of each positive mutant with the appropriate protein fusion were tested in triplicate using the β-galactosidase assay, and the results reported here are the average of these data. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay—Overnight 3 ml of LB cultures containing wild type or mutant rpsA and BadR-CAT protein fusion were diluted 20-fold in fresh LB medium and grown to an A600 of 2.0. Cells were chilled on ice and then diluted in LB to a concentration of 107 cells/ml, and 1 μl of this stock was then spotted onto plates with increasing Cm concentrations ranging from 5 to 45 μg/μl. Increments of 1 μg/μl were used below 10 μg/μl, then increments of 2.5 μg/μl were used to 25 μg/μl, and finally 5 μg/μl increases in antibiotic concentration were used for the remaining plates. The MIC reported is the lowest concentration of Cm that restricted growth of a given construct after 16 h at 37 °C. Time Course Study and Quantitative PCR—60 ml of LB cultures were inoculated (1%) with overnight BW25113 transformed with the BadR-LacZ protein fusion along with either wild type, 4R, or 5R evolved rpsA constructs and grown in baffled Erlenmeyer shake flasks at 37 °C and at 200 rpm. Replicate cultures of each clone were performed. Samples were removed and chilled on ice prior to measuring the A600 or β-galactosidase activity. Samples removed during mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.49–0.75) were pelleted and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at -80 °C until RNA extraction by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were diluted in 1× DNase I buffer (Ambion) and treated with 0.5 μl of RNase OUT (Invitrogen) and 0.8 μl of DNase I (139 units/μl; Invitrogen). Samples were purified using acid/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed according to protocol (Invitrogen) with 150 ng of random hexamers and 150 ng of total E. coli RNA and 1 μl of SSIII reverse transcriptase. Reactions were diluted 3-fold with water upon completion. Real time PCR was performed with gene-specific PCR primers designed using MyPROBES software (33Rohlin L. Trent J.D. Salmon K. Kim U. Gunsalus R.P. Liao J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6046-6057Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) for lacZ and chaA, a housekeeping gene involved in potassium, sodium, and calcium ion regulation within the cell. The reactions were conducted on a Smart Cycler (Cepheid) with 2 μl of cDNA added per 25 μl of real time PCR sample using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen). A four-step program consisting of denaturation, annealing, extension, and data acquisition was used, and melt curves verified that only one species of DNA product was amplified using the primer pairs. Calibration curves were performed for each primer pair using genomic DNA template amounts over 4 orders of magnitude, and curves with linearity R2 values of at least 0.99 were used to determine the amount of lacZ transcript relative to the chaA control. The 5′-UTR of a GC-rich Gene Is Responsible for Translational Deficiency—To understand the elements of the high GC R. palustris mRNAs that are responsible for reduced translational efficiency in E. coli, we selected the badD gene from the well characterized benzoate degradation pathway for further study (34Egland P.G. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2102-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were generated that used the 47-bp DNA sequence preceding the start codon of badD and compared it with the UTR of equal length from the transcriptional start site of the PlacO1 expression vector (Fig. 1). Additionally, we compared differences in the beginning coding sequence of badD fused to lacZ, by using either native or codon-optimized DNA sequence (32Grote A. Hiller K. Scheer M. Munch R. Nortemann B. Hempel D.C. Jahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Finally, we designed a construct with R. palustris UTR and badD codons, but we replaced the 14 bp preceding the ATG with the corresponding 14 bp from the PlacO1 expression vector UTR to determine the effect of an optimized SD sequence on activity. The results of this experiment confirm that the R. palustris UTR causes a translational deficiency such that no activity can be measured regardless of whether using the native coding sequence or one optimized for E. coli codons (Fig. 1). These results complement an earlier study indicating that AT-rich sequences derived from the antiterminator of the E. coli rrn operons enhanced translation up to ∼3.6-fold when placed upstream of a strong SD (22Komarova A.V. Tchufistova L.S. Supina E.V. Boni I.V. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2002; 8: 1137-1147Google Scholar). Optimizing the beginning coding sequence from R. palustris to E. coli codons enables an ∼2-fold increase in expression with the constructs containing the PlacO1 expression vector UTR. Finally, the effect of switching the 14 bp preceding the ATG start site from the R. palustris UTR with the corresponding region containing the SD sequence from the PlacO1 expression construct allows for a very small amount of β-galactosidase expression, showing that the presence of a strong RBS alone is not enough to rescue the translational deficiency of R. palustris transcripts in E. coli. Directed Evolution of rpsA—Once the translational deficiency of foreign transcripts was determined, we sought to alleviate this problem by directed evolution. We employed a pool of modified rpsA constructs in which the sequences of rpsA were mutagenized by error-prone PCR. These rpsA variants were expressed from their native promoter on a low copy plasmid to avoid growth deficiency because of overexpression (35McGinness K.E. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13454-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the chromosomal copy of rpsA was maintained. An in vivo selection system was designed in which mutants of the rpsA gene were co-expressed in the presence of a protein fusion of the R. palustris promoter UTR, and beginning coding sequence to the CAT gene conferring resistance to this antibiotic. The growth rate of E. coli cells harboring these two plasmids incubated in media containing Cm reflects the level of CAT expression that in turn depends on the efficacy of expression from the GC-rich UTR and gene leader sequence. The selection pressure was increased after each round of directed evolution by increasing the concentration of Cm. After selection toward the badR fusion construct, two S1 mutants, 4R and 5R, enabled growth to MIC values of 25 and 35 μg/μl Cm, whereas the wild type S1 construct allowed growth to an MIC Cm value of 7.5 μg/μl, indicating our successful isolation of rpsA variants that enhanced expression from the badR construct. To further improve our selection of rpsA variants with enhanced activity toward high GC templates, we applied a β-galactosidase screen to our selection method. Multiple positive clones were chosen after selection on Cm plates, and the plasmids harboring the mutant rpsA was then employed in a screen using a fusion of the R. palustris gene sequence to lacZ. Positive clones were screened in parallel for β-galactosidase activity alongside the parent clone to identify the mutant with the highest activity toward its target gene. This mutant was then subjected to a subsequent round of mutagenesis, selection, and screening to continue improving translation efficiency of the R. palustris DNA sequence. Five rounds of selection and screening were performed, resulting in a mutant (5R) that enabled 12.0-fold higher β-galactosidase expression than the wild type S1 (Fig. 2a). To further investigate the ability to enhance expression of a different R. palustris gene, we used the fourth generation rpsA mutant (4R), evolved toward badR, as a starting point for increasing expression of the CrtI protein fusion. This 4R clone exhibited 2-fold higher activity toward the crtI construct than the wild type S1. After three rounds of selection, a mutant (3C) was isolated, which increased activity from the LacZ fusion by 8.0-fold (Fig. 2b). We attempted a fourth round of selection toward the crtI construct, but we were unable to isolate further enhanced variants, suggesting that the protein may be saturated for mutations that enhance CrtI-LacZ expression or that it had reached a local maximum because of previously accumulated mutations. To remove the possibility that selected variants are specialized to translate only one DNA sequence, we adopted a strategy to evolve rpsA against multiple gene targets (Fig. 2c). We used an S1 mutant (4R) as the starting point for evolution toward the BadD protein fusion for one round of selection and screening. This clone (5D) was then selected and screened four additional rounds toward a protein fusion of BadK, the final gene in the badH–K operon, including the four genes upstream of badK expressed from their native promoter and UTR (34Egland P.G. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2102-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis of the Selected Variants—After each round of selection and screening, we sequenced the highest activity clone to determine newly acquired mutations. On average, we observed 1–3 new coding mutations per round of directed evolution (Fig. 2). The 5th round mutant evolved toward badR accumulated 10 mutations, of which 5 mutations map to the 3rd and 4th repeats of the S1 OB fold domain, whereas other mutations occurred in the 1st, 5th, or 6th domains. After three rounds of evolution toward the CrtI protein fusion, an additional four unique mutations were accumulated, three of which map to the 3rd and 4th repeats of the OB fold domain. The final mutant evolved towards multiple R. palustris constructs (9K) collected an additional 10 amino acid mutations unique from the parent clone (4R). Four mutations were lost during the creation of S1 mutant 9K, including a Q261H mutation occurring in the first round of evolution toward badK, which was again mutated in the 3rd round of selection toward this construct (H261L). Additionally, three mutations (A471V, Y477D, and A530T) occurring in the 6th repeat of the S1 domain were lost during the second round of mut"

https://openalex.org/W3189912187,"As biologists increasingly rely upon computational tools, it is imperative that they be able to appropriately apply these tools and clearly understand the methods the tools employ. Such tools must have access to all the relevant data and knowledge and, in some sense, ""understand"" biology so that they can serve biologists' goals appropriately and ""explain"" in biological terms how results are computed.We describe a deduction-based approach to biocomputation that semiautomatically combines knowledge, software, and data to satisfy goals expressed in a high-level biological language. The approach is implemented in an open source web-based biocomputing platform called BioDeducta, which combines SRI's SNARK theorem prover with the BioBike interactive integrated knowledge base. The biologist/user expresses a high-level conjecture, representing a biocomputational goal query, without indicating how this goal is to be achieved. A subject domain theory, represented in SNARK's logical language, transforms the terms in the conjecture into capabilities of the available resources and the background knowledge necessary to link them together. If the subject domain theory enables SNARK to prove the conjecture--that is, to find paths between the goal and BioBike resources--then the resulting proofs represent solutions to the conjecture/query. Such proofs provide provenance for each result, indicating in detail how they were computed. We demonstrate BioDeducta by showing how it can approximately replicate a previously published analysis of genes involved in the adaptation of cyanobacteria to different light niches.Through the use of automated deduction guided by a biological subject domain theory, this work is a step towards enabling biologists to conveniently and efficiently marshal integrated knowledge, data, and computational tools toward resolving complex biological queries."
