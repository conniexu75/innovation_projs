https://openalex.org/W1499452131,"The electric potential field around native horse cytochrome c and 12 singly modified 4-carboxy-2,4-dinitrophenyl- (CDNP) lysine cytochromes c is asymmetric, mainly because of the inhomogeneous distribution of negative charges. Dipole moments of 325 and 308 debye, (1.08.10(-27) and 1.03.10(-27) coulomb.meter), respectively, were calculated for horse ferri- and ferrocytochrome c. The angle between the heme plane and the dipole vector of horse ferricytochrome c is 33 degrees and increases 1 degree upon reduction to the ferrous form. Dipole moments of the CDNP-lysine cytochromes c differ from that of native cytochrome c by as much as 140 debye in magnitude and 45 degrees in direction. It is proposed that its dipole moment causes cytochrome c to orient itself in the electric fields of its redox partners, and that the CDNP-lysine cytochromes c, which have different dipole moments, do not form a productive complex. Reorientation to the correct position for electron transfer increases the activation energy and lowers the rate of reaction. This model describes quantitatively the relative activities of those CDNP-lysine cytochromes c which are modified outside of the interaction domain and it allows correction of the activities of those modified inside the domain, on the front surface of the molecule, for the change in dipole moment. The interaction domain for the reaction with cytochrome c reductase includes in decreasing order of involvement lysines 13, 72, 86, 27, and 87. That for the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase is slightly smaller, with lysines 13, 72, 86, and 27. The cytochrome c peroxidase domain is the largest of all and is defined by lysines 72, 86, 13, 87, 27,, and 73. All refined interaction domains encompass the exposed heme edge and are to a large extent overlapping, indicating that electron transfer takes place at or close to this prosthetic group and that cytochrome c must move on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane during electron transport between reductase and oxidase. For a quantitative description of the electrostatic interaction of cytochrome c with other molecules, it is essential to take into account the totality of its charge configuration."
https://openalex.org/W1563405664,"We have prepared radioiodinated purified platelet-derived growth factor (125I-PDGF) which retains full mitogenic activity. The binding of 125I-PDGF to Swiss 3T3 cells is saturable and highly competed by whole blood serum, purified unlabeled PDGF, and by material from each stage in the purification of PDGF from platelet-rich plasma. Other purified mitogens and substances tested do not compete. 125I-PDGF binding to fibroblasts, 3T3 cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells shows an apparent dissociation constant of 10(-11) M, comparable to the range in which PDGF is mitogenic. A clone of Swiss 3T3 cells obtained from a population selected repeatedly against mitogenic response to PDGF shows a greatly reduced mitogenic response to PDGF and binds only 5% as much 125I-PDGF/cell. The binding capacity of the different cell types tested ranges from 2,500 binding sites/cell on the poorly responding variant to 390,000 binding sites/cell on one strain of Swiss 3T3 cells. Cell types that do not respond to PDGF do not show specific high affinity binding of 125I-PDGF. At 4 degrees C, 125I-PDGF binding to monolayer cultures is relatively slow. Equilibrium binding of low concentrations of 125I-PDGF is not achieved during 7 h unless the binding medium is constantly mixed. 125I-PDGF binding at 4 degrees C shows a broad pH optimum between 6.3 and 8.0. Binding does not seem to require Ca2+ or Mg2+ but is reduced more than 6-fold if both monovalent and divalent salts are omitted. The initial rate of 125I-PDGF binding is greater at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C but cell-associated 125I begins to decline soon after reaching a peak value at 30-60 min. Coincident with this decline, trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I appears in the medium and the binding capacity of the cells declines. These phenomena suggest that PDGF and its receptor may be internalized and degraded."

https://openalex.org/W1572137657,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has previously been shown to bind to a specific high affinity receptor on human foreskin fibroblasts. The present study was carried out to characterize some of the cellular events resulting from the interaction of the ligand with its receptor. Radiolabeled PDGF was rapidly internalized and degraded after binding to the cells. The degradation was complete and was inhibited by low concentrations of the lysosomotropic agents, chloroquine, ammonium chloride, or methylamine, suggesting that the degradation occurs in the lysosomes. The cellular binding capacity for PDGF decreased after exposure of the cells to PDGF at 37 degrees C. This down regulation of the PDGF receptor was optimal after a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C and half-maximal at 0.5 nM concentration of PDGF. The binding capacity was restored when the PDGF-containing medium was changed to medium without PDGF; the binding capacity increased from 40 to 80% od the initial value after a 4-h incubation at 37 degrees C. The reappearance on the cell surface of PDGF-binding sites was dependent on protein synthesis and totally blocked by cycloheximide (20 micrograms/ml). Thus, either the receptor has to be resynthesized after internalization or, alternatively, any step in the recycling of used receptors is dependent on protein synthesis. Exposure of the cells to PDGF also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the binding capacity for epidermal growth factor which has a distinct receptor on these cells. In contrast, epidermal growth factor did not modulate the PDGF binding capacity, lending no support to the idea that the receptors for epidermal growth factor and PDGF are processed in a common pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1910226981,"Several hemoglobins and bovine myoglobin are shown to undergo autooxidation reactions promoted by anions. The reduced protein in the presence of oxygen and anion yields the anion complex of the oxidized (Met) species and a second product that is almost certainly superoxide. The second product can be detected by its reduction of cytochrome c3+ at the same rates and in the same amount as the Met species. Anions are increasingly effective as promoters in the same order as their strengths as nucleophiles, e.g. Cl- less than F- less than OCN- less than SCN- less than N3- less than CN-. Rates are directly proportional to anion concentrations. A linear dependence of rate upon [H+] is also observed and can be related to the protonation of a strongly acidic group. Globin from hemoglobin A and hemes with altered 2,4-substituents gave reconstituted hemoglobins that autooxidize at rates that decrease with the electron-withdrawing power of the substituent: acetyl greater than vinyl greater than hydrogen greater than ethyl. Changes in rate with globin structure can be interpreted in terms of steric access to the ligand binding site; the more sterically restricted is the site, the slower is the reaction. The effects of [O2] on the rate vary with the degree of saturation with O2. At high O2 levels (e.g. from saturation to the point where 5% deoxyHbA and 95% oxyHbA are present), a decrease in [O2] results in an increase in the rate of azide-promoted autooxidation. At O2 levels with from 5 to 75% deoxyHbA, the rate remains nearly constant. At still lower levels with oxyHbA less than 25%, the rate decreases as [O2] is lowered. Exposure to CO reduces the rate. The reaction mechanism for anion-induced autooxidation must provide for the stoichiometric formation of a cytochrome c3%-reducing species (presumably, superoxide), the anion acting as a nucleophile in the rate-determining step, the facilitation by protons, the sensitivity of the rate to the electronegativity of heme iron, and the varied effects of [O2] upon the rate. These findings can not be fully accommodated by mechanisms in which the Met species forms either via dissociative loss of superoxide from the oxy species followed by anion binding or via displacement of protonated dioxygen from oxyheme upon nucleophilic attack of the anion at heme iron. A consistent mechanism is the reaction of protonated deoxy species with the anion followed by the reaction of Fe2+-anion complex with O2 to give Fe3+-anion and (formula, see text). Here, the deoxy rather than oxy species is involved in Fe2+ oxidation to Fe3+; O2 can serve as one-electron acceptor but not while serving as an iron-bound ligand. A precise non-iron site for electron transfer from ferrous porphyrin to O2 remains unlocated but a process involving the porphyrin pi-system has analogy in simple heme, flavin, or other organic donor reactions with O2 that yield superoxide..."

https://openalex.org/W1530320727,"Immunoprecipitates containing the transforming protein of the avian sarcoma virus, Y73, together with its associated tyrosine-specific protein kinase, have an activity which will phosphorylate the synthetic peptide Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Asn-Glu-Tyr-Thr-Ala-Arg at the tyrosine residue. This peptide corresponds to 10 out of 11 amino acids surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine in both pp60src and P90, the transforming proteins of Rous sarcoma virus and Y73 virus, respectively. The apparent Km for phosphorylation of the peptide was about 5 mM. A second peptide with the sequence Lys-Leu-Ile-Asp-Asn-Glu-Tyr-Thr-ala-Arg differing from the first peptide only by the absence of the glutamic acid 4 residues from the tyrosine was also phosphorylated, but the apparent Km for the reaction was 40 mM. Several sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in viral transforming proteins have been found to have one or more glutamic acids close to the phosphorylated tyrosine on the NH2-terminal side. Taken together with our in vitro phosphorylation studies, this suggests that the primary sequence surrounding target tyrosines may play a role in recognition of substrates by tyrosine protein kinases, and in particular, that glutamic acid residues on the NH2-terminal side may be important."
https://openalex.org/W1502660436,"Chemical analysis of intact leukotriene A4 showed that vertebrate albumins prolonged its aqueous half-life. At pH 7.4, leukotriene A4 hydrolyzed by first order reaction kinetics with rate constants inversely proportional to the albumin concentration. The stabilizing effect of albumin varied quantitatively among different species. Certain agents, such as warfarin, that interact with the site I binding region of albumin reversed its stabilizing effect. Sequestration and exposure of leukotriene A4 to a hydrophobic, alkaline microenvironment of albumin would account for the results. The amino acid sequences Lys-Ala-Trp-Ala-Val-Ala-Arg from residues 211-217 of human albumin or Lys-Ala-Trp-Ser-Val-Ala-Arg from residues 210-216 of bovine albumin are compatible with this requirement. The persistence of leukotriene A4 in the presence of albumin confirms and extends our recent observations on its uniform and predictable influence on eicosanoid stability. The significance of this influence is uncertain; however, albumin can no longer be viewed as inert considering its capacity to modify the stability of several, structurally diverse eicosanoids."
https://openalex.org/W1545990390,"The insulin-like effects of ionic zinc (Zn2+) were studied in isolated rat adipocytes. Concentrations of Zn2+ between 250 and 1000 microM stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport and glucose metabolism to CO2, glyceride-fatty acid, and glyceride-glycerol. Selective stimulation of the pentose phosphate cycle was observed since a Zn2+-induced increase in glucose carbon 1 oxidation persisted even when glucose transport was blocked with 50 microM cytochalasin B or when transport was no longer rate-limiting for metabolism at high concentrations of glucose. Enhanced pentose phosphate cycle activity may have been due to a selective inhibition of glutathione reductase by the ion, which was also accompanied by a fall in cellular glutathione content. Zn2+ also inhibited lipolysis stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agent ritodrine in the absence of glucose. The effects of Zn2+ on glucose oxidation and stimulated rates of lipolysis were inhibited by extracellular catalase, indicating that they were largely a result of H2O2 generation. The H2O2 production appeared for the most part to be caused by zinc-catalyzed autoxidation of sulfhydryl groups present on external cell membranes, although involvement of sulfhydryl groups on bovine serum albumin in the buffer could also have contributed. The insulin-like effects of Zn2+ in adipocytes are therefore caused not only by direct effects of the ion on intracellular metabolism but also by indirect effects related to H2O2 generation."
https://openalex.org/W1529315337,"Two homobifunctional cross-linking reagents have been used to cross-link 125I-platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to a cell surface component with an approximate Mr = 164,000 that has many characteristics of a specific PDGF receptor. Excess unlabeled PDGF competed for labeling of this component, while high concentrations of fibroblast growth factor, insulin, epidermal growth factor, low density lipoprotein or acetylated low density lipoprotein had no effect. Preincubation of cells with 125I-PDGF at 37 degrees C reduced specific 125I-PDGF binding (down regulation) and produced a parallel decrease in the amount of the 164,000-dalton receptor available for labeling. The 164,000-dalton component contains at least some protein that is accessible to trypsin in the extracellular medium. A complex of comparable Mr is seen on all PDGF-responsive cell types examined, but not on a nonresponsive cell type. 125I-PDGF does not become covalently cross-linked to this component in the absence of a cross-linking reagent."

https://openalex.org/W1582146722,"Guanine nucleotides were observed to modify the binding of 125I-angiotensin II to rat hepatic plasma membrane receptors. GTP and its nonhydrolyzable analogues greatly increased the dissociation rate of bound 125I-angiotensin II and altered hormone binding to the receptor under equilibrium conditions. In the absence of GTP, 125I-angiotensin II labeled both high affinity sites (Kd1 = 0.46 nM, N1 = 650 fmol/mg) and low affinity sites (Kd2 = 4.1 nM, N2 = 1740 fmol/mg). In the presence of guanine nucleotides, the affinities of the two sites were unchanged, but the number of high affinity sites decreased markedly to 52 fmol/mg. In analogous experiments using the angiotensin II antagonist, 125I-sarcosine1,Ala8-angiotensin II (125I-saralasin), guanine nucleotides minimally affected the interaction of 125I-saralasin with its receptor, increasing the dissociation rate 1.9-fold and the Kd 1.4-fold. The guanine nucleotide inhibition of agonist binding required a cation such as Na+ or Mg2+, with a maximal effect occurring at about 1 mM Mg2+. In liver plasma membranes prepared in EDTA, angiotensin II inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities by 30% and 10%, respectively. Angiotensin II also caused a 40% inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in intact hepatocytes, with a half-maximal effect occurring at 1 nM. The inhibition by angiotensin II of adenylate cyclase in membranes and of cAMP levels in intact cells could be reversed by the antagonist sarcosine1,Ile8-angiotensin II. Vasopressin caused a smaller 26% inhibition of glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The ability of angiotensin II to inhibit cyclic AMP synthesis may provide an explanation for the observed effects of guanine nucleotides on 125I-angiotensin II binding to plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1601854650,"The mechanism of prostaglandin synthase-dependent (bi)sulfite (hydrated sulfur dioxide) oxidation was investigated using an enzyme preparation derived from ram seminal vesicles. The horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of (bi)sulfite was used as a model system. Incubation of (bi)sulfite with prostaglandin synthase and arachidonic acid, 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid, or H2O2 results in the formation of the reactive sulfur trioxide anion radical (SO3(-)). The horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 system also oxidizes (bi)sulfite to SO3(-). This free radical reacts with oxygen resulting in oxygen consumption by these incubations. The free radical was detected with the indirect electron spin resonance technique of spin trapping. The SO3(-) radical adduct formed by the reaction of SO3(-) with the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, gives a nitroxide free radical with a nearly unique electron spin resonance spectrum (aH = 16.0 G and aN = 14.7 G). Using the spin-trapping technique, the SO3(-) could be detected even in incubations of guinea pig lung microsomes. When arachidonic acid-derived prostaglandin G2 was the source of hydroperoxide, formation of SO3(-) could be inhibited by indomethacin. When 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid or hydrogen peroxide was used to drive the enzymatic oxidation of (bi)sulfite, indomethacin had no effect. This hydroperoxidase activity was not nearly as heat-labile as the cyclo-oxygenase reaction which forms prostaglandin G2. Finally, the peroxidatic oxidation of (bi)sulfite may occur in vivo in competition with the mitochondrial sulfite oxidase, which oxidizes (bi)sulfite to sulfate without the formation of free radicals."

The increases were as great as those with physiological doses of glucagon to intact rats. Dexamethasone alone increased argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinase 1.2-fold.

https://openalex.org/W1545478999,"We have located and sequenced the gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III (CoIII) in Neurospora crassa mitochondria. The CoIII gene is located downstream from the small rRNA gene within a cluster of tRNA genes and is coded by the same strand as the tRNA and the rRNA genes. Like the tRNA and the rRNA genes, the CoIII gene is also flanked by the GC-rich palindromic DNA sequences which are highly conserved in N. crassa mitochondria. The CoIII coding sequence predicts a protein 269 amino acids long including 8 tryptophan residues. All 8 tryptophan residues are coded for by UGA. This supports our previous conclusion based on the anticodon sequence of N. crassa mitochondrial tryptophan tRNA and provides evidence for the notion that use of UGA as a codon for tryptophan rather than chain termination may be a feature common to most mitochondrial protein synthesis systems. The close correspondence between the amino acid composition of N. crassa CoIII and that of the protein predicted by the CoIII gene sequence suggests that unlike in mammalian mitochondria, AUA is a codon for isoleucine and not for methionine in N. crassa mitochondria. The N. crassa CoIII sequence shows strong homologies to the corresponding yeast and human proteins (53 and 47%, respectively). The overall hydrophobic character of the protein is consistent with suggestions that most of CoIII is embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1517856266,"Cultured lymphoblasts derived from infants with Menkes' disease exhibit the same increased avidity for copper as do fibroblasts and most extrahepatic tissues from these patients. The Menkes' cells preferentially take up not only copper but also, on exposure to elevated metal concentrations, the other metallothionein-binding metals, zinc and cadmium. Menkes' lymphoblasts contain larger amounts of metallothionein than normal cells following exposure to each of these metals; the amount bound to this protein quantitatively accounted for the total cellular increment in metal in Menkes' cells. Induction of metallothionein synthesis caused both normal and Menkes' cells to subsequently take up increased amounts of 67Cu. These observations suggest that an enhanced capacity of Menkes' cells to accumulate metallothionein may be responsible for their increased uptake and retention of copper."
https://openalex.org/W1523106215,"Two photosensitive iodocyanopindolol derivatives, 1-(4-azidobenzimidyl)-3,3-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-7-(2-cyano-3-iodoindol-4-yloxy)-1,4-diazaheptane (ICYP-azide-1) and 1-(4-azidobenzoyl)-3,3-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-7-(2-cyano-3-iodoindol-4-yloxy)-1,4-diazaheptane (ICYP-azide-2) have been prepared. [125I]ICYP-azide-1 and -2 (specific radioactivity up to 2.2 Ci/mumol) bind specifically and with very high affinity (KD = 40-45 pM) to beta-adrenergic receptors of turkey erythrocyte membranes. When [125I]ICYP-azide-1 or -2 were incubated with membranes and UV-irradiated, two polypeptides (Mr = 40,000 and 50,000) were specifically photolabeled as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These polypeptides may represent subunits of the beta-adrenergic receptor. The yield of specific covalent label incorporation into both polypeptides was up to 17.2% with [125I]ICYP-azide-2 when expressed as fraction of total beta-receptor binding sites. Since the Mr = 40,000 polypeptide was labeled predominantly and since covalent incorporation had the same concentration dependence as reversible specific binding, this polypeptide could contain a beta-adrenergic ligand binding site. Due to the low working concentration (10-100 pM) of [125I]ICYP-azide-1 and -2, nonspecific labeling of membrane proteins was extremely low. The new photoaffinity labels should therefore become valuable tools for probing beta-receptor structure."
https://openalex.org/W1575045356,"Prostaglandin synthase is a multi-enzyme complex which catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid to the various prostaglandins. During the oxygenation, the enzyme is self-deactivated and, on the basis of ESR data, it has been proposed to form a self-destructive free radical. The free radical was suggested to form from the oxygen lost from prostaglandin G2 during its reduction to prostaglandin H2, and the destructive species was therefore thought to be an oxygen-centered free radical, tentatively identified as the hydroxy radical. We have reinvestigated this ESR signal (g = 2.005) and have concluded, with the aid of the known ESR parameters for the hydroxy and other oxygen-centered free radicals, that the free radical formed during the oxygenation is neither a hydroxy nor any known oxygen-centred radical. Prostaglandin synthase is thought to be a hemoprotein, so this unknown ESR signal was compared with the previously observed free radical formed by the reaction of H2O2 with methemoglobin. This comparison indicates that the free radical formed by the reaction of prostaglandin G2 with ram seminal vesicles is hemoprotein-derived and may be formed by the oxidation of an amino acid(s) located near the iron of the heme."

https://openalex.org/W1597580989,"A soluble RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was purified from the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. A single virus-specific protein designated as p63 (or NCVP4) copurified with this activity. The purified polymerase was free of ribonuclease activity and was shown to copy poliovirion RNA when oligo(U) was added to the in vitro reaction mixture. Characterization of the product RNA by electrophoresis in methylmercury (II) hydroxide-agarose gels showed that genome-sized copies of poliovirion RNA were synthesized in vitro by the purified polymerase. The product RNA was shown to be heteropolymeric, complementary to virion RNA, and covalently linked to oligo(U). The product RNA contained the expected distribution of UMP and GMP containing dinucleotide pairs which included a very low frequency of CpG pairs. The amount, size distribution, and rate of synthesis of product RNA was very dependent on the in vitro reaction conditions. Full sized product RNA was synthesized in about 6 min when reaction conditions were used that yielded maximum elongation rates (pH 8.0, 7 mM Mg2+, 37 degrees C). Under these conditions, most of the product RNA recovered from a 1-h reaction was full sized. Thus, the polymerase was found to specifically initiate synthesis at the 3'-end of the template using an oligo(U) primer and to carry out an elongation reaction at about 1250 nucleotides/min that resulted in the synthesis of full sized product RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1517219983,"The effects of hypothyroidism on the hepatic alpha 1-receptor system were studied in isolated rat liver cells. Phenylephrine and vasopressin caused concentration-dependent activation of glycogen phosphorylase and release of 45Ca from 45Ca-loaded cells in either normal or thyroidectomized rats. However, the magnitude of both responses to phenylephrine was markedly suppressed after thyroidectomy and could be restored to near normal levels by in vivo treatment with 1-triiodothyronine (0.25 mg/kg/day) for 4 days. The potency of vasopressin to induce phosphorylase activation and 45Ca release was only slightly reduced by thyroidectomy. Binding of [3H]prazosin to putative alpha 1-receptors in purified liver plasma membranes revealed that the above changes were accompanied by a decrease in the density of binding sites from 567 +/- 51 fmol/mg of protein in controls to 326 +/- 51 fmol/mg in thyroidectomized rats and a return to 498 +/- 23 fmol/mg in thyroidectomized rats treated with 1-triiodothyronine. The affinity of binding sites for [3H]prazosin or for alpha-receptor agonists was the same in the three groups of rats and affinity for epinephrine was unaffected by the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (30-100 microM). From these findings, it appears that a reduction in the number of hepatic alpha 1-receptors is responsible for the selective decrease in alpha-adrenergic responses in the hypothyroid rat liver. These changes are opposite to those previously reported for hepatic beta-receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1577820429,"Chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins have been examined as substrates for cGMP-dependent and cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Of the four HMG proteins only HMG 14 contained a major high affinity site which could be phosphorylated by both enzymes, preferentially by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. One mol of 32P was incorporated/mol of HMG 14. Kinetic analysis revealed apparent Km and Vmax of 40.5 microM and 14.7 mumol/min/mg, respectively, for cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and 123 microM and 11.1 mumol/min/mg, respectively, for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Tryptic maps of 32P-labeled phosphopeptides of HMG 14 demonstrated phosphorylation of the same site by both enzymes. The tryptic fragment containing the major phosphorylation site was identified by amino acid composition and sequence as HMG 14 (residues 4-13): H-Lys-Val-Ser(P)-Ser-Ala-Glu-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-OH. HMG 14 and HMG 17 also contained minor sites which could be phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Tryptic phosphopeptides mapping suggested that the same minor site was phosphorylated on both HMG 14 and 17. On the basis of amino acid composition, the tryptic peptides carrying the minor phosphorylation sites were identified as H-Leu-Ser(P)-Ala-Lys representing residues 23-26 and 27-30 of HMG 14 and HMG 17, respectively."

A mixture of freshly isolated liver parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells failed to internalize and degrade the 125I-hemoglobin.haptoglobin added, although it retained the ability to bind the molecule. The liver parenchymal cells in primary culture also lacked the ability to degrade 125I-hemoglobin.haptoglobin, although they bound the molecule more extensively as compared with the freshly isolated liver cells. It was confirmed that the 125I-hemoglobin.haptoglobin which was bound to the freshly isolated liver parenchymal cells localized on the outer surface of liver plasma membranes. Scatchard plots revealed the existence of two binding sites for 125I-hemoglobin-haptoglobin on the isolated liver plasma membrane: an apparent high affinity binding site (Kd = 1.3 X 10(-7) M) and an apparent low affinity binding site (Kd = 4.0 X 10(-6) M) at 37 degrees C. In contrast, freshly isolated liver parenchymal cells had only an apparent low affinity binding site (Kd = 1.4 X 10(-6) M) at 37 degrees C. Impairment of the apparent high affinity binding site during the isolation procedure with collagenase seemed to be related to loss of the ability to internalize and degrade the 125I-hemoglobin.haptoglobin molecules into the freshly isolated liver parenchymal cells or liver parenchymal cells in primary culture."

After 3 h of starvation, purine synthesis via the de novo pathway decreased 90% and via the salvage pathway decreased 60%. Cycloheximide and puromycin each reduced de novo synthesis by 96% and salvage synthesis by 72%. The decrease in purine synthesis de novo after removal of the amino acid was of first order kinetics and was fully and rapidly reversed by reconstitution with the amino acid. The synthesis of alpha-N-formylglycinamide ribonucleotide declined 97% after amino acid starvation; the synthesis of purines from 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside decreased 41%.

The enzyme is capable of catalyzing the transfer of phosphate from nucleoside monophosphates to the 5'-hydroxyl of any other nucleoside, but shows a decided preference for purine deoxynucleoside phosphate acceptors. A short lived phosphoryl enzyme intermediate has been trapped by rapid denaturation in presence of [32P]AMP. The steady state kinetics of this enzyme is found to be fully consistent with a branched ping pong pathway involving a compulsory phosphoryl enzyme intermediate from which phosphate may be transferred to nucleoside or to water. With appropriately chosen substrates, parallel line reciprocal plots were obtained, provided that both products of the branched pathway were taken into account in the rate measurements. Conversely, when only transphosphorylation was measured, converging reciprocal plots were obtained. Accordingly, assays were devised for the measurement of three velocity components: transphosphorylation, hydrolysis, and the sum of both reactions. Competitive inhibition of the transferase reaction by higher concentrations of either substrate is attributed to deadend interactions. Instead of being inhibited by the formation of a putative E-P.AMP complex, however, the phosphatase reaction is accelerated almost 2-fold."

The specific activity of the wild type enzyme was 43,200 units/mg, while that of the mutant enzyme was 3,430 units/mg, less than 8% of the wild type activity. Isoelectric focusing also revealed differences in the protein from mutant and wild type. The activity of the wild type enzyme was separated into two peaks with isoelectric points of 9.6 and 9.0. In contrast, the activity of the mutant enzyme focused in a single peak with a pI of 9.4. These results indicate that the mutation in the FB2 strain affects the structural gene for RNase H. The molecular weight of both enzymes was determined by gel filtration as well as NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to be identical. Both enzymes are very sensitive to increased temperatures and show indistinguishable rates of inactivation. The basis for the heterogeneity of the isoelectric point and the altered activity of the mutant enzyme is still unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1560537207,"Plasmid subclones of the 5' and 3' regions of the beta major-globin gene have been used as probes to assay the level and character of the transcripts of this gene in differentiating Friend erythroleukemia cells treated with dexamethasone. Using an S1 nuclease protection protocol, it is shown that dexamethasone reduces the amount of precursor-specific sequences in differentiating Friend cells within 30 min without significantly affecting the nuclear turnover of these molecules. The sites of initiation and termination of transcription remained the same during the shutdown of transcription by the hormone. In contrast to the situation in Friend cells, dexamethasone failed to inhibit globin gene transcription in three normal erythroid tissues. The manner in which the Friend virus complex might render the globin genes sensitive to glucocorticoids is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2147795229,"Human fibroblasts contain two classes of ouabain-insensitive Na+ channels. One channel is activated by alkaloid neurotoxins in combination with scorpion venom, a response which is similar to that of the voltage-sensitive Na+ ionophore of nerve. The other channel is activated by fetal calf serum, several other mitogenic agents, or low extracellular Ca2+. The nervelike Na+ channel is inhibited by tetrodotoxin but not by amiloride, while the mitogen-stimulated channel is blocked by amiloride but not by tetrodotoxin. The combined effects of neurotoxins and low Ca2+ on Na+ uptake are additive, consistent with the conclusion that these Na+ pathways are different and independent. Studies of Na+ efflux show the presence of two intracellular Na+ compartments. When Na+ flux through the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase pump is inhibited by ouabain, compartment A has a high rate constant of efflux (K1 = 0.30 mn-1) and constitutes 60% of the total cellular Na+. Compartment B, with a markedly smaller efflux constant (k2 = -0.07), contains the remaining 40% of cell Na+. Stimulation of flux through the nervelike channel has a pronounced effect on the rate constants and Na+ content of both compartments (K1 = 0.56, k2 = 0.10), but activation of the mitogenic channel has a pronounced effect only on the rate of efflux from compartment A and on the size of compartment B. A cytoplasmic-nuclear model for the Na+ compartments is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1508172059,"The FI gene product (gp) of bacteriophage lambda is required during phage head assembly in vivo. Mutations in this gene lead to an accumulation of immature concatemeric lambda DNA and of proheads that appear normal and are competent for DNA packaging in vitro. This phenotype can be taken as evidence of a failure to couple DNA and proheads for packaging/maturation. In contrast to the requirement for gpFI in vivo, the packaging of lambda DNA in vitro occurs efficiently in the complete absence of gpFI. However, if ssDNA is included at the outset of the in vitro packaging reaction, DNA packaging is blocked. This block to packaging is relieved by addition of gpFI. Thus packaging of lambda DNA in vitro can be made dependent of gpFI by the inclusion of ssDNA at the outset of the reaction. Inhibition of DNA packaging by ssDNA appears to be mediated by a lambda b region-directed protein (packaging inhibitor, ben protein) that is present in the crude extracts of cells used to support the early steps of the packaging reaction. Neither ssDNA nor the packaging inhibitor alone has significant inhibitory effect on packaging; both components are required together to effect the inhibition that is relieved by gpFI. The packaging inhibitor was extensively purified and shown to have endonucleolytic activity. Several lines of evidence are presented to support the idea that both the inhibitory and endonucleolytic activities are functions of the same protein. Although gpFI relieves the inhibition imposed by the ben protein in packaging, gpFI fails to block the DNA cleavage activity of the ben protein in the standard endonuclease assay."
https://openalex.org/W1485215430,"D-Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.11) was isolated from rat liver in two forms: A, isolated in the presence, and isolated in the absence of dithiothreitol. Both forms had an apparently identical molecular weight of approximately 37,000/subunit and the same Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate of 2 microM. However, the Ki of the AMP inhibition of form A was 140 microM and of form B, 370 microM. With form B the same inhibition as with form A was reached by incubating the enzyme with dithiothreitol. The two forms of the enzyme differed in their total, as well as in their number of fast reacting thiol groups. Form A was the more reduced form, exhibiting 22.4 thiol groups/molecule, 2.5 of them fast reacting with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Only 0.5 fast reacting groups and a total of 19.2 were found with form B. The fast reacting thiol groups disappeared when assayed in the presence of AMP. It is suggested that a redox reaction alters a site that influences the inhibitory action of AMP, so as to regulate the activity of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1511216864,"A DNA endonuclease whose expression is under the control of the b region of bacteriophage lambda has been partially purified from an induced lambda lysogen. In a reaction that requires single-stranded DNA, ATP, and Mg2+, the lambda-induced endonuclease makes one double strand break in pBR322 and other covalently closed circular DNA molecules, converting these substrates into unit-length linear forms. The double strand break in pBR322 DNA occurs at one of several preferred sites. Linear DNA appears not to be a good substrate for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1571539727,"The removal of copper from beef heart cytochrome c oxidase by either dialysis against potassium cyanide or by treatment with bathocuproine sulfonate produced changes in the enzyme which are indicative of a spin state transition. In the Soret region of the CD spectrum copper depletion of the enzyme caused a significant decrease in amplitude in combination with a red shift of the peak maximum for oxidized samples, while reduced copper-depleted samples exhibited decreased amplitude and a blue shift of the peak maximum. In the magnetic CD spectra of oxidized copper-depleted samples the peak at 420 nm was shifted to lower wave-length along with a significant increase in amplitude. In reduced samples the peak at 446 nm exhibited a slight red shift concomitant with a substantial decrease in amplitude. The conformational changes indicated by the CD and magnetic CD spectra when copper is removed from the enzyme were supported by the EPR spectra of the NO complex of the reduced copper-depleted enzyme. The removal of copper from cytochrome c oxidase caused the NO complex to exhibit a 3-line splitting pattern of gz in the EPR spectrum instead of the 9 lines seen in the NO complex of the native enzyme. When [15N]NO was used, a 2-line pattern was seen at gz when copper was removed from the enzyme. The changes in the CD and magnetic CD spectra and in the EPR spectra of the NO derivatives of cytochrome c oxidase can be explained by the rearrangement of the axial ligands to iron in cytochrome a3 as a result of copper depletion. These results emphasize the close structural interdependence of the metallic components of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1568099445,"The hormonal response of viable mouse thymocytes is radically dependent of their ambient temperature. While at 37 degrees C the cells respond to isoproterenol by an abrupt rise (within 30 s) followed by a exponential decline in the level of intracellular cAMP, at 4 degrees C the level of cAMP remains high, i.e. there is an inhibition of the hormone-induced refractory state. These distinctly different patterns of response are reflected also in both the state of activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the activity of adenylate cyclase. The inhibition of cellular refractoriness in the cold is shown to be fully reversible, lasting only as long as the hormone is present in the extracellular medium. Washing out the hormone or displacing it by a specific antagonist (propranolol) results in a decline of cAMP, of the activity ratio of the kinase, and of the activity of the adenylate cyclase back to basal values. Evidence is presented to show that at 4 degrees C there is no significant hormone-dependent decreases in cAMP degradation or efflux. On the other hand, the activity of adenylate cyclase remains persistently high, through neither the hormone-binding site of the receptor nor the active site of the catalytic subunit of the cyclase seem to be impaired. The different response pattern observed at 4 degrees C appears, therefore, to be associated with the transfer and the signal between these two sites and probably with the G/F protein (s). The possibility to dissect in a selective and reversible manner the process of hormonal stimulation (coupling) from the process of desensitization, which, under normal physiological conditions constitute consecutive and inseparable chain of events, leads us to a propose that the signal transfer which enables activation of adenylate cyclase is, somewhere along its way, distinct from the signal transfer which brings about the onset of the refractory state, and to conclude that these two processes are partially autonomous and regulated by either two different proteins or two different sites on the same protein. The postulated proteins (or sites) should, therefore, differ in their sensitivity to temperature changes, a difference which may be most useful in the identification and isolation of the molecular species involved and in the study of their properties and their mechanism of action."
