https://openalex.org/W1974527622,"Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2099623128,"Hearing loss is associated with poor cognitive performance and incident dementia and may contribute to cognitive decline. Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may ameliorate cognitive decline. The purpose of this study was to test whether use of hearing aids was associated with better cognitive performance, and if this relationship was mediated via social isolation and/or depression. Structural equation modelling of associations between hearing loss, cognitive performance, social isolation, depression and hearing aid use was carried out with a subsample of the UK Biobank data set (n = 164,770) of UK adults aged 40 to 69 years who completed a hearing test. Age, sex, general health and socioeconomic status were controlled for as potential confounders. Hearing aid use was associated with better cognition, independently of social isolation and depression. This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that hearing aids may improve cognitive performance, although if hearing aids do have a positive effect on cognition it is not likely to be via reduction of the adverse effects of hearing loss on social isolation or depression. We suggest that any positive effects of hearing aid use on cognition may be via improvement in audibility or associated increases in self-efficacy. Alternatively, positive associations between hearing aid use and cognition may be accounted for by more cognitively able people seeking and using hearing aids. Further research is required to determine the direction of association, if there is any direct causal relationship between hearing aid use and better cognition, and whether hearing aid use results in reduction in rates of cognitive decline measured longitudinally."
https://openalex.org/W1989452740,"We describe eight, mostly complete white-tailed eagle (Haliaëtus [Haliaeetus] albicilla) talons from the Krapina Neandertal site in present-day Croatia, dating to approximately 130 kyrs ago. Four talons bear multiple, edge-smoothed cut marks; eight show polishing facets and/or abrasion. Three of the largest talons have small notches at roughly the same place along the plantar surface, interrupting the proximal margin of the talon blade. These features suggest they were part of a jewelry assemblage, --- the manipulations a consequence of mounting the talons in a necklace or bracelet. An associated phalanx articulates with one of the talons and has numerous cut marks, some of which are smoothed. These white-tailed eagle bones, discovered more than 100 years ago, all derive from a single level at Krapina and represent more talons than found in the entire European Mousterian period. Presence of eight talons indicates that the Krapina Neandertals acquired and curated eagle talons for some kind of symbolic purpose. Some have argued that Neandertals lacked symbolic ability or copied this behavior from modern humans. These remains clearly show that the Krapina Neandertals made jewelry well before the appearance of modern humans in Europe, extending ornament production and symbolic activity early into the European Mousterian."
https://openalex.org/W2120982880,"The shape of the human female pelvis is thought to reflect an evolutionary trade-off between two competing demands: a pelvis wide enough to permit the birth of large-brained infants, and narrow enough for efficient bipedal locomotion. This trade-off, known as the obstetrical dilemma, is invoked to explain the relative difficulty of human childbirth and differences in locomotor performance between men and women. The basis for the obstetrical dilemma is a standard static biomechanical model that predicts wider pelves in females increase the metabolic cost of locomotion by decreasing the effective mechanical advantage of the hip abductor muscles for pelvic stabilization during the single-leg support phase of walking and running, requiring these muscles to produce more force. Here we experimentally test this model against a more accurate dynamic model of hip abductor mechanics in men and women. The results show that pelvic width does not predict hip abductor mechanics or locomotor cost in either women or men, and that women and men are equally efficient at both walking and running. Since a wider birth canal does not increase a woman’s locomotor cost, and because selection for successful birthing must be strong, other factors affecting maternal pelvic and fetal size should be investigated in order to help explain the prevalence of birth complications caused by a neonate too large to fit through the birth canal."
https://openalex.org/W2065469785,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a degenerative tauopathy characterized by aggregation of Tau protein through the repeat domain to form intraneuronal paired helical filaments (PHFs). We report two cell models in which we control the inherent toxicity of the core Tau fragment. These models demonstrate the properties of prion-like recruitment of full-length Tau into an aggregation pathway in which template-directed, endogenous truncation propagates aggregation through the core Tau binding domain. We use these in combination with dissolution of native PHFs to quantify the activity of Tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs). We report the synthesis of novel stable crystalline leucomethylthioninium salts (LMTX®), which overcome the pharmacokinetic limitations of methylthioninium chloride. LMTX®, as either a dihydromesylate or a dihydrobromide salt, retains TAI activity in vitro and disrupts PHFs isolated from AD brain tissues at 0.16 μm. The Ki value for intracellular TAI activity, which we have been able to determine for the first time, is 0.12 μm. These values are close to the steady state trough brain concentration of methylthioninium ion (0.18 μm) that is required to arrest progression of AD on clinical and imaging end points and the minimum brain concentration (0.13 μm) required to reverse behavioral deficits and pathology in Tau transgenic mice.

These tangles were discovered by Alzheimer (1Alzheimer A. Über eine eigenartige Erkrankung der Hirnrinde.Allg. Z. Psych. Psych.-gerich.

There is increasing interest in the possibility of developing a Tau-based approach to treatment of AD. Alzheimer disease dimethyl methylthioninium chloride endoplasmic reticulum isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside leucomethylthioninium LMT-dihydrobromide LMT-dihydromesylate methylthioninium methylthioninium chloride methylene white paired helical filament signal sequence Tau aggregation inhibitor. We previously reported an assay for Tau-Tau binding through the repeat domain in which we demonstrated that the repeat domain has the ability to define a template-directed truncation of full-length Tau to reproduce a proteolytically stable species characteristic of the PHF core in AD and that the process could be propagated through stepwise binding and digestion cycles (9Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y.K. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Selective inhibition of Alzheimer disease-like tau aggregation by phenothiazines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We now report the development of two cell-based assays that permit demonstration of prion-like processing of Tau in the more physiological context of the cell. Compounds which have Tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) activity in cell-free assays block template-directed truncation within cells with approximately the same rank order, showing that the process is aggregation-dependent. These models confirm that Tau protein, in the absence of any post-translational modification or covalent cross-linking, is inherently able to form proteolytically resistant aggregates through the repeat domain in a physiological environment and that this process recruits normal Tau to undergo template-directed proteolytic truncation to form characteristic neofragments, including the core Tau unit of the PHF. The primary motivation in developing the cell assays that we report has been to aid the optimization of TAIs, as an intermediate between primary screening and testing in transgenic animal models, prior to clinical testing. Methylthioninium chloride (MTC; commonly known as “methylene blue”), the first reported TAI, reverses the proteolytic stability of PHFs isolated from AD brain tissues in vitro without disrupting normal Tau-tubulin interactions (9Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y.K. Roth M. Harrington C.R. Selective inhibition of Alzheimer disease-like tau aggregation by phenothiazines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11213-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). MTC is a stable heterocyclic ionic molecule, which may exist in equilibrium, depending on environmental conditions (e.g. pH, level of oxygenation, and the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents), with its oxygen-sensitive redox couple, leucomethylthionium (LMT; also known as “methylene white” (MW)) (Fig. 1A). A phase 2 clinical trial in mild/moderate AD identified a dose of 138 mg of MT/day, administered as MTC, as the minimum effective dose on clinical and imaging outcomes at 24 weeks (10Wischik C.M. Staff R.T. Wischik D.J. Bentham P. Murray A.D. Storey J.M.D. Kook K.A. Harrington C.R. Tau aggregation inhibitor therapy: an exploratory phase 2 study in mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2015; 44: 705-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, a dose of 228 mg of MT/day had either no efficacy or limited efficacy on the same end points, due to limitations in the ability to absorb the MT in its cationic form (11Baddeley T.C. McCaffrey J. Storey J.M.D. Cheung J.K.S. Melis V. Horsley D. Harrington C.R. Wischik C.M. Complex disposition of methylthioninium redox forms determines efficacy in tau aggregation inhibitor therapy for Alzheimer's disease.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2015; 352: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This is because MTC behaves effectively as a pro-drug that requires active reduction to the uncharged LMT form in the gut to permit absorption by passive diffusion and subsequent distribution to the brain (11Baddeley T.C. McCaffrey J. Storey J.M.D. Cheung J.K.S. Melis V. Horsley D. Harrington C.R. Wischik C.M. Complex disposition of methylthioninium redox forms determines efficacy in tau aggregation inhibitor therapy for Alzheimer's disease.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2015; 352: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As a result of dose-dependent limitations in this process, the 138 mg of MT/day dose was simply the highest available dose, and testing for efficacy and safety of higher doses of MT is not feasible clinically using MTC (10Wischik C.M. Staff R.T. Wischik D.J. Bentham P. Murray A.D. Storey J.M.D. Kook K.A. Harrington C.R. Tau aggregation inhibitor therapy: an exploratory phase 2 study in mild or moderate Alzheimer's disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2015; 44: 705-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In order to overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of novel chemical entities (which we denote LMTX®) in which the reduced LMT form can be provided directly as a stable anhydrous crystalline salt suitable for pharmaceutical development. We use the new cell assays to analyze different diprotic salt forms of LMT and show that they retain TAI activity within the physiological milieu of the cell. We use the assays to determine that the intracellular Ki for activity of MT at the Tau aggregation site is 0.12 μm. This value is close to the P50 value for disaggregation of PHFs isolated from AD brain (0.16 μm), the minimum brain concentration (0.13 μm) required to reverse behavioral deficits and reduce Tau pathology in Tau transgenic mice (12Melis V.

Pharmacol. 2015Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the estimated steady state trough brain concentration of MT and its pharmacologically active demethyl derivatives (0.18 μm) at the minimum effective dose found to be required for arresting the progression of AD (11Baddeley T.C.

Detailed syntheses can be found in the supplemental material. MTC was purchased from Simpsons (Gwent, UK). 1,9-Dimethyl methylthioninium chloride (listed as “1,9-dimethylmethylene blue” and which we refer to as DMMTC) was purchased from Serva. The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1B. A polymorphism analysis was conducted by Solvias AG (Kaiseraugst, Switzerland) to investigate the predisposition of LMTM to show polymorphism or hydrate formation. Two types of crystallization experiment were conducted: suspension equilibrations, generally considered the most reliable way to discover stable polymorphic forms, and cooling crystallizations, which increase the probability of identifying kinetically preferred but thermodynamically metastable polymorphic forms from highly saturated solutions. Both FT-Raman spectroscopy and powder x-ray diffraction were used to analyze samples (13Rager T. Geoffroy A. Hilfiker R. Storey J.M.D. The crystalline state of methylene blue: a zoo of hydrates.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2012; 14: 8074-8082Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PHFs were purified from AD brain as described previously (2Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thøgersen H.C. Edwards P.C.

U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5842-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), were used for the primulin-binding P50 assay. Recombinant Tau fragments dGA and dGAE, corresponding to amino acids 297–390 and 297–391, respectively, of the largest human Tau isoform in the central nervous system (15Goedert M. Spillantini M.G.

These proteins were purified from bacterial cell lysates using P-11 phosphocellulose ion exchange chromatography (16Goedert M. Jakes R.

The disruption of PHFs was monitored by the effect of compounds on enhanced PHF-dependent fluorescence measured using primulin binding to PHFs. Samples were assayed in 96-well white plates (100-μl volumes) in the presence of primulin (1 μm) and test compounds at appropriate concentrations. The fluorescence was measured in a Varian Carey Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer, and the excitation spectrum was measured with the emission wavelength at 480 nm. Peak fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 420 nm was measured from spectra after correction for the signal measured in the absence of PHFs. The P50 was calculated as the concentration of compound at which the fluorescence is reduced to 50% of the value in the absence of compound. Compounds were tested for inhibition of Tau-Tau binding using an ELISA-based assay (9Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y.K. Roth M. Harrington C.R.

The Tau fragment dGA, at 1 μm in 50 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6), was adsorbed to the surface of 96-well poly(vinyl chloride) plates. After blocking with 2% dried milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dGAE (0.15 μm in 25 mm K-PIPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween® 20, 1% fish skin gelatin, pH 6.8) was added with test compounds. All incubations were at 37 °C for 60 min. Bound antibody was detected as described previously (9Wischik C.M. Edwards P.C. Lai R.Y.K. Roth M. Harrington C.R.

The B50 value was calculated as the concentration of inhibitor at which specific binding was reduced to 50% of the value in the absence of inhibitor. A cell line expressing full-length human Tau was constructed using the LacSwitch® (Stratagene) system in which Tau is expressed under control of the lac repressor protein. 3T6 cells (ECACC number 86120801 mouse Swiss albino embryo fibroblasts) were transfected, by electroporation, with the p3′SS plasmid, which encodes the lac repressor protein, and colonies were selected for hygromycin resistance (3T6H cells). A NotI cloning site was introduced into hTau40 cDNA to allow cloning of Tau into the pOPRSVICAT vector by PCR-based mutagenesis using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-gtcgactctagaggcggccgcatggctgagccccggcaggag-3′; reverse primer, 5′–actcttaagggtcgcggccgctcacaacaaaccctgcttggccag-3′. The insert was ligated into the vector, and the correct orientation of the inserts was confirmed by restriction digest mapping. The pOPRSVT40 plasmid was transfected by electroporation into 3T6H cells, and clones were selected for resistance to G418. The expression of full-length hTau40 was induced using isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expression system used for production of membrane-associated Tau fragments is based on the observation that rabbit globin mRNA is translated on membrane-bound ribosomes if the signal sequence (SS) of rat albumin is inserted at the 5′ end of the cDNA (17Partridge K.A. Johannessen A. Tauler A. Pryme I.F. Hesketh J.E.

The vector described previously for expression of globin was modified to incorporate fragments of Tau coding sequence downstream of the signal sequence while at the same time maintaining the globin 3′-untranslated region. Three vectors expressing truncated forms of Tau protein (residues 296–390, 190–441, and 190–390) and referred to as SSTau(296–390), SSTau(190–441), and SSTau(190–390), respectively, were constructed. PCR-based mutagenesis on pcKSSGG (17Partridge K.A. Johannessen A. Tauler A. Pryme I.F. Hesketh J.E. Competition between the signal sequence and a 3′UTR localisation signal during redirection of β-globin mRNA to the endoplasmic reticulum: implications for biotechnology.Cytotechnology. 1999; 30: 37-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to introduce an AgeI site at the globin start codon to make pcKSSGGAgeI (forward primer, 5′-gccttttcaccggtgcatctgtcca-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tggacagatgcaccggtgaaaaggc-3′). For pcKSSTau(190–441), PCR-based mutagenesis on hTau40 introduced an AgeI site at nucleotide 1128 of hTau40 (forward primer, 5′-tctggtgaaccggtaaaatcagggg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cccctgattttaccggttcaccaga-3′). The fragment was cut with EcoRI beyond the Tau stop codon, blunt-ended, cut with AgeI, ligated into pcKSSGGAgeI, cut with BamHI, blunt-ended, and then cut with AgeI to make pcKSSTau(190–441). The ligation process results in Lys-190 becoming the start of the Tau sequence. For pcKSSTau(190–390), PCR-based mutagenesis on pcKSSTau(190–441) introduced a BamHI site and a stop codon at nucleotide 1740 (which terminates the Tau sequence at Ala-390) (forward primer, 5′-cggggcgtatccgtacaagtcg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cgacttgtacggatcctacgccccg-3′). The fragment was cut with AgeI and BamHI and ligated into pcKSSGGAgeI at the same sites to make pcKSSTau(190–390). For pcKSSTau(296–390), PCR-based mutagenesis on pcKSSTau(190–390) introduced an AgeI site at nucleotide 1450 of pcKSSTau(190–390) (forward primer, 5′-ggctcaccggttaatatcaaac-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gtttgatattaaccggtgagcc-3′). The fragment was cut with AgeI and BamHI and ligated into pcKSSGGAgeI at the same sites to make pcKSSTau(296–390). These constructs were created using the expression vector pcDNA3.1, which carries the G418 resistance marker. All were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo vector (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands), which contains the Zeocin resistance marker, for transfection into the inducible hTau40 cell line. For construction of the plasmid pZeo(295–391), designed to express protein corresponding to a truncated fragment of Tau (residues 295–391), EcoRI and BamHI cloning sites were introduced by PCR amplification of hTau40 cDNA (forward primer, 5′-cggaattccaccatggataatatcaaacacgtcccg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cgcgggatcctcactccgccccgtggtctgtcttggc-3′). The constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(−) for transfection into the hTau40 cell line. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with Glutamax I, pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose; Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Helena BioSciences), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and further antibiotic as appropriate for the selection and maintenance of the relevant plasmids. Hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and G418 (500 μg/ml) were included for both selection and maintenance of the hTau40 cell line, and 400 or 200 μg/ml Zeocin was used for selection or maintenance, respectively, of SSTau(190–441), SSTau(190–390), SSTau(296–390), and pZeo(295–391). Cells were grown at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cell-based Tau aggregation assays used the cell lines described above, which express inducible full-length hTau40 in combination with constitutive expression of one of the Tau fragments selected from SSTau(190–441), SSTau(190–390), SSTau(296–390), and Tau(295–391) (see Fig. 2). Expression of hTau40 was induced by the addition of IPTG (10–50 μm); in the case of cells expressing the SSTau fragments, their expression was increased by the addition of sodium butyrate (5 mm), a nonspecific enhancer of protein expression (18Gorman C.M.

For testing of compounds, cells were incubated with compounds in 24-well plates, and after 24 h, IPTG was added to the medium. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and then taken up with Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and reacted with mAb 7/51 antibody (14Harrington C.R. Mukaetova-Ladinska E.B. Hills R. Edwards P.C. Montejo de Garcini E. Novak M.

Compounds were typically tested at four concentrations, each in triplicate, with all samples being separated on a single gel. To control for any variability in expression of hTau40, we use the ratio of the intensities of the truncated 12 kDa to full-length hTau40 protein bands. The values, normalized to those obtained for control samples in which there had been no test item, were plotted against compound concentration. The EC50 value was determined as the concentration at which the ratio was 50% of the value obtained in the absence of compound.

Toxicity was determined using the Cytotox 96-well kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LD50 was determined as the concentration in the assay at which the absorbance at 490 nm was decreased by 50%. 3T6 cells expressing Tau were grown on glass coverslips for microscopy. Cells were fixed either in 0.3% glutaraldehyde containing 0.1% Triton® X-100 or in paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by extraction with 0.2% Triton® X-100. In some cases, cells were extracted with saponin (0.5% in 80 mm K-PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30% glycerol, pH 6.8) for 2 min and then fixed in 0.3% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer for 10 min. Saponin (0.5%) was included in subsequent antibody incubations and washes. Saponin is a relatively mild detergent that leaves internal membranes intact, whereas Triton® X-100 will expose the lumenal surface of internal organelles. Cells were then labeled by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with mAb 7/51 (hybridoma supernatant fluid diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween® 20). Antibody was detected using goat anti-mouse FITC conjugate. The rat mAb YL1/2 was used for visualization of microtubules (21Kilmartin J.V. Wright B. Milstein C.

Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. We report the development of an industrially scalable synthesis of LMT salts as novel chemical entities (LMTX®) using crude MTC as the starting material (organic purity less than 97% and metal impurity in excess of 20 μg/g). The synthetic scheme for the dihydromesylate salt, as an example, is shown in Fig. 1C, whereas details of the synthesis are provided in the supplemental material. When scaled up, the final crystalline product was isolated in 84% yield on a 90-kg industrial synthesis with a 99.7% organic purity and heavy metal content within the permitted European Pharmacopoeia limits specified for MTC (see supplemental Table S1). The single crystal, x-ray structural determinations of MTC (22Marr 3rd, H.E. Stewart J.M. Chiu M.F. Crystal structure of methylene blue pentahydrate.Acta Crystallogr. B. 1973; 29: 847-853Crossref Google Scholar); the oxygen-sensitive, uncharged LMT (MW) (stored under argon); and the oxygen-stable, protonated LMTM are compared in Fig. 1D. The core ring system of MTC is planar, as expected for a completely delocalized system; in contrast, MW and LMTM have non-planar central heterocyclic rings, consistent with the reduced form. The x-ray crystallography for LMTM confirmed that the nitrogen atoms at positions 3 and 7 had tetrahedral geometry and hence were protonated. Protonation of the nitrogen atoms contributes to both the geometry of LMTM and its stability in an oxygen atmosphere and differentiates it from MW, which has trigonal pyramidal nitrogen geometries. These structures distinguish the protonated LMTM from MW and confirm that LMTM is a distinct chemical entity. Of the LMTX® salt forms investigated (dihydrobromide and dihydromesylate), LMTM exhibited optimal characteristics in terms of crystal properties, purity (99.7%), stability to oxidation, and process scalability. LMTM is substantially more water-soluble than MTC (1,700 and 18 mg/ml, respectively) and exists as a single polymorph (see Raman spectrum and x-ray diffraction pattern of the LMTM polymorph in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The LMTM polymorph does not change on storage at 30 °C and 65% humidity over 24 months (see supplemental Table S2). A fluorometric assay was developed to measure dissolution of PHFs isolated from AD brain tissue. The addition of PHFs to primulin solution induces a PHF concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 420 nm, not seen in the absence of PHFs (Fig. 3A), due to the binding of primulin to PHFs (23Resch J.F.

https://openalex.org/W1974020172,"Acyl-CoA formation initiates cellular fatty acid metabolism. Acyl-CoAs are generated by the ligation of a fatty acid to Coenzyme A mediated by a large family of acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS). Conversely, acyl-CoAs can be hydrolyzed by a family of acyl-CoA thioesterases (ACOT). Here, we have determined the transcriptional regulation of all ACS and ACOT enzymes across tissues and in response to metabolic perturbations. We find patterns of coordinated regulation within and between these gene families as well as distinct regulation occurring in a tissue- and physiologically-dependent manner. Due to observed changes in long-chain ACOT mRNA and protein abundance in liver and adipose tissue, we determined the consequence of increasing cytosolic long-chain thioesterase activity on fatty acid metabolism in these tissues by generating transgenic mice overexpressing a hyperactive mutant of Acot7 in the liver or adipose tissue. Doubling cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase activity failed to protect mice from diet-induced obesity, fatty liver or insulin resistance, however, overexpression of Acot7 in adipocytes rendered mice cold intolerant. Together, these data suggest distinct modes of regulation of the ACS and ACOT enzymes and that these enzymes act in a coordinated fashion to control fatty acid metabolism in a tissue-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1991220629,"Early detection and treatment are of vital importance to the successful eradication of various cancers, and development of economical and non-invasive novel cancer screening systems is critical. Previous reports using canine scent detection demonstrated the existence of cancer-specific odours. However, it is difficult to introduce canine scent recognition into clinical practice because of the need to maintain accuracy. In this study, we developed a Nematode Scent Detection Test (NSDT) using Caenorhabditis elegans to provide a novel highly accurate cancer detection system that is economical, painless, rapid and convenient. We demonstrated wild-type C. elegans displayed attractive chemotaxis towards human cancer cell secretions, cancer tissues and urine from cancer patients but avoided control urine; in parallel, the response of the olfactory neurons of C. elegans to the urine from cancer patients was significantly stronger than to control urine. In contrast, G protein α mutants and olfactory neurons-ablated animals were not attracted to cancer patient urine, suggesting that C. elegans senses odours in urine. We tested 242 samples to measure the performance of the NSDT, and found the sensitivity was 95.8%; this is markedly higher than that of other existing tumour markers. Furthermore, the specificity was 95.0%. Importantly, this test was able to diagnose various cancer types tested at the early stage (stage 0 or 1). To conclude, C. elegans scent-based analyses might provide a new strategy to detect and study disease-associated scents."

However, a number of factors influence how well recipients and donor organs tolerate this procedure. The main objective of this study was to develop and validate a flexible risk model for prediction of survival after heart transplantation using the largest transplant registry in the world.We developed a flexible, non-linear artificial neural networks model (IHTSA) and classification and regression tree to comprehensively evaluate the impact of recipient-donor variables on survival over time. We analyzed 56,625 heart-transplanted adult patients, corresponding to 294,719 patient-years. We compared the discrimination power with three existing scoring models, donor risk index (DRI), risk-stratification score (RSS) and index for mortality prediction after cardiac transplantation (IMPACT). The accuracy of the model was excellent (C-index 0.600 [95% CI: 0.595-0.604]) with predicted versus actual 1-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 83.7% versus 82.6%, 71.4%-70.8%, and 54.8%-54.3% in the derivation cohort; 83.7% versus 82.8%, 71.5%-71.1%, and 54.9%-53.8% in the internal validation cohort; and 84.5% versus 84.4%, 72.9%-75.6%, and 57.5%-57.5% in the external validation cohort. The IHTSA model showed superior or similar discrimination in all of the cohorts. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve to predict one-year mortality was for the IHTSA: 0.650 (95% CI: 0.640-0.655), DRI 0.56 (95% CI: 0.56-0.57), RSS 0.61 (95% CI: 0.60-0.61), and IMPACT 0.61 (0.61-0.62), respectively. The decision-tree showed that recipients matched to a donor younger than 38 years had additional expected median survival time of 2.8 years. Furthermore, the number of suitable donors could be increased by up to 22%.We show that the IHTSA model can be used to predict both short-term and long-term mortality with high accuracy globally. The model also estimates the expected benefit to the individual patient."
https://openalex.org/W2064773034,"Chemolithoautotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria play an essential role in the global iron cycle. Thus far, the majority of marine iron-oxidizing bacteria have been identified as Zetaproteobacteria, a novel class within the phylum Proteobacteria. Marine iron-oxidizing microbial communities have been found associated with volcanically active seamounts, crustal spreading centers, and coastal waters. However, little is known about the presence and diversity of iron-oxidizing communities at hydrothermal systems along the slow crustal spreading center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. From October to November 2012, samples were collected from rust-colored mats at three well-known hydrothermal vent systems on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Rainbow, Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse, and Snake Pit) using the ROV Jason II. The goal of these efforts was to determine if iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria were present at sites proximal to black smoker vent fields. Small, diffuse flow venting areas with high iron(II) concentrations and rust-colored microbial mats were observed at all three sites proximal to black smoker chimneys. A novel, syringe-based precision sampler was used to collect discrete microbial iron mat samples at the three sites. The presence of Zetaproteobacteria was confirmed using a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and single-cell sorting, while light micros-copy revealed a variety of iron-oxyhydroxide structures, indicating that active iron-oxidizing communities exist along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Sequencing analysis suggests that these iron mats contain cosmopolitan representatives of Zetaproteobacteria, but also exhibit diversity that may be uncommon at other iron-rich marine sites studied to date. A meta-analysis of publically available data encompassing a variety of aquatic habitats indicates that Zetaproteobacteria are rare if an iron source is not readily available. This work adds to the growing understanding of Zetaproteobacteria ecology and suggests that this organism is likely locally restricted to iron-rich marine environments but may exhibit wide-scale geographic distribution, further underscoring the importance of Zetaproteobacteria in global iron cycling."

Numerical results are obtained using boundary value problem solver bvp4c in MATLAB for several values of parameters. The numerical results show that dual solutions exist for the shrinking case, while for the stretching case, the solution is unique. A stability analysis is performed to determine the stability of the dual solutions. For the stable solution, the skin friction is higher in the presence of magnetic field and increases when the suction effect is increased. It is also found that increasing the Brownian motion parameter and the thermophoresis parameter reduces the heat transfer rate at the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2029219854,"Tuberculosis is a major global public health problem, which also affects economic and social development. China has the second largest burden of tuberculosis in the world. The tuberculosis morbidity in Xinjiang is much higher than the national situation; therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting tuberculosis morbidity so as to make the control of tuberculosis more effective. Recently, the Box-Jenkins approach, specifically the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, is typically applied to predict the morbidity of infectious diseases; it can take into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in time series. Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models are the prevalent tools used to deal with time series heteroscedasticity. In this study, based on the data of the tuberculosis morbidity from January 2004 to June 2014 in Xinjiang, we establish the single ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12 model and the combined ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12-ARCH (1) model, which can be used to predict the tuberculosis morbidity successfully in Xinjiang. Comparative analyses show that the combined model is more effective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish the ARIMA model and ARIMA-ARCH model for prediction and monitoring the monthly morbidity of tuberculosis in Xinjiang. Based on the results of this study, the ARIMA (1, 1, 2) (1, 1, 1)12-ARCH (1) model is suggested to give tuberculosis surveillance by providing estimates on tuberculosis morbidity trends in Xinjiang, China."
https://openalex.org/W2080248638,"As a result of salt (NaCl)-stress, sensitive varieties of maize (Zea mays L.) respond with a strong inhibition of organ growth. The reduction of leaf elongation investigated here has several causes, including a modification of the mechanical properties of the cell wall. Among the various tissues that form the leaf, the epidermis plays a special role in controlling organ growth, because it is thought to form a rigid outer leaf coat that can restrict elongation by interacting with the inner cell layers. This study was designed to determine whether growth-related changes in the leaf epidermis and its cell wall correspond to the overall reduction in cell expansion of maize leaves during an osmotic stress-phase induced by salt treatment. Two different maize varieties contrasting in their degree of salt resistance (i.e., the hybrids Lector vs. SR03) were compared in order to identify physiological features contributing to resistance towards salinity. Wall loosening-related parameters, such as the capacity of the epidermal cell wall to expand, β-expansin abundance and apoplastic pH values, were analysed. Our data demonstrate that, in the salt-tolerant maize hybrid which maintained leaf growth under salinity, the epidermal cell wall was more extensible under salt stress. This was associated with a shift of the epidermal apoplastic pH into a range more favourable for acid growth. The more sensitive hybrid that displayed a pronounced leaf growth-reduction was shown to have stiffer epidermal cell walls under stress. This may be attributable to the reduced abundance of cell wall-loosening β-expansin proteins following a high salinity-treatment in the nutrient solution (100 mM NaCl, 8 days). This study clearly documents that salt stress impairs epidermal wall-loosening in growth-reduced maize leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2033884459,"The eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) is a medium-sized Australian marsupial carnivore that has recently undergone a rapid and severe population decline over the 10 years to 2009, with no sign of recovery. This decline has been linked to a period of unfavourable weather, but subsequent improved weather conditions have not been matched by quoll recovery. A recent study suggested another mechanism: that declines in Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations, due to the spread of the fatal Devil Facial Tumour Disease, have released feral cats (Felis catus) from competitive suppression, with eastern quoll declines linked to a subsequent increase in cat sightings. Yet current evidence of intraguild suppression among devils, cats and quolls is scant and equivocal. We therefore assessed the influences of top-down effects on abundance and activity patterns among devils, feral cats and eastern quolls. Between 2011 and 2013, we monitored four carnivore populations using longitudinal trapping and camera surveys, and performed camera surveys at 12 additional sites throughout the eastern quoll’s range. We did not find evidence of a negative relationship between devil and cat abundance, nor of higher cat abundance in areas where devil populations had declined the longest. Cats did not appear to avoid devils spatially; however, there was evidence of temporal separation of cat and devil activity, with reduced separation and increasing nocturnal activity observed in areas where devils had declined the longest. Cats and quolls used the same areas, and there was no evidence that cat and quoll abundances were negatively related. Temporal overlap in observed cat and quoll activity was higher in summer than in winter, but this seasonal difference was unrelated to devil declines. We suggest that cats did not cause the recent quoll decline, but that predation of juvenile quolls by cats could be inhibiting low density quoll populations from recovering their former abundance through a ‘predator pit’ effect following weather-induced decline. Predation intensity could increase further should cats become increasingly nocturnal in response to devil declines."
https://openalex.org/W2000069042,"Background & Aims Osteopontin (OPN) is a matricellular protein that upregulates during pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. The present study was aimed to evaluate whether serum OPN could be used as a biomarker to assess the degree of hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Methods Needle biopsy was performed on HCV patients and scored as zero fibrosis (F0), mild fibrosis (F1), moderate fibrosis (F2), severe fibrosis (F3) and liver cirrhosis (F4) based on Masson’s trichrome and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining. Serum OPN levels were measured using ELISA and correlated with the degree of fibrosis. Furthermore, the OPN values were correlated and evaluated with platelets count, serum hyaluronic acid (HA), and collagen type IV and subjected to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Serum OPN levels were remarkably increased from F0 through F4 in a progressive manner and the differences were significant (P < 0.001) between each group. The data were highly correlated with the degree of hepatic fibrosis. The ROC curve analysis depicted that serum OPN is an independent risk factor and an excellent biomarker and a prognostic index in HCV patients. Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that serum OPN levels reflect the degree of hepatic fibrosis and could be used as a biomarker to assess the stage of fibrosis in HCV patients which would help to reduce the number of liver biopsies. Furthermore, serum OPN serves as a prognostic index towards the progression of hepatic fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."

Among U.S. policy makers, the promotion of advanced education, particularly in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields, has become a key strategy for ensuring the U.S.’s position as an innovative economic leader. Since approximately one third of science and engineering post-graduate students in the U.S. are foreign born, the future of the U.S. STEM educational system is intimately tied to issues of global competitiveness and American immigration policy. This study utilizes a combination of national education data, a survey of foreign-born STEM graduate students, and in-depth interviews of a sub-set of those students to explain how a combination of scientists’ and engineers’ educational decisions, as well as their experience in school, can predict a students’ career path and geographical location, which can affect the long-term innovation environment in their home and destination country. This study highlights the fact that the increasing global competitiveness in STEM education and the complex, restrictive nature of U.S. immigration policies are contributing to an environment where the American STEM system may no longer be able to comfortably remain the premier destination for the world’s top international students."

https://openalex.org/W2073509408,"Introduction Current clinical trials utilize mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) expanded in culture, however these interventions carry considerable costs and concerns pertaining to culture-induced losses of potency. This study assessed the feasibility of new clinical-grade technology to obtain uncultured MSC isolates from three human intra-osseous tissue sources based on immunomagnetic selection for CD271-positive cells. Materials and Methods MSCs were isolated from bone marrow (BM) aspirates or surgical waste materials; enzymatically digested femoral heads (FHs) and reamer irrigator aspirator (RIA) waste fluids. Flow cytometry for the CD45−/lowCD73+CD271+ phenotype was used to evaluate uncultured MSCs before and after selection, and to measure MSC enrichment in parallel to colony forming-unit fibroblast assay. Trilineage differentiation assays and quantitative polymerase chain-reaction for key transcripts involved in bone regeneration was used to assess the functional utility of isolated cells for bone repair. Results Uncultured CD45−/lowCD271+ MSCs uniformly expressed CD73, CD90 and CD105 but showed variable expression of MSCA-1 and SUSD2 (BM>RIA>FH). MSCs were enriched over 150-fold from BM aspirates and RIA fluids, whereas the highest MSC purities were obtained from FH digests. Enriched fractions expressed increased levels of BMP-2, COL1A2, VEGFC, SPARC and CXCL12 transcripts (BM>RIA>FH), with the highest up-regulation detected for CXCL12 in BM (>1300-fold). Following culture expansion, CD271-selected MSCS were tri-potential and phenotypically identical to plastic adherence-selected MSCs. Discussion A CD271-based GMP-compliant immunomagnetic selection resulted in a substantial increase in MSC purity and elevated expression of transcripts involved in bone formation, vascularisation and chemo-attraction. Although this technology, particularly from RIA fluids, can be immediately applied by orthopaedic surgeons as autologous therapy, further improvements in MSC purities and pre-clinical testing of product safety would be required to develop this process for allogeneic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2132184283,"To address possible cell-to-cell heterogeneity in growth dynamics of isogenic cell populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we developed a millifluidic drop-based device that not only allows the analysis of populations grown from single cells over periods of a week, but is also able to sort and collect drops of interest, containing viable and healthy cells, which can be used for further experimentation. In this study, we used isogenic algal cells that were first synchronized in mixotrophic growth conditions. We show that these synchronized cells, when placed in droplets and kept in mixotrophic growth conditions, exhibit mostly homogeneous growth statistics, but with two distinct subpopulations: a major population with a short doubling-time (fast-growers) and a significant subpopulation of slowly dividing cells (slow-growers). These observations suggest that algal cells from an isogenic population may be present in either of two states, a state of restricted division and a state of active division. When isogenic cells were allowed to propagate for about 1000 generations on solid agar plates, they displayed an increased heterogeneity in their growth dynamics. Although we could still identify the original populations of slow- and fast-growers, drops inoculated with a single progenitor cell now displayed a wider diversity of doubling-times. Moreover, populations dividing with the same growth-rate often reached different cell numbers in stationary phase, suggesting that the progenitor cells differed in the number of cell divisions they could undertake. We discuss possible explanations for these cell-to-cell heterogeneities in growth dynamics, such as mutations, differential aging or stochastic variations in metabolites and macromolecules yielding molecular switches, in the light of single-cell heterogeneities that have been reported among isogenic populations of other eu- and prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1992695405,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. About 10% of all ALS cases are familial (fALS), among which 15–20% are linked to Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutations, usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date only one FDA approved drug is available which increases survival moderately. Our understanding of ALS disease mechanisms is largely derived from rodent model studies, however due to the differences between rodents and humans, it is necessary to have humanized models for studies of disease pathogenesis as well as drug development. Therefore, we generated a comprehensive library of a total 22 of fALS patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. These cells were thoroughly characterized before being deposited into the library. The library of cells includes a variety of C9orf72 mutations, sod1 mutations, FUS, ANG and FIG4 mutations. Certain mutations are represented with more than one line, which allows for studies of variable genetic backgrounds. In addition, these iPSCs can be successfully differentiated to astroglia, a cell type known to play a critical role in ALS disease progression. This library represents a comprehensive resource that can be used for ALS disease modeling and the development of novel therapeutics."

There are 31 genes that encode the full-length OVATE-domain containing proteins in the rice genome. In this study, the gene structure analysis revealed that OsOFPs are intron poor. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OVATE proteins from rice, Arabidopsis and tomato can be divided into 4 groups (I-IV). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis identified OsOFPs with different tissue-specific expression patterns at all stages of development in the rice plant. Interestingly, nearly half of the total number of OsOFP family was more highly expressed during the seed developmental stage. In addition, seed developmental cis-elements were found in the promoter region of the OsOFPs. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that YFP-OsOFP fusion proteins predominantly localized in the nucleus. Our results suggest that OsOFPs may act as regulatory proteins and play pivotal roles in the growth and development of rice."

https://openalex.org/W2045839211,"Background The duration of antibiotic treatment of exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) is controversial. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker of bacterial infection used to identify the cause of ECOPD. Methods and Findings We investigated whether a PCT-guided plan would allow a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with severe ECOPD. For this multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled 184 patients hospitalized with ECOPD from 18 hospitals in Italy. Patients were assigned to receive antibiotics for 10 days (standard group) or for either 3 or 10 days (PCT group). The primary outcome was the rate of ECOPD at 6 months. Having planned to recruit 400 patients, we randomized only 183: 93 in the PCT group and 90 in the standard group. Thus, the completed study was underpowered. The ECOPD rate at 6 months between PCT-guided and standard antibiotic treatment was not significant (% difference, 4.04; 90% confidence interval [CI], −7.23 to 15.31), but the CI included the non-inferiority margin of 15. In the PCT-guided group, about 50% of patients were treated for 3 days, and there was no difference in primary or secondary outcomes compared to patients treated for 10 days. Conclusions Although the primary and secondary clinical outcomes were no different for patients treated for 3 or 10 days in the PCT group, the conclusion that antibiotics can be safely stopped after 3 days in patients with low serum PCT cannot be substantiated statistically. Thus, the results of this study are inconclusive regarding the noninferiority of the PCT-guided plan compared to the standard antibiotic treatment.

However, while a few promising methods for prediction of skin sensitization have been described, to date no validated method, in vitro or in vivo, exists that is able to accurately classify chemicals as respiratory sensitizers. Results Recently, we presented the in vitro based Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD) assay as a novel testing strategy for classification of skin sensitizing chemicals based on measurement of a genomic biomarker signature. We have expanded the applicability domain of the GARD assay to classify also respiratory sensitizers by identifying a separate biomarker signature containing 389 differentially regulated genes for respiratory sensitizers in comparison to non-respiratory sensitizers. By using an independent data set in combination with supervised machine learning, we validated the assay, showing that the identified genomic biomarker is able to accurately classify respiratory sensitizers. Conclusions We have identified a genomic biomarker signature for classification of respiratory sensitizers. Combining this newly identified biomarker signature with our previously identified biomarker signature for classification of skin sensitizers, we have developed a novel in vitro testing strategy with a potent ability to predict both skin and respiratory sensitization in the same sample."
https://openalex.org/W2128924836,"A body mass index (BMI) >22kg/m2 is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Aboriginal Australians. To identify loci associated with BMI and T2D we undertook a genome-wide association study using 1,075,436 quality-controlled single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped (Illumina 2.5M Duo Beadchip) in 402 individuals in extended pedigrees from a Western Australian Aboriginal community. Imputation using the thousand genomes (1000G) reference panel extended the analysis to 6,724,284 post quality-control autosomal SNPs. No associations achieved genome-wide significance, commonly accepted as P<5x10-8. Nevertheless, genes/pathways in common with other ethnicities were identified despite the arrival of Aboriginal people in Australia >45,000 years ago. The top hit (rs10868204 Pgenotyped = 1.50x10-6; rs11140653 Pimputed_1000G = 2.90x10-7) for BMI lies 5’ of NTRK2, the type 2 neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). PIK3C2G (rs12816270 Pgenotyped = 8.06x10-6; rs10841048 Pimputed_1000G = 6.28x10-7) was associated with BMI, but not with T2D as reported elsewhere. BMI also associated with CNTNAP2 (rs6960319 Pgenotyped = 4.65x10-5; rs13225016 Pimputed_1000G = 6.57x10-5), previously identified as the strongest gene-by-environment interaction for BMI in African-Americans. The top hit (rs11240074 Pgenotyped = 5.59x10-6, Pimputed_1000G = 5.73x10-6) for T2D lies 5’ of BCL9 that, along with TCF7L2, promotes beta-catenin’s transcriptional activity in the WNT signaling pathway. Additional hits occurred in genes affecting pancreatic (KCNJ6, KCNA1) and/or GABA (GABRR1, KCNA1) functions. Notable associations observed for genes previously identified at genome-wide significance in other populations included MC4R (Pgenotyped = 4.49x10-4) for BMI and IGF2BP2 Pimputed_1000G = 2.55x10-6) for T2D. Our results may provide novel functional leads in understanding disease pathogenesis in this Australian Aboriginal population."
https://openalex.org/W2044823852,"Potyviruses are one of the most destructive viral pathogens of Solanaceae plants. In Capsicum annuum landrace CM334, a broad-spectrum gene, Pvr4 is known to be involved in resistance against multiple potyviruses, including Pepper mottle virus (PepMoV), Pepper severe mosaic virus (PepSMV), and Potato virus Y (PVY). However, a potyvirus avirulence factor against Pvr4 has not been identified. To identify the avirulence factor corresponding to Pvr4 in potyviruses, we performed Agrobacterium-mediated transient expressions of potyvirus protein coding regions in potyvirus-resistant (Pvr4) and -susceptible (pvr4) pepper plants. Hypersensitive response (HR) was observed only when a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NIb) of PepMoV, PepSMV, or PVY was expressed in Pvr4-bearing pepper leaves in a genotype-specific manner. In contrast, HR was not observed when the NIb of Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a virulent potyvirus, was expressed in Pvr4-bearing pepper leaves. Our results clearly demonstrate that NIbs of PepMoV, PepSMV, and PVY serve as avirulence factors for Pvr4 in pepper plants."
https://openalex.org/W2106860481,"Few studies have empirically examined the suite of mechanisms that underlie the distributional shifts displayed by organisms in response to changing climatic condition. Mangrove forests are expected to move inland as sea-level rises, encroaching on saltmarsh plants inhabiting higher elevations. Mangrove propagules are transported by tidal waters and propagule dispersal is likely modified upon encountering the mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone, the implications of which are poorly known. Here, using an experimental approach, we record landward and seaward dispersal and subsequent establishment of mangrove propagules that encounter biotic boundaries composed of two types of saltmarsh taxa: succulents and grasses. Our findings revealed that propagules emplaced within saltmarsh vegetation immediately landward of the extant mangrove fringe boundary frequently dispersed in the seaward direction. However, propagules moved seaward less frequently and over shorter distances upon encountering boundaries composed of saltmarsh grasses versus succulents. We uniquely confirmed that the small subset of propagules dispersing landward displayed proportionately higher establishment success than those transported seaward. Although impacts of ecotones on plant dispersal have rarely been investigated in situ, our experimental results indicate that the interplay between tidal transport and physical attributes of saltmarsh vegetation influence boundary permeability to propagules, thereby directing the initial phase of shifting mangrove distributions. The incorporation of tidal inundation information and detailed data on landscape features, such as the structure of saltmarsh vegetation at mangrove boundaries, should improve the accuracy of models that are being developed to forecast mangrove distributional shifts in response to sea-level rise."
https://openalex.org/W2109213612,"Objective In addition to IgA, the deposition of complement (C)3 in dermal vessels is commonly found in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of circulating complement proteins in the pathogenesis of childhood HSP. Methods Plasma levels of C3a, C4a, C5a, and Bb in 30 HSP patients and 30 healthy controls were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of C3a receptor (C3aR), C5a receptor (CD88), E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), C3, C5, interleukin (IL)-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and RANTES by human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) was evaluated either by flow cytometry or by ELISA. Results At the acute stage, HSP patients had higher plasma levels of C3a (359.5 ± 115.3 vs. 183.3 ± 94.1 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), C5a (181.4 ± 86.1 vs. 33.7 ± 26.3 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), and Bb (3.7 ± 2.6 vs. 1.0 ± 0.6 μg/ml, p < 0.0001), but not C4a than healthy controls. Although HSP patient-derived acute phase plasma did not alter the presentation of C3aR and CD88 on HMVEC-d, it enhanced the production of endothelial C3 and C5. Moreover, C5a was shown in vitro to up-regulate the expression of IL-8, MCP-1, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 by HMVEC-d with a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion In HSP, the activation of the complement system in part through the alternative pathway may have resulted in increased plasma levels of C3a and C5a, which, especially C5a, may play a role in the disease pathogenesis by activating endothelium of cutaneous small vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2065999764,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Furthermore, the decline of neurogenesis accompanying aging could be involved in age-related cognitive deficits. It is believed that the neural stem cell niche comprises a specialized microenvironment regulating stem cell activation and maintenance. However, little is known about the significance of the extracellular matrix in controlling adult stem cells. Reelin is a large glycoprotein of the extracelluar matrix known to be of crucial importance for neuronal migration. Here, we examined the local interrelation between Reelin expressing interneurons and putative hippocampal stem cells and investigated the effects of Reelin deficiency on stem cell and progenitor cell proliferation. Reelin-positive cells are found in close vicinity to putative stem cell processes, which would allow for stem cell regulation by Reelin. We investigated the proliferation of stem cells in the Reelin-deficient reeler hippocampus by Ki67 labeling and found a strong reduction of mitotic cells. A detailed analysis of dividing Type 1, type 2 and type 3 cells indicated that once a stem cell is recruited for proliferation, the progression to the next progenitor stage as well as the number of mitotic cycles is not altered in reeler. Our data point to a role for Reelin in either regulating stem cell quiescence or maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2163443499,"Background Over the past years, the essential role of vitamin B6 in brain development and functioning has been recognized and genetic metabolic disorders resulting in functional vitamin B6 deficiency have been identified. However, data on B6 vitamers in children are scarce. Materials and Methods B6 vitamer concentrations in simultaneously sampled plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 70 children with intellectual disability were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For ethical reasons, CSF samples could not be obtained from healthy children. The influence of sex, age, epilepsy and treatment with anti-epileptic drugs, were investigated. Results The B6 vitamer composition of plasma (pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) > pyridoxic acid > pyridoxal (PL)) differed from that of CSF (PL > PLP > pyridoxic acid > pyridoxamine). Strong correlations were found for B6 vitamers in and between plasma and CSF. Treatment with anti-epileptic drugs resulted in decreased concentrations of PL and PLP in CSF. Conclusion We provide concentrations of all B6 vitamers in plasma and CSF of children with intellectual disability (±epilepsy), which can be used in the investigation of known and novel disorders associated with vitamin B6 metabolism as well as in monitoring of the biochemical effects of treatment with vitamin B6."
https://openalex.org/W1965142574,"Prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) have been eliminated from over 95% of their historic range in large part from direct eradication campaigns to reduce their purported competition with cattle for forage. Despite the longstanding importance of this issue to grassland management and conservation, the ecological interactions between cattle and prairie dogs have not been well examined. We address this issue through two complementary experiments to determine if cattle and prairie dogs form a mutualistic grazing association similar to that between prairie dogs and American bison. Our experimental results show that cattle preferentially graze along prairie dog colony edges and use their colony centers for resting, resembling the mutualistic relationship prairie dogs have with American bison. Our results also show that prairie dog colonies are not only an important component of the grassland mosaic for maintaining biodiversity, but also provide benefits to cattle, thereby challenging the long-standing view of prairie dogs as an undesirable pest species in grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2089759548,"Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) are being adopted globally to protect ecosystems and supplement fisheries management. The state of California recently implemented a coast-wide network of MPAs, a statewide seafloor mapping program, and ecological characterizations of species and ecosystems targeted for protection by the network. The main goals of this study were to use these data to evaluate how well seafloor features, as proxies for habitats, are represented and replicated across an MPA network and how well ecological surveys representatively sampled fish habitats inside MPAs and adjacent reference sites. Seafloor data were classified into broad substrate categories (rock and sediment) and finer scale geomorphic classifications standard to marine classification schemes using surface analyses (slope, ruggedness, etc.) done on the digital elevation model derived from multibeam bathymetry data. These classifications were then used to evaluate the representation and replication of seafloor structure within the MPAs and across the ecological surveys. Both the broad substrate categories and the finer scale geomorphic features were proportionately represented for many of the classes with deviations of 1-6% and 0-7%, respectively. Within MPAs, however, representation of seafloor features differed markedly from original estimates, with differences ranging up to 28%. Seafloor structure in the biological monitoring design had mismatches between sampling in the MPAs and their corresponding reference sites and some seafloor structure classes were missed entirely. The geomorphic variables derived from multibeam bathymetry data for these analyses are known determinants of the distribution and abundance of marine species and for coastal marine biodiversity. Thus, analyses like those performed in this study can be a valuable initial method of evaluating and predicting the conservation value of MPAs across a regional network."
https://openalex.org/W2045913210,"In our previous study, we demonstrated that the use of the autoluminescent Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a reporter strain had the potential to drastically reduce the time, effort, animals and costs consumed in evaluation of the activities of drugs and vaccines in live mice. However, the strains were relatively unstable and lost reporter with time without selection. The kanamycin selection marker used wasn’t the best choice as it provides resistance to amino glycosides which are an important class of second line drugs used in tuberculosis treatment. In addition, the marker could limit utility of the strains for screening of new potential drugs or evaluating drug combinations for tuberculosis treatment. Limited selection marker genes for mycobacterial genetic manipulation is a major drawback for such a marker-containing strain in many research fields. Therefore, selectable marker-free, more stable autoluminescent mycobacteria are highly needed. After trying several strategies, we created such mycobacterial strains successfully by using an integrative vector and removing both the resistance maker and integrase genes by Xer site-specific recombination in one step. The corresponding plasmid vectors developed in this study could be very convenient in constructing other selectable marker-free, more stable reporter mycobacteria with diverse applications."
https://openalex.org/W2002377248,"Low voltage-activated (LVA) T-type Ca2+ channels activate in response to subthreshold membrane depolarizations and therefore represent an important source of Ca2+ influx near the resting membrane potential. In neurons, these proteins significantly contribute to control relevant physiological processes including neuronal excitability, pacemaking and post-inhibitory rebound burst firing. Three subtypes of T-type channels (Cav3.1 to Cav3.3) have been identified, and using functional expression of recombinant channels diverse studies have validated the notion that T-type Ca2+ channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands as well as by second messenger pathways. In this context, the present study reveals a previously unrecognized role for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in the regulation of native T-type channels in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, as well as recombinant Cav3.1channels heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cdk5 and its co-activators play critical roles in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, cortical lamination, neuronal cell migration and axon outgrowth. Our results show that overexpression of Cdk5 causes a significant increase in whole cell patch clamp currents through T-type channels in N1E-115 cells, while siRNA knockdown of Cdk5 greatly reduced these currents. Consistent with this, overexpression of Cdk5 in HEK-293 cells stably expressing Cav3.1channels upregulates macroscopic currents. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 2234 within the C-terminal region of the Cav3.1subunit. These results highlight a novel role for Cdk5 in the regulation of T-type Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2035965575,"Despite the ever-increasing number of dementia patients worldwide, fundamental therapeutic approaches to treat this disease remain to be established. Preventive approaches such as diet, exercise and learning attract attention. Several epidemiological studies suggest that ingestion of fermented dairy products prevents cognitive decline in the elderly. These reports indicate that specific ingredients in the fermented dairy products elicit an anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative activity that facilitates neuroprotection. The responsible components remain to be investigated. A number of studies have shown that inflammation caused by microglia is closely related to exaggeration of the pathology and cognitive decline seen in the elderly. Many researchers have proposed that controlling microglial activities could be effective in preventing and possibly curing dementia. In the present study, to elucidate specific compounds that regulate microglial activity from dairy products, repeated purification by HPLC, combined with evaluation using primary microglia, facilitated the identification of dehydroergosterol (DHE) as a novel component of the extract that enhances microglial anti-inflammatory activity. DHE contains three conjugated double bonds in a steroid ring system and is an analogue of ergosterol. Despite their related chemical structures, the anti-inflammatory activity of DHE is markedly stronger than that of ergosterol. P. candidum for camembert cheese produces DHE, but P. Roqueforti for blue cheese and Aspergillus do not. DHE also induces CD11b-positive microglia cells into CD206-positive M2 type microglia. Neurotoxicity and neuronal cell death induced by excessively activated microglia is suppressed by treatment with DHE. Thus, this is the first report to demonstrate that DHE, identified as a responsible compound in dairy products, can induce microglia into a preferable phenotype for our brain environment and can be safely introduced into the body by consumption of dairy products. We believe the uptake of DHE might help to prevent the onset of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2054393606,"Whales receive underwater sounds through a fundamentally different mechanism than their close terrestrial relatives. Instead of hearing through the ear canal, cetaceans hear through specialized fatty tissues leading to an evolutionarily novel feature: an acoustic funnel located anterior to the tympanic aperture. We traced the ontogenetic development of this feature in 56 fetal specimens from 10 different families of toothed (odontocete) and baleen (mysticete) whales, using X-ray computed tomography. We also charted ear ossification patterns through ontogeny to understand the impact of heterochronic developmental processes. We determined that the acoustic funnel arises from a prominent V-shaped structure established early in ontogeny, formed by the malleus and the goniale. In odontocetes, this V-formation develops into a cone-shaped funnel facing anteriorly, directly into intramandibular acoustic fats, which is likely functionally linked to the anterior orientation of sound reception in echolocation. In contrast, the acoustic funnel in balaenopterids rotates laterally, later in fetal development, consistent with a lateral sound reception pathway. Balaenids and several fossil mysticetes retain a somewhat anteriorly oriented acoustic funnel in the mature condition, indicating that a lateral sound reception pathway in balaenopterids may be a recent evolutionary innovation linked to specialized feeding modes, such as lunge-feeding."

Uncertainty about their potential role, current work commitments and inability to get agreement from their employer were also important barriers, whereas clarity over training would be an important enabler. In contrast, for those who were not considering going, or who had decided against going, family considerations and partner concerns were the most important factors.More UK healthcare workers would volunteer to help tackle Ebola in West Africa if there was better information available, including clarity about roles, cover arrangements, and training. This could be achieved with a well-publicised high quality portal of reliable information."

Methodology/Principal findings A cross-sectional study in patients with SAHS according to the presence (n = 132) or not (n = 264) of T2D. Both groups were matched by age, gender, BMI, and waist and neck circumferences. A subgroup of 125 subjects was also matched by AHI. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and heart failure. A higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was observed in T2D patients [32.2 (10.2–114.0) vs. 25.6 (10.2–123.4) events/hours; p = 0.002). When sleep events were evaluated separately, patients with T2D showed a significant increase in apnea events [8.4 (0.1–87.7) vs. 6.3 (0.0–105.6) e/h; p = 0.044), as well as a two-fold increase in the percentage of time spent with oxygen saturation <90% [15.7 (0.0–97.0) vs. 7.9 (0.0–95.6) %; <0.001)], higher rates of oxygen desaturation events, and also higher daily sleepiness [7.0 (0.0–21.0) vs. 5.0 (0.0–21.0); p = 0.006)] than subjects without T2D. Significant positive correlations between fasting plasma glucose and AHI, the apnea events, and CT90 were observed. Finally, multiple linear regression analyses showed that T2D was independently associated with AHI (R2 = 0.217), the apnea index (R2 = 0.194), CT90 (R2 = 0.222), and desaturation events. Conclusions/significance T2D patients present a different pattern of sleep breathing than subject without diabetes. The most important differences are the severity of hypoxemia and the number of apneas whereas the incidence of hypopnea episodes is similar."

Our work focuses on analysing if the volume of collaborations of one author together with the relevance of his collaborators is somewhat related to his research performance over time. In order to prove this relation we collected the temporal distributions of scholars’ publications and citations from the Google Scholar platform and the co-authorship network (of Computer Scientists) underlying the well-known DBLP bibliographic database. By the application of time series clustering, social network analysis and non-parametric statistics, we observe that scholars with similar publications (citations) patterns also tend to have a similar centrality in the co-authorship network. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers success evolution with respect to co-authorship."

Anthropogenic and natural changes have caused a rapid decline in gazelle populations, raising concerns about their conservation status and future survival. The genetic profile of 111 wild gazelles from Israel was determined based on three regions of mitochondrial DNA (control region, Cytochrome b and 12S ribosomal RNA) and nine nuclear microsatellite markers. Genetic analysis of the mountain gazelle population, the largest known population of this rare species, revealed adequate diversity levels and gene flow between subpopulations. Nevertheless, ongoing habitat degradation and other human effects, such as poaching, suggest the need for drastic measures to prevent species extinction. Dorcas gazelles in Israel displayed inbreeding within subpopulations while still maintaining considerable genetic diversity overall. This stable population, represented by a distinctive genetic profile, is fragmented and isolated from its relatives in neighboring localities. Based on the genetic profile of a newly sampled subpopulation in Israel, we provide an alternative hypothesis for the historic dispersal of Dorcas gazelle, from the Southern Levant to northern Africa. The small acacia gazelle population was closest to gazelles from the Farasan Islands of Saudi Arabia, based on mitochondrial markers. The two populations did not share haplotypes, suggesting that these two populations may be the last remnant wild gazelles of this species worldwide. Only a dozen acacia gazelles survive in Israel, and urgent steps are needed to ensure the survival of this genetically distinctive lineage. The genetic assessments of our study recognize new conservation priorities for each gazelle species in the Southern Levant."
https://openalex.org/W2020111425,"Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacteria and human pathogen widely used in cancer immunotherapy because of its capacity to induce a specific cytotoxic T cell response in tumours. This bacterial pathogen strongly induces innate and specific immunity with the potential to overcome tumour induced tolerance and weak immunogenicity. Here, we propose a Listeria based vaccination for melanoma based in its tropism for these tumour cells and its ability to transform in vitro and in vivo melanoma cells into matured and activated dendritic cells with competent microbicidal and antigen processing abilities. This Listeria based vaccination using low doses of the pathogen caused melanoma regression by apoptosis as well as bacterial clearance. Vaccination efficacy is LLO dependent and implies the reduction of LLO-specific CD4+ T cell responses, strong stimulation of innate pro-inflammatory immune cells and a prevalence of LLO-specific CD8+ T cells involved in tumour regression and Listeria elimination. These results support the use of low doses of pathogenic Listeria as safe melanoma therapeutic vaccines that do not require antibiotics for bacterial removal."
https://openalex.org/W2091916003,"It is generally accepted that the basal ganglia play an important role in interval timing that requires the measurement of temporal durations. By contrast, it remains controversial whether the basal ganglia play an essential role in temporal order judgment (TOJ) of successive stimuli, a behavior that does not necessarily require the measurement of durations in time. To address this issue, we compared the effects of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) on the TOJ of two successive taps delivered to each hand, with the arms uncrossed in one condition and crossed in another. In addition to age-matched elderly participants without PD (non-PD), we examined young healthy participants so that the effect of aging could serve as a control for evaluating the effects of PD. There was no significant difference between PD and non-PD participants in any parameter of TOJ under either arm posture, although reaction time was significantly longer in PD compared with non-PD participants. By contrast, the effect of aging was apparent in both conditions. With their arms uncrossed, the temporal resolution (the interstimulus interval that yielded 84% correct responses) in elderly participants was significantly worse compared with young participants. With their arms crossed, elderly participants made more errors at longer intervals (~1 s) than young participants, although both age groups showed similar judgment reversal at moderately short intervals (~200 ms). These results indicate that the basal ganglia and dopaminergic systems do not play essential roles in tactile TOJ involving both hands and that the effect of aging on TOJ is mostly independent of the dopaminergic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2103745123,"Hedgehog signaling is primarily transduced by two transcription factors: Gli2, which mainly acts as a full-length activator, and Gli3, which tends to be proteolytically processed from a full-length form (Gli3FL) to an N-terminal repressor (Gli3REP). Recent studies using a Sufu knockout mouse have indicated that Sufu is involved in regulating Gli2 and Gli3 activator and repressor activity at multiple steps of the signaling cascade; however, the mechanism of specific Gli2 and Gli3 regulation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we established an allelic series of ENU-induced mouse strains. Analysis of one of the missense alleles, SufuT396I, showed that Thr396 residue of Sufu played a key role in regulation of Gli3 activity. SufuT396I/T396I embryos exhibited severe polydactyly, which is indicative of compromised Gli3 activity. Concomitantly, significant quantitative reductions of unprocessed Gli3 (Gli3FL) and processed Gli3 (Gli3REP) were observed in vivo as well as in vitro. Genetic experiments showed that patterning defects in the limb buds of SufuT396I/T396I were rescued by a constitutive Gli3REP allele (Gli3∆699), strongly suggesting that SufuT396I reduced the truncated Gli3 repressor. In contrast, SufuT396I qualitatively exhibited no mutational effects on Gli2 regulation. Taken together, the results of this study show that the Thr396 residue of Sufu is specifically required for regulation of Gli3 but not Gli2. This implies a novel Sufu-mediated mechanism in which Gli2 activator and Gli3 repressor are differentially regulated."

However, people often act upon self-interest in irrational ways that threaten the long-term survival of the whole group. A lack of sustainable or environmentally responsible behavior is often observed. In this study, we examine how the maximization of benefits principle works in a wider social interactive context of personality preferences in order to gain a more realistic insight into the evolution of cooperation. We used time perspective (TP), a concept reflecting individual differences in orientation towards past, present, or future, and relevant for making sustainable choices. We developed a personality-driven agent-based model that explores the role of personality in the outcomes of social dilemmas and includes multiple facets of diversity: (1) The agents have different behavior strategies: individual differences derived by applying cluster analysis to survey data from 22 countries (N = 10,940) and resulting in 7 cross-cultural profiles of TP; (2) The non-uniform distribution of the types of agents across countries; (3) The diverse interactions between the agents; and (4) diverse responses to those interactions in a well-mixed population. As one of the results, we introduced an index of overall cooperation for each of the 22 countries, which was validated against cultural, economic, and sustainability indicators (HDI, dimensions of national culture, and Environment Performance Index). It was associated with higher human development, higher individualism, lower power distance, and better environmental performance. The findings illustrate how individual differences in TP can be simulated to predict the ways people in different countries solve the personal vs. common gain dilemma in the global limited-resource situation. This interdisciplinary approach to social simulation can be adopted to explain the possible causes of global environmental issues and to predict their possible outcomes."

Recently, a genetic mutation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1, N266H, was discovered in a human patient through exome sequencing. We examined the effect of this mutation on expression, targeting and activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Mutant N266H protein was expressed in AP-1 cells, which lack their endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger protein. Targeting of the mutant protein to the cell surface was normal and expression levels were only slightly reduced relative to the wild type protein. However, the N266H mutant protein had no detectable Na+/H+ exchanger activity. A histidine residue at this location may disrupt the cation binding site or the pore of the Na+/H+ exchanger protein."

Accidental contact with the caterpillar bristles causes an intense itching sensation, followed by symptoms of an acute inflammation, which last for three to seven days after the first incident. After multiple accidents a chronic inflammatory reaction, called “Pararamose”, characterized by articular synovial membrane thickening with joint deformities common to chronic synovitis, frequently occurs. Although complement mediated inflammation may aid the host defense, inappropriate or excessive activation of the complement system and generation of anaphylatoxins can lead to inflammatory disorder and pathologies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in vitro, whether the Premolis semirufa’s bristles extract could interfere with the human complement system. Results The bristles extract was able to inhibit the haemolytic activity of the alternative pathway, as well as the activation of the lectin pathway, but had no effect on the classical pathway, and this inhibition seemed to be caused by activation and consumption of complement components. The extract induced the production of significant amounts of all three anaphylatoxins, C3a, C4a and C5a, promoted direct cleavage of C3, C4 and C5 and induced a significant generation of terminal complement complexes in normal human serum. By using molecular exclusion chromatography, a serine protease of 82 kDa, which activates complement, was isolated from P. semirufa bristles extract. The protease, named here as Ps82, reduced the haemolytic activity of the alternative and classical pathways and inhibited the lectin pathway. In addition, Ps82 induced the cleavage of C3, C4 and C5 and the generation of C3a and C4a in normal human serum and it was capable to cleave human purified C5 and generate C5a. The use of Phenanthroline, metalloprotease inhibitor, in the reactions did not significantly interfere with the activity of the Ps82, whereas the presence of PMSF, serine protease inhibitor, totally blocked the activity. Conclusion These data show that a serine protease present in the Premolis semirufa’s bristles extract has the ability to activate the complement system, which may contribute to the inflammatory process presented in humans after envenomation."
https://openalex.org/W2049829104,"Objective We aimed to evaluate the association of birth weight SDS with insulin resistance, blood pressure, and auxology in children and adolescents born 23–42 weeks of gestation. Methods We studied 143 singleton children and adolescents aged 9.3 ± 3.3 years (range 2.0–17.9 years). Clinical assessments included insulin resistance measured by HOMA2-IR, auxology, and blood pressure from sphygmomanometer measurements. Continuous associations were examined, and stratified analyses carried out. For the latter, participants were divided into those of below-average birth weight (BABW, <0 SDS) and above-average birth weight (AABW, ≥0 SDS). Results Irrespective of gestational age, lower birth weight SDS was associated with progressively greater HOMA2-IR (p<0.0001) and higher fasting insulin concentrations (p<0.0001). Decreasing birth weight SDS was associated with higher systolic (p = 0.011) and diastolic (p = 0.006) blood pressure. Lower birth weight SDS was also associated with decreasing stature (p<0.010). The BABW group was ~40% more insulin resistant than AABW participants (p = 0.004), with the former also displaying fasting insulin concentrations 37% higher (p = 0.004). BABW participants were 0.54 SDS shorter than those of higher birth weight (p = 0.002). On average, BABW participants had not met their genetic potential, tending to be shorter than their parents (p = 0.065). As a result, when corrected for parents' heights, BABW participants were 0.62 SDS shorter than those born of higher birth weight (p = 0.001). Sub-group analyses on participants born appropriate-for-gestational-age (n = 128) showed that associations of birth weight SDS with both insulin resistance and stature remained (although attenuated). Conclusion Decreasing birth weight SDS (even within the normal range) is associated with adverse metabolic profile and lower stature in children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2042511497,"Aims In-stent restenosis remains a serious problem after the implantation of drug-eluting stents, which is attributable to neointima formation and re-endothelialization. Here, we tried to find a new method which aims at selectively inhibiting proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation without inhibition of re-endothelialization. Methods and Results We used the smooth muscle-specific SM22alpha promoter in a recombinant lentiviral vector to drive overexpression of cell-cycle inhibitor, p27, in VSMCs. p27 effectively inhibited VSMC proliferation mediated by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 checkpoint. The SM22alpha-p27 lentiviral vector inhibited VSMC proliferation more effectively than paclitaxel. Rats infected with Lenti-SM22alpha-p27 had a significantly lower intima/media (I/M) ratio and also showed inhibition of restenosis on day 28 after balloon injury. Moreover, the repair of injured endothelium, and re-endothelialization of the carotid artery wall, was not affected by the smooth muscle cell-specific expression of p27. Conclusion A recombinant lentiviral vector carrying the SM22alpha promoter was used to effectively infect and selectively overexpress p27 protein in VSMCs, leading to inhibition of intimal hyperplasia without compromising endothelial repair."
https://openalex.org/W2011807898,"Occupancy surveys should be designed to minimise false absences. This is commonly achieved by increasing replication or increasing the efficiency of surveys. In the case of destructive sampling designs, in which searches of individual microhabitats represent the repeat surveys, minimising false absences leads to an inherent trade-off. Surveyors can sample more low quality microhabitats, bearing the resultant financial costs and producing wider-spread impacts, or they can target high quality microhabitats were the focal species is more likely to be found and risk more severe impacts on local habitat quality. We show how this trade-off can be solved with a decision-theoretic approach, using the Millewa Skink Hemiergis millewae from southern Australia as a case study. Hemiergis millewae is an endangered reptile that is best detected using destructive sampling of grass hummocks. Within sites that were known to be occupied by H. millewae, logistic regression modelling revealed that lizards were more frequently detected in large hummocks. If this model is an accurate representation of the detection process, searching large hummocks is more efficient and requires less replication, but this strategy also entails destruction of the best microhabitats for the species. We developed an optimisation tool to calculate the minimum combination of the number and size of hummocks to search to achieve a given cumulative probability of detecting the species at a site, incorporating weights to reflect the sensitivity of the results to a surveyor’s priorities. The optimisation showed that placing high weight on minimising volume necessitates impractical replication, whereas placing high weight on minimising replication requires searching very large hummocks which are less common and may be vital for H. millewae. While destructive sampling methods are sometimes necessary, surveyors must be conscious of the ecological impacts of these methods. This study provides a simple tool for identifying sampling strategies that minimise those impacts."
