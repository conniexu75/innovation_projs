https://openalex.org/W2104666893,"A fundamental question in cancer biology is whether cells with tumorigenic potential are common or rare within human cancers. Studies on diverse cancers, including melanoma, have indicated that only rare human cancer cells (0.1-0.0001%) form tumours when transplanted into non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. However, the extent to which NOD/SCID mice underestimate the frequency of tumorigenic human cancer cells has been uncertain. Here we show that modified xenotransplantation assay conditions, including the use of more highly immunocompromised NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (Il2rg(-/-)) mice, can increase the detection of tumorigenic melanoma cells by several orders of magnitude. In limiting dilution assays, approximately 25% of unselected melanoma cells from 12 different patients, including cells from primary and metastatic melanomas obtained directly from patients, formed tumours under these more permissive conditions. In single-cell transplants, an average of 27% of unselected melanoma cells from four different patients formed tumours. Modifications to xenotransplantation assays can therefore dramatically increase the detectable frequency of tumorigenic cells, demonstrating that they are common in some human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2001502279,"It has been a long-standing goal in applied physics to construct devices in which superconductivity can be switched on and off with an electric field. In the past few years, a promising candidate has emerged; interfaces between complex oxides, in which a variety of electronic phases can be obtained. It was recently shown that the conducting interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (both in bulk form are insulators) can become superconducting. Caviglia et al. now use the electric field effect, which tunes the charge carrier density, to explore the phase diagram of the system. A remarkable feature is that superconductivity can be switched on and off, driving a quantum phase transition between a two-dimensional superconducting and insulating state. It has been a goal in applied physics to construct devices in which superconductivity can be switched on and off with an electric field. Recently, it was shown that the conducting interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (both in bulk form are insulators) can produce a two-dimensional superconducting condensate. This paper now uses the electric field effect, which tunes the charge carrier density, to explore the phase diagram of the system. Interfaces between complex oxides are emerging as one of the most interesting systems in condensed matter physics1. In this special setting, in which translational symmetry is artificially broken, a variety of new and unusual electronic phases can be promoted2. Theoretical studies predict complex phase diagrams and suggest the key role of the charge carrier density in determining the systems’ ground states. A particularly fascinating system is the conducting interface between the band insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 (ref. 3). Recently two possible ground states have been experimentally identified: a magnetic state4 and a two-dimensional superconducting condensate5. Here we use the electric field effect to explore the phase diagram of the system. The electrostatic tuning of the carrier density allows an on/off switching of superconductivity and drives a quantum phase transition6,7,8 between a two-dimensional superconducting state and an insulating state. Analyses of the magnetotransport properties in the insulating state are consistent with weak localization and do not provide evidence for magnetism. The electric field control of superconductivity demonstrated here opens the way to the development of new mesoscopic superconducting circuits."

We have previously documented that transplanted haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations localize to subdomains of bone-marrow microvessels where the chemokine CXCL12 is particularly abundant3. Using a combination of high-resolution confocal microscopy and two-photon video imaging of individual haematopoietic cells in the calvarium bone marrow of living mice over time, we examine the relationship of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to blood vessels, osteoblasts and endosteal surface as they home and engraft in irradiated and c-Kit-receptor-deficient recipient mice. Osteoblasts were enmeshed in microvessels and relative positioning of stem/progenitor cells within this complex tissue was nonrandom and dynamic. Both cell autonomous and non-autonomous factors influenced primitive cell localization. Different haematopoietic cell subsets localized to distinct locations according to the stage of differentiation. When physiological challenges drove either engraftment or expansion, bone-marrow stem/progenitor cells assumed positions in close proximity to bone and osteoblasts. Our analysis permits observing in real time, at a single cell level, processes that previously have been studied only by their long-term outcome at the organismal level."
https://openalex.org/W2170100837,"The concept of an individual swapping his or her body with that of another person has captured the imagination of writers and artists for decades. Although this topic has not been the subject of investigation in science, it exemplifies the fundamental question of why we have an ongoing experience of being located inside our bodies. Here we report a perceptual illusion of body-swapping that addresses directly this issue. Manipulation of the visual perspective, in combination with the receipt of correlated multisensory information from the body was sufficient to trigger the illusion that another person's body or an artificial body was one's own. This effect was so strong that people could experience being in another person's body when facing their own body and shaking hands with it. Our results are of fundamental importance because they identify the perceptual processes that produce the feeling of ownership of one's body."

We examined the expression of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) <i>YSL</i> genes (<i>OsYSL1-18</i>) in the epidermis/exodermis, cortex, and stele of rice roots. Expression of <i>OsYSL15</i> in root epidermis and stele was induced by iron deficiency and showed daily fluctuation. OsYSL15 restored a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when supplied with iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid and transported iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. An OsYSL15-green fluorescent protein fusion was localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells. <i>OsYSL15</i> promoter-β-glucuronidase analysis revealed that <i>OsYSL15</i> expression in roots was dominant in the epidermis/exodermis and phloem cells under conditions of iron deficiency and was detected only in phloem under iron sufficiency. These results strongly suggest that <i>OsYSL15</i> is the dominant iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter responsible for iron uptake from the rhizosphere and is also responsible for phloem transport of iron. <i>OsYSL15</i> was also expressed in flowers, developing seeds, and in the embryonic scutellar epithelial cells during seed germination. <i>OsYSL15</i> knockdown seedlings showed severe arrest in germination and early growth and were rescued by high iron supply. These results demonstrate that rice OsYSL15 plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis during the early stages of growth."
https://openalex.org/W2041085963,"Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles that have diverse roles in cell motility and sensing extracellular signals. Motility defects in cilia and flagella often result in primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the mechanisms underlying cilia formation and function, and in particular the cytoplasmic assembly of dyneins that power ciliary motility, are only poorly understood. Here we report a new gene, kintoun (ktu), involved in this cytoplasmic process. This gene was first identified in a medaka mutant, and found to be mutated in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients from two affected families as well as in the pf13 mutant of Chlamydomonas. In the absence of Ktu/PF13, both outer and inner dynein arms are missing or defective in the axoneme, leading to a loss of motility. Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies show that Ktu/PF13 is one of the long-sought proteins involved in pre-assembly of dynein arm complexes in the cytoplasm before intraflagellar transport loads them for the ciliary compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2054600904,"The synthesis and storage of neutral lipids in lipid droplets is a fundamental property of eukaryotic cells, but the spatial organization of this process is poorly understood. Here we examined the intracellular localization of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis in eukaryotes. We found that DGAT2 expressed in cultured cells localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) under basal conditions. After providing oleate to drive TG synthesis, DGAT2 also localized to near the surface of lipid droplets, where it co-localized with mitochondria. Biochemical fractionation revealed that DGAT2 is present in mitochondria-associated membranes, specialized domains of the ER that are highly enriched in lipid synthetic enzymes and interact tightly with mitochondria. The interaction of DGAT2 with mitochondria depended on 67 N-terminal amino acids of DGAT2, which are not conserved in family members that have different catalytic functions. This targeting signal was sufficient to localize a red fluorescent protein to mitochondria. A highly conserved, positively charged, putative mitochondrial targeting signal was identified in murine DGAT2 between amino acids 61 and 66. Thus, DGAT2, an ER-resident transmembrane domain-containing enzyme, is also found in mitochondria-associated membranes, where its N terminus may promote its association with mitochondria.

Most eukaryotic cells can synthesize neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TGs) 2The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; ADRP, adipose differentiation-related protein; BODIPY 493/503, 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HSP70, heat-shock protein 70; MAM, mitochondria-associated membranes; MGAT, monoacylglycerol acyltransferase; 18:1, oleate; RFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; ADRP, adipose differentiation-related protein; BODIPY 493/503, 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7,8-pentamethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HSP70, heat-shock protein 70; MAM, mitochondria-associated membranes; MGAT, monoacylglycerol acyltransferase; 18:1, oleate; RFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and sterol esters, and store them in cytosolic lipid droplets. Yet, a molecular understanding of this process and how it is spatially organized is lacking. For example, lipid substrates for TG synthesis (fatty acids and glycerolipid precursors) are found in the cytoplasm and membranes, energy for activating fatty acids (by converting to fatty acyl-CoA) comes from mitochondria, and the enzymes that catalyze TG formation are primarily found in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How the cell orchestrates this complex anabolic process to maximize lipid synthesis and storage during times of substrate excess is poorly understood. In most cells, TG synthesis occurs via the glycerol 3-phosphate (Kennedy) pathway and involves multiple enzymatic reactions in different subcellular compartments (1Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The fatty acids for TG synthesis must first be “activated” by acyl-CoA synthases, a family of enzymes that localize to membranes of different compartments, including the ER, mitochondria, and plasma membrane (2Lewin T.M. Kim J.-H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24674-24679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and utilize ATP to ligate CoA to the fatty acyl chain. Next, these fatty acids enter the Kennedy pathway of glycerolipid synthesis, in which the first two reactions occur in both the ER and mitochondria. In the first reaction, glycerol 3-phosphate and a fatty acyl-CoA are combined to yield lysophosphatidic acid through the actions of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase enzymes (1Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 3Gimeno R.E. Cao J. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2079-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the second reaction, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase enzymes catalyze the esterification of lysophosphatidic acid with fatty acyl-CoA to form phosphatidic acid (1Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 4Shindou H. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Next, phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated at membrane surfaces by phosphatidate phosphatase to yield diacylglycerol (1Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 5Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

The final reaction of TG synthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes (7Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A recent study of the subcellular localizations of tung tree DGAT1 and DGAT2 in tobacco BY-2 cells revealed that the enzymes are located in distinct, non-overlapping regions of the ER (21Shockey J.M. Gidda S.K. Chapital D.C. Kuan J.C. Dhanoa P.K. Bland J.M. Rothstein S.J. Mullen R.T. Dyer J.M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2294-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Most recently, DGAT2 was reported to co-localize with lipid droplets in cultured adipocytes (22Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). As a step toward a better understanding of the cellular organization of processes that contribute to TG synthesis and storage, we determined the subcellular localization of murine DGAT2 in mammalian cells. Construction of Plasmids—Murine DGAT2, DGAT1, and human acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (MGAT2), with N-terminal FLAG epitopes (MGDYKDDDDG, epitope underlined) were cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). For co-expression of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in COS-7 cells, DGAT1 and DGAT2 were cloned in-frame into the pBudCE4.1 dual expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid contained DGAT1 with a C-terminal myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and DGAT2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Δ55, Δ30-67, and W3RKK3A DGAT2 mutants were generated, using DGAT2 as a template, in mutagenesis reactions with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid, N67RFP, was constructed by cloning a PCR-amplified fragment of DGAT2 (amino acid residues 1-67), in-frame, to the N terminus of monomeric RFP (a gift from Dr. Roger Tsien) (23Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 24Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E.

Mutants 1-30RFP, 30-67RFP, and 67RKKA3-RFP were generated by using N67RFP as a template in mutagenesis reactions and the QuikChange II kit. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For transfections, 3 μg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 9 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was added to a 100-mm culture dish containing 9 ml of medium and cells at ∼75% confluence. After 24 h, transfected cells were harvested and used for DGAT activity assays or subcellular fractionation experiments. McArdle rat hepatoma RH7777 cells stably expressing DGAT1 and DGAT2 were generated as described before (13Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J.

DGAT Activity Assays—Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation (1000 × g). To lyse cells, the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 250 mm sucrose and passed through a 27-gauge needle 15 times. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant or mouse liver membrane fractions (10-50 μg of protein) were used for in vitro DGAT activity assays, performed as described (13Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E.

In some experiments, cell lysates were preincubated with 0.5 mm DGAT1 inhibitor (2-((1s,4s)-4-(4-(4-amino-7,7-dimethyl-7H-pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4]oxazin-6-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid) to reduce endogenous DGAT activity. The inhibitor was synthesized by Syngene International Ltd. (Bangalore, India). Immunoblot Analyses—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with the following antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma, 1:2,000), rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma, 1:2,000), rabbit anti-DGAT2 (1:2,000), anti-calnexin (Stressgen, 1:1,000), anti-c-Myc (9E10, Calbiochem, 1:1,000), anti-cytochrome c (Upstate Biotechnologies, 1:10,000), anti-heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70, Affinity Bioreagents, 1:2,000), anti-GAPDH (Covance, 1:2,000), anti-RFP (Chemicon, 1:1,000), anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (clone 20E8, Molecular Probes, 1:1,000), anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, 1:2,000), and anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad, 1:2,000). Protein-antibody complexes were visualized with the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce). Membranes were exposed to Fuji RX film. Bands were quantified by scanning densitometry with ImageJ image analysis software (National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells in 6-well dishes were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of FuGENE 6. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and re-plated into 12-well plates containing glass coverslips and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 0.5 mm oleate complexed to 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 12 h to promote lipid droplet formation. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 5 min to block nonspecific antibody binding and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the indicated primary antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (1:500) and rabbit anti-calnexin (1:200), rabbit anti-Mito(1491) (a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes an unknown mitochondrial protein; a generous gift from Dr. Peter Walter, University of California, San Francisco) (1:200), or rabbit anti-giantin. For some experiments, fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-c-Myc (1:200) and rabbit anti-FLAG (1:200). After incubation with primary antibodies, cells were exposed to goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200) and donkey anti-mouse 594 (1:200) secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min. All manipulations were performed at room temperature. To visualize lipid droplets, fixed cells were stained with the neutral lipid stain, BODIPY 493/503 (Molecular Probes), during incubation with donkey anti-mouse 594 secondary antibody. In some experiments, mitochondria were visualized by incubating cells expressing FLAG-tagged DGAT2 with 0.5 μm MitoTracker Red for 20 min. Cells were fixed as described above and incubated first with mouse anti-FLAG, and then with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Calbiochem). To visualize the lipid droplet protein, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), COS-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing an ADRP-GFP fusion protein (a gift from C. Sztalryd, University of Maryland) and FLAG-tagged DGAT2. Cells were fixed as described above, and DGAT2 was detected by staining cells with mouse anti-FLAG and donkey anti-mouse 594. ADRP was visualized detecting GFP fluorescence. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with a drop of Immuno-Fluore mounting medium (ICN) and allowed to set overnight. Confocal images were acquired with a LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Images were processed with LSM Image Browser (Zeiss), ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop.

Subcellular Fractionation—Microsomal, mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), and mitochondrial fractions were isolated from cultured cells as described (26Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in isolation medium (250 mm mannitol, 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm EGTA) with 15-20 up-and-down strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem motor-driven homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the fraction containing mitochondria plus MAM. The 10,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti-70.1 rotor at 4 °C to pellet microsomes, which were resuspended in isolation medium. The mitochondria plus MAM pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of isolation medium and layered on top of 8 ml of Percoll medium (225 mm mannitol, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, and 30% Percoll (v/v)) and centrifuged for 30 min at 95,000 × g. A dense band containing purified mitochondria was recovered from ∼3/4 down the tube, diluted with isolation medium, and washed twice by centrifugation at 6300 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in isolation medium. Purified MAMs were recovered from the Percoll gradient as a diffuse white band located above the mitochondria. MAMs were diluted with isolation medium and centrifuged at 6300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, containing MAMs, was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti-70.1 rotor. MAMs were resuspended in isolation medium. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Tukey test. DGAT2 Is Localized to the ER and Associates with Lipid Droplets—To determine the subcellular localization of murine DGAT2, we expressed N-terminal FLAG-tagged DGAT2 in COS-7 cells and compared its distribution with that of calnexin, a resident ER membrane protein. Under basal culture conditions, DGAT2 exhibited a typical ER (reticular) staining pattern and co-localized extensively with calnexin (Fig. 1A, upper panel). DGAT2 and calnexin were also concentrated in the perinuclear region. When COS-7 cells transiently expressing DGAT2 were treated with 0.5 mm oleate for 12 h, both DGAT2 and calnexin were concentrated at the surface of large spherical structures that appeared to be lipid droplets (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Calnexin, but not DGAT2, has been identified as a lipid droplet-associated protein (27Brasaemle D.L. Dolios G. Shapiro L. Wang R. J. Biol.

Total cellular DGAT activity in McArdle RH7777 cells expressing DGAT2 and treated with 0.25 mm oleate for 12 h was not increased relative to untreated cells (data not shown), indicating that the enzymatic activity did not change upon the change in localization. To confirm that the spherical structures were lipid droplets, we compared the localization of DGAT2 with that of a lipid droplet protein, ADRP. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with DGAT2 and a plasmid that expresses an ADRP-GFP fusion protein. In transfected cells that were treated with oleate, DGAT2 and ADRP co-localized at the surfaces of lipid droplets (Fig. 1B). We also co-stained DGAT2-transfected cells with the neutral lipid dye, BODIPY 493/503. In oleate-treated cells, DGAT2 had a striking ring-like localization around lipid droplets, which were concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2A). These findings agree with those reported by Kuerschner et al. (22Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), who also showed that DGAT2 co-localizes with lipid droplets in oleate-loaded COS-7 cells. In that study, a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the N or C termini of DGAT2 restricted its localization to the ER, whereas untagged DGAT2 localized predominantly to lipid droplets after lipid loading, suggesting that an epitope tag interferes with DGAT2 localization. This was apparently not the case for DGAT2 with the N-terminal FLAG-epitope that was used in our experiments. Both FLAG-epitope-tagged DGAT2 and untagged DGAT2 exhibited typical ER staining patterns and were present around lipid droplets in oleate-loaded cells (data not shown). We therefore performed all subsequent studies with FLAG-tagged DGAT2. Unlike DGAT2, the lipid acyltransferases DGAT1 and MGAT-2 showed predominantly an ER-staining pattern and did not redistribute to a similar degree around lipid droplets in oleate-treated cells (Fig. 2, B and C). We also examined the size and number of lipid droplets produced by cells expressing DGAT1, DGAT2, and MGAT2 that had been treated with 0.5 mm oleate for 12 h (Table 1). (The lipid droplet staining pattern of untransfected COS-7 cells treated with or without 0.5 mm oleate is shown in supplemental Fig. S1.) Lipid droplets in cells expressing DGAT1 or MGAT2 were similar in size to control cells but were ∼3-fold and ∼1.6-fold more numerous, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, lipid droplets in COS-7 cells expressing DGAT2 exhibited a 2-fold greater diameter than control cells and a marked reduction (∼60%) in the number of lipid droplets, which could result from coalescence of smaller droplets to produce fewer large lipid droplets. This is similar to the findings in McArdle RH7777 rat hepatoma cells stably expressing DGAT1 and DGAT2 (13Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J.

Open table in a new tab Co-localization of DGAT2 with Mitochondria after Lipid Loading—We next compared the localization of DGAT2 to that of other organelles, such as mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus. For mitochondria, we used the markers Mito-Tracker Red and Mito(1491). Mito(1491) is a protein with an undefined function that resides exclusively in the mitochondria and completely co-localizes with MitoTracker Red (supplemental Fig. S3). In COS-7 cells transfected with DGAT2 not treated with oleate, mitochondria displayed a typical worm-like staining pattern for both MitoTracker Red and Mito(1491) and partially co-localized with DGAT2 (Fig. 3, A and B, upper panels). Strikingly, when COS-7 cells expressing FLAG-DGAT2 were incubated with 0.5 mm oleate to promote lipid droplet formation, mitochondria underwent a dramatic re-organization around lipid droplets and co-localized almost completely with DGAT2 (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels). To determine if the rearrangement around the lipid droplet surface was specific for mitochondria, we examined the subcellular distribution of the Golgi marker, giantin, under identical conditions. Unlike mitochondria, giantin did not undergo re-organization around the lipid droplet surface of oleate-loaded COS-7 cells expressing DGAT2 and displayed a typical Golgi staining pattern in both the absence and presence of oleate (Fig. 3C). Mitochondrial re-organization was not observed in COS-7 cells expressing MGAT2 or DGAT1 (data not shown). DGAT2 Is Present in MAM—DGAT activity is enriched in MAM (31Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H.

https://openalex.org/W1990184879,"Terrestrial wetland emissions are the largest single source of the greenhouse gas methane. Northern high-latitude wetlands contribute significantly to the overall methane emissions from wetlands, but the relative source distribution between tropical and high-latitude wetlands remains uncertain. As a result, not all the observed spatial and seasonal patterns of atmospheric methane concentrations can be satisfactorily explained, particularly for high northern latitudes. For example, a late-autumn shoulder is consistently observed in the seasonal cycles of atmospheric methane at high-latitude sites, but the sources responsible for these increased methane concentrations remain uncertain. Here we report a data set that extends hourly methane flux measurements from a high Arctic setting into the late autumn and early winter, during the onset of soil freezing. We find that emissions fall to a low steady level after the growing season but then increase significantly during the freeze-in period. The integral of emissions during the freeze-in period is approximately equal to the amount of methane emitted during the entire summer season. Three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry and transport model simulations of global atmospheric methane concentrations indicate that the observed early winter emission burst improves the agreement between the simulated seasonal cycle and atmospheric data from latitudes north of 60 degrees N. Our findings suggest that permafrost-associated freeze-in bursts of methane emissions from tundra regions could be an important and so far unrecognized component of the seasonal distribution of methane emissions from high latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2097823859,"The great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and tsunami of 2004 was a dramatic reminder of the importance of understanding the seismic and tsunami hazards of subduction zones. In March 2005, the Sunda megathrust ruptured again, producing an event of moment magnitude (M(w)) 8.6 south of the 2004 rupture area, which was the site of a similar event in 1861 (ref. 6). Concern was then focused on the Mentawai area, where large earthquakes had occurred in 1797 (M(w) = 8.8) and 1833 (M(w) = 9.0). Two earthquakes, one of M(w) = 8.4 and, twelve hours later, one of M(w) = 7.9, indeed occurred there on 12 September 2007. Here we show that these earthquakes ruptured only a fraction of the area ruptured in 1833 and consist of distinct asperities within a patch of the megathrust that had remained locked in the interseismic period. This indicates that the same portion of a megathrust can rupture in different patterns depending on whether asperities break as isolated seismic events or cooperate to produce a larger rupture. This variability probably arises from the influence of non-permanent barriers, zones with locally lower pre-stress due to the past earthquakes. The stress state of the portion of the Sunda megathrust that had ruptured in 1833 and 1797 was probably not adequate for the development of a single large rupture in 2007. The moment released in 2007 amounts to only a fraction both of that released in 1833 and of the deficit of moment that had accumulated as a result of interseismic strain since 1833. The potential for a large megathrust event in the Mentawai area thus remains large."

We observed complex metabolic abnormalities in GPRC6A(-/-) mice involving multiple organ systems that express GPRC6A, including bone, kidney, testes, and liver. GPRC6A(-/-) mice exhibited hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. In addition, we observed high expression of GPRC6A in Leydig cells in the testis. Ablation of GPRC6A resulted in feminization of male GPRC6A(-/-) mice in association with decreased lean body mass, increased fat mass, increased circulating levels of estradiol, and reduced levels of testosterone. GPRC6A was also highly expressed in kidney proximal and distal tubules, and GPRC6A(-/-) mice exhibited increments in urine Ca/Cr and PO(4)/Cr ratios as well as low molecular weight proteinuria. Finally, GPRC6A(-/-) mice exhibited a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) in association with impaired mineralization of bone.GPRC6A(-/-) mice have a metabolic syndrome characterized by defective osteoblast-mediated bone mineralization, abnormal renal handling of calcium and phosphorus, fatty liver, glucose intolerance and disordered steroidogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1983943582,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy-sensing enzyme, counteracts energy depletion by stimulation of energy production and limitation of energy utilization. On energy depletion, erythrocytes undergo suicidal death or eryptosis, triggered by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) activity ([Ca(2+)](i)) and characterized by cell shrinkage and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure at the erythrocyte surface. The present study explored whether AMPK participates in the regulation of eryptosis. Western blotting and confocal microscopy disclosed AMPK expression in erythrocytes. [Ca(2+)](i) (Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume (forward scatter), and PS exposure (annexin V binding) were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Glucose removal increased [Ca(2+)](i), decreased cell volume, and increased PS exposure. The AMPK-inhibitor compound C (20 microM) did not significantly modify eryptosis under glucose-replete conditions but significantly augmented the eryptotic effect of glucose withdrawal. An increase in [Ca(2+)](i) by Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin triggered eryptosis, an effect blunted by the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR; 1 mM). As compared with erythrocytes from wild-type littermates (ampk(+/+)), erythrocytes from AMPKalpha1-deficient mice (ampk(-/-)) were significantly more susceptible to the eryptotic effect of energy depletion. The ampk(-/-) mice were anemic despite excessive reticulocytosis, and they suffered from severe splenomegaly, again pointing to enhanced erythrocyte turnover. The observations disclose a critical role of AMPK in the survival of circulating erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2005765669,"Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars in close binary systems. They play an important role as cosmological distance indicators and have led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Among the most important unsolved questions about supernovae are how the explosion actually proceeds and whether accretion occurs from a companion or by the merging of two white dwarfs. Tycho Brahe's supernova of 1572 (SN 1572) is thought to be one of the best candidates for a type Ia supernova in the Milky Way. The proximity of the SN 1572 remnant has allowed detailed studies, such as the possible identification of the binary companion, and provides a unique opportunity to test theories of the explosion mechanism and the nature of the progenitor. The determination of the hitherto unknown spectroscopic type of this supernova is crucial in relating these results to the diverse population of type Ia supernovae. Here we report an optical spectrum of Tycho's supernova near maximum brightness, obtained from a scattered-light echo more than four centuries after the direct light from the explosion swept past the Earth. We find that SN 1572 belongs to the majority class of normal type Ia supernovae."

The same VDAC1-based peptides also detached HK bound to brain or tumor-derived mitochondria.

In mammals, HK-I and HK-II are strategically located at the outer membrane of mitochondria, where they gain preferential access to mitochondrially generated ATP (6Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Google Scholar). In this manner, HK-I and HK-II drive the high glycolytic rates typical of tumor cells, even under aerobic conditions (1Pedersen P.L.

Such elevated levels of mitochondria-bound HK is suggested to play a pivotal role in promoting cell growth and survival in rapidly growing, highly glycolytic tumors and in protecting against mitochondria-mediated cell death (1Pedersen P.L.

Indeed, overexpression of mitochondria-bound HK in the tumor-derived cell line U-937, in T-REx-293, or in vascular smooth muscle cells suppressed staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell death (8Azoulay-Zohar H.

Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar). A decrease in apoptotic cell death and concomitant increase in cell proliferation have also been reported to be induced upon HK-II expression in NIH-3T3 (7Fanciulli M. Paggi M.G. Bruno T. Del Carlo C. Bonetto F. Gentile F.P. Floridi A. Oncol. Res.. 1994; 6: 405-409Google Scholar), rat 1a fibroblasts (10Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N.

In addition, binding of HK-II to mitochondria inhibited Bax-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis (12Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Google Scholar). Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis results in the efflux of a number of potential apoptotic regulators, such as cytochrome c, to the cytosol, triggering caspases activation and cell destruction. The molecular mechanism of HK-mediated protection against cell death involves HK-I and HK-II binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (8Azoulay-Zohar H.

Yamazaki N. Baba Y. Terada H. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2000; 267: 6067-6073Google Scholar). Also, it has been recently shown that acute viruses, such as HEV, can protect infected cells from apoptotic death via enhanced VDAC and HK expression (18Moin S.M. Panteva M. Jameel S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 21124-21133Google Scholar). VDAC is a key channel protein that integrates cellular energy metabolism. VDAC has also been recognized as a key protein in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, as the proposed target for the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family of proteins and due to its function in the release of apoptotic proteins (19Shimizu S.

HK-I also prevented opening of the permeability transition pore and suppresses the release of cytochrome c, thus inhibiting the mitochondrial phase of apoptosis (8Azoulay-Zohar H. Israelson A. Abu-Hamad S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J.. 2004; 377: 347-355Google Scholar), and thereby contributing to cell survival (12Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Google Scholar, 22Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1368: 7-18Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the interaction of HK with VDAC can be regulated via VDAC phosphorylation (23Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Shulga N. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 10545-10554Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Akt activation partly inhibits apoptosis by promoting the binding of HK-II to mitochondria (23Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Shulga N. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 10545-10554Google Scholar). This effect of Akt was shown to be mediated by negative regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β-phosphorylated VDAC is unable to bind HK-II, shifting the equilibrium toward cytosolic HK and thus allowing apoptosis induction (23Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Shulga N. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 10545-10554Google Scholar). These results suggest that HK-I or HK-II, via their interaction with VDAC1, prevent key events in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Despite these advances, the precise VDAC1 sequences interacting with HK-I or HK-II remain unknown. Recently, using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified VDAC1 domains that interact with HK-I (24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar), located in two cytoplasmic domains, according to previously proposed VDAC1 topology models (25Colombini M. Mol. Cell. Biochem.. 2004; 256-257: 107-115Google Scholar, 26De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10191-10200Google Scholar). However, according to recently published NMR-based VDAC1 structure (27Bayrhuber M. Meins T. Habeck M. Becker S. Giller K. Villinger S. Vonrhein C. Griesinger C. Zweckstetter M. Zeth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2008; 105: 15370-15373Google Scholar, 28Hiller S. Garces R.G. Malia T.J. Orekhov V.Y. Colombini M. Wagner G. Science.. 2008; 321: 1206-1210Google Scholar) only part of these domains are exposed to the cytosol. In addition, the amphipathic N-terminal domain of VDAC1 (24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar, 27Bayrhuber M. Meins T. Habeck M. Becker S. Giller K. Villinger S. Vonrhein C. Griesinger C. Zweckstetter M. Zeth K.

Science.. 2008; 321: 1206-1210Google Scholar) was identified as the HK-I interaction site. 3S. Abu-Hamad, D. Calo, N. Arbel, L. Arzoine, I. Israelson, N. Keinan, R. Ben-Romano, O. Friedman, and V. Shoshan-Barmatz, J. Cell Science, in press. These VDAC1 domains are involved in HK-I-mediated protection against cell death via the inhibition of cytochrome c release. In this study, we have used VDAC1-based synthetic and recombinant peptides to define the boundaries of VDAC1 sequences essential for HK-I and HK-II binding, and show their abilities to disturb HK mediating protection against cell death. Materials—Glucose 6-phosphate, Hepes, lactate dehydrogenase, leupeptin, mannitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, propidium iodide, pyruvate kinase, staurosporine, sucrose, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. A Cibacron blue HiTrap™ Blue HP column was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-VDAC antibodies came from Calbiochem-Novobiochem (Nottingham, UK). Monoclonal antibodies against actin and polyclonal goat antibodies against HK-I and HK-II were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-goat antibodies were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Five mVDAC1 peptide-encoding inserts were generated by standard PCR and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the tetracycline-inducible pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen), using mVDAC1 cDNA as a template and the primers indicated in Table 1. The N-terminal-, LP1-, LP2-, LP3-, and LP4-coding VDAC1 sequences (Fig. 1) were generated using primers F-N and R-N and F-1 and R-1 to F-4 and R-4, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this study to generate recombinant VDAC1-based peptides and their corresponding sequencesInsert nameOligonucleotidesSequence (5′ to 3′)NF-NGCCAGATCTATGGCTGTGCCACCCACGTAR-NCGAATTCTCATAAGCCAAATCCATAGCCCTTLP1F-1GCCAGATCTATCGATATGTCCTGGACCTGGGAAAGATGGACTGAGTACGGCCTGACGTR-1CGAATTCTCATTTCCAGGTCCATTTATTGTCGGTATTCCATTTCTCTGTALP2F-2GCCAGATCTATCGATATGTCCTGGACCTGGGAATCATCCTTCTCACCTAACACTGGGAR-2CGAATTCTCATTTCCAGGTCCATTTCCGCTTGTACCCTGTCTTGATTTTALP3F-3GCCAGATCTATGTCCTGGACCTGGGAAGAGACTGCAAAATCCCGAGTGR-3CGAATTCTCATTTCCAGGTCCATTTATCAGTCTTGTAGCCAACTGCLP4F-4GCCAGATCTATCGATATGTCCTGGACCTGGGAAAAGAAGTTGGAGACCGCTGTCAATCR-4CGAATTCTCATTTCCAGGTCCATTTGTTACTGTTTCCTGCTGTCCAGGCA Open table in a new tab The four VDAC1 loop-based peptides, LP1 to LP4, were flanked by a tryptophan zipper motif, namely, the SWTWE amino acid sequence at the N terminus of the peptide and KWTWK sequence at the C terminus. Correct constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The pcDNA3-HK-II and pcDNA3-HK-I plasmids were kindly provided by J. E. Wilson (Michigan State University), and the HK-I-GFP fusion protein, in which GFP was connected to the HK-I C-terminal, was generated as described previously (24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar). Construction of the native and mutated mVDAC1 vectors, mVDAC1-, mVDAC1/E72Q-, mVDAC1/E202Q-, and mVDAC1/K109L-pcDNA4/TO, was described previously (24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar). Peptides Synthesis—The synthetic N-terminal, LP1, LP2, LP3, and LP4 VDAC1-based peptides were synthesized by the Oligonucleotides and Peptide Synthesis Unit, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel. The LP4-Antp looped-shaped peptide, including the cell penetrating peptide, Antp, the peptide Antp, and other VDAC1-based peptides, were synthesized by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China). The N-terminal and LP4 peptides were water-soluble, whereas the other peptides were dissolved in Me2SO. Cancer Cell Lines and Tumors—CT26 is a murine colon carcinoma cell line, B16 is a murine melanoma cell line, BCL1 is a murine B cell leukemia cell line, MCF7 represents a human breast carcinoma cell line, and Molt4 is a human T lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. All were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) or provided by Dr. Eliezer Flescher (Tel Aviv University). T-REx-293 cells correspond to a transformed primary human embryonal kidney cell line expressing the tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen). Cell growth was maintained in a humidified atmosphere, at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CT26, B16, MCF-7, and T-REx-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biological Industries), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and nonessential amino acids (all from Biological Industries). Molt4 and BCL1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from venous blood of healthy donors were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation, as previously described (30Rotem R. Heyfets A. Fingrut O. Blickstein D. Shaklai M. Flescher E. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 1984-1993Google Scholar). To generate BCL1 leukemia-bearing C57BL BALB/c mice (Tel-Aviv University), animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with BCL1 cells freshly extracted from BCL1-bearing mice. Four weeks later, the mice were killed under anesthesia, their spleens were removed, and the cells were extracted by spleen dispersion. Red blood cells were disrupted using red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma). Cell Transfection—Logarithmically growing T-REx-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids pcDNA3-HK-II or pcDNA3-HK-I alone or with one of the following vectors: each of the mVDAC1-peptide-encoding pcDNA4/TO plasmids or the native or mutated mVDAC1-encoding pcDNA4/TO plasmid (or the corresponding control plasmid). Transfections were performed using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h growth in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml), cells were subjected to the desired treatment. Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide Staining of Cells—To determine the extent of apoptosis, cells were subjected to staining with 100 μg/ml acridine orange and 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide (EtBr) in PBS (see figure legends). Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Death—T-REx-293, Molt4, B16, and CT26 cells were incubated for 90 min with 20 μm LP4-Antp or Antp peptides in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. MCF7 cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with the peptides for 3 and 2 h, respectively. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide (PI). The level of cell death, reflected by the percentage of PI-positive cells, was determined by a flow cytometer (FACScan, BD Biosciences) and ModFIT-lt2.0 software. Cytochrome c Release Induced by Staurosporine (STS)—Control T-REx-293 cells and T-REx-293 cells expressing HK-I or HK-II and/or VDAC1-based peptides were grown on 60-mm dishes for 72 h in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml). Thereafter, cells were exposed to STS (1.25 μm) for 4 h and assayed for cytochrome c release (see figure legends). Isolation of Rat Brain, Mammalian Cells, and Tumor-derived Mitochondria—Rat brain, mammalian cells, and tumor-derived mitochondria were prepared by mechanical cell homogenization and differential centrifugation, as previously described (31Johnson D.L.H. Methods Enzymol.. 1967; 10: 94-96Google Scholar). Detachment of Mitochondria-bound HK and HK Activity Assay—To induce detachment of mitochondria-bound HK, increasing amounts of synthetic peptides (0.0025-0.2 mm) were added to isolated mitochondria (1.5-2 mg/ml) and released HK was assayed following its activity (32Al Jamal J.A. Protein J.. 2005; 24: 1-8Google Scholar) or by immunoblotting using anti-HK-I antibodies. Rat Brain HK-I Purification—HK-I was purified from rat brain mitochondria (8Azoulay-Zohar H. Israelson A. Abu-Hamad S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J.. 2004; 377: 347-355Google Scholar), with the modification of using a Cibacron Blue HiTrap™ Blue HP column and a AKTAbasic purifier chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR, using the ProteOn-XPR36 system (Bio-Rad) was employed to study the interaction of VDAC1-based synthetic peptides with purified HK-I. Purified HK-I and rabbit IgG were immobilized onto a GLM sensor surface, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The peptides were diluted in running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 4% (v/v) Me2SO, 10 mm PBS, pH, 7.4) and injected onto the sensor chip at varying concentrations (flow rate, 40 μl/min). Response units were monitored using the ProteOn imaging system and related software tools. Signals were normalized using appropriate controls. Cell Penetration of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled LP4-Antp and Antp Peptides—LP4-Antp and Antp peptides (1 mg) were labeled with FITC (Sigma) by incubation for 30 min with 50 μm FITC in 10 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.7, at 37 °C. Unreacted reagent was removed by dialysis using membranes with a cut off of 1000 Da (Cellu. Sep H1, Membrane Filtration Products, Seguin, TX). T-REx-293 cells were incubated for 90 min with 20 μm FITC-labeled-LP4-Antp or Antp peptide in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and viewed under a Zeiss LSM 510 meta-confocal microscope. LP4-Antp and Antp Peptide Treatment of HK-I Overexpressing Cells—T-REx-293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pcDNA3-HK-I or control plasmid pcDNA3. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 2 h with 20 μm of the LP4-Antp or the Antp peptide in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then exposed to STS (1.25 μm) for 2 h. Apoptosis was analyzed quantitatively by acridine orange/EtBr staining, as described above. Confocal Microscopy—T-REx-293 cells (5 × 104) were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, and transfected with plasmid pEGFP-HK-I alone or with plasmid pEGFP-HK and pcDNA4/TO-LP4, stabilized with the tryptophan zipper motif. After 48 h, control cells were incubated for 90 min with a solution containing 0.4% Me2SO or LP4-Antp (15 μm). Cells were fixed for 15 min using 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS, rinsed for 30 min in PBS, and cell imaging was carried out by confocal microscopy (Olympus 1X81). We have demonstrated that the pro-survival protein HK-I, expressed at high levels in many types of cancer (1Pedersen P.L. Mathupala S. Rempel A. Geschwind J.F. Ko Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2002; 1555: 14-20Google Scholar, 2Arora K.K. Fanciulli M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1990; 265: 6481-6488Google Scholar, 5Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol.. 1995; 126: 65-198Google Scholar), interacted with VDAC1 and protected against cell death as induced by STS or VDAC1 overexpression (8Azoulay-Zohar H. Israelson A. Abu-Hamad S. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochem. J.. 2004; 377: 347-355Google Scholar, 9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that E72Q-mVDAC1 no longer retains its capacity to bind HK-I (9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar, 24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar). The domains and amino acid residues involved in the interaction of VDAC1 with HK-I were also defined (9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar, 24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar). These domains, according to previously proposed VDAC1 membrane topology models (25Colombini M. Mol. Cell. Biochem.. 2004; 256-257: 107-115Google Scholar, 26De Pinto V. Prezioso G. Thinnes F. Link T.A. Palmieri F. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 10191-10200Google Scholar), are exposed to the cytosol. However, according to recently published NMR-based recombinant human VDAC1 structure (27Bayrhuber M. Meins T. Habeck M. Becker S. Giller K. Villinger S. Vonrhein C. Griesinger C. Zweckstetter M. Zeth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2008; 105: 15370-15373Google Scholar, 28Hiller S. Garces R.G. Malia T.J. Orekhov V.Y. Colombini M. Wagner G. Science.. 2008; 321: 1206-1210Google Scholar), these sequences are only partially exposed to the cytosol (Fig. 1). Based on certain mutations in VDAC1 found to diminish HK-I protection against apoptosis (24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar), VDAC1-based peptides were synthesized and their interactions with HK-I and HK-II, as well as the effects of their expression on HK-mediated anti-apoptotic activity, were studied. HK-II Overexpression Protects against Cell Death—The anti-apoptotic effect of HK-II was tested by its overexpression in T-REx-293 cells expressing native or mutated mVDAC1 and induction of apoptosis by STS. STS-induced apoptotic cell death was reduced by 64% in cells overexpressing HK-II and native mVDAC1, as compared with the values obtained in control cells. However, the protective effect of HK-II was abolished in cells overexpressing E72Q-, E202Q-, or K109L-mVDAC1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The level of HK-II in cells transfected to express the protein was about 6-fold higher than in control cells (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that like HK-I (9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar, 24Abu-Hamad S. Zaid H. Israelson A. Nahon E. Shoshan-Barmatz V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 13482-13490Google Scholar), the interaction of HK-II with VDAC1 involves glutamate and lysine residues located in 2 different regions of VDAC1. These results also show that although the cells express endogenous hVDAC1, the presence of mVDAC1 mutants, nonetheless, completely prevented the anti-apoptotic effect of HK-II. This is in agreement with previous studies (9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar) showing that no protection mediated by HK-I or ruthenium red against STS-induced apoptosis was observed in cells expressing E72Q-VDAC1, although endogenous VDAC1 was present in these cells. This indicates that E72Q-VDAC1 possesses a dominant negative effect and implies that VDAC1 molecules are capable of intermolecular interactions to form a homo-oligomer, involved in apoptosis induction (9Zaid H. Abu-Hamad S. Israelson A. Nathan I. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Cell Death Differ.. 2005; 12: 751-760Google Scholar). VDAC1-based Synthetic Peptides Interact with HK-I—Five VDAC1-based peptides (labeled in gray in Fig. 1) (LP1, LP2, LP3, LP4, and the N terminus) were synthesized and their interactions with purified rat brain HK-I was demonstrated using SPR technology (Fig. 3). Purified HK-I or rabbit IgG were coupled to a SPR biosensor chip. Increasing concentrations (20 to 300 μm) of the VDAC1-based peptides were injected onto the sensor chips and binding to HK-I was monitored. The N-terminal, LP1, and LP4 peptides strongly bound to immobilized HK-I in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). By contrast, two other VDAC1-based peptides, i.e. LP2 and LP3, did not interact with HK-I (Fig. 3). Binding of the LP1, LP4, and N-terminal peptides to HK-I was specific, because no signal was obtained with the IgG-immobilized chip (Fig. 3A, data shown only for LP1). All HK-I-interacting VDAC1-based peptides associated relatively rapidly with the immobilized HK-I. However, whereas the LP1 and the N-terminal peptides showed rapid dissociation, the LP4 peptide showed slow dissociation from the immobilized HK-I. The apparent binding affinities of the LP1, LP4, and N-terminal peptides to HK-I were derived from dose-response curves obtained using steady-state values and calculated to be 65, 70, and 140 μm for LP1, LP4, and N-terminal peptides, respectively (Fig. 3D, data shown only for the N-terminal peptide). The results thus demonstrate direct and specific interaction of selected VDAC1-based peptides with HK-I. VDAC1-based Synthetic Peptides Detach Bound HK from Mitochondria—HK-I and HK-II are highly expressed in cancer cells, where over 70% of the protein is bound to mitochondria (3Gelb B.D. Adams V. Jones S.N. Griffin L.D. MacGregor G.R. McCabe E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1992; 89: 202-206Google Scholar, 4Mathupala S.P. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 4777-4786Google Scholar). Brain mitochondria also express very high levels of mitochondria-bound HK-I (34Wilson J.E. J. Exp. Biol.. 2003; 206: 2049-2057Google Scholar). The effects of the synthetic VDAC1-based peptides on HK-I bound to rat brain mitochondria and on HK-I/HK-II bound to mitochondria isolated from BCL1 leukemia cells were tested. The LP1 peptide, containing the Glu72 residue, was able to release mitochondria-bound HK from both rat brain and BCL1 mitochondria, as reflected in the appearance of HK activity in the supernatant (Fig. 4, A-C). The N-terminal peptide was also able to release HK from mitochondria from both sources, but to a lesser extent than LP1 (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). HK was released from rat brain mitochondria by both the LP1 and N-terminal peptides in a dose-response manner. Apparent affinities (K0.5) of 2 and 20 μm were derived for the LP1 and N-terminal peptides from the saturation curve fits (Fig. 4, C and D). The LP2 and LP4 peptides also caused release of a small fraction of mitochondria-bound HK-I (Fig. 4A). By contrast, LP3 peptide did not detach HK from either mitochondria"

Here we show that the closely linked mesenchymal forkhead transcription factors Foxf1 and Foxl1 are part of this signaling cascade. Analysis of conserved non-coding sequences surrounding Foxf1 and Foxl1 identified seven Gli binding sites, with two sites near Foxl1 being identical among mammalian, bird, fish, and amphibian species. In vitro experiments indicate that Gli2 binds to these Gli sites, several of which are critical for Gli2-mediated activation of a luciferase reporter in 293 cells. In addition, we demonstrate occupancy of one of these elements by Gli proteins in the intestine in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, expression of both Foxf1 and Foxl1 is reduced in the Gli2/Gli3 mutant gut. These results provide compelling evidence that Foxf1 and Foxl1 are mediators of the Hh (endoderm) to mesoderm signaling pathway.

Shh and Ihh, expressed in the gut endoderm, bind to the receptor Ptch1, which is expressed exclusively in the mesoderm of the vertebrate gut (1Motoyama J. Heng H. Crackower M.A. Takabatake T.

Interaction with the Ptch1 receptor causes derepression of Smo, a transmembrane protein, which prevents post-translational processing of Gli2 and Gli3 by inhibiting phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation (5Wang Y. McMahon A.P. Allen B.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ptch1-mediated repression of Smo, an N-terminal proteolytic fragment of Gli3, and to a lesser extent Gli2, emerges from the proteasome as a transcriptional repressor, whereas Gli1 appears to be completely degraded. Both Shh and Ihh are expressed in mouse definitive endoderm from E8.5 onward along the entire gut tube, except in the domain of pancreatic bud endoderm (6Apelqvist A. Ahlgren U. Edlund H. Curr.

Severe embryonic inhibition of all Hh signals, through overexpression of an Hhip cDNA or via injection of a neutralizing antibody against Hh proteins, revealed that Shh and Ihh are also indispensable for villus development and later critical for patterning the cryptvillus axis and restricting epithelial proliferation via modulation of adjacent mesenchymal cells (3Wang L.C.

Recent computational approaches have attempted to identify Gli target genes. One investigation used a local alignment algorithm termed “enhancer element locator,” which evaluates the spatial order of transcription factor binding sites from two different species (8Hallikas O. Palin K. Sinjushina N. Rautiainen R. Partanen J. Ukkonen E. Taipale J. Cell. 2006; 124: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Gli binding sites near Foxf1, Foxc2, and Foxl1, all located within a 50-kb region of mouse chromosome 8, scored very highly using the enhancer element locator method. In addition, expression of Foxf1 is dependent on Shh in the developing oral cavity, lung, and sclerotome, and both Foxf1 and Foxf2 expression can be extinguished in E12.5 intestine explants when treated with the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine (9Mahlapuu M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ormestad M. Astorga J. Landgren H. Wang T. Johansson B.R. Miura N. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that Foxf1 and Foxf2 could be Hh target genes. Intestinal epithelial phenotypes of Foxf1, Foxf2, and Foxl1 mutants also suggest connections to the Hh signaling pathway. Foxf1+/-, Foxf2-/-, and Foxl1-/- mice all have perturbations in the crypt-villus axis, characterized by increased proliferation and Wnt signaling, reminiscent of epithelial abnormalities caused by Hh signal ablation (3Wang L.C.

Foxl1-/- mice also have delayed villus morphogenesis, with very stunted villi evident at E16.5 and E18.5, similar to the severe defects in villus development caused by Hh inhibition (7Madison B.B.

The Foxl1 mRNA expression pattern also highly resembles that of the known Hh target genes Ptch1, Gli1, and Bmp4 during intestine development (2Ramalho-Santos M. Melton D.A. McMahon A.P.

Our studies indicate that Foxfl and Foxl1 are direct target genes of the Hh signaling pathway in the developing stomach and intestine. Their expression is dependent on Gli2 and Gli3 and induced by Shh-N recombinant protein. Several highly conserved Gli binding sites appear crucial for Gli-mediated binding and transcriptional activation of the Foxf1 and Foxl1 promoters. These findings provide a critical link toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that control epithelial proliferation and organization of the developing gastrointestinal (GI) tract. EMSA Analysis—Stomach and intestine primordia (E14.5) were isolated from ∼36 CD1 embryos and snap-frozen in liquid N2, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Greenbaum L.E. Li W. Cressman D.E. Peng Y. Ciliberto G. Poli V. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Complete (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor tablets were used in all buffers, supplemented with 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 mm sodium metavanadate. Oligonucleotides (oligos) were labeled by incubating 50 ng of double-stranded DNA with 30 μCi of a [32P]dCTP and 2.5 units of Klenow (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at room temperature followed by removal of unincorporated nucleotides with a MicroSpin G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (17Gupta R.K. Gao N. Gorski R.K. White P. Hardy O.T. Rafiq K. Brestelli J.E. Chen G. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Kaestner K.H. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); 3-4 μg of protein extract were incubated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, with 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (added fresh), 50 ng/μl sonicated dIdC, and 125 ng/μl bovine serum albumin for 10 min to prebind. Labeled probe (25,000 cpm) was then added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For some assays, 1 μg of a polyclonal rabbit antibody to Gli2 (AbCam ab26056) or 1 μg of rabbit IgG (R&D Systems) was added during the prebind. Oligos used in all experiments are listed in supplemental Table 1. Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells (CRL-1573) were purchased from ATCC. Genomic fragments of CNS1, Foxf1, and Foxl1 were obtained by PCR of mouse genomic tail DNA with PfuUltra (Stratagene). For Foxf1 PCR, a concentration of 1 m betaine was necessary for amplification. PCR products were cloned into pSC-B (Stratagene) and subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) between XhoI and NcoI (Foxf1 promoter). Using PfuUltra (Stratagene), the Foxl1 promoter PCR product was amplified with nested primers and then subcloned into pGL3-Basic. In 24-well plates, 1.5 × 105 293 cells were seeded in each well. About 24 h later, 200 ng of DNA (100 ng of reporter plasmid, 5 ng of pRL-SV40 (Stratagene) and 70 or 45 ng of pBlue-Script II (Stratagene)) were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 3:1 (FuGENE:DNA). For Foxf1 assays, 50 ng of pCS2-Gli2* was co-transfected, whereas 25 ng was co-transfected for Foxl1. Gli2* lacks the 328 N-terminal amino acids of Gli2 and has been shown to be a 30 times more potent transactivator in co-transfection assays than Gli2 (18Roessler E. Ermilov A.N. Grange D.K. Wang A. Grachtchouk M. Dlugosz A.A. Muenke M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (17Gupta R.K. Gao N. Gorski R.K. White P. Hardy O.T. Rafiq K. Brestelli J.E. Chen G. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Kaestner K.H. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Gli sites within the FoxL1 promoter and within CNS1 were mutated according to specifications of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis of the Gli site within the Foxf1 promoter was performed by overlap extension PCR using the PfuUltra polymerase (19Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR—RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The Bio-Rad iScript kit was used for cDNA synthesis from 500 ng of total RNA. To prevent amplification of contaminating genomic DNA in RNA samples, 0.5 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) was added to each reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction, prior to the addition of RT. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, 10 min at 65 °C, and then cooled on ice. Using the Brilliant Sybr Green mix (Stratagene), QPCR amplification was performed in triplicate with 0.5 μl of cDNA per 19-μl reaction on a Stratagene MX3000 thermocycler. Amplification thresholds were normalized to those of HPRT. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Chromatin was prepared from the small intestine of embryos at day 14.5 of gestation (n = 5) as described previously (20Rubins N.E. Friedman J.R. Le P.P. Zhang L. Brestelli J. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7069-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal goat anti-Gli1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, antibody sc-6153). After reversal of the cross-link, the FoxF1 promoter fragment was PCR-amplified using primers and QPCR as described above. Enrichment between input DNA and immunoprecipitated DNA was calculated relative to that of the promoter of the myelin basic protein gene, which is not expressed in the intestinal mucosa and not a target of Gli regulation. Isolation of Gli2 and Gli3 Mutant Tissue—Gli2+/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. Alex Joyner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). Gli3+/- (Gli3Xt-j) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were maintained on a mixed CD1-C3H/HeJ background. Embryos were isolated from Gli2+/-Gli3+/- intercrosses and genotyped as described previously (21Hui C.C. Joyner A.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 22Mo R.

Stomach and intestine primordia from E12.5 embryos were removed and homogenized in buffer RLT (Qiagen) in conjunction with QIAshredder columns (Qiagen). RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as indicated above. E14.5 Gut Mesoderm Stimulation with Shh-N—Stomach and intestine primordia (E14.5) were isolated from 12-14 CD1 embryos and placed into cold Ca2+ and Mg2+-free (CMF) HBSS (Invitrogen). Tissues were incubated 10 min at room temperature in CMF-HBSS containing 10 mm EDTA and then cut lengthwise to expose the endoderm and transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing cold CMF-HBSS. Tissue was vortexed until all endoderm was removed, as evaluated under a Leica dissecting microscope. Mesoderm was rinsed in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (catalog number 11995, Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, + penicillin/streptomycin). Mesoderm was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, with periodic mixing, in 1 ml of a 50% solution of Dispase (25 caseinolytic units/ml, BD Biosciences) diluted with medium. Medium (9 ml) was added and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Tissue was washed with 5 ml of medium and then distributed between 6 wells of a 24-well plate in 0.5 ml of medium/well. After 24 h of culture, 0.5% bovine serum albumin or mouse recombinant Shh-N (catalog number 461-SH, R&D Systems) was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. After an additional 72 h of culture, RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described above. Activation of Hh target genes is mediated by Gli factors binding to the consensus sequence GACCACCCA (23Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 24Vokes S.A. Ji H. McCuine S. Tenzen T. Giles S. Zhong S. Longabaugh W.J. Davidson E.H. Wong W.H. McMahon A.P. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To identify conserved sequences within a 150-kb region surrounding Foxf1 and Foxl1, we compared mammalian and non-mammalian species using the VISTA browser (25Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Frazer K.A. Pachter L. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Dubchak I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (Web Server issue): W273-W279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), which provides multispecies global alignment. Using this tool, we discovered two sites near Foxf1 and five sites near Foxl1 that resembled or matched the Gli binding consensus (Fig. 1). One Gli site near Foxf1 was within a small (∼100 bp) conserved region (CNS1), which also contained two forkhead sites (AYAAACA) and one site similar to the consensus of Mef2 transcription factors, known to be involved in striated and smooth muscle development (27Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The two Gli sites nearest to Foxl1 were within a region of the proximal promoter that exhibited even greater sequence conservation than the coding region of Foxl1 (Fig. 1C). Gli binding sites often appeared within close proximity to forkhead binding sites, with four out of seven Gli sites located within 16 bp of a conserved forkhead site (data not shown). The Gli site nearest Foxl1, at -53, was also immediately adjacent to a highly conserved Homeobox (Hox) consensus site, TAAT (Fig. 1C). To assess the Gli binding potential of these conserved sequences, we performed EMSAs on sites with the closest match to the Gli consensus. Gli sites near Foxl1 at -186 and -53, with respect to the start of the Foxl1 mRNA at +1, exhibited strong binding, which was diminished upon competition with an unlabeled oligo encompassing a Gli site from the Ptch1 promoter (28Agren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgard R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, an antibody against Gli2 reduced the level of the shifted signal of the -186 and -53 oligos, indicating a disruption of Gli2 binding (Fig. 2, A and B). The same held true in assays performed with the Gli site nearest to Foxf1 (Foxf1 Gli site, -46.9 kb), except that the intensity of the shifted complex was much less (Fig. 2, A and B). To compare the relative binding affinity of these Gli sites, competitions with unlabeled oligos were performed (Fig. 2, C and D). These indicated that sequences at -53 and -186 had higher affinity than the Gli site near Foxf1 at -46.9 kb. These experiments also revealed that the -53 oligo produced two closely migrating complexes, and the top band in this doublet was partially resistant to competition with the -186 oligo (Fig. 2D). This upper band could represent binding of a Hox factor to the highly conserved Hox site immediately adjacent to the Gli site. Next, we tested the Gli sites within Foxf1 and Foxl1 promoter fragments for their ability to activate a luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells. Individual Gli sites were mutated, and promoter activity was assayed in the context of a constitutively active Gli2 protein that contains an N-terminal deletion of the repressor domain (Gli2ΔN or Gli2*) (18Roessler E. Ermilov A.N. Grange D.K. Wang A. Grachtchouk M. Dlugosz A.A. Muenke M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The 3.6-kb Foxf1 promoter exhibited very high level reporter activity in 293 cells but was still stimulated ∼2-fold when co-transfected with a Gli2*-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3A). Mutation of the Gli site significantly reduced Gli2*-mediated enhancement but did not affect the basal level of promoter activity (Fig. 3A). The conserved non-coding region (CNS1) near Foxf1, about 7.5 kb distal to the Gli site near Foxf1, was assayed for its effects on reporter activity in the context of the 3.6-kb Foxf1 promoter. CNS1 did not affect Foxf1 promoter activity, and likewise, when the Gli site within CNS1 was mutated, reporter activity was unchanged (Fig. 3A). This may not be so surprising considering that a transgenic mouse with a LacZ cDNA driven by a Foxf1 promoter lacking the CNS1 region largely recapitulates the expression pattern of Foxf1 in the developing and adult gut (29Kim I.M. Zhou Y. Ramakrishna S. Hughes D.E. Solway J. Costa R.H. Kalinichenko V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37908-37916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the context of a 1.0-kb Foxl1 promoter fragment, we observed a 4-fold induction of reporter activity upon co-transfection of the Gli2*-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3B). Gli sites at -53 and -186 were assessed first because of their high conservation and ability to bind Gli2 in EMSAs. The Gli site mutation at -186 caused substantial attenuation of Gli2*-mediated induction, whereas mutation of the -53 site had somewhat lesser, although significant, effects. Mutation of both sites decreased Gli2*-mediated induction to less than 1.6-fold, indicating that these two sites provide the large majority of the Gli2 responsiveness of the Foxl1 promoter in this assay (Fig. 3B). However, a small induction was still observed in the -53/-186 double mutant, suggesting that some Gli2 responsiveness may remain. Additional mutations at the -277, -231, and -122 Gli sites, in which all sites except -231 are mutated or in which all five sites are mutated, completely eliminated any significant induction by Gli2* (Fig. 3B). Among all five Gli sites, the -186 site appears to have preeminence because of its comparatively high conservation, strong Gli binding affinity, and key importance in Gli2*-mediated induction in this assay. Although the CNS1 element did not enhance the activity of the Foxf1 promoter, there was a pronounced stimulatory effect on Foxl1 regulatory sequences, more than doubling the Gli2*-mediated induction of this promoter (Fig. 3C). Mutation of the Gli site within CNS1 significantly diminished the effect of CNS1 (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that CNS1 may act as a distal enhancer for the Foxl1 promoter. To determine whether Gli proteins occupy any of the potential binding sites identified above in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with an antibody specific to Gli1 on chromatin isolated from fetal intestine (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 4, the Gli binding site in the promoter of the Foxf1 gene, located at position -46.9 kb with respect to the transcriptional start site of Foxl1, is highly enriched in the immunoprecipitated DNA when compared with input DNA, indicating strong binding to this site by Gli1 in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first description of Gli1 binding to in vivo targets in the GI tract using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The in vitro and in vivo data described above indicate that Gli transcription factors directly activate the Foxf1 and Foxl1 genes, predicting that genetic inactivation of Gli2 and/or Gli3 would cause reductions of Foxf1 and Foxl1 mRNA levels in vivo. Gli1 is not expressed in the absence of Gli2 and Gli3 and thus cannot compensate for their inactivation (30Bai C.B. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated Foxf1 and Foxl1 mRNA levels in E12.5 Gli2 and Gli3 null stomach and intestine (midgut) primordia (Fig. 5, B and C). In the stomach primordium of Gli2-/-Gli3-/- double mutants, Foxl1 expression is significantly decreased, whereas Foxf1 expression is not altered (Fig. 5B). The stomach primordium of Gli2+/-Gli3-/- embryos exhibited a significant increase in expression of Foxf1 and a small increase of Foxl1 mRNA. This may reflect strong repressive effects of Gli3 that normally function to limit expression of Foxf1 (and perhaps Foxl1) in the stomach. However, this did not hold true in the intestine, where Foxf1 and Foxl1 expression was lower when both alleles of either Gli2 or Gli3 are inactivated, although Foxl1 mRNA levels were not significantly reduced in Gli2+/-Gli3-/- embryos (Fig. 5C). In terms of Foxf1 and Foxl1 regulation, expression of these genes appears more dependent on levels of both Gli2 and Gli3 in the developing intestine than in the stomach. Reduction of Foxf1 and Fox1l mRNA levels was not secondary to a deficiency of mesodermal tissue caused by Gli2 and/or Gli3 mutations because QPCR did not reveal significant reductions of the mRNA for vimentin, an intermediate filament broadly expressed in mesenchymal cells (data not shown). As expected, expression of Gli1 was dramatically reduced in Gli2-/-Gli3-/- embryos (Fig. 5B). Next we investigated whether activation of the Hh pathway was sufficient to induce the expression of these genes in a relevant tissue. Gut mesoderm from E14.5 embryos was isolated and treated with a recombinant mouse N-terminal fragment of Shh (Shh-N) and assayed for induction of Foxf1 and Foxl1 mRNA. Foxl1 was significantly induced in both stomach and intestine mesoderm, whereas Foxf1 was significantly induced only in the intestine (Fig. 6A). In this assay, the Hh signaling pathway is clearly activated, as indicated by robust induction of the Gli2/Gli3 target gene Gli1 (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Foxf1 and Foxl1 are dependent on Gli2 and Gli3 and induced upon Hh pathway activation in the mesoderm of developing stomach and intestine. In summary, this study provides clear evidence that Foxf1 and Foxl1 are target genes of the Hh signaling pathway via Gli transcription factors. Although a total absence of Gli factors (in Gli2-/-Gli3-/- double mutants) does not completely extinguish Foxf1 and Foxl1 expression in the developing gut, this is not surprising. The remaining expression of Foxf1 and Foxl1 in Gli2-/-Gli3-/- gut tissue is likely due to other signals and transcription factors acting on their respective promoters. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1, conserved Hox sites, forkhead sites, and other binding sites are located in these promoters and could provide Hh-independent positive influences on Foxf1 and Foxl1 expression. In the developing mouse, expression of Foxf1 in the lateral mesoderm and yolk sac is absent in Shh-/-Ihh-/- and Smo-/- embryos but maintained in the allantois and primitive streak (31Astorga J. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), indicating that Hh-independent signals maintain some level of Foxf1 expression in certain tissues. Although complete inactivation of Gli activity in Gli2-/- Gli3-/- embryos did not entirely eliminate expression of Foxf1 and Foxl1 in the stomach and intestine, an 80% reduction of Foxf1 and 50% reduction of Foxl1 in the intestine could account for a portion of the comprehensive defects seen upon Hh inhibition in the developing gut. In addition to Foxf1 and Foxl1, there are likely to be multiple other Hh target genes activated via Gli transcription factors in the developing gut mesoderm. These target genes may individually execute small roles in larger developmental processes. One remarkable example of this phenomenon involves the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway, in which each of 12 identified platelet-derived growth factor target genes individually contributes small phenotypic aspects of the much more serious phenotypes of the Pdgfra and Pdgfrb mutants (32Schmahl J. Raymond C.S. Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic inactivation of Foxl1 results in a developmental phenotype of the gut considerably less severe than that caused by potent inhibition of the Hh signal (7Madison B.B. Braunstein K. Kuizon E. Portman K. Qiao X.T. Gumucio D.L. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Foxf1 and Foxl1 dependence on the Hh signal also differs between different tissues. It is interesting that both Foxf1 and Foxl1 appear less responsive to Shh-N stimulation in stomach mesoderm and somewhat less dependent on Gli2 and Gli3 in the developing stomach when compared with similar experiments with intestinal tissue. This could reflect a difference of Gli2 and Gli3 expression levels in the stomach, the degree to which the Hh pathway is activated there, and/or differential dependence on other transcription factors expressed in the stomach. Where possible, primary tissue was used to evaluate the connection between the Hh signal and Foxf1 and Foxl1 in this study. Luciferase assays of Foxf1 and Foxl1 Gli-dependent promoter activity were the only instances where primary tissue could not be used due to technical limitations. However, it is compelling that Shh induction of Foxf1 and Foxl1 mRNAs in E14.5 intestinal mesenchyme closely mirrors the induction seen by Gli2* in HEK293 cells; note a 3.4-fold induction of Foxl1 in E14.5 mesenchyme (versus a 4-fold induction in HEK293 cells) and a 1.6-fold induction of Foxf1 in E14.5 mesenchyme (versus a 2-fold induction in HEK293 cells) in Figs. 3 and 6. This similarity may suggest that testing these promoter fragments in HEK293 cells represents an appropriate model for assaying Gli-mediated activation of these mesenchymally expressed forkhead genes. When fetal intestinal mesenchyme was cultured in the presence of Shh, Foxl1 was more responsive than Foxf1. In contrast, when we analyzed gene expression in the intestine anlage of Gli2-/-Gli3-/-embryos, Foxf1 was the more affected gene, whereas in the stomach, Foxl1 is more sensitive to Gli2/Gli3 ablation. At present, we do not know what explains these slight discrepancies. It is possible that during the relatively long culture with Shh (72 h), there is a partial fate change in the cultured mesenchyme. Alternatively, differences could be due to alternate signaling molecules affecting gene expression in the culture experiment or non-physiological dosage of Shh. Nevertheless, our genetic data strongly support the notion that both Foxf1 and Foxl1 are regulated by hedgehog signaling and Gli factors. To evaluate the in vivo binding of Gli factors to the Foxf1 and Foxl1 promoters, we developed ChIP from embryonic gut tissue for Gli1, which to our knowledge has not been reported previously. We were thus able to confirm strong Gli binding to the promoter of the Foxf1 gene in vivo. To truly dissect the in vivo relevance of the Hh responsiveness of a target gene, it would be necessary to mutate all Gli binding sites within endogenous regulatory elements. This would be a costly and extremely complicated undertaking for linked genes such as Foxl1 or Foxf1, which have multiple Gli binding sites that could additionally regulate the expression of neighboring loci. The surmounting evidence provided here (phylogenetic conservation of Gli sites, confirmed binding by EMSA, promoter responsiveness to Gli2 in luciferase assays, occupancy of target sites by Gli in vivo, genetic dependence on Gli2 and Gli3, and Shh induction in primary tissue explants) strongly indicates that Foxf1 and Foxl1 are target genes of the Hh pathway. Because Foxf1 and Foxl1 appear to be controlled in parallel by the same signaling pathway (the Hh signal) and are both expressed in the same tissue (the developing mesoderm of the gut), it is compelling to speculate whether, and to what extent, Foxf1 and Foxl1 are functionally or biochemically redundant. Foxl1 and Foxf2 mutants both exhibit reduced expression levels of Bmp4 in the gut (10Ormestad M. Astorga J. Landgren H. Wang T. Johansson B.R. Miura N. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2006; 133: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and recent characterizations indicate that Foxf1 mutant embryos have a severe depletion of Bmp4 expression in the lateral and extraembryonic mesoderm (31Astorga J. Carlsson P. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). If Foxf1 is involved in Bmp4 expression in the developing intestine, then the effects of Foxf1 and Foxl1 could be routed, in part, through Bmp4, a known repressor of epithelial proliferation (33Haramis A.P.

Genet. 2004; 36: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), perhaps via direct effects on the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 7B). Foxf1 was recently described as having a critical role in mediating fibroblast migration, and the integrin Itgb3 was identified as a direct target gene (36Malin D. Kim I.M. Boetticher E. Kalin T.V. Ramakrishna S. Meliton L. Ustiyan V. Zhu X. Kalinichenko V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2486-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Foxf1 deficiency in the gut could thus cause defects in mesodermal migration during villus development. This could affect the distribution of mesenchymal cells along the crypt-villus axis, and in turn, affect epithelial organization. Still, there are few known target genes of Foxf1 and Foxl1, and no described targets that are candidate repressors of the Wnt signaling pathway, except that Foxl1 inactivation results in higher expression of the Wnt-enhancing proteoglycan, Syndecan-1 (12Perreault N. Katz J.P. Sackett S.D. Kaestner K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43328-43333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the Foxl1 in vivo DNA binding consensus will aid bioinformatic identification of Foxl1 target genes and enable the evaluation of whether Foxf1 and Foxl1 bind to the same cis-regulatory elements and cooperatively or redundantly regulate identical target genes. Although mutations in either Foxl1 or Foxf1 affect mesenchymal signaling, their combined role in GI development cannot be easily addressed by genetic means due to their genomic proximity. Construction of a double mutant is further hampered by the presence of at least two genes, Foxc2 and Mthfsd, between Foxf1 and Foxl1. Nevertheless, our analysis of the regulatory circuits operative in the developing GI tract provides firm evidence placing Foxf1 and Foxl1 at a central node in the reciprocal signaling mediating organogenesis of the mammalian GI tract (Fig. 7B). Although multiple genes are involved in the morphological processes of gut development, the mutation of single genes can have profound effects on the homeostasis of the adult gastrointestinal epithelium. Mutations of the Wnt signaling pathway represent the most salient causes of sporadic and familial colorectal cancer in humans. However, very few non-cell-autonomous regulators of intestinal epithelial proliferation and/or Wnt signaling have been described. One non-autonomous regulator, Foxl1, is a modifier of the mouse ApcMin mutation, acting as a suppressor of tumors formed from unchecked Wnt signaling, probably through the regulation of secreted proteins (37Perreault N. Sackett S.D. Katz J.P. Furth E.E. Kaestner K.H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together, Foxl1 with Foxf1 could provide indispensable control of proliferation and homeostasis of the adult intestinal epithelium. As more mesenchymal regulators of epithelial proliferation are discovered in mice and humans, genetic risk factors associated with colorectal cancer could include an array of mutations relevant to this indirect tumor suppression, thus expanding the power of genetic testing and pharmacological intervention for preventative and therapeutic measures.

Transmission electron microscopic studies indicate that indomethacin damages mitochondrial ultrastructure and causes mitochondrial dysfunction as evident from decreased stage-3 respiration, dehydrogenase activity, and transmembrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>). Mitochondrial pathology is associated with increased generation of intra-mitochondrial-reactive oxygen species, such as <mml:math><mml:mrow>O<mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ·OH, leading to oxidative stress. <mml:math><mml:mrow>O<mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math> is the most effective to damage mitochondrial aconitase, leading to the release of iron from its iron-sulfur cluster.

Immunoprecipitation of mitochondrial aconitase and subsequent Western immunoblotting indicate carbonylation of aconitase along with the loss of activity <i>in vivo</i> after indomethacin treatment. The release of iron has been documented by fluorescence imaging of mucosal cells by using Phen Green SK, a specific probe for chelatable iron. Interestingly, intra-mitochondrial ·OH generation is crucial for the development of mitochondrial pathology and activation of mitochondrial death pathway by indomethacin. Scavenging of ·OH by dimethyl sulfoxide or α-phenyl-<i>n</i>-<i>tert</i>-butylnitrone, a spin-trap, prevents indomethacin-induced mitochondrial ultrastructural changes, oxidative stress, collapse of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The scavengers also restore indomethacin-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 to block mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and gastric mucosal damage.

https://openalex.org/W2035241082,"Background Establishment and maintenance of a functional central nervous system (CNS) requires a highly orchestrated process of neural progenitor cell proliferation, cell cycle exit, and differentiation. An evolutionary conserved program consisting of Notch signalling mediated by basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor activity is necessary for both the maintenance of neural progenitor cell character and the progression of neurogenesis; however, additional players in mammalian CNS neural specification remain largely unknown. In Drosophila we recently characterized Hamlet, a transcription factor that mediates Notch signalling and neural cell fate. Methodology/Principal Findings Hamlet is a member of the Prdm (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing) proto-oncogene transcription factor family, and in this study we report that multiple genes in the Prdm family (Prdm6, 8, 12, 13 and 16) are expressed in the developing mouse CNS in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. In developing spinal cord Prdm8, 12 and 13 are expressed in precise neuronal progenitor zones suggesting that they may specify discrete neuronal subtypes. In developing telencephalon Prdm12 and 16 are expressed in the ventricular zone in a lateral to medial graded manner, and Prdm8 is expressed in a complementary domain in postmitotic neurons. In postnatal brain Prdm8 additionally shows restricted expression in cortical layers 2/3 and 4, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. To further elucidate roles of Prdm8 and 16 in the developing telencephalon we analyzed the relationship between these factors and the bHLH Hes (Hairy and enhancer of split homolog) effectors of Notch signalling. In Hes null telencephalon neural differentiation is enhanced, Prdm8 expression is upregulated, and Prdm16 expression is downregulated; conversely in utero electroporation of Hes1 into the developing telencephalon upregulates Prdm16 expression. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that Prdm genes are regulated by the Notch-Hes pathway and represent strong candidates to control neural class specification and the sequential progression of mammalian CNS neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2091890593,"Chromosomal abnormalities are frequently caused by problems encountered during DNA replication. Although the ATR-Chk1 pathway has previously been implicated in preventing the collapse of stalled replication forks into double-strand breaks (DSB), the importance of the response to fork collapse in ATR-deficient cells has not been well characterized. Herein, we demonstrate that, upon stalled replication, ATR deficiency leads to the phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM and DNA-PKcs and to the focal accumulation of Rad51, a marker of homologous recombination and fork restart. Because H2AX has been shown to play a facilitative role in homologous recombination, we hypothesized that H2AX participates in Rad51-mediated suppression of DSBs generated in the absence of ATR. Consistent with this model, increased Rad51 focal accumulation in ATR-deficient cells is largely dependent on H2AX, and dual deficiencies in ATR and H2AX lead to synergistic increases in chromatid breaks and translocations. Importantly, the ATM and DNA-PK phosphorylation site on H2AX (Ser139) is required for genome stabilization in the absence of ATR; therefore, phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM and DNA-PKcs plays a pivotal role in suppressing DSBs during DNA synthesis in instances of ATR pathway failure. These results imply that ATR-dependent fork stabilization and H2AX/ATM/DNA-PKcs-dependent restart pathways cooperatively suppress double-strand breaks as a layered response network when replication stalls.

Genome maintenance prevents mutations that lead to cancer and age-related diseases. A major challenge in preserving genome integrity occurs in the simple act of DNA replication, in which failures at numerous levels can occur. Besides the mis-incorporation of nucleotides, it is during this phase of the cell cycle that the relatively stable double-stranded nature of DNA is temporarily suspended at the replication fork, a structure that is susceptible to collapse into DSBs. 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; 4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; HR, homologous recombination; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; shATR, shRNA targeting ATR; shCtrl, shRNA targeting control; DNA-PKcs, catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase. Replication fork stability is maintained by a variety of mechanisms, including activation of the ATR-dependent checkpoint pathway. The ATR pathway is activated upon the generation and recognition of extended stretches of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks (1Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Consistent with the role of the ATR-dependent checkpoint in replication fork stability, common fragile sites, located in late-replicating regions of the genome, are significantly more unstable (5-10-fold) in the absence of ATR or Chk1 (19Casper A.M.

Together, these studies indicate that maintenance of replication fork stability may contribute to tumor suppression. It is important to note that prevention of fork collapse represents an early response to problems occurring during DNA replication. In the event of fork collapse into DSBs, homologous recombination (HR) has also been demonstrated to play a key role in genome stability during S phase by catalyzing recombination between sister chromatids as a means to re-establish replication forks (33Marians K.J.

Therefore, through its contribution to HR, it is possible that H2AX plays an important role in replication fork stability as part of a salvage pathway to reinitiate replication following collapse. If ATR prevents the collapse of stalled replication forks into DSBs, and H2AX facilitates HR-mediated restart, the combined deficiency in ATR and H2AX would be expected to dramatically enhance the accumulation of DSBs upon replication fork stalling. Herein, we utilize both partial and complete elimination of ATR and H2AX to demonstrate that these genes work cooperatively in non-redundant pathways to suppress DSBs during S phase. As discussed, these studies imply that the various components of replication fork protection and regeneration cooperate to maintain replication fork stability. Given the large number of genes involved in each of these processes, it is possible that combined deficiencies in these pathways may be relatively frequent in humans and may synergistically influence the onset of age-related diseases and cancer. MEF Isolation, Lentivirus Infection, and ATR Deletion—Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were harvested from day 14.5 postcoitus embryos and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) in a 3% oxygen incubator and frozen within 3 doublings after isolation. For shRNA lentivirus infections, cells were plated at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate in 0.5% FBS/DMEM in the presence of virus (as described below) and distributed into additional plates by split/plating 24 h later (1 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate in 0.5% FBS/DMEM). The next day, media was changed to 0.1% FBS/DMEM; 24 h later, cells were stimulated with 20% FBS/DMEM for 16-19 h to enrich and normalize for S phase (supplemental Fig. S1). Plates were then harvested or treated as described (“Results”). Lentivirus constructs expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) from the H1 promoter that target ATR (5′-gaattgttattgtggtaaattcaagagatttgccacagtaacaattc) or a control sequence (5′-gtactagttcatggttattttcaagagagataaccatggactagtac) were generated using the H1UG1 vector, which co-expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein through the human ubiquitin C promoter. Lentiviruses were produced as described (52Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), titered by enhanced green fluorescent protein expression and delivered to MEFs at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10, which consistently yielded 95-98% infection rates. To delete ATR in ATRflox/-Cre-ERT2+ MEFs (18Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 53Ruzankina Y. Pinzon-Guzman C. Asare A. Ong T. Pontano L.

Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 113-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), cells were enriched in G0 as described above and treated with 0.2 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, Calbiochem) for 48 h prior to serum stimulation. Aphidicolin Sensitivity Assay—MEFs were infected with lentiviral constructs on the first day of synchronization (above) and replated 1 day later at 2 × 105 cells per 10-cm plate. Upon serum stimulation, cells were left untreated or treated with 0.2 or 0.4 μm aphidicolin. Cells were grown for a total of 4 days, with an intervening replating at day 2. Media and aphidicolin were replenished every 24 h. At replating and final harvest, cells were counted and the total population doublings were determined. Chemical Inhibitors—Aphidicolin (Calbiochem), a DNA polymerase inhibitor, was used at a final concentration of 5 μm unless otherwise indicated. ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (Sigma) and DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 (Calbiochem) were added to media at a concentration of 10 μm 1 h prior to cell collection or aphidicolin treatment. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and cDNA was produced with the cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primers against β-actin and ATR (Applied Biosystems, Mm00607939_s1, Mm01223656_m1) were used for ΔΔCT analysis. Analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System, with amplification quantified by MGB probes. Immunoblotting—Resuspended cells were lysed in 1× SDS lysis buffer (2×= 20% glycerol, 0.15 m SDS, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% for H2AX; 4% for ATR) and blotted onto 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were detected for non-phospho-H2AX (Bethyl), phospho-H2AX (Upstate, JBW301 clone), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (U. S. Biological), ATR (Santa Cruz), and mTOR (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometric Quantification of BrdUrd Incorporation, Phospho-H2AX, and Phospho-histone H3—G0-enriched cells were harvested 16-19 h after serum stimulation and fixed in 70% EtOH prior to staining. Cells were analyzed for phospho-H2AX and DNA content as previously described (54Zhu M. Weiss R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For quantification of S phase, cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd (Roche) for 30 min, then harvested and fixed in 70% EtOH, acid denatured (3 n HCl containing 0.5% Tween 20), and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5 (Sigma). Following staining with anti-BrdUrd (BD Pharmingen) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson), cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml RNase, 50 mm EDTA) for DNA content. To determine the percentage of phospho-H2AX-positive cells in mitosis, cells were first permeablized and stained for phospho-H2AX (54Zhu M. Weiss R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with allophycocyanin-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by staining for phospho-histone H3 (Upstate) at a 1:200 dilution and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:500 dilution. For each procedure, cells were analyzed by FACS using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software. Immunocytochemical Detection of BrdUrd, Rad51, and Phospho-H2AX—MEFs were plated on round coverslips and synchronized as described above. After stimulation, cells were treated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, then permeablized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice. Cells were stained using anti-Rad51 (Santa Cruz) or anti-phospho-H2AX antibody (Upstate), followed by Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) detection. Cells/antibodies were then fixed (3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose, phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature, denatured with 2 n HCl for 5 min at room temperature, washed, and stained with anti-BrdUrd (BD Pharmingen), Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope with a ×100 objective lens. Rad51 foci and phospho-H2AX staining were quantified from images by double-blind methods. Metaphase Spreads and Spectral Karyotyping—To arrest cells in M phase, 0.5 μm nocodazole (Calbiochem) was added for 4 h, and mitotic spreads were prepared as described (18Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) nucleic acid stain was used (1:50,000 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.9). Metaphases were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescent microscope with a ×100 objective lens. Spectral karyotyping was performed following the DNA spectral karyotyping hybridization and detection protocol from Applied Spectral Imaging. Images were captured on an ASI CCD camera and interferometer, using an Olympus BX61 microscope with a ×60 objective lens. Data were managed and analyzed using Case Data Manager software (version 5.0) from ASI. H2AX Wild-type and H2AXS139A Add-back Constructs—Full-length murine H2AX and H2AXS139A were PCR amplified (PFU Turbo polymerase, Stratagene) from cDNA (Open Biosystems, MMM1013-64604) using the following primers: a common forward primer (5′-gcattctagagccgccaccatgtccggacgcggcaagaccggcggcaag) and one of two differing reverse primers (5′-caggggatccttagtactcctgagaggcctgcgaggccttctt for H2AX wild-type and 5′-caggggatccttagtactcctgagcggcctgcgaggccttctt for H2AXS139A). Amplified products were subsequently cloned into the HFUW lentiviral vector for expression from the human ubiquitin C promoter. Protein expression and virus titering was assayed by Western blot and FACS analysis for H2AX using a total H2AX antibody (Bethyl) using the manufacturer's recommended concentrations (supplemental Fig. S3). Intermediate Suppression of ATR Leads to Increased H2AX Phosphorylation in S Phase upon Replication Stress—We have previously shown that ATR deletion leads to increased H2AX phosphorylation upon replication stalling (18Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, through overexpressing a kinase-inactive mutant, ATR has also been reported to be responsible for H2AX phosphorylation in response to replication stress (40Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). We reasoned that these contrasting results may be due to differences in the levels of ATR pathway inhibition, as dominant-negative overexpression leads only to hypomorphic suppression (55Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that levels of ATR suppression strongly influence its effects on H2AX phosphorylation, wild-type and ATR+/- MEFs were transduced with lentivirus expressing an shRNA targeting either ATR (shATR) or a non-targeting control shRNA (shCtrl). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated that ATR mRNA was reduced 61% upon shATR expression in wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). As previously reported (5Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar), ATR+/- cells maintained only 55% of the wild-type ATR mRNA level; however, this level decreased to 16% of wild-type when ATR+/- cells expressed shATR (ATRhypo, Fig. 1A). ATR protein levels decreased in a manner consistent with the decrease in mRNA (Fig. 1B). To determine whether partial suppression of ATR in combination with replication stress leads to H2AX phosphorylation, wild-type, ATR-suppressed (e.g. ATRhypo), and ATR-deleted cells (ATRΔ/-) were serum-starved at the time of ATR depletion and subsequently stimulated to enter the cell cycle. At peak S phase, cells were treated with aphidicolin (5 μm). For each condition, S phase levels were similar at the time of aphidicolin treatment (supplemental Fig. S1). Although only a small increase in H2AX phosphorylation was observed in wild-type cells following aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-3), increasing levels of H2AX phosphorylation were observed upon aphidicolin treatment as ATR abundance was reduced, culminating with the highest levels observed in ATRΔ/- cells. The stimulatory effect of ATR suppression on H2AX phosphorylation implied that H2AX may perform a salvage pathway role in response to replication stress. If so, then dual suppression of ATR and H2AX in the presence of replication stress would be expected to diminish viability further than suppression of either gene alone. To test this hypothesis, ATR+/-H2AX-/- MEFs were generated, and ATR transcript was further suppressed by shATR expression, as described above. The end-point proliferation of these cells was compared with that of control MEFs both in the presence or absence of low doses of aphidicolin (0.2 and 0.4 μm). These concentrations of aphidicolin only partially inhibit DNA polymerase processivity, and have been shown to cause increased fragile site expression in ATR-deficient cells (19Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The expansion of wild-type and H2AX-/- MEFS expressing shCtrl and ATRhypo MEFs were only marginally inhibited by low doses of aphidicolin (20-30%). However, proliferation of ATR+/-H2AX-/- MEFs expressing the shATR hairpin (ATRhypoH2AX-/-) was significantly suppressed by low doses of aphidicolin, culminating in a greater than 60% reduction in the presence of 0.4 μm aphidicolin (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that H2AX plays an important function in the biological response to replicative stress specifically under conditions of ATR dysfunction. H2AX Phosphorylation Occurs in S Phase and Is Not the Result of Premature M Phase Entry—It has been suggested previously that double-strand breaks resulting from aphidicolin treatment of ATR-deficient cells are attributable to premature mitotic entry (19Casper A.M. Nghiem P. Arlt M.F. Glover T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 779-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). By flow cytometry, aphidicolin treatment led to an increased frequency of ATRΔ/- cells that exhibited detectable H2AX phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). However, co-detection of phosphorylated H2AX with phospho-histone H3, a mitotic marker, indicated that nearly all of aphidicolin-treated ATRΔ/- cells with detectable levels of H2AX phosphorylation were phosphohistone H3 negative (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that H2AX phosphorylation is not the result of premature mitotic entry, cons"
https://openalex.org/W2147040734,"It is unclear why some species become successful invaders whilst others fail, and whether invasive success depends on pre-adaptations already present in the native range or on characters evolving de-novo after introduction. Ants are among the worst invasive pests, with Lasius neglectus and its rapid spread through Europe and Asia as the most recent example of a pest ant that may become a global problem. Here, we present the first integrated study on behavior, morphology, population genetics, chemical recognition and parasite load of L. neglectus and its non-invasive sister species L. turcicus. We find that L. neglectus expresses the same supercolonial syndrome as other invasive ants, a social system that is characterized by mating without dispersal and large networks of cooperating nests rather than smaller mutually hostile colonies. We conclude that the invasive success of L. neglectus relies on a combination of parasite-release following introduction and pre-adaptations in mating system, body-size, queen number and recognition efficiency that evolved long before introduction. Our results challenge the notion that supercolonial organization is an inevitable consequence of low genetic variation for chemical recognition cues in small invasive founder populations. We infer that low variation and limited volatility in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles already existed in the native range in combination with low dispersal and a highly viscous population structure. Human transport to relatively disturbed urban areas thus became the decisive factor to induce parasite release, a well established general promoter of invasiveness in non-social animals and plants, but understudied in invasive social insects."

https://openalex.org/W2059669097,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling is an obligate requirement for normal development and pathological angiogenesis such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. Although autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1173 (Y1173) of VEGFR-2 is considered a focal point for its angiogenic signal relay, however, the mechanism of phosphorylation of Y1173, signaling proteins that are recruited to this residue and their role in angiogenesis is not fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we demonstrate that c-Src kinase directly through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and indirectly via c-Cbl binds to phospho-Y1057 of VEGFR-2. Activation of c-Src kinase by a positive feedback mechanism phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at multi-docking site, Y1173. c-Src also catalyzes tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 and acts as an adaptor to bridge IQGAP1 to VEGFR-2. In turn, IQGAP1 activates b-Raf and mediates proliferation of endothelial cells. Silencing expression of IQGAP1 and b-Raf revealed that their activity is essential for VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis model of chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Conclusions/Significance Angiogenesis contributes to the pathology of numerous human diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration. Determining molecular mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and identification of molecules that are relaying its angiogenic signaling may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-associated diseases. Our study shows that recruitment and activation of c-Src by VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in relaying angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2; it phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at Y1173, facilitates association and activation of IQGAP1 and other signaling proteins to VEGFR-2. IQGAP1-dependent signaling, in part, is critically required for endothelial cell proliferation, a key step in angiogenesis. Thus, Y1057 of VEGFR-2 serves to regulate VEGFR-2 function in a combinatorial manner by supporting both diversity of recruitment of angiogenic signaling proteins to VEGFR-2, and its ability to promote angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971832552,"The ARF tumor suppressor controls a well-described p53/Mdm2-dependent oncogenic stress checkpoint. In addition, ARF has recently been shown to localize to mitochondria, and to induce autophagy; however, this has never before been demonstrated for endogenous ARF, and the molecular basis for this activity of ARF has not been elucidated. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry-based approach, we show that mitochondrial ARF interacts with the Bcl2 family member Bcl-xl, which normally protects cells from autophagy by inhibiting the Beclin-1/Vps34 complex, which is essential for autophagy. We find that increased expression of ARF decreases Beclin-1/Bcl-xl complexes in cells, thereby providing a basis for ARF-induced autophagy. Our data also indicate that silencing p53 leads to high levels of ARF and increased autophagy, thereby providing a possible basis for the finding by others that p53 inhibits autophagy. The combined data support the premise that ARF induces autophagy in a p53-independent manner in part by virtue of its interaction with Bcl-xl."

Leptin exerts its actions through complex signaling pathways including STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and binding to target gene promoter/cofactor complexes. Deficient or defective leptin signaling leads to obesity, which may be caused by insufficient leptin levels and/or resistance to leptin signaling. To understand the molecular mechanisms of leptin resistance, we studied the regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression by leptin. We show that phospho-STAT3 activates POMC promoter in response to leptin signaling through a mechanism that requires an SP1-binding site in the POMC promoter. Furthermore, FoxO1 binds to STAT3 and prevents STAT3 from interacting with the SP1·POMC promoter complex, and consequently, inhibits STAT3-mediated leptin action.

Leptin exerts its actions through complex signaling pathways upon its binding and activation of the long form leptin receptor (OBRb) but not the other forms of leptin receptors (OBRa, Rc, Rd, and Re) (5Vaisse C.

Activated OBRb turns on Jak2-STAT3 pathway, including STAT3 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus, and its eventual regulation of target gene promoter activities, e.g. activation of POMC transcription (7Bates S.H. Stearns W.H. Dundon T.A. Schubert M. Tso A.W. Wang Y. Banks A.S. Lavery H.J. Haq A.K. Maratos-Flier E. Neel B.G. Schwartz M.W. Myers Jr., M.G. Nature.. 2003; 421: 856-859Google Scholar). Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid leptin levels are often higher in obese subjects, as expected from their higher fat volume compared with the lean (8Schwartz M.W. Peskind E. Raskind M. Boyko E.J. Porte Jr., D. Nat. Med.. 1996; 2: 589-593Google Scholar). However, leptin fails to effect downstream physiological consequences in these animals because of impairment in the leptin signaling pathways, collectively referred as leptin resistance (9Myers M.G. Cowley M.A. Munzberg H. Annu. Rev. Physiol.. 2008; 70: 537-556Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying leptin resistance are still unclear. One possibility is that increased activity of SOCS3 suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation and activity on its target genes, based on analysis of DIO mice after 14 weeks of high fat diet (HFD) feeding (10El-Haschimi K. Pierroz D.D. Hileman S.M. Bjorbaek C. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig.. 2000; 105: 1827-1832Google Scholar). Recent studies using DIO mice after 4–5 weeks on HFD showed that the levels of leptin-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation were comparable with those of lean mice on a normal chow diet (10El-Haschimi K. Pierroz D.D. Hileman S.M. Bjorbaek C. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig.. 2000; 105: 1827-1832Google Scholar, 11Martin T.L. Alquier T. Asakura K. Furukawa N. Preitner F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 18933-18941Google Scholar). Mice after 4–5 weeks of HFD feeding showed altered metabolism and increased leptin level, indicating that they may be in an early stage of leptin resistance (10El-Haschimi K. Pierroz D.D. Hileman S.M. Bjorbaek C. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig.. 2000; 105: 1827-1832Google Scholar). The fact that STAT3 phosphorylation was unchanged at this early stage but was suppressed at late stages of leptin resistance suggests different molecular mechanisms operating during the early and late stages of leptin resistance. For early stages of leptin resistance, because the level of STAT3 phosphorylation was unaltered, the impairment must lie downstream of STAT3 activation, possibly by a transcription factor, such as FoxO1 (12Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S. Won J.C. Kim K.S. Kim S.W. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Kim Y.B. Lee K.U. Nat. Neurosci.. 2006; 9: 901-906Google Scholar, 13Kitamura T. Feng Y. Kitamura Y.I. Chua Jr., S.C. Xu A.W. Barsh G.S. Rossetti L. Accili D. Nat. Med.. 2006; 12: 534-540Google Scholar). FoxO1, a member of forkhead box-containing protein O superfamily, is a central signaling molecule involved in many aspects of actions, including growth and proliferation as well as metabolic regulation through protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions (14Barthel A. Schmoll D. Unterman T.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab.. 2005; 16: 183-189Google Scholar, 15Hirota K. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Araya N. Yamagata K. Asada S. Sugaya T. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 13056-13060Google Scholar).POMC is a key neuropeptide induced by leptin (16Cone R.D. Nat. Neurosci.. 2005; 8: 571-578Google Scholar). POMC expression is reduced in leptin signaling deficient mouse models, such as ob/ob and db/db mice (17Mizuno T.M. Kleopoulos S.P. Bergen H.T. Roberts J.L. Priest C.A. Mobbs C.V. Diabetes.. 1998; 47: 294-297Google Scholar). POMC expression is also reduced in leptin-resistant DIO mice (18Huang X.F. Xin X. McLennan P. Storlien L. Diabetes Obes. Metab.. 2004; 6: 35-44Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that leptin-stimulated POMC gene expression is mediated via STAT3 (19Munzberg H. Huo L. Nillni E.A. Hollenberg A.N. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology.. 2003; 144: 2121-2131Google Scholar). However, how STAT3 regulates POMC gene expression and how this regulation may be inhibited are not clear. In this study, we used an in vitro system and demonstrated that phospho-STAT3 activates POMC promoter activity in response to leptin through a mechanism that requires an SP1-binding site in the promoter of POMC gene. Furthermore, FoxO1 binds to STAT3 and prevents STAT3 from interacting with the POMC promoter·SP1 complex, and consequently, inhibits STAT3-mediated leptin action. Our study suggests that leptin action could be inhibited at a step downstream of STAT3 activation and translocation into the nucleus and provides a potential mechanism of leptin resistance in which an increased FoxO1 antagonizes STAT3-mediated leptin signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Welfare and Diet-treated Animals—All of the experiments involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Agency for Science, Technology and Research Biomedical Sciences Institutes. For analysis of FoxO1 expression during early stages of leptin resistance, C57BL/6 male mice were divided into two groups at wean time, with one group receiving HFD (Research Diet D12492) and the other receiving chow diet (Research Diet D12450B) for 5 weeks.DNA Constructs—The POMC promoter-luciferase construct (pGL3-POMC) was a generous gift from Dr. Accili (Columbia University), pcDNA3-FLAG-mFoxO1 from Dr. Fukamizu (Japan), pN3-SP1 FL-complete from Dr. Suske (Germany). pXJ40-FLAG-STAT3 was described previously (20Zhang T.

All of the other DNA constructs used in this study, including truncation and mutation constructs based on pGL3-POMC, are described in detail in supplemental Tables S1 and S2.Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—Flp-In HEK293 stable cell lines overexpressing OBRa (293-OBRa) or OBRb (293-OBRb) were described previously (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. One day after plating, the cells were transfected with relevant DNA constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences). 16 h later, transfected cells were serum-starved for 5 h before they were treated with recombinant leptin (Invitrogen) or vehicle for 20 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed in 200 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer included in a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured from cell extracts on a luminometer (Molecular Devices). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase activity.Detection of OBRa and OBRb in 293 Stable Cell Lines—293-OBRa and 293-OBRb cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and incubated with leptin-coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight. After repeated washing with lysis buffer, the beads with pulled down proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Leptin receptor expression was examined by using Myc antibodies.Leptin Binding to Stable HEK293 Cells—This was performed in six-well plates as previously described (21Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Google Scholar). Briefly, 293-OBRa or 293-OBRb cells were grown to ∼90% confluence and washed with PBS. The cells were incubated with ∼60,000 cpm of murine recombinant 125I-leptin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) alone or 125I-leptin with an excessive amount of unlabeled leptin (2 μg/well) for 6 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma). At the end of incubation, unbound 125I-leptin was removed by two PBS washes. 1 ml of 1 n NaOH was then added, and radioactivity in the lysate was measured using a Wizard 1470 Automatic Gamma Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Nuclear Extract Preparation from 293 Cells—The cells after treatment with leptin or vehicle were washed twice and collected in cold PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended with hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and rocked at 4 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 s, and high salt buffer (20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor in hypotonic buffer without Nonidet P-40) was added to resuspend the pellet. After 40 min rocking, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract.Co-IP—For STAT3-SP1 interaction, 293-OBRb cells were transfected with pXJ40-FLAG-mSTAT3, and followed by 30-min leptin treatment. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells and incubated with SP1 antibody for IP. Immunoblotting of the IP samples was performed using phospho-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling). 5% of cell lysate used in each co-IP sample was loaded as input.For STAT3-FoxO1 interaction in 293-OBRb cells, 293-OBRb cells transfected with expression vectors of pXJ40-FLAG-mSTAT3 and pcDNA3-Myc-mFoxO1 were serum-starved and treated with leptin (50 nm) for 30 min and then lysed in lysis buffer. ∼500 μg of cell lysate was incubated for 2 h with 1 μg of FLAG (Sigma), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, or control IgG, respectively, followed by IP with protein A+G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against FLAG or Myc. 5% of cell lysate used in each co-IP sample was loaded as input.For STAT3-FoxO1 interaction using mouse hypothalamic extracts, hypothalamus from 14 C57BL/6 mice that were fed with HFD for 5 weeks was homogenized in chilled whole cell buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 280 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm NaF, supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. Each IP reaction contains ∼8 mg of hypothalamic extracts and 2 μg of anti-STAT3, anti-FoxO1, or control IgG, and proteins were pulled down by protein A+G-Sepharose beads. IP protein complexes and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FoxO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-STAT3 (Cell Signaling).For FoxO1 effects on STAT3-SP1 interaction, pXJ40-FLAG-mSTAT3 and increasing amounts of pcDNA3-Myc-mFoxO1 were transfected into 293-OBRb cells. The cells were harvested for nuclear fractionation after leptin treatment. Binding of STAT3 to SP1 in nuclear extracts was examined by IP with FLAG antibody (for STAT3) and immunoblotting with Myc (for FoxO1) and SP1 antibodies.Immunoblotting—The cells were lysed in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min with gentle rocking and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of supernatant samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against phospho-STAT3; pan-STAT3, FoxO1, SP1, and Myc; FLAG (Sigma); and Myc (polyclonal, Upstate).EMSA—Two pairs of oligonucleotides: wild type (5′-GAG GCC CGC CGC CCC CCT-3′ and 5′-GAA GGG GGG CGG CGG GC-3′) and SP1-binding site mutant sequence (5′-GAG GCT TGT TGC CCC CCT-3′ and 5′-GAA GGG GAA CAA CGG GC-3′) were annealed, and about 100 ng of the probes were labeled with 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP by klenowexo- (New England Biolabs). After labeling, the probes were purified by using G-50 column, and radioactivity was measured with a LS 6500 multi-purpose scintillation counter (Beckmam Coulter). 5 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with the probe with 20,000 cpm in DNA-protein loading buffers (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× complete protease inhibitor) in a total volume of 12 μl at room temperature for 15 min. The mixture was resolved by 4% PAGE gel in 0.5× TBE, and the gel was dried at 80 °C by using a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) for 2 h. Supersensitive x-ray film (Kodak) was exposed for 48 h at -80 °C and then developed.Immunocytochemistry—293-OBRb cells were transfected with relevant plasmids 1 day after they were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips. After leptin or mock treatment, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in ICC buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum, and 0.15% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then probed by using STAT3 and FoxO1 antibodies and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted on slides and sealed for observation by confocal microscopy.FoxO1 Expression Measurements—Foxo1 mRNA levels were assessed by real time quantitative PCR essentially as previously described (22Xiao X.Q. Grove K.L. Smith M.S. Endocrinology.. 2004; 145: 5344-5354Google Scholar). Briefly, the hypothalamus was homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA was further purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (1 μg) were treated with DNase and reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers (Promega). The cDNAs were then diluted 10 times for PCR analysis in triplicates. Ten microliters of reaction mixture contained 5 μl of SYBR green Universal PCR Master Mix, 300 nm specific target gene primers and 2 μl of cDNA. The amplification was performed as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles each at 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 60 s, with additional dissociation step in the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detector system. Standard curves were drawn on the basis of the log of the input RNA versus the critical threshold cycle, which allowed for the critical threshold values to be converted to relative RNA concentrations for each sample. Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as endogenous control. SYBR green primers were designed by Primer Express software from Applied Biosystems and the sequences were: 5′-GCT GCA ATG GCT ATG GTA GGA-3′ and 5′-GTC ACA GTC CAA GCG CTC AAT-3′ for FoxO1; 5′-CAA GGT CAT CCA TGA CAA CTT TG-3′ and 5′-GGC CAT CCA CAG TCT TCT GG-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.The FoxO1 protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. Mouse hypothalamic nuclear extracts were prepared essentially the same as that for 293 cells described above. Briefly, mouse hypothalamus was homogenized in the hypotonic buffer and rocked at 4 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in the high salt buffer. After 40 min of rocking, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract. Equivalent amount of nuclear extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibody against FoxO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The same membrane was later reprobed using β-actin antibody for loading normalization. The films were scanned and quantified using a densitometer (Bio-Rad).Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons of data were made using two-tailed Student's t test for independent data. The significance limit was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSLeptin Regulation of POMC Promoter Activity via STAT3 Activation—Leptin regulates energy homeostasis mainly through its central action by binding and activating the long form leptin receptor OBRb, but not the other forms (5Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet.. 1996; 14: 95-97Google Scholar, 6Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature.. 1998; 395: 763-770Google Scholar). We established a HEK 293 cell line with stable expression of OBRb (293-OBRb) as an in vitro system to study leptin regulation of POMC promoter activity. HEK 293 cells overexpressing OBRa (293-OBRa) was used as a negative control. In these cell lines, only a single copy of the gene construct with C-terminal Myc tagging (Fig. 1A, upper panel) was integrated into the genome to ensure consistent expression level of respective receptors. Because the expression level of the receptors in the stable cell lines was not abundant enough for direct detection from cell lysate by Western blotting, we concentrated the proteins by using leptin-coupled beads. OBRa or OBRb could be detected only in respective stable cell lines, but not the control (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To further confirm the expression of OBRa or OBRb and to validate their proper localization and orientation on the cell surface in these cell lines, we incubated cells with 125I-labeled leptin in the presence or absence of excessive unlabeled leptin. 125I-Labeled leptin could bind both 293-OBRa and 293-OBRb to a similar extent (Fig. 1B). Radioactivity of 125I-labeled leptin, indicative of leptin binding, was not detectable in the presence of excessive unlabeled leptin (Fig. 1B). To test whether 293-OBRb cells could be used as an in vitro system to study leptin regulation of POMC promoter activity, we introduced a plasmid containing the luciferase gene driven by POMC promoter into 293-OBRb and the control 293-OBRa by transient transfection. We used the POMC promoter containing -646 to +65 of the POMC gene, because full promoter activity requires no more than 480 bp of DNA fragment upstream of transcription initiation site (13Kitamura T. Feng Y. Kitamura Y.I. Chua Jr., S.C. Xu A.W. Barsh G.S. Rossetti L. Accili D. Nat. Med.. 2006; 12: 534-540Google Scholar, 23Jeannotte L. Trifiro M.A. Plante R.K. Chamberland M. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1987; 7: 4058-4064Google Scholar). Leptin treatment induced STAT3 phosphorylation only in 293-OBRb cells (Fig. 1C). Similarly, leptin-stimulated luciferase activity was only observed in 293-OBRb, but not in 293-OBRa cells (Fig. 1D), consistent with previous findings that only OBRb is capable of leptin signal transduction (6Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature.. 1998; 395: 763-770Google Scholar). We also tested leptin-dependent stimulation of the POMC promoter in AtT-20 cells, but the response was significantly less than that observed in 293-OBRb cells (data not shown), consistent with a previous report (19Munzberg H. Huo L. Nillni E.A. Hollenberg A.N. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology.. 2003; 144: 2121-2131Google Scholar). When transfected with OBRb expressing vectors, 293 cells have been previously proven to be capable of leptin-mediated intracellular signaling in regulating thyrotropin-releasing hormone promoter (24Harris M. Aschkenasi C. Elias C.F. Chandrankunnel A. Nillni E.A. Bjoorbaek C. Elmquist J.K. Flier J.S. Hollenberg A.N. J. Clin. Investig.. 2001; 107: 111-120Google Scholar) and, more relevant to the present study, POMC promoter (19Munzberg H. Huo L. Nillni E.A. Hollenberg A.N. Bjorbaek C. Endocrinology.. 2003; 144: 2121-2131Google Scholar). Taken together, 293-OBRb was a suitable system in studying POMC promoter activity regulation by STAT3-mediated leptin signaling.FoxO1 Inhibits STAT3-mediated POMC Activity—In early stages of leptin resistance, the levels of phospho-STAT3 are comparable in mice on HFD with those on normal chow diet, indicating that impairment of leptin signaling lies downstream of STAT3 activation (10El-Haschimi K. Pierroz D.D. Hileman S.M. Bjorbaek C. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig.. 2000; 105: 1827-1832Google Scholar). To mimic the early stages of leptin resistance, in which STAT3 phosphorylation was not reduced, we transfected 293-OBRb cells with the amount of STAT3 that resulted in maximal level of leptin-induced POMC promoter activation (data not shown). FoxO1 was previously shown to have antagonistic effects on STAT3-mediated gene regulation (12Kim M.S. Pak Y.K. Jang P.G. Namkoong C. Choi Y.S. Won J.C. Kim K.S. Kim S.W. Kim H.S. Park J.Y. Kim Y.B. Lee K.U. Nat. Neurosci.. 2006; 9: 901-906Google Scholar, 13Kitamura T. Feng Y. Kitamura Y.I. Chua Jr., S.C. Xu A.W. Barsh G.S. Rossetti L. Accili D. Nat. Med.. 2006; 12: 534-540Google Scholar). We first tested whether FoxO1 expression was altered in early stages of leptin resistance. Both FoxO1 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A) and protein levels (Fig. 2, B and C) in the hypothalamus were increased in mice on HFD for 5 weeks compared with their control group. We then tested whether FoxO1 could interfere with leptin-induced POMC promoter activity by introducing increasing amount of FoxO1 cDNA on the background of constant STAT3 level in 293-OBRb cells (Fig. 3A). FoxO1 expression levels increased proportionately with the increasing amounts of cDNA used for transfection (Fig. 3A). Although leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was not affected by increasing FoxO1 expression, leptin regulation of POMC promoter activity, as indicated by luciferase activity, was abolished at high expression levels of FoxO1 (Fig. 3B). Leptin regulation of POMC promoter activity was not affected when increasing amounts of a similar-sized control protein were introduced (data not shown). These data demonstrated that high levels of FoxO1 could interfere with leptin signaling and suggest that FoxO1 acted at a step downstream of STAT3 activation.FIGURE 2FoxO1 expression level is increased in the hypothalamus of mice on HFD for 5 weeks. A, FoxO1 mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. FoxO1 mRNA level in mice on HFD (gray bar) was increased compared with the control (Ctrl.) group (white bar).

B, FoxO1 protein levels were assessed in hypothalamic nuclear extracts of mice on HFD or normal chow diet by Western blotting. The membrane was first probed using FoxO1 antibody and then reprobed with β-actin antibody for loading normalization. C, FoxO1 protein levels were increased in hypothalamic nuclear extracts of mice on HFD (gray bar) compared with the control group (white bar). The results represent the means ± S.E. n = 4/group. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3FoxO1 inhibits leptin-induced POMC promoter activity. A, 293-OBRb cells were transfected with the same amount of pXJ40-FLAG-mSTAT3 and pGL3-POMC, plus increasing amounts of pcDNA3-FLAG-mFoxO1, as indicated by the solid bars for POMC and STAT3, and the solid staircase for FoxO1. A promoter-less pGL3-basic was transfected in place of pGL3-POMC as negative control (lanes 1 and 2). 20 h after leptin treatment, the cells were harvested for immunoblotting using antibodies against phospho-STAT3, pan-STAT3, or FoxO1. Tubulin was included to indicate equal loading among all the samples. Note that FoxO1 expression increased proportionately with increasing amount of transfected pcDNA3-FLAG-mFoxO1. B, cells treated in a manner similar to the method in A were lysed in passive lysis buffer, and their Firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The assay was repeated in triplicate. The results represent the means ± S.E. of one such assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FoxO1 Inhibits STAT3 Action in the Nucleus—To further delineate at which step increasing FoxO1 affected leptin signaling, we tested whether FoxO1 suppressed STAT3 translocation into nucleus after leptin activation. 293-OBRb cells were transfected with increasing amounts of FoxO1 cDNA on the background of constant STAT3 level, and nuclear and cytoplasmic components were separated by fractionation. As expected, FoxO1 protein levels increased in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A, second panel) with increasing amount of FoxO1 cDNA, whereas phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus remained at the same level regardless of FoxO1 expression levels (Fig. 4A, first panel). To directly visualize the effects of FoxO1 on leptin-induced STAT3 activation and translocation into the nucleus, we performed immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy on 293-OBRb cells expressing STAT3 alone or STAT3 plus FoxO1. STAT3 signals were mostly cytoplasmic without leptin stimulation (Fig. 4B, panels a and b) but concentrated in the nucleus in leptin-treated samples (Fig. 4B, panels c and d). The extent of STAT3 translocation into the nucleus as indicated by the STAT3 signal in the nucleus was indistinguishable between cells with and those without FoxO1 (Fig. 4B, panels c and d). These data showed that FoxO1 affected neither leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation nor the subsequent STAT3 translocation into the nucleus and indicated that FoxO1-mediated inhibition of leptin regulation of POMC promoter activity occurred downstream of STAT3 translocation into the nucleus, i.e. a high level of FoxO1 prevents STAT3 from activating the POMC promoter in the nucleus.FIGURE 4High level of FoxO1 does not interfere with STAT3 phosphorylation or STAT3 translocation into nucleus. A, 293-OBRb cells were transfected with the same amount of pXJ40-FLAG-mSTAT3 and pGL3-POMC,"

MsrA and MsrB are the best known Msrs that repair methionine-S-sulfoxide (Met-S-SO) and methionine-R-sulfoxide (Met-R-SO) residues in proteins, respectively. In addition, an Escherichia coli enzyme specific for free Met-R-SO, designated fRMsr, was recently discovered. In this work, we carried out comparative genomic and experimental analyses to examine occurrence, evolution, and function of fRMsr. This protein is present in single copies and two mutually exclusive subtypes in about half of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes but is missing in higher plants and animals. A Saccharomyces cerevisiae fRMsr homolog was found to reduce free Met-R-SO but not free Met-S-SO or dabsyl-Met-R-SO. fRMsr was responsible for growth of yeast cells on Met-R-SO, and the double fRMsr/MsrA mutant could not grow on a mixture of methionine sulfoxides. However, in the presence of methionine, even the triple fRMsr/MsrA/MsrB mutant was viable. In addition, fRMsr deletion strain showed an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and a decreased life span, whereas overexpression of fRMsr conferred higher resistance to oxidants. Molecular modeling and cysteine residue targeting by thioredoxin pointed to Cys101 as catalytic and Cys125 as resolving residues in yeast fRMsr. These residues as well as a third Cys, resolving Cys91, clustered in the structure, and each was required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

Among the 20 common amino acids in proteins, Met and Cys are the residues most susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Sec, selenocysteine; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; Met-R-SO, methionine-R-sulfoxide, Met-S-SO, methionine-S-sulfoxide; Met-SO, methionine-sulfoxide; Trx, thioredoxin; hTrx, human Trx; MsrA, methionine-sulfoxide reductase A; MsrB, methionine-sulfoxide reductase B; fRMsr, free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase. 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Sec, selenocysteine; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; Met-R-SO, methionine-R-sulfoxide, Met-S-SO, methionine-S-sulfoxide; Met-SO, methionine-sulfoxide; Trx, thioredoxin; hTrx, human Trx; MsrA, methionine-sulfoxide reductase A; MsrB, methionine-sulfoxide reductase B; fRMsr, free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase. Upon oxidation, Met forms a diastereomeric mixture of methionine-S-sulfoxide (Met-S-SO) and methionine-R-sulfoxide (Met-R-SO). Met-S-SO and Met-R-SO can be reduced back to Met by MsrA (Met-S-SO reductase) and MsrB (Met-R-SO reductase), respectively (1Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys.

MsrB1 (also known as SelR or SelX) is a selenoprotein, which contains selenocysteine (Sec) in the active site and is localized to cytosol and nucleus. MsrB2 and MsrB3 are Cys-containing homologs of MsrB1. MsrB2 resides in mitochondria, whereas human MsrB3 has two alternative splice forms, wherein MsrB3A localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and MsrB3B is targeted to mitochondria (15Kim H.-Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).The catalytic mechanism of MsrA involves a sulfenic acid intermediate at the catalytic Cys followed by the formation of a disulfide bond between the catalytic and resolving Cys. A third Cys may then form a disulfide with the resolving Cys (16Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Dorsselear A.V. Branlant G. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 6463-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The resulting disulfide is reduced by thioredoxin or other oxidoreductases, generating the initial, reduced form of the protein. X-ray structures of MsrAs from several organisms have been solved (17Lowther W.T. Brot N. Weissbach H. Honek J.F. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4119-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Cys-containing MsrBs (e.g. mammalian MsrB2 and MsrB3) follow the same mechanism, although the two Msr types have no homology and are characterized by different structural folds (19Lowther W.T. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kim H.-Y. Gladyshev V.N.

Sec-containing mammalian MsrB1 has also been characterized and compared with Cys-containing MsrBs (20Kim H.-Y. Gladyshev V.N. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e375Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cys-containing MsrBs share some active site features (e.g. conserved residues His77, Val81, and Asn97, numbering based on mouse MsrB1 sequence), which are absent in selenoprotein MsrB1s. When these three residues were introduced into the Sec-containing MsrB1, the enzyme was inactive. However, when the three residues were introduced into the Cys mutant form of MsrB1, the activity was partially recovered (20Kim H.-Y. Gladyshev V.N. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e375Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the idea that catalytic Cys and Sec require different active site features.In addition to MsrA and MsrB functions, previous studies suggested the presence of additional Msr activities in Escherichia coli and yeast cells, which were especially evident in cells deficient in both enzymes (14Koc A. Gasch A.P. Rutherford J.C. Kim H.-Y. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7999-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Boschi-Muller S. Gand A. Branlant G. Arch.

S. A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) discovered a new enzyme, designated fRMsr (free Met-R-SO reductase), which catalyzes the reduction of free Met-R-SO in E. coli. They showed that this activity is associated with a GAF-like-domain-containing protein. Homologs of this enzyme were found in other bacteria as well as in eukaryotes, suggesting that these proteins also could function as fRMsrs. However, none of these other proteins have been functionally characterized.In this work, we cloned a yeast homolog of bacterial fRMsr and functionally characterized it with regard to the in vivo function and catalytic mechanism. In addition, we carried out comparative genomic analyses to examine evolution of this protein family. The data show that fRMsr is the main enzyme responsible for the reduction of free Met-R-SO in both prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) were used for DNA manipulation and BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) for protein expression. Restriction enzymes were from Fermentas, PCR reagents were from Invitrogen, and Talon polyhistidine affinity resin was from Clontech.Comparative Genomic Analyses of fRMsrs in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes—Sequenced genomes of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes were retrieved from the NCBI Web site. A total of 540 bacterial, 48 archaeal, and 160 eukaryotic organisms were analyzed (as of March 2008). We used E. coli (NP_416346) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae fRMsr proteins (NP_012854) as our seed sequences to search for homologs in other organisms. TBLASTN (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar) was used with default parameters. Orthologous proteins were defined as bidirectional best hits (26Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar).Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis—A phylogenetic tree based on concatenation of 31 orthologs occurring in 191 species (27Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. von Mering C. Creevey C.J. Snel B. Bork P. Science. 2006; 311: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the distribution of organisms that do or do not contain fRMsrs. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (28Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) with default parameters and ambiguous alignments in highly variable regions were excluded. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with PHYLIP programs (29Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Neighbor-joining trees were obtained with NEIGHBOR, and the most parsimonious trees were determined with PROTPARS. The robustness of these trees was evaluated by maximum likelihood analysis with PHYML (30Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14047) Google Scholar) and Bayesian estimation of phylogeny with MrBayes (31Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (24708) Google Scholar).Computational Analysis of the Active Site of Yeast fRMsr—In silico analysis of the active site was carried out using the structure of oxidized yeast fRMsr with Protein Data Bank code 1F5M. The structure was adjusted with the program VegaZZ 2.2.0 (available on the World Wide Web) to reduce the disulfide bond and protonate residues and minimized (60 steps of 0.05 Å, steepest descent global minimization) with UCSF Chimera (available on the World Wide Web). The active site was analyzed with Q-site finder (available on the World Wide Web), which assesses residue accessibility to a small molecular probe and then ranks up to 10 potential active sites (32Laurie A.T. Jackson R.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The top-ranked predicted active sites were considered as the most probable sites of catalysis. The theoretical titration data for each putative catalytic Cys were obtained using the H++ server (available on the World Wide Web) (35Gordon J.C. Myers J.B. Folta T. Shoja V. Heath L.S. Onufriev A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W368-W371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), which calculates theoretical pKa values and estimates variation of the charge state on the titrable atom of each titrable residue at different pH values. These values were then superimposed with the calculated curves for a typical HH behavior at the corresponding theoretical pKa. The assumptions were that deviating titrable residues more frequently occur in enzyme active sites (33Ondrechen M.J. Clifton J.G. Ringe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, visual inspections of the titration curves were carried out for curves with the largest deviation from the standard HH behavior as candidate residues of the active site (33Ondrechen M.J.

VegaZZ was also employed to prepare the Met-R-SO substrate (down-loaded from the ZINC data base). The SP4 force field and the AMMP-mom method were employed to assign charges to Met-R-SO and to minimize the structure. The substrate was then exported to ArgusLab. The yeast fRMsr structure was virtually reduced with VegaZZ building tools. The structure for the reduced protein was treated with Tinker (available on the World Wide Web) for extensive minimization dynamics. Using the AMBER99 force field and gradient convergence per atom criterion of 0.01 kcal/mol/Å, the reduced structure employed in the docking calculation was obtained. Molecular dynamics experiments were done with Tinker, using the dynamics option. We conducted first nonboundary dynamics starting from the reduced, but not minimized, structure. We sampled time steps in the range 0.01–1.0 fs and overall dynamics time up to 200 ps and performed calculations assuming 300 K and 1 atmosphere. After evaluation of the time range (0–1 ps), in which the clear movement of the active site Cys was detectable, we carried out final calculations with the following parameters: time step = 0.1 fs, number of steps = 1,000,000, and dumps time = 0.05 ps. Analysis of trajectories was done with Tinker and VegaZZ; the root mean square fluctuation (standard definition) of carbon alpha was calculated starting from the structures of our ensemble with in-house programs. For docking, the substrate was analyzed in the intercalation site using a docking box of 20 × 20 × 20 Å centered at the approximate center of mass of the two candidate catalytic Cys residues (Cys101 and Cys125). We employed the GAdock docking engine, a genetic algorithm search technique implemented in ArgusLab. To set up the docking parameters, calculations were made with the following values: population size 250, maximum generations 100,000, mutation rate 0.02, grid resolution 0.1 Å, and flexible ligand mode (other parameters were kept with default values). Docking calculations with AutoDock 4 were run in Linux environment making use of the ADT graphical user interface (available on the World Wide Web). We imported the same Met-R-SO and yeast fRMsr structures employed for ArgusLaba dockings. Although with ArgusLab, the protein structure was forced to be rigid during the docking, with AutoDock it was possible to define a subset of flexible amino acids that were free to move during the docking. We defined as flexible the following residues: Tyr70, Leu80, Val89, Ala90, Cys91, Ile94, Gly99, Val100, Cys101, Gly102, Thr103, Ala104, Ala105, Ile123, Ala124, Cys125, and Asp126. These residues can be considered as an extended reaction center around the three Cys residues (positions 91, 101, and 125). Again, the docking box 20 × 20 × 20 Å was centered around the approximate center of mass of the two candidate catalytic Cys residues (Cys101 and Cys125). We employed the genetic algorithm search with the following parameters: population size 250, maximum generations 50,000, mutation rate 0.02, maximum number of energy evaluation 10,000,000, grid resolution 0.2 Å, and flexible ligand mode. Images were prepared with UCSF Chimera, VegaZZ, and PyMol (available on the World Wide Web) packages.Preparation and Verification of Msr Mutant Strains—The yeast strains used in this study were derivatives of wild type BY4741 cells. Mutants missing two or three Msr genes were generated by a one-step gene disruption method using markers described in Table S1 (40Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The HIS3 marker was amplified from p423 vector with the following primers: 5′-CGGTTTCTTCATGTTTATATGATGACGATTTTCCCAAATGTAAGCAAACAAAGGCGACTGCCAGGTATCGTTTGAACACG-3′ and 5′-TGCCCGTCCGACAATATATTTGACAAGAGAGCTACATGGGAATATTGGTTATGTCGTATGCTGCAGCTTTAAATAATCGG-3′. PCR products were purified from agarose gel and used for yeast transformation. Mutant clones were selected in minimal histidine-free medium. Deletions of each open reading frame were confirmed by PCR. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S1.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Yeast fRMsr—The gene coding for fRMsr was amplified from yeast genomic DNA with the following primers (restriction enzyme sites NdeI and NotI are underlined): fRMsr-F 5′-AAACATATGATGGGCTCATCAACCGGGTTTC-3′ and fRMsr-R 5′-AAGCGGCCGCGACACATGATTTATTAATTAATTTAGCAAG-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and NotI and cloned into pET21b vector (Novagen) and then transformed into E. coli NovaBlue cells. The constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and direct sequencing. The plasmid harboring the correct insert was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. These cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A600 reached 0.8, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Induction of protein synthesis proceeded at 30 °C for 4 h, and cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm. Cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and recentrifuged. Harvested cells were stored at -70 °C until use.To purify recombinant protein, cell pellets were mixed with resuspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After sonication, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 30 min and loaded onto a cobalt Talon resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated with resuspension buffer. Following washing with the same buffer, the protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl). The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing fRMsr were pooled and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline in a dialysis cassette (Pierce).Site-directed Mutagenesis of fRMsr—Substitutions of Cys with Ser at positions 91, 101, and 125 were carried out using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with the following primers: C91Sf, 5′-GGAAAGGTCGCTAGCCAAATGATTC-3′; C91Sr, 5′-GAATCATTTGGCTAGCGACCTTTCC-3′; C101Sf, 5′-GGTAAAGGTGTTAGCGGAACTGCAGC-3′; C101Sr, 5′-GCTGCAGTTCCGCTAACACCTTTACC-3′; C125Sf, 5′-GTCATATTGCGAGCGACGGTGAAAC-3′; C125Sr, 5′-GTTTCACCGTCGCTCGCAATATGAC-3′. After PCRs, wild type template was digested with DpnI, and the PCR products were transformed into E. coli NovaBlue cells. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids carrying correct mutations were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and protein expression was carried out as described above.Determination of fRMsr Activity—The reaction mixture (20 μl in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) included 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm substrate (Met-R-SO or Met-S-SO), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of purified enzyme. The reaction proceeded at 37 °C for 30 min and then was stopped by adding 2 μl of trichloroacetic acid. After further incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant (5 μl) was mixed with the OPA derivatization reagent to a 100-μl final volume as described (8Lee B.C. Le D.T. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28361-28369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Following a 2-min reaction at room temperature, 50 μl of the mixture were injected onto a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 × 150 mm) initially equilibrated at room temperature with 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8 (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) at a ratio of 88:12 (v/v). Met was separated at room temperature at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min using a linear gradient of 12–40% methanol from 0 to 5 min, 40–47% methanol from 5 to 40 min, and 47–100% methanol from 40 to 45 min. Detection was by fluorescence of Met derivatives using a Waters 474 scanning fluorescence detector with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 445 nm.The reduction of free Met-R-SO was also determined by a coupled assay. Briefly, a 100-μl reaction mixture contained 5 μg of purified fRMsr, 5 μg of E. coli thioredoxin (Trx), 0.5 μl of E. coli thioredoxin reductase (Sigma), 0.4 mm NADPH, and free Met-R-SO. The reaction was allowed to take place at 37 °C for 15 min, 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was added to the reaction mixture, and NADPH oxidation was analyzed immediately at A340. The activity was calculated using an NADPH extinction coefficient (6220 m-1 cm-1) (41Le D.T. Liang X. Fomenko D.E. Raza A.S. Chong C.-K. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6685-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Viability Assays and Oxidative Stress Resistance—Yeast strains were grown in liquid medium overnight and then seeded into fresh liquid medium at an A600 of 0.1. The cultures were allowed to reach an A600 of 0.4–0.5, diluted to an A600 of 0.1–0.2, and used for viability assays. Briefly, 50 μl of yeast culture was inoculated into 1 ml of liquid medium, and of that, 50 μl was diluted into 450 μl of medium and used to count colonies at time 0. H2O2 was then added, at the indicated concentrations, to 1-ml cultures, and the cells were further incubated at 30 °C. At 30, 60, and 120 min after treatment, 50 μl of each culture was diluted into 450 μl of liquid medium. To count viable colonies, the diluted cultures were mixed with 3 ml of liquid medium supplemented with 0.4% agarose held in a water bath at 42 °C, and the resulting mixtures were poured onto agar plates containing the same medium components as the liquid medium. Viability of wild type and deletion mutant strains was assayed in YPD or YNB medium, and those of wild type strains overexpressing vector or yeast fRMsr were assayed in YNB medium without histidine.For plate assays, overnight cultures of wild type and deletion mutant strains were adjusted to an A600 of 2.5, 0.25, 0.025, and 0.0025 via serial dilution. Each diluted sample (5 μl) was spotted onto YNB agar medium in the presence or absence of indicated concentrations of H2O2, and cell growth was quantified after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C.Analysis of Microarray Data—Data on expression levels of fRMsr (GDS777/10627_at/YKL069W), MsrA (GDS777/5697_at/MXR1), and MsrB (GDS777/6899_at/YCL033C) at different nutrient-limiting conditions (i.e. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) and at different oxygen availability (i.e. aerobic and anaerobic) were collected from GEO profiles (42Tai S.L. Boer V.M. Daran-Lapujade P. Walsh M.C. de Winde J.H. Daran J.M. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Data from three single channels were averaged, and S.D. values were calculated.Preparation of Human Thioredoxin 1 (hTrx1) C35S Mutant-immobilized Resins and Cys Targeting—C35S hTrx1-immobilized resins were prepared to trap resolving cysteines of fRMsr. Briefly, mutant C35S hTrx1 in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl was incubated with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) that had been swelled according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling reaction was stopped by centrifugation, and unreacted side chains on the resin were blocked with 0.2 m glycine (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with the basic coupling buffer described above and acetate buffer (0.1 m, pH 4) several times, immobilized C35S hTrx1 was quantified based on the difference between the amounts of protein initially used and remaining in solution after the coupling reaction. To search for residues targeted by C35S hTrx1, various fRMsr forms (wild type, C91S, C101S, C125S, or C101S/C125S; 50 μg of each) were incubated with 0.5 ml of C35S hTrx1-immobilized resin at room temperature for 2 h under gentle stirring. Immobilized C35S hTrx1 was initially reduced with 1 mm DTT for 30 min and washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl). After incubating the C35S hTrx1-immobilized resin with each fRMsr form at room temperature for 2 h, the resins were suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. During the whole process, initial samples prior to incubation with the C35S hTrx1-immobilized resin, flow-through samples after incubation with the resin, and elution samples after 10 mm DTT treatment were collected, and 10 μl of each fraction were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by Western blot with anti-fRMsr antibodies.RESULTSComparative Genomics of fRMsrs—Analysis of completely sequenced genomes revealed a restricted (compared with MsrA and MsrB) use of fRMsr (a list of analyzed organisms is shown in Table S2). 41.5% of all examined bacteria, 6% of archaea, and 44.4% of eukaryotes were found to possess this protein, and each of these organisms contained a single copy of fRMsr. The distribution of fRMsrs was further analyzed in detail in bacteria (Fig. S1), archaea (Fig. S2), and eukaryotes (Fig. S3) based on a highly resolved tree of life (27Ciccarelli F.D.

https://openalex.org/W2003361199,"The pgsA null Escherichia coli strain, UE54, lacks the major anionic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Despite these alterations the strain exhibits relatively normal cell division. Analysis of the UE54 phospholipids using negativeion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry resulted in identification of a new anionic phospholipid, N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine. Staining with the fluorescent dye 10-N-nonyl acridine orange revealed anionic phospholipid membrane domains at the septal and polar regions. Making UE54 null in minCDE resulted in budding off of minicells from polar domains. Analysis of lipid composition by mass spectrometry revealed that minicells relative to parent cells were significantly enriched in phosphatidic acid and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine. Thus despite the absence of cardiolipin, which forms membrane domains at the cell pole and division sites in wild-type cells, the mutant cells still maintain polar/septal localization of anionic phospholipids. These three anionic phospholipids share common physical properties that favor polar/septal domain formation. The findings support the proposed role for anionic phospholipids in organizing amphitropic cell division proteins at specific sites on the membrane surface."

Several reports demonstrated the cooperative effects of oncogenic factors in the same amplicon during cancer development. However, the functional correlation between the factors remains unclear. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling plays important roles in cytostasis and normal epithelium differentiation, and alterations in TGF-β signaling have been identified in many malignancies. Here, we demonstrated that transcriptional co-repressors of TGF-β signaling, SKI and MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1 (MEL1), were aberrantly expressed in MKN28 gastric cancer cells by chromosomal co-amplification of 1p36.32. SKI and MEL1 knockdown synergistically restored TGF-β responsiveness in MKN28 cells and reduced tumor growth in vivo. MEL1 interacted with SKI and inhibited TGF-β signaling by stabilizing the inactive Smad3-SKI complex on the promoter of TGF-β target genes. These findings reveal a novel mechanism where distinct transcriptional co-repressors are co-amplified and functionally interact, and provide molecular targets for gastric cancer treatment.

Upon ligand binding, TβR-II activates TβR-I and transduces signals through various proteins, particularly Smad proteins that are the major and specific signal transducers for TGF-β (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell.. 2003; 113: 685-700Google Scholar, 2Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature.. 2003; 425: 577-584Google Scholar). Activated TβR-I phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), i.e. Smad2 and Smad3, which interact with the common-mediator Smad (Smad4) and translocate to the nucleus. Nuclear Smad complexes regulate transcription of target genes by binding to various transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators. Moreover, Smad complexes bind transcriptional co-repressors, e.g. SKI (also termed c-Ski), SKIL (also termed SnoN), ecotropic virus integration 1 site (EVI1), and TGIF, which negatively regulate TGF-β signaling. SKI and SKIL are members of the SKI family of nuclear proto-oncogenes (3Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 5489-5500Google Scholar, 4Pearson-White S. Nucleic Acids Res... 1993; 21: 4632-4638Google Scholar, 5Pearson-White S. Crittenden R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1997; 25: 2930-2937Google Scholar). SKI was originally identified as the transforming protein of avian Sloan-Kettering retrovirus (v-Ski) (6Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol... 1986; 57: 1065-1072Google Scholar, 7Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1989; 9: 4038-4045Google Scholar). The human cellular SKI homolog and closely related SKIL were later cloned based on sequence similarity to v-Ski (3Nomura N. Sasamoto S. Ishii S. Date T. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1989; 17: 5489-5500Google Scholar). Both SKI and SKIL physically interact with Smad3 and Smad4, resulting in the displacement of p300/CREB-binding protein from the Smad proteins (8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35269-35277Google Scholar, 9Wu J.W. Krawitz A.R. Chai J. Li W. Zhang F. Luo K. Shi Y. Cell.. 2002; 111: 357-367Google Scholar) and in the recruitment of nuclear hormone receptor co-repressor N-CoR (10Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 2196-2206Google Scholar, 11Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science.. 1999; 286: 771-774Google Scholar) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35269-35277Google Scholar). SKI and SKIL thus induce histone deacetylation and repress target gene transcription. In addition, SKI has been shown to stabilize inactive Smad complexes on DNA (12Suzuki H. Yagi K. Kondo M. Kato M. Miyazono K. Miyazawa K. Oncogene.. 2004; 23: 5068-5076Google Scholar). Murine Evi-1 zinc finger protein was isolated from common sites of viral integration in murine myeloid leukemia (13Morishita K. Parker D.S. Mucenski M.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Ihle J.N. Cell.. 1988; 54: 831-840Google Scholar). The human homolog, EVI1, located at chromosomal position 3q26, is also transcriptionally activated by several recurrent chromosomal aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (14Morishita K. Parganas E. William C.L. Whittaker M.H. Drabkin H. Oval J. Taetle R. Valentine M.B. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1992; 89: 3937-3941Google Scholar). EVI1 was reported to antagonize the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β by interacting with Smad3 (15Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature.. 1998; 394: 92-96Google Scholar, 16Alliston T. Ko T.C. Cao Y. Liang Y.Y. Feng X.H. Chang C. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 24227-24237Google Scholar). MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1) was originally identified as a member of the EVI1 gene family and as a PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous (PR) domain member (PRDM16) (17Mochizuki N. Shimizu S. Nagasawa T. Tanaka H. Taniwaki M. Yokota J. Morishita K. Blood.. 2000; 96: 3209-3214Google Scholar). MEL1 was found in t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML, which has similar clinicopathological features to the 3q21q26 syndrome, as a transcriptionally activated gene near the chromosomal breakpoint. The structure of the MEL1 gene product and MDS1/EVI1 are very similar, and MEL1S, an alternatively spliced form of MEL1 lacking the PR domain, is aberrantly expressed in AML (18Nishikata I. Sasaki H. Iga M. Tateno Y. Imayoshi S. Asou N. Nakamura T. Morishita K. Blood.. 2003; 102: 3323-3332Google Scholar). It was reported that MEL1S, but not MEL1, prevented TGF-β-induced growth inhibition in mouse T-cell line CTLL-2 (19Yoshida M. Nosaka K. Yasunaga J. Nishikata I. Morishita K. Matsuoka M. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2753-2760Google Scholar). MEL1 has recently been shown to interact with Smad3 (20Warner D.R. Horn K.H. Mudd L. Webb C.L. Greene R.M. Pisano M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 814-820Google Scholar); however, little is known about the roles of MEL1 in tumorigenesis and TGF-β signaling. Here, we present the first evidence that SKI is aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer. SKI was overexpressed in clinical cases with well differentiated adenocarcinoma but not in cases with undifferentiated carcinoma, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of certain gastric cancer subsets. Moreover, high SKI expression in gastric cancer cell lines correlated with MEL1 overexpression. These aberrant expressions resulted from chromosomal amplification of the 1p36.32 locus where SKI and MEL1 co-localize in the MKN28 gastric cancer cell line. Furthermore, MEL1 interacted with SKI and cooperated to inhibit TGF-β-induced cytostasis by enhancing the SKI-Smad3 interaction and promoting binding of Smad3 to the Smad-binding DNA element. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism where two distinct transcriptional co-repressors interact, and provide novel molecular targets for the treatment of gastric cancer. Cell Cultures—HEK293, COS7, and HaCaT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. The R mutant of Mv1Lu (R4-2) cells was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1500 mg/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. MKN28 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. cDNA Constructs and Chemicals—Human MEL1 cDNA (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number AB078876) deletion mutants were constructed using a PCR-based approach as previously described (21Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T. Miyazawa K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 6458-6470Google Scholar). The original constructs of the constitutively active form of human type I TGF-β receptor (c.a.TβR-I), human Smad2, human Smad3, human Smad4, human SKI, and human HDAC1 cDNAs were described previously (8Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 35269-35277Google Scholar, 21Koinuma D. Shinozaki M. Komuro A. Goto K. Saitoh M. Hanyu A. Ebina M. Nukiwa T. Miyazawa K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 6458-6470Google Scholar). Tissue Microarray Construction and Immunohistochemistry—For a total of 120 gastric cancers, we selected one to four representative hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections after reviewing routine histopathological slides and obtaining the corresponding tissue blocks stored in the hospital. To construct tissue-microarray blocks, two to five tissue cores were taken from each representative tissue block, and a maximum of 57 tissue cores were transferred to a recipient paraffin block using a Tissue Microarrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD) (22Takada H. Imoto I. Tsuda H. Sonoda I. Ichikura T. Mochizuki H. Okanoue T. Inazawa J. Cancer Sci... 2005; 96: 100-110Google Scholar). From each tissue-microarray block, 4-μm thick sections were made and subjected to immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections as described previously (22Takada H. Imoto I. Tsuda H. Sonoda I. Ichikura T. Mochizuki H. Okanoue T. Inazawa J. Cancer Sci... 2005; 96: 100-110Google Scholar). Paraffin-embedded specimens of primary gastric cancer used for immunohistochemistry were obtained from patients treated at the National Defense Medical College Hospital (Saitama, Japan) with formal written informed consent from each patient and approval by the local ethics committee. Briefly, after de-paraffinization and dehydration, antigens were retrieved by autoclaving in 1× Target retrieval solution at high pH (Dako, Grostrup, Denmark). After cooling, the sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase, and then reacted overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-human SKI antibody (1:100, ABM3001; Cascade BioScience, Winchester, MA). The sections were rinsed, incubated with rabbit EnVision+ peroxidase (Dako), stained with 0.05% hydrogen peroxide and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Three formalin-fixed melanoma cases were used as positive controls and primary antibody was omitted as a negative control. The results were assessed as follows: 0, no staining or staining in <10% of tumor area; 1+, weakly positive in at least 10% of the tumor tissue; 2+, strong staining in at least 10% of the tumor tissue. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNAs were purified from gastric cancer and normal stomach tissues using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Samples were obtained from patients treated at the National Defense Medical College Hospital with formal written informed consent from each patient and approval by the local ethics committee. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Total RNAs from culture cells were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System for reverse transcriptase-PCR (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT)20 primers. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen) and ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specificity of the detected signals was confirmed by the dissociation protocol. The following primer sequences were used: human mannose-phosphate isomerase: forward, 5′-CTAGCTCCAGCAAGGACAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-CAGGGACCTCCGTCTTCATA-3′; human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1): forward, 5′-TTTGCTTTCCTTGGTCAGGC-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTTGCGACCTTGACCATCT-3′; human total MEL1: forward, 5′-AATCTCACCAGACACCTGAG-3′, reverse, 5′-CTTCTCCTTGTTGTGGATGT-3′; human MEL1L: forward, 5′-CAAGGAGGAGGAGAGAGATT-3′ reverse, 5′-CGGTTGGGCTCATACATA-3′; human MEL1S: forward, 5′-TGCACACCCAGCAACACC-3′, reverse, 5′-GCTGCGCTAGAGAAAAGCGT-3′; human PAI-1: forward, 5′-GGCTGACTTCACGAGTCTTTCA-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCGGGCTGAGACTATGACA-3′; human SKI: forward, 5′-TGTCTGCCGCAGATTCTCAACT-3′, reverse, 5′-CCCATGACTTTGAGGATCTCCA-3′; human SKIL: forward, 5′-CTGAATATGCAGGACAGTTGGC-3′, reverse, 5′-TTCCCGTTCCTGTCTGAGTTC-3′; human EVI1: forward, 5′-AACGTTTGCCACTTCGTCG-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGCAGACCTCACAGATAAAGG-3′; and human p21: forward, 5′-CGGCAGACCAGCATGACAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GAAGATCAGCCGGCGTTTG-3′. Transfection of cDNAs, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Transfection of cDNA was performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell lysates were prepared in Igepal CA630 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates and antibodies were incubated for 2 h to overnight. Immune complexes were then precipitated with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) or Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG (Dynal; Invitrogen). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (23Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci... 1999; 112: 3519-3527Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences AB) were used as secondary antibodies for ECL detection (Amersham Bioscience AB). Antibodies—An anti-MEL1 antibody was generated by immunizing a rabbit with human MEL1 (amino acid residues 12-59) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Anti-Smad2 (24Korchynskyi O. Landstrom M. Stoika R. Funa K. Heldin C.H. Dijke P.T. Souchelnytskyi S. Int. J. Cancer.. 1999; 82: 197-202Google Scholar) and anti-SKI (25Nagata M. Goto K. Ehata S. Kobayashi N. Saitoh M. Miyoshi H. Imamura T. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Genes Cells.. 2006; 11: 1267-1280Google Scholar) antibodies were previously described. The following commercially available antibodies used were: mouse anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma), biotinylated anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (DM1A) (Sigma), rabbit anti-Smad3 (CHEMICON international, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-SKI (G8) (Cascade Bioscience, Winchester, MA), anti-Smad2/3 (BD Bioscience), anti-HDAC1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-myc (9E10) (BD Bioscience), and anti-HA (Invivogen). Normal mouse IgG1 (MB002) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as a control. Luciferase Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with various combinations of promoter-reporter constructs and expression plasmids. Total amounts of transfected DNA were adjusted to the same levels with empty vector. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h later, and luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized to pGL4.75-SV40-hRluc. (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc2 was derived from (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (26Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. Ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar) by replacing the plasmid backbone from pGL3 to pGL4. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—Metaphase chromosomes were prepared from normal male lymphocytes and the MKN28 cell line. FISH analyses were performed as described previously (27Ariyama T. Inazawa J. Uemura Y. Kakazu N. Maekawa T. Urase F. Irimajiri K. Horiuchi A. Nakamura Y. Abe T. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet.. 1995; 81: 20-23Google Scholar) using BACs located around the region of interest as probes. The copy number and molecular organization of the region of interest were assessed according to the hybridization patterns of both metaphase and interphase chromosomes. RNA Panel of the Cancer Cell Lines—An RNA panel of cancer cell lines was described previously (28Dan S. Tsunoda T. Kitahara O. Yanagawa R. Zembutsu H. Katagiri T. Yamazaki K. Nakamura Y. Yamori T. Cancer Res... 2002; 62: 1139-1147Google Scholar). Thymidine Incorporation Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The serum concentration was then decreased to 1% and cells were stimulated with TGF-β. Forty-eight hours later, cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine for 4 h. Thymidine incorporation into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was analyzed as described previously (23Ebisawa T. Tada K. Kitajima I. Tojo K. Sampath T.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Imamura T. J. Cell Sci... 1999; 112: 3519-3527Google Scholar). Production and Intection of Lentiviral Experssion Vectors—The miRNA expression vector was constructed using the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit (Invitrogen) by annealing each oligonucleotide (SKI miR: forward, 5′-TGCTGAGCTCTTTCTCACTCGCTGACGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGTCAGCGAGAGAAAGAGCT-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTGAGCTCTTTCTCTCGCTGACGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACGTCAGCGAGTGAGAAAGAGCTC-3′; and MEL1 miR: forward, 5′-TGCTGTATGAAAGGCTTCACCGTGCTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAGCACGGTAGCCTTTCATA-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTGTATGAAAGGCTACCGTGCTGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACAGCACGGTGAAGCCTTTCATAC-3′) followed by ligation into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector that was pre-linearized and then sequencing. Control miRNA expression vectors were constructed from pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg and miR-luc control plasmids (Invitrogen). Sequences of control miRNAs without 5′ overhangs are as follows: negative control miRNA, 5′-GAAATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGACGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGTCTCCACGCAGTACATTTT-3′; luciferase control miRNA (for in vivo experiment), 5′-TATTCAGCCCATATCGTTTCAGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACTGAAACGATGGGCTGAATA-3′. miRNA coding regions were then transferred to the lentiviral vector CSII-CMV-RfA (29Shibuya K. Shirakawa J. Kameyama T. Honda S. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Miyamoto A. Onodera M. Sumida T. Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. J. Exp. Med... 2003; 198: 1829-1839Google Scholar) by the Gateway system. For proliferation-defective lentiviral vectors, 293FT cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with three plasmids: miRNA vector, VSV-G, Rev expressing construct (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev), and packaging construct (pCAG-HIVgp) (29Shibuya K. Shirakawa J. Kameyama T. Honda S. Tahara-Hanaoka S. Miyamoto A. Onodera M. Sumida T. Nakauchi H. Miyoshi H. Shibuya A. J. Exp. Med... 2003; 198: 1829-1839Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. For infection with the lentiviral vectors, 1 × 105 MKN28 cells/well in 6-well culture plates were infected with lentiviral vectors at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. In Vivo Tumor Growth Assay—Cell tumorigenicity was examined in 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice purchased from Charles River Japan (Yokohama, Japan). 6 × 105 MKN28 cells in 100 μl of culture medium and 30 μl of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) were injected subcutaneously into the sides of the stomachs of mice. The mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after injection and tumors were weighed. All animal procedures were performed in the animal experiment laboratory of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research according to the guidelines proposed by the Science Council of Japan. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Immunofluorescence Labeling—Cells were seeded on 8-well culture slides (BD Bioscience) coated with 1% type I-A collagen (Nitta gelatin, Osaka, Japan), and transfected with MEL1-FLAG using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the serum concentration was decreased to 0.1% for 4 h and then cells were treated with 1 ng/ml of TGF-β for 30 min. The cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) and then blocked with CAS-BLOCK (Zymed, Invitrogen). Anti-FLAG biotinylated M2 (×1000) and anti-Smad2/3 (×1500) antibodies were used. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), which was used before the anti-FLAG biotinylated M2, and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cell images were captured with a FV-1000 confocal scanning laser microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). DNA Affinity Purification—Proteins were precipitated from transfected cell lysates using a 3× CAGA probe as described previously (30Nishihara A. Hanai J. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 28716-28723Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed as described previously (31Koinuma D. Tsutsumi S. Kamimura N. Taniguchi H. Miyazawa K. Sunamura M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Aburatani H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2009; 29: 172-186Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde with gentle shaking for 10 min at room temperature, and cross-linking was stopped by addition of 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m glycine. After two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were harvested by scraping, pelleted, and suspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Samples were sonicated three times 15 s each with an interval of 30 s with a UH-50 sonicator (SMT, Japan), and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 8 °C for 10 min. After removal of a control aliquot (whole cell extract), supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Samples were immunoprecipitated with Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG that had been preincubated with 4-8 μg of antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After five washes by ChIP wash buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.7% deoxycolate, 1% Igepal CA630) and one wash by TE buffer (pH 8.0), the proteins were eluted from the beads by 0.2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). The DNA samples were extracted with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) after reversal of cross-linking. The purified DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. For PCR amplification, the following specific primers were used, 5′-ACTTGTCCCTAGGAAAATCC-3′ and 5′-GAAAACGGAGAGTGAGTTTG-3′ for p21 promoter; 5′-CTGCCTAGGGCATTCATT-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTTGGGTATATGTTTC-3′ for Smad7 promoter; 5′-TGTTTGGGCTATTTACTAGTTG-3′ and 5′-ATAAAATGACTTAAGCCCAGAG-3′ for HPRT1 first intron were used. Statistical Analysis—For luciferase reporter analysis and thymidine incorporation assay, results are expressed as means. Error bars represent the S.D. For the in vivo tumor growth assay, a Student's t test was used to calculate significant differences in tumor weights between the two groups. For multiple comparisons of the quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR data, Tukey-Kramer method was used to calculate the significance of the differences. SKI and MEL1 Are Aberrantly Expressed by Chromosomal Co-amplification of 1p36.32 in MKN28 Gastric Cancer Cells—To clarify the roles of co-repressors for Smads under pathological conditions, we first examined mRNA expression levels of SKI and other transcriptional co-repressors that inhibit Smad signaling, including SKIL, EVI1, and MEL1, in various human cancer cell lines. Interestingly, SKI was highly expressed in gastric cancer cell lines, MKN7, MKN28, and MKN45, and the SKI expression pattern was similar to that of MEL1, but not to that of SKIL or EVI1 (Fig. 1A). MEL1 has two variants, a long form (MEL1L) and a short form (MEL1S) (Fig. 1B), and MEL1S was originally identified as a transcriptional co-repressor expressed in AML and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients (18Nishikata I. Sasaki H. Iga M. Tateno Y. Imayoshi S. Asou N. Nakamura T. Morishita K. Blood.. 2003; 102: 3323-3332Google Scholar, 19Yoshida M. Nosaka K. Yasunaga J. Nishikata I. Morishita K. Matsuoka M. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2753-2760Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, an ATL cell line, ED, displayed high MEL1S expression but very low MEL1L expression. In contrast, MEL1L expression was higher than that of MEL1S in various carcinoma cell lines. Interestingly, total MEL1 expression levels were low in ED cells, and the expression profile of total MEL1 was similar to that of MEL1L. These findings suggest that MEL1, particularly MEL1L, is highly expressed in some gastric carcinoma cell lines. Based on information from public databases (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and genome.ucsc.edu, Fig. 1C), MEL1 is located in the vicinity of SKI on the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p36.32). Therefore, we performed FISH to determine the mechanism by which MEL1 and SKI are highly expressed in gastric carcinoma cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1D, MEL1 and SKI were co-amplified in MKN28 cells. SKI and MEL1 Are Highly Expressed in Gastric Cancer Tissues—To further clarify the roles of SKI in gastric cancer, we next examined SKI protein expression in gastric cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. Representative immunohistochemical staining of SKI in cases of well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2A), moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2B), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2C), and signet-ring cell carcinoma (Fig. 2D) are shown. The SKI immunoreactivity score was 2+ in 78 (65%), 1+ in 36 (30%), and 0 in 6 (5%) gastric cancer cases (Table 1). SKI expression correlated with the histological type: the incidence of score 2+ cancers was 80% (66 of 82) in the differentiated type (or intestinal type) but only 32% (12 of 38) in the undifferentiated type (or gastric type). The incidence of high SKI expression was significantly higher in differentiated than in undifferentiated cases (p < 0.0001). In particular, well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma showed a high incidence (89%, 34 of 38) of score 2+.

As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, in three of six gastric cancer patient samples, both MEL1 and SKI were highly expressed in tumor tissues compare with normal tissues. SKI and MEL1 Cooperatively Repress TGF-β Signaling in Gastric Cancer Cells—To determine the contribution of SKI and/or MEL1 in gastric cancer progression, we investigated the effect of SKI and/or MEL1 loss-of-function on TGF-β responsiveness. We generated MKN28 cells in which endogenous SKI and/or MEL1 were knocked down by an miRNA system. These cells exhibited at least a 60% reduction in SKI and MEL1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A, left panel), and SKI and MEL1 protein levels were greatly decreased in these cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). Knockdown of SKI and MEL1 expression by miRNA did not affect phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad2/3 (data not shown). Interestingly, although SKI or MEL1 knockdown only weakly enhanced PAI-1 (Fig. 3B, left panel) and p21 (Fig. 3B, right panel) expression induced by TGF-β, knockdown of both SKI and MEL1 synergistically enhanced their expression. Similar results were obtained using another gastric cancer cell, MKN7 cells (supplementary Fig. S1). We further examined the effect of SKI and MEL1 on the anti-proliferative responses to TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 3C, knockdown of both proteins restored anti-proliferative responses to TGF-β. TGF-β signaling suppresses tumor growth at early stages of tumorigenesis through its ability to elicit growth arrest (1Shi Y. Massague J. Cell.. 2003; 113: 685-700Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2097493383,"S. aureus is a highly successful pathogen that is speculated to be the most common cause of human disease. The progression of disease in S. aureus is subject to multi-factorial regulation, in response to the environments encountered during growth. This adaptive nature is thought to be central to pathogenesis, and is the result of multiple regulatory mechanisms employed in gene regulation. In this work we describe the existence of a novel S. aureus regulator, an as yet uncharacterized ECF-sigma factor (sigma(S)), that appears to be an important component of the stress and pathogenic responses of this organism. Using biochemical approaches we have shown that sigma(S) is able to associates with core-RNAP, and initiate transcription from its own coding region. Using a mutant strain we determined that sigma(S) is important for S. aureus survival during starvation, extended exposure to elevated growth temperatures, and Triton X-100 induced lysis. Coculture studies reveal that a sigma(S) mutant is significantly outcompeted by its parental strain, which is only exacerbated during prolonged growth (7 days), or in the presence of stressor compounds. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis determined that under standard conditions, S. aureus SH1000 does not initiate expression of sigS. Assays performed hourly for 72 h revealed expression in typically background ranges. Analysis of a potential anti-sigma factor, encoded downstream of sigS, revealed it to have no obvious role in the upregulation of sigS expression. Using a murine model of septic arthritis, sigS-mutant infected animals lost significantly less weight, developed septic arthritis at significantly lower levels, and had increased survival rates. Studies of mounted immune responses reveal that sigS-mutant infected animals had significantly lower levels of IL-6, indicating only a weak immunological response. Finally, strains of S. aureus lacking sigS were far less able to undergo systemic dissemination, as determined by bacterial loads in the kidneys of infected animals. These results establish that sigma(S) is an important component in S. aureus fitness, and in its adaptation to stress. Additionally it appears to have a significant role in its pathogenic nature, and likely represents a key component in the S. aureus regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W2092716724,"A key hub for the orchestration of epigenetic modifications necessary to restrict neuronal gene expression to the nervous system is the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST; also known as neuron restrictive silencer factor, NRSF). REST suppresses the nonspecific and premature expression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal and neural progenitor cells, respectively, via recruitment of enzymatically diverse corepressors, including G9a histone methyltransferase (HMTase) that catalyzes di-methylation of histone 3-lysine 9 (H3K9me2). Recently, we identified the RNA polymerase II transcriptional Mediator to be an essential link between RE1-bound REST and G9a in epigenetic suppression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. However, the means by which REST recruits Mediator to facilitate G9a-dependent extra-neuronal gene silencing remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify the MED19 and MED26 subunits in Mediator as direct physical and synergistic functional targets of REST. We show that although REST independently binds to both MED19 and MED26 in isolation, combined depletion of both subunits is required to disrupt the association of REST with Mediator. Furthermore, combined, but not individual, depletion of MED19/MED26 impairs REST-directed recruitment to RE1 elements of Mediator and G9a, leading to a reversal of G9a-dependent H3K9me2 and de-repression of REST-target gene expression. Together, these findings identify MED19/MED26 as a probable composite REST interface in Mediator and further clarify the mechanistic basis by which Mediator facilitates REST-imposed epigenetic restrictions on neuronal gene expression.

The specification and maintenance of neuronal identity within the developing vertebrate nervous system derives from the influence of both genetic and epigenetic programs that combine to establish unique spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal-specific gene expression. Expressed genes that confer unique and highly specialized morphological, biochemical, and physiological properties on individual neuronal subtypes must be suppressed in non-neuronal tissues, and the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate these processes are fundamentally important for proper nervous system development and function (1Sasai Y.

REST occupies a central role in non-neuronal lineage restriction through its ability to suppress the nonspecific and premature expression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells and neural progenitor cells, respectively (4Schoenherr C.J.

Consistent with such a role, the expression of REST is dominantly constrained in non-neuronal and neural progenitor cells, although low levels of REST protein are maintained in some populations of postmitotic neurons, most notably those of the hippocampus (10Sun Y.M.

Taken together, these observations reveal fundamental links between REST and vertebrate development and disease, and emphasize the importance of a more comprehensive understanding of REST-mediated gene repression. In this regard, REST has previously been characterized as a bipartite transcriptional repressor harboring two spatially and functionally distinct repression domains: one spanning its N-terminal 83 amino acids and a second encompassing its C-terminal zinc finger (31Tapia-Ramirez J.

Mechanistically, the N- and C-terminal repression domains in REST have been shown to exert repressive activity through recruitment of the SIN3/ HDAC and CoREST/HDAC/LSD1 corepressor complexes, respectively, both of which function to impose restrictive epigenetic modifications on the chromatin structure of REST target genes (31Tapia-Ramirez J.

Recently, we identified a comparably potent, yet previously uncharacterized, internal repression domain in REST (amino acids 141–600) encompassing its DNA-binding domain followed by a lysine-rich region (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). We found that REST-(141–600) directly recruits a distinct corepressor complex comprising Mediator, a multisubunit global coregulator of RNA polymerase II transcription, and G9a HMTase, an enzyme dominantly responsible for transcriptionally repressive histone 3 lysine-9 mono-(H3K9m) and di-methylation (H3K9me2) within mammalian euchromatin (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). In contrast to the well-established role of Mediator as a bridge between DNA-bound activators and the RNA polymerase II general transcription machinery, our findings revealed a critical requirement for Mediator in recruitment of enzymatically active G9a by RE1-bound REST, thus revealing Mediator to be a direct link between REST and G9a-dependent H3K9me2 required for extra-neuronal gene silencing (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). Nonetheless, key elements of this repressive protein interaction network remain to be established, including the identity of the Mediator subunit(s) with which REST directly interfaces to recruit Mediator/G9a onto RE1 elements. Here, using an unbiased in vitro protein interaction screen to identify REST-binding subunits in Mediator, we identified MED19 and MED26 as candidate REST target subunits. We validated independent association of REST with both MED19 and MED26 in isolation, but nonetheless found that combined depletion of both subunits was required to disrupt the association of REST with Mediator. Furthermore, we found that combined, but not individual, depletion of MED19/MED26 impairs REST-directed recruitment to RE1 elements of Mediator, G9a, and G9a-dependent H3K9me2, leading to de-repression of REST-target genes in vivo. Collectively, these findings identify MED19 and MED26 as synergistic physical and functional targets of REST in Mediator and further clarify the mechanistic basis by which Mediator facilitates REST-imposed epigenetic restrictions on neuronal gene expression.

For immunoprecipitation of intact Mediator, nuclear lysates (0.5 mg) prepared as described previously (45Kim S. Xu X. Hecht A. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 14066-14075Google Scholar) were adjusted to 0.1 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose conjugated to anti-MED4 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with 0.3 m KCl D buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and processed by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. For chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, cells were cross-linked, and harvested into cell lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 85 mm KCl and 0.5% Triton X-100) and then pelleted and resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA pH 8.0, and 1% SDS). Chromatin was solubilized and sheared by pulsed sonication (Fisher Scientific, Model 100) and clarified by high-speed centrifugation. Chromatin-containing fractions were diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) followed by incubation with primary antibodies as indicated at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were precipitated with a pre-blocked mix of protein G-agarose and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h followed by sequential washes with sarcosyl buffer (TE and 0.2% Sarcosyl), low-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl), high-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl), LiCL detergent buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm LiCl) and TE. DNA was recovered in elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and subjected to proteinase K treatment and decross-linking at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation and resuspended in double distilled water. RE1 occupancy levels are expressed relative to RE1 occupancy levels in control siRNA-transfected cells. Primer sequences for quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have been described (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) Analyses—RT-qPCR analyses have been described previously (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA extracted from HeLa cells transfected 3 days prior with specified siRNAs, was subjected to reverse transcription and real-time PCR analyses Results represent the average of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. mRNA levels are expressed relative to mRNA levels in control siRNA-transfected cells. Sequences of primers used in RT-qPCR analyses are as follows: β-Actin (5′-CAAAGACCTGTACGCCAACACAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCT-3′); MED19 (5′-TGGTTCCCATGATAACAGCAGCCT-3′ and 5′-CGGCTCTGTTTGTGCTTGTGCTTA-3′); MED26 (5′-AAACCTCTGACCCAGAAAGAGCCA-3′ and 5′-ACAGCTCCTTCCAGTTCGTCTGTT-3′); SNAP25 (5′-AACTGGAACGCATTGAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGTCCGTCAAATTCTTTTCTGC-3′); Syn1 (5′-GGTCTCTGAAGCCGGATTTTG-3′ and 5′-GTCCCCAGTTTCTTATGCAGTC-3′); M4 (5′-TTCATCCAGTTCCTGTCCAACCCA-3′ and 5′-GGCTTCTTGACGCTCTGCTTCATT-3′). REST Independently Binds to MED19 and MED26 both in Vitro and in Vivo—In an initial attempt to identify the REST target subunit(s) in Mediator, we screened 31 of 33 possible mammalian Mediator subunits for in vitro interaction with a GST-REST derivative expressing REST amino acids 141–600 and therefore encompassing the REST DNA-binding domain followed by a lysine-rich region. Recently, we showed that this domain harbors autonomous repression activity in a manner requiring its direct interaction with Mediator (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). Mediator subunits omitted from this screen included MED12L and MED13L, for which cDNAs are currently unavailable. Among the remaining Mediator subunits tested, only MED19 and MED26 exhibited significant REST binding activity, with MED19 possessing an apparent greater affinity for REST than MED26 (supplemental Figs. S1–S3). Interestingly, comparative genomic analyses indicate that whereas MED19 is broadly represented throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, with identifiable orthologs present in species spanning humans to fungi, MED26 appears to be restricted to higher eukaryotes, as no identifiable ortholog is present in fungi. To confirm the interaction specificities of MED19 and MED26 for REST amino acids (aa) 141–600, we also tested these two Mediator subunits for their respective abilities to bind to REST N-terminal (aa 1–140) and C-terminal (aa 601–1098) fragments. Notably, MED19 and MED26 bound only to REST (141–600) corresponding precisely to the Mediator-binding domain on REST (Fig. 1A) (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar). To determine if REST binds to MED19 and MED26 in vivo, we examined the ability of REST to coimmunoprecipitate along with either MED19 or MED26 following their ectopic expression in HEK 293 human embryonic kidney cells. This analysis revealed specific and efficient precipitation of MYC-REST by FLAG-specific antibodies only in the presence, but not in the absence, of either FLAG-MED19 or FLAG-MED26 (Fig. 1B). Taken together, the results of in vitro and in vivo binding analyses reveal that REST-(141–600) interacts specifically and selectively with both MED19 and MED26, suggesting that either one or both of these subunits might represent a functionally important target(s) of REST in Mediator. MED19 and MED26 Synergistically Mediate the Interaction between REST and Mediator—As a precondition for exploring potential functional interactions between REST and MED19/MED26 through the use of RNAi in mammalian cells, we evaluated the impact of depleting either or both of these subunits on the integrity of Mediator. To this end, we immunoprecipitated Mediator from HeLa cells following siRNA-mediated depletion of MED19 and/or MED26, and examined the immunoprecipitates for the presence of Mediator subunits representing each of four structurally apparent Mediator subdomains (Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase) (46Conaway R.C. Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Yao T. Conaway J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci... 2005; 30: 250-255Google Scholar, 47Chadick J.Z. Asturias F.J. Trends Biochem. Sci... 2005; 30: 264-271Google Scholar, 48Bjorklund S. Gustafsson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci... 2005; 30: 240-244Google Scholar). We observed that neither individual nor combined depletion of MED19/MED26 significantly altered the apparent stability of other Mediator subunits examined or their stable incorporation into Mediator (Fig. 2). This finding is consistent with the prior observation that Saccharomyces cerevisiaie Mediator isolated under physiological conditions from a MED19-deficient yeast strain is not structurally compromised (49Baidoobonso S.M. Guidi B.W. Myers L.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 5551-5559Google Scholar). Thus, under physiological conditions, neither MED19 nor MED26 are likely to be essential for the structural integrity of Mediator. Next, we examined the ability of Mediator deficient in MED19 and/or MED26 to associate with REST. To this end, GST-REST-(141–600) was tested for its ability to bind Mediator present in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells depleted of MED19 and/or MED26 by RNAi. Consistent with our recent delineation of REST amino acids 141–600 as Mediator-binding domain (21Ding N Zhou H. Esteve P.-O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell.. 2008; 31: 347-359Google Scholar), we confirmed that GST-REST-(141–600) bound Mediator present in nuclear extracts from HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 5). Notably, we observed that only combined, but not individual, depletion of MED19/MED26 significantly impaired the interaction between Mediator and REST-(141–600) (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4 and 6–8). These results confirm that REST physically associates with Mediator, likely through both its MED19 and MED26 subunits. MED19 and MED26 Are Synergistically Required for REST Repressor Activity—Based on our recent finding that REST-dependent recruitment of Mediator is essential to link RE1-bound REST with G9a in epigenetic gene silencing, we hypothesized that the interaction between REST-(141–600) and MED19/MED26 might therefore be critical for REST-directed repression. As a direct test of this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of MED19 and/or MED26 depletion on the repressive activity of REST-(141–600) using a transient reporter-based transcriptional repression assay. To this end, REST-(141–600), tethered to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, was tested for its ability to repress transcription from a constitutively active GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid in HeLa cells depleted of MED19 and/or MED26 by RNAi. As controls for these experiments, we also monitored the impact of MED19 and/or MED26 depletion on the respective repressive acti"
https://openalex.org/W1986561876,"The Cys loop receptor channels mediate fast synaptic transmission in the nervous system. The M2-demarcated transmembrane pore is an important determinant of their ion permeation properties. Portals within the intracellular domain are also part of the permeation pathway in cationic Cys loop receptors, with charged residues in a helical MA stretch partially lining these openings profoundly affecting channel conductance. It is unknown whether analogous portals contribute to the permeation pathway in anionic Cys loop receptors. We therefore investigated the influence of charged residues within the proposed MA stretch on functional properties of the homomeric glycine alpha1 receptor. Up to eight basic residues in the MA stretch were concurrently mutated to a negatively charged glutamate, and wild-type and mutant subunits were expressed in HEK-293 cells. Mutation of all eight residues produced a non-functional receptor. The greatest reduction in conductance at negative membrane potentials (from 92.2+/-2.8 to 60.0+/-2.2 picosiemens) was observed with glutamate present at the 377, 378, 385, and 386 positions (the 4E subunit). Inclusion of additional glutamate residues within this subunit did not decrease conductance further. Neutralizing these residues (the 4A subunit) caused a modest decrease in conductance (80.5+/-2.3 picosiemens). Outward conductance at positive potentials was not markedly affected. Anion to cation selectivity and concentration-response relationships were unaffected by the 4A or 4E mutations. Our results identify basic residues affecting conductance in the glycine receptor, suggesting that portals are part of the extended permeation pathway but that the M2-demarcated channel pore is the dominant determinant of permeation properties in glycine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2048486262,"Background The species Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) includes many serovars that cause disease in avian and mammalian hosts. These serovars differ greatly in their host range and their degree of host adaptation. The host specificity of S. enterica serovars appears to be a complex phenomenon governed by multiple factors acting at different stages of the infection process, which makes identification of the cause/s of host specificity solely by experimental methods difficult. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have employed a molecular evolution and phylogenetics based approach to identify genes that might play important roles in conferring host specificity to different serovars of S. enterica. These genes are ‘differentially evolved’ in different S. enterica serovars. This list of ‘differentially evolved’ genes includes genes that encode translocon proteins (SipD, SseC and SseD) of both Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 encoded type three secretion systems, sptP, which encodes an effector protein that inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of the host cell, and genes which encode effector proteins (SseF and SifA) that are important in placing the Salmonella-containing vacuole in a juxtanuclear position. Conclusions/Significance Analysis of known functions of these ‘differentially evolved genes’ indicates that the products of these genes directly interact with the host cell and manipulate its functions and thereby confer host specificity, at least in part, to different serovars of S. enterica that are considered in this study."

Because of the implications of TRS, there is much interest in the development of research tools that can modulate intracellular TRS. Hydrogen peroxide and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide have been extensively employed to increase intracellular oxidative stress (14Erlemann K. Rokach J. Powell W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 40376-40384Google Scholar). However, they are not ideal for increasing thiol oxidative stress because of the nonspecific oxidation nature of these agents. Diamide is also used to oxidize GSH to GSSG to create thiol oxidative stress (14Erlemann K. Rokach J. Powell W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 40376-40384Google Scholar, 15Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Wertheim B. Correa W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1969; 37: 593-596Google Scholar). The drawback of this reagent is that it can also react with other functional groups such as carboxylic acids (16Tsunoda T. Tamamiya Y. Kawamura Y. Itô S. Tetrahedron Lett... 1995; 36: 2529-2530Google Scholar) and alcohols (17Tsunoda T. Uemoto K. Nagino C. Kawamura M. Kaku H. Itô S. Tetrahedron Lett... 1999; 40: 7355-7358Google Scholar), resulting in unwanted effects. Therefore, it is desirable to develop agents that can more selectively modify intracellular thiol redox status. TRS is closely associated with the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG is often used in the literature as a parameter of TRS (18Patsoukis N. Georgiou C.D. Anal. Bioanal. Chem... 2005; 383: 923-929Google Scholar). GSH, a tripeptide with a central cysteine amino acid, is the most abundant thiol in cells and has a critical role in regulating intracellular redox status (19Asmis R. Wang Y. Xu L. Kisgati M. Begley J.G. Mieyal J.J. FASEB J.. 2005; 19: 1866-1868Google Scholar, 20Patsoukis N. Georgiou C.D. Anal. Bioanal. Chem... 2004; 378: 1783-1792Google Scholar, 21Pullela P.K. Chiku T. Carvan M.J. Sem D.S. Anal. Biochem... 2006; 352: 265-273Google Scholar). The cell normally maintains a high ratio (∼100:1) of GSH to GSSG as a protection mechanism against oxidative stress (22Schirmer R.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1989: 553-596Google Scholar). Upon oxidative stress, which is reflected by an increase in reactive oxygen species, GSH is oxidized to GSSG, which is reduced back to GSH by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GR) (see Fig. 1). Therefore, GR is critical for maintaining a high GSH:GSSG ratio and the cell's protection against oxidative stress. Inhibition of GR can decrease the ratio of GSH to GSSG and increase intracellular TRS (19Asmis R. Wang Y. Xu L. Kisgati M. Begley J.G. Mieyal J.J. FASEB J.. 2005; 19: 1866-1868Google Scholar). Therefore, a potent, readily obtainable, and selective GR inhibitor would be a valuable research tool in studying TRS-related normal or abnormal biochemical processes. Additionally, the enzyme has also been a target for the development of anticancer drugs and antimalarial drugs (23Bauer H. Fritz-Wolf K. Winzer A. Kühner S. Little S. Yardley V. Vezin H. Palfey B. Schirmer R.H. Davioud-Charvet E. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 2006; 128: 10784-10794Google Scholar).

However, the toxicity caused by nonspecific interactions, as well as the inhibition of DNA synthesis by BCNU, complicates the use of the compound as a GR inhibitor (31FitzGerald G.B. Bauman C.

We have previously reported on the design, synthesis, and inhibitory activity of a novel class of irreversible carbamate GR inhibitors (46Seefeldt T. Dwivedi C. Peitz G. Herman J. Carlson L. Zhang Z. Guan X. J. Med. Chem... 2005; 48: 5224-5231Google Scholar). Of this class, 2-acetylamino-3-[4-(2-acetylamino-2-carboxyethylsulfanylcarbonylamino)phenylcarbamoylsulfanyl]propionic acid (compound 1) (Fig. 2) was determined to be the most potent inhibitor with IC50, Ki, and kinact values of 50 μm, 88 μm, and 0.1 min–1, respectively, against yeast GR (46Seefeldt T. Dwivedi C. Peitz G. Herman J. Carlson L. Zhang Z. Guan X. J. Med. Chem... 2005; 48: 5224-5231Google Scholar). In comparison, BCNU exhibited an IC50 of 470 μm under the same conditions. However, in our effort to create intracellular thiol oxidative stress, the compound failed to inhibit intracellular GR due to its inability to pass through the cell membrane. 3Unpublished data from this laboratory. In this work, we present 2-acetylamino-3-[4-(2-acetylamino-2-carboxyethylsulfanylthiocarbonylamino)phenylthiocarbamoylsulfanyl]propionic acid (2-AAPA), a close structural analog of compound 1, as a novel and cell-permeable irreversible GR inhibitor (Fig. 2). The Ki and kinact values of 2-AAPA against yeast GR were comparable with those of compound 1. Most important, 2-AAPA can inhibit intracellular GR and produce thiol oxidative stress. An additional advantage is that the compound can be easily prepared by one-step synthesis from commercially available reagents. 2-AAPA can be a useful research tool in creating intracellular thiol oxidative stress. The synthesis and characterization of the compound as a GR inhibitor, as well as its effect on the intracellular ratio of GSH to GSSG, are presented. Synthesis of 2-AAPA—A solution of 1,4-diisothiocyanatobenzene (1 mmol; Aldrich) in tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) was added to a solution of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (2 mmol; Sigma) in saturated sodium bicarbonate (10 ml) at room temperature under argon with stirring (Fig. 3). Water was added until the solution cleared, and the solution was allowed to stir for 1 h. The tetrahydrofuran was removed in vacuo, and the remaining solution was acidified to pH 2 with HCl (2 m). The solution was loaded onto a phenyl solid extraction column (6 ml, J&W Scientific) preconditioned with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (15 ml), 100% acetonitrile (15 ml), and again with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (15 ml). The separation was monitored by TLC on Sigma glass-backed Silica Gel 60 F254 plates, and the product was eluted using 10% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fractions containing the product were pooled and freeze-dried. 2-AAPA was obtained as a yellow powder (melting point of 151–153 °C) in 51% yield. The purity of the product was determined using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) performed on a Beckman system equipped with a UV detector. The HPLC employed an Adsorbosil C18 column (250 × 3.2 mm, inner diameter, 5 μm; Alltech) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the detector was set at 254 nm. Compound purity was assessed by two HPLC methods: a gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile in an aqueous solution of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 40 min and a gradient of 0–100% methanol in an aqueous solution of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 40 min. The compound was determined to be >99% pure by both HPLC methods. Structural characterization was conducted by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry. NMR spectra were obtained with a JEOL 500-MHz NMR spectrometer. The high resolution mass spectrum was obtained on a Bruker 7T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6): δ 1.8 (s, 6H, 2×CH3), 3.32 (dd, J = 8.91, 13.5, 2H, 2×SCH), 3.76 (dd, J = 4.95, 13.5, 2H, 2×SCH), 4.39 (m, 2H, 2×NCH), 7.56 (s, br, 2.5H observed, phenyl), 8.3 (d, 2H, 2×C(O)NH-CH), and 11.7 (s, 2H, 2×C(S)NH-phenyl); 13C NMR (Me2SO-d6): 171.7, 169.1, 126.2, 123.8, 51.1, 35.9, and 22.2. The carbon of the carbamate was not observed. HRMS for C18H23N4O6S4 (M + H)+: calculated, 519.0500; and found, 519.0560. GR Assay—GR assays were carried out as described (46Seefeldt T. Dwivedi C. Peitz G. Herman J. Carlson L. Zhang Z. Guan X. J. Med. Chem... 2005; 48: 5224-5231Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and NADPH (0.2 mm; Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of GSSG (0.52 mm; Sigma). GR activity was measured by the initial rates of disappearance of NADPH determined spectrophotometrically at λ = 340 nm. Time- and Concentration-dependent Inactivation of GR—Yeast GR (0.3 units/ml) was incubated at 25 °C with 2-AAPA at different concentrations (16, 32, 63, and 125 μm) in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and NADPH (0.2 mm). Aliquots were withdrawn and tested for remaining GR activity at different time intervals (0, 5, 10, and 20 min) as described for the GR assay. An identical incubation in the absence of the inhibitor was conducted as a control. Dialysis of 2-AAPA-inhibited GR—The procedure included inactivation of yeast GR (0.9 units/ml) by 2-AAPA (1 mm) at 25 °C, followed by extensive dialysis in phosphate buffer (3× 800 ml, 0.1 m, pH 7.4) in a 3-ml DispoDialyzer (Spectrum) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da. Aliquots were withdrawn at different time intervals, and the remaining GR activity was determined as described for the GR assay. Substrate GSSG Protection Experiment—Yeast GR (0.7 units/ml) was incubated with 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) at 25 °C in the presence or absence of GSSG (0.25 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4). Aliquots were withdrawn, and the remaining GR activity was determined as described for the GR assay. NADPH-dependent GR Inhibition—Yeast GR (0.7 units/ml) was incubated with 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) in the presence or absence of NADPH (0.2 mm). Aliquots were withdrawn, and the remaining GR activity was determined as described for the GR assay. Reaction of 2-AAPA with Serine or Cysteine—2-AAPA (0.1 mm) was mixed with serine (5 mm) or cysteine (5 mm) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.5) at ambient temperature. Aliquots were withdrawn to determine the remaining 2-AAPA by HPLC. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of 2-AAPA-inhibited GR—Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed in the Redox Biological Center funded mass spectrometry core facility located in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The LC/electrospray ionization MS/MS system consisted of a QSTAR XL QTOF tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) interfaced to an SCL-10A HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD). A solution containing yeast GR (17.6 units/ml), NADPH (1 mm), and 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.5) was left at room temperature for 2 h. At the end of 2 h, 500 μl of the solution was on-line desalted through a pre-concentration loop (2 × 20 mm) packed with POROS 10 R2 perfusion material (PerSeptive Biosystems) and flushed with 2 ml of 0.25% formic acid in water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min before being diverted to the analytical column. The LC separation was achieved on a C18 column (50 × 1.0 mm, inner diameter, 5 μm; Micro-Tech Scientific, Inc., Vista, CA) and using a linear gradient elution from 10 to 90% Solvent B in 10 min at a flow rate of 100 μl/min (Solvent A = 0.3% formic acid in water (v/v); Solvent B = 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v)). The solvent flow from HPLC was split 40:60 between the mass spectrometer and a waste solvent bottle. The mass spectrometer was operated with a Turbo IonSpray electrospray ionization source in a positive ion mode with a mass range of 500–2000 atomic mass units. The IonSpray voltage was set to 5500 V, with a source temperature of 150 °C, a skimmer declustering potential of 40 V, and a ring focusing potential of 230 V. The data were acquired and processed using Analyst QS 1.1 software, and the molecular masses of proteins were generated from several multiply charged peaks using the Bayesian protein reconstruct option in BioAnalyst Extensions 1.1.5 software. A control experiment in the absence of 2-AAPA was also conducted in parallel. Effects of 2-AAPA on Glutathione S-Transferase and Glutathione Peroxidase—The effects of 2-AAPA on glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GP) activity were determined by incubating 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) with GST (0.02 units/ml; Sigma) or GP (0.02 units/ml; Sigma) at 25 °C for 30 min. The remaining enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically using assay protocols from Sigma. Determination of the Effect of 2-AAPA on GSH Biosynthesis—To determine whether 2-AAPA inhibits GSH biosynthesis, the effects of 2-AAPA on γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), two enzymes involved in GSH biosynthesis, were determined using a previously reported procedure (47Nardi G. Cipollaro M. Loguercio C. J. Chromatogr... 1990; 530: 122-128Google Scholar) with minor modification. The procedure determines the activities of GCS and GS in cell homogenate by monitoring the formation of glutamylcysteine and GSH, the reaction products of GCS and GS, respectively. Because CV-1 is a kidney cell line that is rich in γ-glutamyltransferase and dipeptidase, two enzymes that rapidly cleave GSH and glutamylcysteine (48Hinchman C.A. Ballatori N. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1990; 40: 1131-1135Google Scholar), we decided to use OVCAR-3 cells, a human ovarian cancer cell line (NCI, National Institutes of Health) routinely used in this laboratory, for the investigation. OVCAR-3 cells (2.5 million/assay) were homogenized using an Omni 5000 homogenizer (Omni International, Waterbury, CT) in phosphate buffer (1 ml, 1 mm) with 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and passed through a Microcon centrifugal filter device (Millipore) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da to collect the protein fraction. The remaining protein fraction (∼100 μl) was collected and checked for the presence of residual GSH and glutamylcysteine by HPLC; a trace amount of residual GSH and glutamylcysteine was observed. The protein fraction was incubated with 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) at 25 °C for 30 min. A reaction mixture containing Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.2), MgCl2 (20 mm), KCl (50 mm), ATP (6 mm), and dithiothreitol (6 mm) was then added. For the GCS assay, cysteine (3 mm) and glutamic acid (15 mm) were added to the reaction solution. For determination of GS activity, glutamylcysteine (3 mm) and glycine (30 mm) were added. The reaction proceeded at 25 °C for 30 min. The samples were then derivatized with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; 50 mm) for 15 min at room temperature (49Guan X. Hoffman B. Dwivedi C. Matthees D.P. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal... 2003; 31: 251-261Google Scholar), followed by the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid (20 μl) as the internal standard. After derivatization, protein was precipitated by the addition of HCl. Glutamylcysteine and GSH in the supernatant were quantified by HPLC. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Beckman Coulter HPLC System Gold system controlled by a system controller (32 Karat workstation with PC) and equipped with a 125 gradient pumping module, a 508 autosampler with a sample cooling system, and a 168 photodiode array detector. The autosampler was set at 4 °C. The HPLC conditions employed an Apollo C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, inner diameter, 5 μm; Alltech), Mobile Phase A (aqueous solution with 1% (v/v) formic acid), and Mobile Phase B (acetonitrile). Mobile Phase B was first increased from 5 to 60% in 16 min and then to 80% in 3 min and held at 80% for an additional 3 min. All flow rates were 0.8 ml/min. The injection volume was 50 μl. The detecting wavelength was 326 nm. Both glutamylcysteine and GSH were detected as the DTNB derivatives, glutamylcysteine-TNB and GSH-TNB, respectively. Quantification was conducted using standard curves constructed with standard GSH and glutamylcysteine. Evaluation of the Effects of 2-AAPA on the Antioxidant Enzymes Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase—To determine the effect of 2-AAPA on catalase activity, 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) was incubated with bovine liver catalase (5 units/ml; Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C. The catalase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using a protocol from Sigma. The effect on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was determined by incubating 0.1 mm 2-AAPA with bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD (0.01 unit/ml; SOD assay kit, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) for 30 min at 25 °C. The remaining activity was determined according to the manufacturer's procedure. Determination of GR Inhibition in CV-1 Cells—Exponentially growing CV-1 cells (7.5 million, monkey kidney cells; American Type Culture Collection) were placed in a 185-cm2 flask in RPMI 1640 growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h for attachment. At the end of 24 h, the cells in the flask (∼15 million) were treated with 2-AAPA (0.1 mm) in a 5 % CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 20 min. The medium was collected, and the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and detached by trypsinization. The medium and the cell suspension were combined and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA, suspended in hypotonic phosphate buffer (1 ml, 1 mm) containing 1 mm EDTA, and homogenized over ice with an Omni 5000 homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and 300 μl of the supernatant was used to determine GR activity as described for the GR assay. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (54Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Determination of GSH and GSSG in CV-1 Cells—Determination of GSH and GSSG in the homogenate followed a previously reported procedure (49Guan X. Hoffman B. Dwivedi C. Matthees D.P. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal... 2003; 31: 251-261Google Scholar) with minor modification. The cells were treated with 2-AAPA in a 185-cm2 flask and collected as described above. The cell pellet was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10% sulfosalicylic acid. The cell suspension was sonicated using a Misonix XL2020 sonicator with a cup horn probe. The lysate (100 μl) was added with β-methylphenylalanine (100 μg/ml, 10 μl) as an internal standard and DTNB (50 mm, 60 μl), followed by neutralization with phosphate buffer (0.5 m, pH 10, 200 μl). The sample was left at ambient temperature for 15 min to allow the completion of GSH derivatization by DTNB. After derivatization, the sample was acidified by the addition of HCl (10 m, 30 μl), followed by centrifugation analysis to remove proteins. The supernatant was diluted 10 times, and 50 μl of the diluted supernatant was subjected to LC/MS analysis. LC/MS was conducted on a Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima mass unit. Quantification of GSH and GSSG was conducted using standard curves containing known amounts of the analyte. Time- and Concentration-dependent Inactivation of GR—Fig. 4 shows a plot derived from the natural logarithm of enzyme activity versus time at various concentrations of 2-AAPA. The plot shows that the enzyme lost its activity over time, a characteristic of irreversible enzyme inactivation. The inhibitory parameters Ki and kinact of 2-AAPA were determined to be 56 μm and 0.1 min–1, respectively, based on the method of Kitz and Wilson (50Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1962; 237: 3245-3249Google Scholar), which replots the reciprocal of apparent rate constants of inhibition (kapp) (slopes of Fig. 4) against the reciprocal of inhibitor concentration (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Determination of Ki and kinact based on the method of Kitz and Wilson (50Kitz R.

https://openalex.org/W2028355032,"Pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) are densely innervated groups of complex sensory airway receptors involved in the regulation of breathing. Together with their surrounding Clara-like cells, they exhibit stem cell potential through their capacity to regenerate depopulated areas of the epithelium following lung injury. We have employed confocal live cell imaging microscopy and novel electrophysiological techniques in a new ex vivo lung slice model to unravel potential purinergic signaling pathways within the NEB microenvironment. Quinacrine histochemistry indicated high amounts of vesicular ATP in NEB cells. Using a ""reporter-patching"" method adapted to create a uniquely sensitive and selective biosensor for the direct detection of ATP release from NEBs ex vivo, we demonstrated quantal ATP release from NEBs following their depolarization. Enhancing enzymatic extracellular ATP hydrolysis or inhibiting P2 receptors confirmed the central role of ATP in paracrine interactions between NEB cells and Clara-like cells. Combined calcium imaging, pharmacology, and immunohistochemistry showed that ligand-binding to functional P2Y(2) receptors underpins the activation of Clara-like cells. Hence, NEB cells communicate with their cellular neighbors in the NEB microenvironment by releasing ATP, which rapidly evokes purinergic activation of surrounding Clara-like cells. Besides ATP acting on the P2X(3) receptor expressing vagal sensory nerve terminals between NEB cells, local paracrine purinergic signaling within this potential stem cell niche may be important to both normal airway function, airway epithelial regeneration after injury, and/or the pathogenesis of small cell lung carcinomas."

The aim of this study was to assess the topographical distribution of H. pylori in the stomach as well as the vacA and cagA genotypes in patients with and without gastric cancer.Three gastric biopsies, from predetermined regions, were evaluated in 16 patients with gastric cancer and 14 patients with dyspeptic symptoms. From cancer patients, additional biopsy specimens were obtained from tumor centers and margins; among these samples, the presence of H. pylori vacA and cagA genotypes was evaluated. Positive H. pylori was 38% and 26% in biopsies obtained from the gastric cancer and non-cancer groups, respectively (p = 0.008), and 36% in tumor sites. In cancer patients, we found a preferential distribution of H. pylori in the fundus and corpus, whereas, in the non-cancer group, the distribution was uniform (p = 0.003). A majority of the biopsies were simultaneously cagA gene-positive and -negative. The fundus and corpus demonstrated a higher positivity rate for the cagA gene in the non-cancer group (p = 0.036). A mixture of cagA gene sizes was also significantly more frequent in this group (p = 0.003). Ninety-two percent of all the subjects showed more than one vacA gene genotype; s1b and m1 vacA genotypes were predominantly found in the gastric cancer group. The highest vacA-genotype signal-sequence diversity was found in the corpus and 5 cm from tumor margins.High H. pylori colonization diversity, along with the cagA gene, was found predominantly in the fundus and corpus of patients with gastric cancer. The genotype diversity observed across systematic whole-organ and tumor sampling was remarkable. We find that there is insufficient evidence to support the association of one isolate with a specific disease, due to the multistrain nature of H. pylori infection shown in this work."

https://openalex.org/W2070824801,"Remyelination is an important aspect of nerve regeneration after nerve injury, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that meltrin-beta (ADAM19), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, plays crucial roles in nerve regeneration after a crush injury to the sciatic nerves. The expression of meltrin-beta was up-regulated in neurons after the crush injury. Morphometrical analysis revealed a delay in remyelination in meltrin-beta-deficient nerves, whereas no significant defects were observed in their axon elongation. The activation of Krox-20, an indispensable transcription factor for myelination, was delayed in meltrin-beta-deficient nerves and was accompanied by the retarded expression of myelin-related proteins. Expression of Krox-20 in Schwann cells was mediated by Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt but not that of Erks was reduced in regenerating nerves of meltrin-beta-deficient mice. The cell membrane fraction prepared from meltrin-beta-deficient nerves showed a defective activation of Akt in the membrane-loaded Schwann cells. Meltrin-beta-deficient mice exhibited delayed sciatic functional recovery after the nerve crush. Altogether, these results reveal a role of meltrin-beta in Schwann cell differentiation and re-myelination in nerve regeneration. Moreover, this study suggests that meltrin-beta functions as a modulator of juxtacrine signaling from axons that activate the Akt pathway and the Krox-20 expression, which is the prerequisite for Schwann cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2057470748,"ZNF521 (zinc finger protein 521) is a transcription factor with an N-terminal transcriptional repressor motif and 30 zinc finger domains. Although a high expression level of ZNF521 in human CD34+ progenitors and hematopoietic malignancies has been demonstrated, the functional role of ZNF521 in hematopoietic cell differentiation has not been clarified. In this study, we analyzed the role of ZNF521 in erythroid cell differentiation using the short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene silencing method. Down-regulation of ZNF521 mediated by transient expression of shRNA for ZNF521 resulted in increased synthesis of hemoglobin in K562 and HEL cell lines as compared with control cells. K562-derived clones in which ZNF521 was constitutively silenced by shRNA also showed marked synthesis of hemoglobin and an increased expression level of glycophorin A. Since GATA-1 is the key regulator of erythroid differentiation, the effect of ZNF521 on transcription activity of GATA-1 was analyzed using a luciferase assay. GATA-1 activity was markedly inhibited by ZNF521 in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion analysis of ZNF521 showed that the repressive effect requires an N-terminal repression motif. Furthermore, the direct interaction of ZNF521 with GATA-1 was demonstrated. These results indicate that ZNF521 modulates erythroid cell differentiation through direct binding with GATA-1.

The gene encoding EVI3 was initially identified as a common site of retroviral integration in murine AKXD B-cell lymphomas (2Justice M.J. Morse III, H.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. J. Virol.. 1994; 68: 1293-1300Google Scholar). The integration site of Evi3 is located upstream of the first translated exon and results in up-regulation of Evi3 by a promoter insertion mechanism. Although EVI3 expression in normal B cells is ontogenetically and developmentally regulated, alteration of EVI3 expression induced by retrovirus insertion might be involved in the genesis of murine B-cell lymphoma. ZNF423/OAZ (olfactory-associated zinc finger protein), another 30-ZF protein that displays highly homology with ZNF521, was identified as a protein interacting with EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1) in a yeast two-hybrid screen (3Tsai R.Y.

Suzuki T. Yamaguchi T.P. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Oncogene.. 2004; 23: 2727-2731Google Scholar). Although direct interaction between ZNF521 and EBF1 has not been demonstrated, ZNF521 also inhibits the transcriptional activity of EBF1. These findings indicate that aberrant expression of ZNF521 and/or ZNF423 results in inhibition of B-cell differentiation and induction of B-cell malignancies by modulating the transcriptional activities of EBF1 (1Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Google Scholar, 7Hentges K.E.

Genome-wide analysis has detected frequent monoallelic deletion of EBF1 or PAX5, which is downstream of EBF1, in B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8Mullighan C.G. Goorha S. Radtke I.

In addition, fusion of PAX5 to ZNF521 resulting in formation of PAX5-ZNF521 fusion protein has been found in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (8Mullighan C.G. Goorha S. Radtke I. Miller C.B.

Both ZNF521 and ZNF423 contain an N-terminal 12-amino acid motif, which is associated with transcriptional repression and conserved among other ZF transcriptional repressors, including FOG-1, FOG-2, BCL11A, and SALL family members (9Lin A.C.

ZNF423 has also been identified as a cofactor of Smad protein in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. ZNF423 binds to Smad1 and Smad4 in response to BMP2 and activates transcription of BMP target genes, such as Xenopus Vent-2 (12Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell.. 2000; 100: 229-240Google Scholar) and murine Smad6 (13Ku M. Howard S. Ni W. Lagna G. Hata A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 5277-5287Google Scholar). On the basis of structural and sequential homology, ZNF521 is speculated to have functions similar to those of ZNF423. Bond et al. (1Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Google Scholar) showed that ZNF521 interacts with Smad1 and Smad4 and increases BMP-responsive element-dependent transcriptional activity following treatment with BMP2 or BMP4. Both ZNF521 and ZNF423 are expressed in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. In addition to these organs, ZNF521 is expressed at relatively high levels in spleen, lymph nodes, and fetal liver, whereas ZNF423 is not expressed in these organs. In hematopoietic cells, ZNF521 mRNA is expressed abundantly in CD34+ early hematopoietic progenitors, and its expression level declines rapidly during their differentiation (1Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Google Scholar). The ZNF521 transcript is not detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. On the other hand, a significant expression level of ZNF521 mRNA is detected in most cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (1Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Google Scholar, 14Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Amodio N. Mega T. Agosti V. Fanello D. Pelaggi D. Bullinger L. Grieco M. Moore M.A. Venuta S. Morrone G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol.. 2008; 40: 848-854Google Scholar). ZNF521 mRNA is also expressed in several hematopoietic cell lines derived from acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia at blast crisis. Among them, a large amount of ZNF521 transcript is detected in K562 and HEL cell lines (1Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Carbone E. Bonelli P. Agosti V. Amodio N. De Rosa G. Di Nicola M. Gianni A.M. Moore M.A. Hata A. Grieco M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Blood.. 2004; 103: 2062-2070Google Scholar), both of which have potential for differentiation to erythroid lineage. These findings strongly suggest that ZNF521 plays an important role in hematopoietic differentiation and leukemogenesis. On the basis of this concept, we investigated the function of ZNF521 in hematopoietic differentiation by using shRNA-mediated silencing of ZNF521 in these cell lines. The data we obtained implicate ZNF521 in the suppression of erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors via inhibition of the transcriptional activity of GATA-1. Furthermore, it was suggested that ZNF521 interacts directly with GATA-1 via the C-terminal ZF domains and suppresses the transcriptional activity of GATA-1 through the N-terminal suppression domain. Cells and Cell Lines—The K562 and HEL cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the 293T and NIH3T3 cell lines were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Plasmids—Two segments of ZNF521 cDNA (start codon to the XhoI site and the XhoI site to the terminal codon) were generated by reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 K562 cells using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was generated using an Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. The following primers were used for PCR: ZNF521 5′ fragment, forward (5′-GTCGACGCAGGATGTCTCGCCGCAAGCAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGCTTGTTTACTCGAGGGACCAGTCATG-3′); ZNF521 3′ fragment, forward (5′-CTGGTCCCTCGAGTAAACAAGCAAAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGGCCGCCTAACTGCTGTGTTGGGTCATTG-3′). The PCR products were cloned into the pUC 118 vector using a Mighty Cloning Kit (TaKaRa) and sequenced. The full-length ZNF521 cDNA was constructed by ligation of the cDNA fragments and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) or p3×FLAG-CMV-7.1 expression vector (Sigma). The pcDNA3 3×FLAG/ZNF521 was constructed by PCR using the primers to generate a 5′-cDNA fragment encoding the 3×FLAG epitope fused to the N terminus of ZNF521 protein. pGL3-MαP-Luc, a plasmid in which the 3×GATA-1 binding site is inserted just upstream of the JunB promoter in JunB-MP-Luc (15Ishiko E. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Gale K. Ishiko J. Satoh Y. Tanaka H. Shibayama H. Mizuki M. Era T. Enver T. Kanakura Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 4929-4939Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. I. Matsumura. Human GATA-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. S. Takahashi. The pcDNA3 myc/GATA-1 was constructed by PCR using the primers to generate a 5′ cDNA fragment encoding the Myc epitope fused to the N terminus of GATA-1 protein. For the establishment of stable cell lines, K562 cells were transferred to culture medium containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml 48 h after transfection. Resistant clones were then isolated and expanded over several weeks. The levels of GATA-1 expression in established clone cells were examined by Western blotting. shRNA Plasmids and Transfection—Two kinds of shRNA for ZNF521, GGGACAAGAAGTACCACTG and GGAAGAGCATATTAGACAG, were designed, and their expression vectors were constructed using pcPURU6β vector (TaKaRa). These vectors were transfected into K562 cells using a Nucleo-fector device (Amaxa Biosystems GmbH, Cologne, Germany). For the establishment of stable cell lines, K562 cells were transferred to culture medium containing puromycin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml 48 h after transfection. Resistant clones were then isolated and expanded over several weeks. The expression levels of ZNF521 mRNA were examined by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by Northern blot analysis and real time PCR. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR of ZNF521 mRNA (Hs01031125_m1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA (4326317E) as an internal control was performed using the TaqMan Gene Expression assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using an Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of ZNF521 mRNA was corrected by reference to that of GAPDH mRNA, and the relative amount of ZNF521 mRNA in each sample was calculated by comparative ΔCt method. Benzidine Staining—The hemoglobinization of K562 cells was analyzed by benzidine staining 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after transient transfection with shRNA for ZNF521. In brief, cells were collected and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with benzidine solution containing 3% H2O2 for 5 min, and 200 cells were counted in each analysis under a light microscope. Cells with blue-brown-stained cytoplasm were counted as benzidine-staining-positive cells. The experiments were repeated three times. Statistical analysis between the two groups was performed using a Tukey-Kramer test. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed by using a 32P-random-labeled ZNF521 cDNA fragment generated by PCR using the primers 5′-AGACAGGTTCATTGTGACCT-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGCACAGTGTCGAGAT-3′. A β-actin control probe was also labeled by random labeling. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Expression of cell surface glycophorin A was examined by flow cytometric analysis using PE-conjugated anti-glycophorin A monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Cells to be used as unstained controls for glycophorin A were incubated with control PE-conjugated mouse monoclonal IgG (Pharmingen). Luciferase Assays—Four micrograms of the plasmid DNAs (cDNA for GATA-1, ZNF521, and/or empty vector), 1.1 μgof the GATA-1 reporter gene pGL3-MαP-Luc (15Ishiko E. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Gale K. Ishiko J. Satoh Y. Tanaka H. Shibayama H. Mizuki M. Era T. Enver T. Kanakura Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 4929-4939Google Scholar), and 0.1 μgof the sea pansy luciferase expression plasmid pRL-SV40 (Toyo B-Net, Tokyo, Japan) as an internal control were transduced into NIH3T3 cells (2 × 105 cells seeded in a 60-mm dish) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 16 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and sea pansy luciferase activity were assayed using the Pica Gene dual sea pansy luminescence kit (Toyo B-Net) and a luminometer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Results are expressed as the ratios of luciferase activity to sea pansy luciferase activity. Statistical analysis of data between the two groups was performed using a paired sample t test. Five micrograms of the GATA-1 reporter gene pGL3-MαP-Luc and 0.05 μg of the sea pansy luciferase expression plasmid pRL-SV40 were transfected into K562 cells (1 × 106 cells) by electroporation. After 36 h, the cells were lysed, and dual luciferase assays were performed. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—Five ZNF521 cDNA fragments were constructed by PCR and sequenced. They were then cloned into the pEUE01-His vector (CellFree Sciences Co. Ltd., Matsuyama, Japan) containing the His6 tag region and SP6 promoter. The full-length GATA-1 cDNA and ZF parts of GATA-1 generated by PCR were cloned into the pEUE01-GST vector (CellFree Sciences Co. Ltd.) containing a GST tag region and SP6 promoter. The His6-ZNF521 proteins and GST-GATA-1 fusion protein were synthesized by use of the wheat cell-free protein synthesis system (16Madin K. Sawasaki T. Ogasawara T. Endo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2000; 97: 559-564Google Scholar). His6-ZNF521 fusion proteins were purified using nickel-Sepharose high performance (GE Healthcare). GST-GATA-1 fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE following Coomassie Blue staining and by Western blotting analysis. GST-GATA-1 fusion protein immobilized on beads and various amounts of His6-ZNF521 proteins were mixed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-His antibody (TaKaRa). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The p3×FLAG-ZNF521 CMV-7.1 plasmid and the pcDNA3 Myc/GATA-1 plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, the cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with EZview red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel or anti-Myc affinity gel (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with lysis buffer. The bound protein was released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 10 μl of sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) and anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Total cellular lysate was isolated from K562/3×FLAG-ZNF521 cell lines, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. The protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-GATA-1 antibody (N6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed with a Quik ChIP kit (IMGENEX, San Diego, CA). K562/3×FLAG-ZNF521 cells (5 × 106 cells) were fixed with 1% of formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and the reactions were stopped by adding 125 mm glycine. Chromatin was sonicated with 20 pulses, 30-s pulses followed by 20 s of rest on ice, using Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). After sonication, immunoprecipitation was performed with EZview red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitated DNA samples and input samples were eluted and reverse cross-linked and purified using phenol/chloroform extraction. The primers used were as follows. GATA-1-binding sites on the β-globin locus were 5′-GGAAGATACTGATAAGTTGAC-3′/5′-TGGAAATCTGGCTTATTGGAG-3′. PCR was performed with HotSt-arTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by UV illumination following ethidium bromide staining. Inhibition of ZNF521 Expression Promotes Erythroid Maturation in K562 and HEL Cells—It is well known that K562 and HEL cells are able to differentiate toward erythroid lineage when they are exposed to chemical inducers (17Andersson L.C. Jokinen M. Gahmberg C.G. Nature.. 1979; 278: 364-365Google Scholar, 18Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weatherall D.J. Nature.. 1979; 280: 164-165Google Scholar, 19Martin P. Papayannopoulou T. Science.. 1982; 216: 1233-1235Google Scholar). Because both K562 and HEL cells constitutively express ZNF521, we investigated whether down-regulation of this ZF protein influences the differentiation of these cells. To silence ZNF521 gene expression, two kinds of shRNA corresponding to a sequence of the ZNF521 coding region were cloned into the expression vector and transfected transiently into K562 and HEL cells by electroporation. The erythroid differentiation was monitored every other day by benzidine staining. A green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid was used to quantify the transduction efficiency after electroporation. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that more than 60% of both K562 and HEL cells appeared to be green fluorescent protein-positive after 24 h (data not shown). The expression levels of ZNF521 mRNA were decreased in shRNA-mediated cell lines as compared with those in control cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, from day 4 to day 8 after transfection of shRNA plasmids for ZNF521, the number of benzidine staining-positive cells increased significantly as compared with control cells in both the K562 and HEL cell lines. We further examined the effect of ZNF521 down-regulation on erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic cells by establishing K562-derived clones in which ZNF521 mRNA is stably disrupted. After transfection of two kinds of ZNF521 shRNA expression vectors and an empty vector into K562 cells, stable clones were isolated by limiting dilution following selection with puromycin. We also established K562 clones overexpressing GATA-1 to compare the phenotype of the ZNF521-silenced K562 clones. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression levels of ZNF521 mRNA in these clone cells determined by Northern blot analysis, and real-time PCR appeared to be dramatically decreased. We compared the erythroid differentiation of ZNF521-silenced clones and GATA-1-overexpressing clones with the control clones by benzidine staining. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, ZNF521-silenced clones showed a marked increase of benzidine staining-positive cells. The increased hemoglobinization in the ZNF521-silenced clones and GATA-1-overexpressing clones was apparently visible (Fig. 1F). Next, we examined the expression of glycophorin A, an erythroid lineage-associated cell surface marker, using flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 1G, the expression level of glycophorin A on the cell surface was significantly increased in ZNF521-silenced clones as compared with the parental K562 cells. Similarly, an increased level of glycophorin A expression was observed in the GATA-1-overexpressing clones. We also compared the gene expression patterns in a ZNF521-silenced clone and a control clone comprehensively using Human Genome Survey Microarray version 2.0, covering more than 30000 genes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Consequently, expression levels of erythroid lineage-related genes, including globin genes, erythrocyte membrane proteins, and ankyrin 1, appeared to be dramatically up-regulated in a ZNF521-silenced clone as compared with a control clone (supplemental Table 1). These results indicate that down-regulation of ZNF521 results in enhancement of erythroid differentiation in hematopoietic progenitors. ZNF521 Inhibits GATA-1 Transcriptional Activity—Since GATA-1 is the key regulator of erythroid differentiation that plays a central role in erythroid lineage-associated gene expression (20Ferreira R. Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 1215-1227Google Scholar), we speculated that ZNF521 might influence the transcriptional activity of GATA-1. To verify this possibility, we performed a luciferase assay with a reporter gene for GATA-1, pGL3-MαP-Luc, which contains three tandem repeats of the GATA-1-responsive element just upstream of the JunB promoter. We used NIH3T3 cells for reporter gene assays, because this cell line does not express endogenous GATA-1. Although transient transfection of the GATA-1 reporter with GATA-1 cDNA alone increased the promoter activity, co-transfection of ZNF521 cDNA with GATA-1 cDNA exerted a significant repressive effect on GATA-1 activity (Fig. 2A). There was no significant effect of ZNF521 cDNA on the basal activity of the JunB promoter, indicating that the inhibitory effect of ZNF521 was specific for the GATA-1-induced transcriptional activity. Next, we co-transfected the GATA-1 reporter with GATA-1 cDNA and various amounts of ZNF521 cDNA into NIH3T3 cells and examined the reporter activity. Consequently, ZNF521 cDNA appeared to inhibit the GATA-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Next, we compared the GATA-1 promoter activities in various K562 cell lines. The GATA-1 promoter activities and GATA-1 protein levels were increased in the ZNF521-silenced clone and the GATA-1-overexpressing clone (Fig. 2C). ZNF521 comprises an N-terminal repression motif and 30 ZFs (Fig. 3A). To determine which parts of ZNF521 inhibit GATA-1 transcriptional activity, we constructed deletion mutants of ZNF521 cDNA and analyzed the effects of these products on GATA-1 transcriptional activity. Two kinds of mutant ZNF521 cDNA, in which the N-terminal repression motif (ΔNT) or C-terminal ZF domains (Δ21–30) were deleted (Fig. 3A), were inserted into the FLAG-tagged expression vector. Production of wild-type and deleted proteins by these cDNAs was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The effects of these mutated ZNF521s on GATA-1 transcriptional activity were compared with that of wild-type ZNF521. As shown in Fig. 3C, the inhibitory effect of wild-type ZNF521 on GATA-1 promoter activity was partially abrogated by deletion of the N-terminal repression motif and C-terminal ZF domains, indicating that these parts are necessary for inhibition of GATA-1 activity. Because deletion mutants of the N-terminal repression motif and C-terminal ZF domains did not completely inhibit GATA-1 activity, another portion(s) of ZNF521 might also be involved in inhibiting GATA-1 transcriptional activity. ZNF521 Does Not Affect the DNA Binding Activity of GATA-1—We performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using K562 clones. The DNA binding activity of GATA-1 was not decreased in ZNF521-silenced clones as compared with that in control clones. These data show that ZNF521 might not affect the DNA binding activity of GATA-1 (supplemental Fig. 1). ZNF521 Interacts Directly with GATA-1 in Vitro and in Vivo—Since ZNF521 inhibits GATA-1 transcriptional activity as shown above, we next examined the physical interaction between ZNF521 and GATA-1. To verify whether ZNF521 is capable of binding to GATA-1 in vitro, we performed a pull-down assay using a GST fusion protein comprising GATA-1 and three fragments of His6-tagged ZNF521 protein, ZF1–8, ZF9–20, and ZF21–30 (Fig. 4A), which were synthesized in vitro using a wheat cell-free protein synthesis system (Fig. 4B). GST-GATA-1 protein was immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with His6-tagged ZNF521 proteins. As shown in Fig. 4C, GST-GATA-1 bound to the C-terminal part of ZNF521 strongly and to the N-terminal part weakly but did not bind to the central portion of ZNF521. GST alone did not bind to any part of ZNF521. These data indicate that ZNF521 interacts directly with GATA-1 in vitro. GATA-1 has two ZFs, an N-terminal finger (NF) and a C-terminal finger (CF). It has been reported that many kinds of protein can bind to GATA-1 via these two ZFs (21Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H.

Leukemia.. 1997; 11: 352-358Google Scholar). To determine which ZF of GATA-1 interacts with which part of the ZFs of ZNF521, we constructed GST-GATA-1 NF, GST-GATA-1 CF, and two fragments of His6-tagged ZNF521, ZF-(21–26) and ZF-(27–30) (Fig. 4A and 5A). GST-GATA-1 CF bound to ZNF521 ZF-(21–26) but not to ZNF521 ZF-(27–30), whereas GST-GATA-1 NF bound neither ZNF521 ZF-(21–26) nor ZF-(27–30) (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that ZNF521 interacts mainly with GATA-1 CF through the ZF-(21–26) portion. Finally, we verified whether ZNF521 interacts with GATA-1 in viable cells. The vectors encoding FLAG-tagged ZNF521 and Myc-tagged GATA-1 were transfected into 293T cells, and the total cell lysates were isolated. As shown in Fig. 6A, immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody on the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates revealed that ZNF521 was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged GATA-1. Immunoblotting with the anti-Myc antibody on the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates revealed that GATA-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with ZNF521. In addition, we established K562 cell lines expressing 3×FLAG-ZNF521 to examine endogenous interaction between ZNF521 and GATA-1. Immunoblotting of the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates with the anti-GATA-1 antibody revealed that ZNF521 was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous GATA-1 (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the data obtained from the ChIP assay using the K562/3×FLAG-ZNF521 cell line indicate that ZNF521 and GATA-1 form a transcription complex within the GATA-1-binding sites on the β-globin promoter, one of the GATA-1 target genes (Fig. 6C). These data confirm that ZNF521 interacts with GATA-1 in vivo. In the present study, we found that shRNA-mediated silencing of the ZNF521-encoding gene in K562 and HEL cells resulted in erythroid differentiation. We also showed that ZNF521 inhibits the transcriptional activity of GATA-1. Deletion analysis of ZNF521 showed that the repressive effect of ZNF521 requires the N-terminal repression motif. Furthermore, direct interaction of ZNF521 with GATA-1 through ZF-(21–26) of ZNF521 and CF of GATA-1 was demonstrated. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for differentiation of erythroid cells and maintenance of the “stemness” of hematopoietic progenitors. GATA-1 is known to interact with a variety of proteins via ZF domains. Among them, GATA-1 NF interacts with FOG-1 (Friend of GATA-1) (21Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujiwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell.. 1997; 90: 109-119Google Scholar, 22Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 219-228Google Scholar) and c-Myb (23Takahashi T. Suwabe N. Dai P. Ishii S. Nakano T. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 134-140Google Scholar), whereas CF interacts with EKLF (24Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Google Scholar), Fli-1 (25Eisbacher M. Holmes M.L. Newton A. Hogg P.J. Khachigian L.M. Crossley M. Chong B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 3427-3441Google Scholar), PU.1 (26Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T.D. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev.. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Google Scholar), and EVI1 (27Laricchia-Robbio L. Fazzina R. Li D. Rinaldi C.R. Sinha K.K. Chakraborty S. Nucifora G. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 7658-7666Google Scholar, 28Soderholm J. Kobayashi H. Mathieu C. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Leukemia.. 1997; 11: 352-358Google Scholar). These interactions play an important role in hematopoiesis, since they lead to transcriptional activation or repression of GATA-1 target genes. On the other hand, ZNF521 contains an N-terminal suppression motif that is conserved among many transcriptional repressors, including FOG-1 and FOG-2 (9Lin A.C. Roche A.E. Wilk J. Svensson E.C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 55017-55023Google Scholar). Recently, this portion was shown to be the association site of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase corepressor complex (NuRD) (10Hong W. Nakazawa M. Chen Y.Y. Kori R. Vakoc C.R. Rakowski C. Blobel G.A. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 2367-2378Google Scholar, 11Lauberth S.M. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 23922-23931Google Scholar), which is involved in global transcriptional repression. In the present study, we demonstrated that deletion of the N-terminal motif of ZNF521 resulted in reduction of the inhibitory effect of ZNF521 against GATA-1 transcriptional activity. This finding suggests that ZNF521 inhibits GATA-1 transcriptional activity by recruiting NuRD. Brand et al. (29Brand M. Ranish J.A. Kummer N.T. Hamilton J. Igarashi K. Francastel C. Chi T.H. Crabtree G.R. Aebersold R. Groudine M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 11: 73-80Google Scholar) showed that binding of NuRD to the promoter of globin genes was increased in globin-nonproducing immature cells as compared with that in globin-producing erythroid-differentiated cells. This suggests that at an early stage of erythroid differentiation, expression of globlin genes is repressed by the NuRD complex, whereas at a more mature stage, this repression declines as a result of dissociation from NuRD. Taken together with our results, it seems likely that the complex of GATA-1 and ZNF521 inhibits globin gene expression at an early stage of erythroid differentiation through complex formation with NuRD. In the present study, we demonstrated that ZNF521 interacts with GATA-1 through ZF-(21–30). We also demonstrated weak in vitro association of GATA-1 with ZNF521 ZF-(1–8). Since a ZNF521 mutant in which ZF-(21–30) was deleted inhibited GATA-1 activity, the association between GATA-1 and ZF-(1–8) of ZNF521 might also be involved in the repression of GATA-1 transcriptional activity. Fox et al. (30Fox A.H. Kowalski K. King G.F. Mackay J.P. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 33595-33603Google Scholar) showed that, in addition to a sixth ZF of FOG-1, ZF1, ZF5, and ZF9 of FOG-1 also interact with the NF of GATA-1 and that each finger contributes to the ability of FOG-1 to modulate GATA-1 activity. Furthermore, they showed that FOG-2 and U-shaped also contain multiple GATA-interacting fingers. These results indicate that GATA-binding proteins including ZNF521 use multiple ZFs to bind GATA-1. Smad family proteins are essential for BMP and transforming growth factor-β signaling (31Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Cárcamo J. Harland R.M. Massagué J. Nature.. 1996; 381: 620-623Google Scholar, 32Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature.. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested that the association of Smads with other transcription factors is the key for recruitment of Smads to specific promoter elements. BMP4 can increase the proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitors (33Bhatia M. Bonnet D. Wu D. Murdoch B. Wrana J. Gallacher L. Dick J.E. J. Exp. Med.. 1999; 189: 1139-1148Google Scholar, 34Bhardwaj G. Murdoch B. Wu D. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Chadwick K. Ling L.E. Karanu F.N. Bhatia M. Nat. Immunol.. 2001; 2: 142-143Google Scholar), whereas transforming growth factor-β acts as a negative regulator for hematopoietic progenitors in vitro (35Ottmann O.G. Pelus L.M. J. Immunol.. 1988; 140: 2661-2665Google Scholar, 36Sitnicka E. Ruscetti F.W. Priestley G.V. Wolf N.S. Bartelmez S.H. Blood.. 1996; 88: 82-88Google Scholar). BMP4 induces GATA-2 transcription (37Dalgin G. Goldman D.C. Donley N. Ahmed R. Eide C.A. Christian J.L. Dev. Biol.. 2007; 310: 454-469Google Scholar, 38Maeno M. Mead P.E. Kelley C. Xu R.H. Kung H.F. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Zon L.I. Blood.. 1996; 88: 1965-1972Google Scholar). Whereas GATA-1 regulates terminal differentiation of erythroid cells (39Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar), GATA-2 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and controls early stages of hematopoiesis (40Labbaye C. Valtieri M. Barberi T. Meccia E. Masella B. Pelosi E. Condorelli G.L. Testa U. Peschle C. J. Clin. Invest.. 1995; 95: 2346-2358Google Scholar). ZNF521 has been demonstrated to interact with Smad1/4 in response to BMP signals and to activate BMP-responsive genes, resulting in proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. Since GATA-2 was demonstrated to be repressed by GATA-1 during erythroid maturation (41Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Pal S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Google Scholar), the inhibition of GATA-1 activity by ZNF521 might be important for constitutive expression of GATA-2 in order to maintain hematopoietic progenitor cells. Taken together, ZNF521 might play an important role in maintaining the “stemness” of hematopoietic progenitors. Interestingly, EVI3, a murine homologue of ZNF521, has been demonstrated to be expressed in the brain, especially the cerebellum, as well as in hematopoietic progenitors (14Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Amodio N. Mega T. Agosti V. Fanello D. Pelaggi D. Bullinger L. Grieco M. Moore M.A. Venuta S. Morrone G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol.. 2008; 40: 848-854Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis revealed striking enrichment of Evi3 mRNA in the granule layer that hosts granule neural precursors in the postnatal cerebellum (14Bond H.M. Mesuraca M. Amodio N. Mega T. Agosti V. Fanello D. Pelaggi D. Bullinger L. Grieco M. Moore M.A. Venuta S. Morrone G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol.. 2008; 40: 848-854Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ZNF521 also plays an important role in development of the nervous system. To confirm this, we are now generating mice homozygous for an Evi3 null allele. We thank Dr. H.

https://openalex.org/W1994928283,"RPE65 is a membrane-associated protein abundantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium, which converts all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, a key step in the retinoid visual cycle. Although three cysteine residues (Cys-231, Cys-329, and Cys-330) were identified to be palmitylated in RPE65, recent studies showed that a triple mutant, with all three Cys replaced by an alanine residue, was still palmitylated and remained membrane-associated, suggesting that there are other yet to be identified palmitylated Cys residues in RPE65. Here we mapped the entire RPE65 using mass spectrometry analysis and demonstrated that a trypsin-digested RPE65 fragment (residues 98-118), which contains two Cys residues (Cys-106 and Cys-112), was singly palmitylated in both native bovine and recombinant human RPE65. To determine whether Cys-106 or Cys-112 is the palmitylation site, these Cys were separately replaced by alanine. Mass spectrometry analysis of purified wild-type RPE65 and C106A and C112A mutants showed that mutation of Cys-106 did not affect the palmitylation status of the fragment 98-118, whereas mutation of Cys-112 abolished palmitylation in this fragment. Subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry analyses both showed that mutation of Cys-112 dissociated RPE65 from the membrane, whereas the C106A mutant remained associated with the membrane. In vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay showed that C106A has an intact enzymatic activity similar to that of wtRPE65, whereas C112A lost its enzymatic activity. These results indicate that the newly identified Cys-112 palmitylation site is essential for the membrane association and activity of RPE65.

Both rod and cone visual pigments in vertebrates require 11-cis-retinal as the chromophore. Isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal by a photon triggers the phototransduction cascade and initiates vision (1Bridges C.D.B. The Rhodopsin-Porphyropsin System.

Recycling of 11-cis-retinal through the retinoid visual cycle is an essential process for the regeneration of visual pigments and for normal vision (3McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R.

The key step in the visual cycle is to isomerize all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 2The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LRAT, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase; MMTS, methyl-methanethiosulfonate; MS, mass spectrometry; Bistris propane, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.

This isomerization process is known to be catalyzed by an isomerohydrolase in the RPE. Several recent lines of evidence suggest that RPE65 is the isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle (7Moiseyev G.

RPE65 is a microsomal protein, abundantly expressed in the RPE (10Ma J.X. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

RPE65 knock-out (Rpe65-/-) mice showed a lack of 11-cis-retinoids, overaccumulation of all-trans-retinyl ester, impaired visual function, and early degeneration of cone photoreceptors (7Moiseyev G.

RPE65 is an iron(II)-dependent enzyme, in which an iron is coordinated by four conserved histidine (His) residues (His-180, -241, -313, and -527) based on molecular modeling using a crystal structure of apocarotenoid monooxygenase as a template (8Redmond T.M.

Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science.. 2005; 308: 267-269Google Scholar). RPE65 lacks any predicted transmembrane helix and is associated with the microsomal membrane (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 15751-15757Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that membrane association of RPE65 is essential for its isomerohydrolase activity (7Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 12413-12418Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for its membrane association has not been revealed. An earlier study showed that three Cys residues (Cys-231, 329 and 330) in RPE65 were palmitylated, which were suggested to be responsible for its membrane association (16Xue L. Gollapalli D.R. Maiti P. Jahng W.J. Rando R.R. Cell.. 2004; 117: 761-771Google Scholar). However, triple mutations of all the three Cys residues did not completely dissociate RPE65 from the membrane (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar, 18Jin M. Yuan Q. Li S. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20915-20924Google Scholar). Moreover, the triple Cys mutant remains palmitylated (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar). These results suggested that either the site of palmitylation responsible for the membrane association of RPE65 had not yet been identified or other mechanisms, such as hydrophobic interactions, anchor the protein to cellular membranes (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar, 19Trudel E. Beaufils S. Renault A. Breton R. Salesse C. Biochemistry.. 2006; 45: 3337-3347Google Scholar). In this study, we used the combination of mass spectrometric analysis and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the palmitylated site in RPE65. Moreover, we determined the role of this site in the membrane association and enzymatic activity of RPE65. Peptide Generation for MS—Purified native bovine RPE65 (14Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Gentleman S. Redmond T.M. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 2835-2840Google Scholar) as well as recombinant human wild-type RPE65 with a histidine tag (wtRPE65-His), and the mutants with Cys-106 and Cys-112 replaced by alanine fused with a histidine tag, C106A-His and C112A-His, were prepared for MS analysis in the original buffers. Up to 100 μg samples were reduced with 2 μl of 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 60 min at 60 °C and then alkylated with 1 μl of 10 mm methyl-methanethiosulfonate (MMTS; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for 10 min. The protein was then precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (Fisher) at -20 °C for 10 min followed by two washes with water (5 min of centrifugation at 100,000 × g, removal of supernatant) and was then brought up in 5-25 μl of 6 m urea. After solubilization, the protein was diluted with 7× volume of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 10% volume of acetonitrile (Sigma). Thereafter, 10 μl of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, 1 μg/μl) was added and incubated with the sample at 37 °C overnight to cleave the protein. HPLC/MS/MS—Peptide separation from the trypsin cleavage mixture of native bovine RPE65 was performed using a binary HPLC pump system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). These samples were analyzed in normal flow mode (200 μl/min initial flow with a 10:1 split in front of the instrument source) with a narrowbore Brownlee Aquapore C18 reverse phase column (OD-300, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, Bodman Industries, Aston, PA) (for injection, the initial sample was diluted to 3 ml with water). Solvent A was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (Fisher) in HPLC-grade water (Fisher), and solvent B was 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 2:1 isopropyl alcohol/acetonitrile (both from Fisher). The column gradient was from 2% B to 98% B over 90 min. The separation of human recombinant RPE65 peptides was performed on an Ultimate 3000 nanoflow HPLC system (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) at a flow rate of 180 nl/min with a nanobore Vydac C18 reverse phase column (238EV5.07515; 150 mm × 75 μm, Bodman) (10 μl of the final sample was injected). Solvent A was 0.2% formic acid (Fisher) in HPLC-grade water, and solvent B was 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. The column gradient was from 2% B to 98% B over 120 min. The effluent was directed into the Ion Max source (normal flow) or nanospray source (nanoflow) of an LTQ XL ETD linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Mass spectra and five data-dependent tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were collected with Xcalibur version 1.4SR1 software. For MS/MS analysis, dynamic exclusion was used. Bioworks 3.3.1 Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used for data analysis. Construction of wtRPE65 Expression Vector and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human RPE65 cDNA with the Kozak sequence (gccacc (20Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res... 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar)) upstream of the translational start codon was subcloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBluescript SK(+) vector. Cys-106 and Cys-112 were replaced by Ala residue using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. To process efficient purification of wtRPE65 and its mutants for mass spectral analysis, a histidine hexamer tag (His6 tag) was inserted in-frame into the N-terminal region of RPE65 by PCR. The mutants were confirmed by sequencing from both strands using ABI-3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and subcloned into an expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (-) (Invitrogen). Following the sequence confirmations, the expression constructs were purified by QIAfilter maxi prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Expression and Purification of Recombinant wtRPE65 and Its Mutants—For mass spectral analysis, the expression plasmids of wtRPE65-His, C106A-His, and C112A-His were transfected into 293A-LRAT cells, a stable cell line expressing LRAT, which was established previously (13Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett... 2005; 579: 5414-5418Google Scholar), and harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm imidazole, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate was applied onto Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin™ (Novagen, Madison, WI) and washed with 25 ml of washing buffer containing 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm imidazole, and proteinase inhibitors as described above. wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants containing the His6 tag were eluted with the washing buffer containing 400 μm imidazole. When necessary, the purified wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants were concentrated using Microcon YM-10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and/or by dialysis using the Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis unit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:1000 dilution of an anti-RPE65 polyclonal antibody (10Ma J.X. Zhang J. Othersen K.L. Moiseyev G. Ablonczy Z. Redmond T.M. Chen Y. Crouch R.K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2001; 42: 1429-1435Google Scholar). After three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 1.5 h with 1:6700 dilutions of an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in TBST containing 1% nonfat dry milk. After four washes with TBST, the bands were detected using Super Signal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) or Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As needed, the membrane was stripped in the stripping buffer (Pierce) and re-blotted with an antibody specific for β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for loading control. The bands (intensity × area) were semi-quantified by densitometry using GeneTools (SynGene, Frederick, MD), averaged from at least three independent experiments. Subcellular Fractionation of Cultured Cells—The 293A-LRAT cells expressing wtRPE65, C106A, or C112A mutants were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, cells were fractionated into cytosolic, membrane, nuclear, and cytoskeletal (containing inclusion body) fractions using FractionPrep™ (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg of total protein and 5 μg of each fraction) from each fraction were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analyses using a purified antibody for RPE65 to identify the subcellular localization. Immunohistochemistry—The 293A-LRAT cells were cultured in glass chamber slides and transfected separately with wtRPE65, C106A, C112A expression vectors and the empty pcDNA3.1 (mock transfection). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells on the chamber slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Following blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat normal serum, the slides were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of an anti-RPE65 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and 1:300 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker calnexin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After three washes, the slides were incubated with 1:200 dilution of Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Following three washes, the slides were treated with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, San Diego). The fluorescent signals were observed using a Zeiss LSM-510META laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Isomerohydrolase Activity Assay—The 293A-LRAT cells were separately transfected with plasmids expressing wtRPE65, C106A, and C112A. Un-transfected 293A-LRAT cells were used as a negative control. The cells were lysed by sonication in a reaction buffer (10 mm Bistris propane (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl). All-trans-[11,12-3H]retinol (1 mCi/ml, 45.5 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in N,N-dimethyl formamide was used as the substrate for the isomerohydrolase assay. For each reaction, microsomal proteins from the cells were added into 200 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Bistris propane (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.2 μm all-trans-retinol, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 μm cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. The reaction was stopped and retinoids extracted with 300 μl of cold retinol and 300 μl of hexane and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The generated retinoids were analyzed by normal phase HPLC as described. The peak of each retinoid isomer was identified based on its characteristic retention time of retinoid standards. The isomerohydrolase activity was calculated from the area of the 11-cis-retinol peak using Radiomatic 610TR software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with synthetic 11-cis-[3H]retinol as a standard. Identification of the Peptide Fragment Containing the Palmitylated Cys Residue—Purified native bovine RPE65 was digested with trypsin, and the digested peptide fragment mixture was analyzed with HPLC/MS-MS following a methodology developed previously and adapted in our laboratory (22Ablonczy Z. Crouch R.K. Goletz P.W. Redmond T.M. Knapp D.R. Ma J.X. Rohrer B. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 40491-40498Google Scholar). This methodology allows the observation of the entire protein sequence map in a single experiment. RPE65 is a 61-kDa protein with 533 amino acids, producing 52 individual peptide fragments, as well as various incomplete cleavage products after digestion with trypsin. In consequence of the high number of fragments, the individual peptides were identified with the utilization of the TurboSequest search engine. The search engine provides a score for how reliable the identification is (XCorr). The higher XCorr, the more reliable is the identification. This analysis resulted in complete sequence mapping with a minimal score limit of 1.4 XCorr. Palmitylation was identified only in a peptide fragment (amino acids 98-118) and its incomplete cleavage products. The identity of the palmitylated peptide identified by the search engine was also confirmed by de novo sequencing. Moreover, this peptide was not identified as unpalmitylated. Other peptides were not palmitylated above XCorr values of 1.0, below which the identification is not accepted to be reliable and could not be confirmed with de novo sequencing. The cysteine residues, which have previously been reported to be palmitylated (Cys-231, Cys-329, and Cys-330), were positively identified as unpalmitylated with their individual peptides showing XCorr values above 2.0. The sequence for the identified palmitylated peptide (amino acids 98-118, IVITEFGTCAFPDPCKNIFSR) is shown in Fig. 1A. The peptide identified by the search engine was a +2 charge state ion, m/z = 1323.9, with single palmitylation and MMTS label, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 2643.7 Da. The identified mass lines in Fig. 1 are indicated by red and blue coloring, but some of the most abundant ions are also labeled. The observed sequences and the expected b+2 and y+2 fragmentation ions are also shown with the identified ions underlined in Fig. 1, indicating single palmitylation on the peptide fragment. However, this peptide contains two Cys residues, Cys-106 and Cys-112, which can potentially be palmitylated (Table 1). Therefore, it was important to determine the abundance of this peptide versus its unpalmitylated (molecular mass of 2451.5 Da with two MMTS labels) and doubly palmitylated (molecular mass of 2835.9 Da with two S-palmityl cysteines) counterparts. Fig. 1B shows normalized selected ion chromatograms for the corresponding +2 charge state ions. The unpalmitylated peptide (Fig. 1B, top panel) is shown with a low abundance at retention time of 39.5 min, whereas the peptide with single palmitylation formed a distinct peak (Fig. 1B, middle panel). In contrast, the peptide that contained two palmitylated Cys residues (Cys-106 and Cys-112) was not detected above background (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). The position of the peak for the singly palmitylated peptide corresponded to the retention time where the sequence shown in Fig. 1A was identified.TABLE 1Alignment of Cys residues in the RPE65 from different species45106112146169195231278329330396427448HumanCCCCCCCCCCCCCAfrican green monkey.............Bovine...........G.Dog..........RG.Rat...........G.Mouse..........RG.Chicken.Y.......TRG.Tiger salamander.F........RGSJapanese Fireberry newt.F........RGSAfrican clawed frog.F........HGTZebrafishL..V..S..ARN. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of wtRPE65 and the Cys Mutants without or with a His6 Tag—The obtained MS/MS data were not sufficient to unequivocally distinguish between the two Cys residues in the peptide, as the recorded sequence may be a mixture of the two different singly palmitylated peptides. Therefore, to identify whether Cys-106 or Cys-112 is palmitylated and to establish the functional significance of the palmitylation, Cys-106 and Cys-112 were separately replaced by Ala. Human wtRPE65 and the mutants C106A and C112A were expressed in 293A-LRAT cells. To purify wtRPE65 and the mutants efficiently, the His6 tag was inserted at the N terminus of wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants. Expressed wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants fused with the His6 tag were purified through a Ni-NTA column (Fig. 2A). Approximately 66, 120, and 22 μg of wtRPE65-His, C106A-His, and C112A-His were purified from the 5 mg of total cellular protein, respectively, and confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Palmitylation of Cys-106 and Cys-112 in the Recombinant Proteins—Purified wtRPE65, C106A, and C112A were digested with trypsin and used for MS analysis. Although the abundance of these recombinant proteins after purification was less than that of the native bovine RPE65, with the utilization of the nanoflow HPLC system, all of the three recombinant proteins were successfully analyzed by MS and provided complete peptide fragment maps with XCorr values above 1.0. Fig. 3A shows the MS/MS spectrum for the +2 charge state of the 98-118 fragment ion from recombinant human wtRPE65. The data provide evidence of complete sequence coverage for the 98-118 peptide. Cys-106 was not labeled with either iodoacetamide or MMTS, which probably indicates a buried localization of the residue. Palmitylation on Cys-112 is evidenced by the observed sequence ladder and, in particular, by mass lines m/z 574 and m/z 826. The analysis of the peptide (residues 98-118) from the mutants reinforced the observations in native bovine and recombinant human wtRPE65 that this peptide was singly palmitylated. The peptide from the C106A mutant also showed palmitylation on Cys-112 (Fig. 3B) as evidenced by mass lines m/z 770, 941, 593, and 423, although the peptide from the C112A mutant was not palmitylated (Fig. 3C). The Ala substitutions were confirmed in both mutants in the obtained sequences. Additionally, the sequence ladders demonstrated that Lys-113 was acetylated and Thr-101, Thr-105, and Ser-117 were phosphorylated in human wtRPE65 (Fig. 3). These post-translational modifications were not detected in native bovine RPE65. Similar to the native bovine protein, no other cysteine residues in the recombinant RPE65 were found to be palmitylated using the minimal XCorr limit (1.0), and no other sites could be confirmed to be palmitylated with de novo sequencing. Subcellular Localization of wtRPE65 and the Cys Mutants—To evaluate the significance of Cys-106 and Cys-112 residues on membrane association of RPE65, the cells expressing wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants were fractionated and analyzed by Western blot analysis. wtRPE65 predominantly existed in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4A), consistent with our previous reports (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar). Similarly, the C106A mutant was present predominantly in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4, A and B). The C112A mutant, however, almost completely lost its membrane association. The C112A protein was mainly identified in a detergent-insoluble fraction containing the cytoskeleton and inclusion body (Fig. 4, A and B). Immunocytochemistry to Compare the Subcellular Localization of the Mutant Proteins with that of wtRPE65—The subcellular localizations of wtRPE65 and the Cys mutants were further examined by immunocytochemistry using antibodies for RPE65 and for an ER marker. There was no detectable signal in the cells with mock transfection, although ER marker signals were detected (Fig. 5A). wtRPE65 and the C106A mutant both showed a similar distribution of RPE65 signals that were co-localized with the ER membrane marker (Fig. 5, B and C). Under the same conditions, the C112A mutant did not co-localize with the ER membrane marker (Fig. 5D). These results together with subcellular fractionation analysis suggest that wtRPE65 and the C106A mutant presented predominantly in the membrane fraction, but C112A mutant dissociated from the membrane. Impacts of the Cys Mutations on RPE65 Protein Levels and Isomerohydrolase Activities with and without the His6 Tag—wtRPE65 and the mutants C106A and C112A were expressed in 293A-LRAT cells. The protein levels of these mutants were compared with wtRPE65 by Western blot analysis. Both C106A and C112A mutants showed RPE65 levels similar to that of wtRPE65 (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that these mutations did not affect protein expression or stability. However, wtRPE65 and C106A showed robust isomerohydrolase activities as they both generated 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinol in the 293A-LRAT cells that stably express LRAT, whereas in the same cells the C112A mutant did not show any detectable enzymatic activity (Fig. 6, C-E). Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the fusion with the His6 tag could affect the isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65, wtRPE65-His, C106A-His, and C112A-His were separately expressed in 293A-LRAT cells. As shown by Western blot analysis, His-tagged wtRPE65 and the mutants had expression levels similar to that without the His tag (Fig. 6G). The same samples were used for in vitro isomerohydrolase activity assay. wtRPE65-His and C106A-His exhibited robust isomerohydrolase activities, whereas C112A-His showed no detectable enzymatic activity (Fig. 6H), consistent with the results in the proteins without the His tag (see Fig. 6, E and F). RPE65 is the retinoid isomerohydrolase in the visual cycle, a key enzyme for regenerating 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of visual pigment (7Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 12413-12418Google Scholar, 8Redmond T.M. Poliakov E. Yu S. Tsai J.Y. Lu Z. Gentleman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is associated with the microsomal membrane in the RPE (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 15751-15757Google Scholar, 12Bavik C.O. Busch C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 23035-23042Google Scholar). The structural basis responsible for membrane association of RPE65 has not been revealed. Previously, it was reported that three Cys residues (Cys-231, -329, and -330) were palmitylated, which was suggested to be responsible for membrane association of RPE65 (16Xue L. Gollapalli D.R. Maiti P. Jahng W.J. Rando R.R. Cell.. 2004; 117: 761-771Google Scholar). However, we reported previously that a triple Cys mutant, in which all of the three Cys were mutated, is present in the membrane fraction, suggesting the membrane association of RPE65 could not be ascribed to the palmitylation at these three Cys residues (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar). Later, Jin et al. have independently confirmed our finding (18Jin M. Yuan Q. Li S. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20915-20924Google Scholar). Furthermore, Jin et al. reported that Cys-231, -329, and -330 were not palmitylated (18Jin M. Yuan Q. Li S. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20915-20924Google Scholar). These studies suggested that there was a yet unknown palmitylation site responsible for the membrane association of RPE65. This study identified the novel palmitylation site, Cys-112, in RPE65 through MS analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that Cys-112 is essential for membrane association of RPE65 and its enzymatic activity. In search for novel palmitylation sites in RPE65, we utilized a new MS analysis strategy. This strategy is based on observing the sequence of the protein in its entirety. This MS analysis allows us not only to see which peptide is palmitylated but also to confirm at the same time that the peptide is not present in unpalmitylated form and that other peptides are not palmitylated either. Our analyses showed that one of the trypsin-digested fragments (residues 98-118), containing two Cys residues (Cys-106 and -112), was singly palmitylated in both native bovine RPE65 and recombinant human RPE65 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Considering the close locations of these two Cys sites and the relatively low (<2.0) XCorr values, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Cys-106 and Cys-112 individually by Ala, to determine whether Cys-106 or Cys-112 is the palmitylation site. MS analysis of the trypsin fragment (residues 98-118) from the C106A and C112A mutants demonstrated that the peptide from the C106A mutant was singly palmitylated, the same as wtRPE65. In contrast, when Cys-112 was replaced by Ala, the palmitylation in this peptide was lost as shown by MS. These results together support the conclusion that Cys-112 is the palmitylation site in the peptide 98-118. Palmitylation is a common post-translational modification responsible for anchoring proteins to the membrane (23Smotrys J.E. Linder M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2004; 73: 559-587Google Scholar, 24Sefton B.M. Buss J.E. J. Cell Biol... 1987; 104: 1449-1453Google Scholar, 25Linder M.E. Deschenes R.J. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 4311-4320Google Scholar, 26Dietrich L.E. Ungermann C. EMBO Rep... 2004; 5: 1053-1057Google Scholar). However, mutations on the previously reported palmitylation sites, Cys-231, Cys-329, and Cys-330 did not affect membrane association of RPE65, suggesting that Cys-231, Cys-329, and Cys-330 are not essential for membrane association. The previous observation, which reported that Cys-231, -329, and -330 were not palmitylated (18Jin M. Yuan Q. Li S. Travis G.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20915-20924Google Scholar), is now independently confirmed by our experiments. To determine the role of the palmitylation at Cys-112 in the membrane association of RPE65, we have expressed wtRPE65 and the C106A and C112A mutants and determined their subcellular localizations using fractionation and immunocytochemistry analyses. wtRPE65 and the C106A mutant showed similar subcellular distributions, predominantly present in the membrane fraction and co-localized with an ER membrane marker as shown by double immunostaining. This subcellular localization is similar to that of mutants C231A, C329A, and C330A reported previously (17Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci... 2006; 47: 5191-5196Google Scholar). Consistent with the MS results, the C112A mutant almost completely lost its membrane association. This observation is supported by our immunocytochemistry results that showed that C112A is not localized on the ER membrane. These results suggest that palmitylation at Cys-112 is important for membrane association of RPE65. A residue with functionally significant palmitylation should meet two major criteria. First, it should be well conserved among different species. RPE65 has high amino acid sequence homologies among different vertebrates (human versus bovine, 98%; mouse, 94%; chicken, 90%). Key residues essential for its enzymatic activity, such as four His residues forming the iron binding pocket, are perfectly conserved in all of the known RPE65 proteins (13Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett... 2005; 579: 5414-5418Google Scholar). Likewise, in all of the RPE65 sequences analyzed, Cys-112 is perfectly conserved, whereas Cys-106 is not (see Table 1). Second, a palmitylation site responsible for membrane association should be exposed to the surface of proteins. Although the three-dimensional structure of RPE65 has not been revealed, molecular modeling based on the three-dimensional structure of apocarotenoid monooxygenase (15Kloer D.P. Ruch S. Al-Babili S. Beyer P. Schulz G.E. Science.. 2005; 308: 267-269Google Scholar) showed that Cys-112 is located on the surface of RPE65 (see supplemental Fig. 1). These structural features support the role of Cys-112 in membrane association. Although the C106A and C112A mutants showed expression levels similar to that of wtRPE65, the C112A mutant lost its enzymatic activity, whereas C106A retained the intact isomerohydrolase activity of RPE65. Our previous studies have shown that RPE65 utilizes highly hydrophobic all-trans-retinyl esters as its direct substrate (27Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Google Scholar). Membrane association has been considered an important feature of RPE65, which may be essential for RPE65 to access its hydrophobic substrate from LRAT through the membrane (7Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Takahashi Y. Wu B.X. Ma J.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 12413-12418Google Scholar). Dissociation of the C112A mutant from the membrane may contribute to the loss of the enzymatic activity. As shown in cell fractionation analysis, the C112A mutant is predominantly present in the fraction of the cytoskeleton and inclusion body. The mislocalization of this mutant could be ascribed to the loss of membrane association of RPE65, as RPE65 has limited solubility and stability in the cytosol in the absence of detergents. Our previous studies have shown that most of the point mutations of RPE65 destabilized the protein and resulted in a short half-life and, consequently, a lower protein level of RPE65 (13Takahashi Y. Moiseyev G. Chen Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett... 2005; 579: 5414-5418Google Scholar, 28Takahashi Y. Chen Y. Moiseyev G. Ma J.X. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 21820-21826Google Scholar, 29Chen Y. Moiseyev G. Takahashi Y. Ma J.X. FEBS Lett... 2006; 580: 4200-4204Google Scholar). However, C112A showed unchanged protein levels, although it had a disturbed subcellular localization and lacked any enzymatic activity. Therefore, the Cys-112 residue seems not important for RPE65 protein stability. The structural significance of Cys-112 remains to be further analyzed. Download .pdf (1.04 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2095671673,"Background Using gene order as a phylogenetic character has the potential to resolve previously unresolved species relationships. This character was used to resolve the evolutionary history within the genus Prochlorococcus, a group of marine cyanobacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings Orthologous gene sets and their genomic positions were identified from 12 species of Prochlorococcus and 1 outgroup species of Synechococcus. From this data, inversion and breakpoint distance-based phylogenetic trees were computed by GRAPPA and FastME. Statistical support of the resulting topology was obtained by application of a 50% jackknife resampling technique. The result was consistent and congruent with nucleotide sequence-based and gene-content based trees. Also, a previously unresolved clade was resolved, that of MIT9211 and SS120. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to use gene order data to resolve a bacterial phylogeny at the genus level. It suggests that the technique is useful in resolving the Tree of Life."
https://openalex.org/W1979635424,"Besides its well recognized role in lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms, glycerol is involved in the regulation of cellular energy homeostasis via glycerol-3-phosphate, a key metabolite in the translocation of reducing power across the mitochondrial inner membrane with mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here, we report a high rate of gluconeogenesis from glycerol and fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes from Lou/C, a peculiar rat strain derived from Wistar, which is resistant to age- and diet-related obesity. This feature, associated with elevated cellular respiration and cytosolic ATP/ADP and NAD(+)/NADH ratios, was linked to a high expression and activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Interestingly, this strain exhibited high expression and protein content of thyroid hormone receptor, whereas circulating thyroid hormone levels were slightly decreased and hepatic thyroid hormone carrier MCT-8 mRNA levels were not modified. We propose that an enhanced liver thyroid hormone receptor in Lou/C may explain its unique resistance to obesity by increasing fatty acid oxidation and lowering liver oxidative phosphorylation stoichiometry at the translocation of reducing power into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2130177912,"A motor component is pre-requisite to any communicative act as one must inherently move to communicate. To learn to make a communicative act, the brain must be able to dynamically associate arbitrary percepts to the neural substrate underlying the pre-requisite motor activity. We aimed to investigate whether brain regions involved in complex gestures (ventral pre-motor cortex, Brodmann Area 44) were involved in mediating association between novel abstract auditory stimuli and novel gestural movements. In a functional resonance imaging (fMRI) study we asked participants to learn associations between previously unrelated novel sounds and meaningless gestures inside the scanner. We use functional connectivity analysis to eliminate the often present confound of ‘strategic covert naming’ when dealing with BA44 and to rule out effects of non-specific reductions in signal. Brodmann Area 44, a region incorporating Broca's region showed strong, bilateral, negative correlation of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) response with learning of sound-action associations during data acquisition. Left-inferior-parietal-lobule (l-IPL) and bilateral loci in and around visual area V5, right-orbital-frontal-gyrus, right-hippocampus, left-para-hippocampus, right-head-of-caudate, right-insula and left-lingual-gyrus also showed decreases in BOLD response with learning. Concurrent with these decreases in BOLD response, an increasing connectivity between areas of the imaged network as well as the right-middle-frontal-gyrus with rising learning performance was revealed by a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. The increasing connectivity therefore occurs within an increasingly energy efficient network as learning proceeds. Strongest learning related connectivity between regions was found when analysing BA44 and l-IPL seeds. The results clearly show that BA44 and l-IPL is dynamically involved in linking gesture and sound and therefore provides evidence that one of the mechanisms required for the evolution of human communication is found within these motor regions."
https://openalex.org/W2098014088,"Antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2066073049,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is constitutively expressed on leukocytes and was thought to be down-regulated with cell activation. However, this work shows the surprising finding of functional PSGL-1 up-regulation during acute inflammation. PSGL-1 function was studied in our autoperfusion assay, in which blood from a mouse carotid flows through a microchamber coated with a fixed density of P-selectin. Under the inflammatory conditions--uveitis induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide injection--we recorded significantly reduced leukocyte rolling velocity, which suggests PSGL-1 up-regulation; however, flow cytometry showed reduced PSGL-1. When bound leukocytes were released from the vasculature by PSGL-1 blockade, a large peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) population showed elevated PSGL-1, which could account for the reduced PSGL-1 in the remaining unbound population. In the eye, systemic blockade of PSGL-1 with a monoclonal antibody or recombinant soluble PSGL-1 drastically reduced the severe manifestations of uveitis. Furthermore, PSGL-1 blockade was significantly more effective in reducing retinal leukostasis than was P-selectin blockade. Our results provide surprising evidence for functional PSGL-1 up-regulation in PBLs during acute inflammation. The temporal overlap between PSGL-1 and P-selectin up-regulation reveals an as yet unrecognized collaboration between this receptor-ligand pair, increasing efficiency of the first steps of the leukocyte recruitment cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1966655768,"The mammalian protein CutA was first discovered in a search for the membrane anchor of mammalian brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). It was co-purified with AChE, but it is distinct from the real transmembrane anchor protein, PRiMA. CutA is a ubiquitous trimeric protein, homologous to the bacterial CutA1 protein that belongs to an operon involved in resistance to divalent ions (“copper tolerance A”). The function of this protein in plants and animals is unknown, and several hypotheses concerning its subcellular localization have been proposed. We analyzed the expression and the subcellular localization of mouse CutA variants, starting at three in-frame ATG codons, in transfected COS cells. We show that CutA produces 20-kDa (H) and 15-kDa (L) components. The H component is transferred into the secretory pathway and secreted, without cleavage of a signal peptide, whereas the L component is mostly cytosolic. We show that expression of the longer CutA variant reduces the level of AChE, that this effect depends on the AChE C-terminal peptides, and probably results from misfolding. Surprisingly, CutA increased the secretion of a mutant possessing a KDEL motif at its C terminus; it also increased the formation of AChE homotetramers. We found no evidence for a direct interaction between CutA and AChE.

Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In these hetero-oligomers, four catalytic subunits, corresponding to the AChET variant that possesses a C-terminal t peptide (2Massoulié J. Perrier N. Noureddine H. Liang D. Bon S. Chem. Biol. Int. 2008; 175: 30-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are associated with a hydrophobic 20-kDa protein (3Gennari K. Brunner J. Brodbeck U. J.

Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, before the characterization of PRiMA, another protein was identified independently by different groups as a component of AChE preparations purified from mammalian brain (6Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R. Massoulié J. Rosenberry T.L. Krejci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34260-34265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This protein was called CutA because of its homology with a bacterial protein (Cu2+ tolerance A), derived from an operon involved in resistance to copper and other divalent metal ions (8Fong S.-T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CutA apparently exists in all organisms (9Yang J. Yang H. Yan L. Yang L. Yu L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2009; 36: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and although its function is unknown, its structural homology with the bacterial and plant P-II nitrogen regulatory protein suggested a role in signal transduction (10Arnesano F. Banci L. Benvenuti M. Bertini I. Calderone V. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45999-46006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the human brain, it has been proposed to be involved in the proliferation and survival of glial cells (11Takayuki, N., Mikio, K., and Tsumoru, M. (March 2, 1993) European Patent JP 1994056895-A/1Google Scholar). Although CutA was first thought to represent the membrane anchor of AChE, co-expression experiments showed that this was not the case. The presence of both CutA and PRiMA in AChE preparations was established by sequencing tryptic peptides and detection in Western blots by different antibodies; in contrast with PRiMA, CutA was not disulfide-linked to AChE subunits, as shown by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions (7Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R. Massoulié J. Rosenberry T.L. Krejci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34260-34265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of CutA in at least three different preparations of affinity-purified PRiMA-anchored AChE (6Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 7Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R. Massoulié J. Rosenberry T.L. Krejci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34260-34265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it was not possible to demonstrate a direct association between the two proteins. In addition, there is no obvious correlation between the expression of CutA and that of membrane-bound AChE, because CutA is expressed in brain and also in all other mammalian tissues. However, stable transfection with an anti-sense construct designed to block expression of CutA was found to suppress the membrane anchoring of AChE in a murine neuroblastoma cell line, N18TG2 (7Perrier A.L. Cousin X. Boschetti N. Haas R. Chatel J.M. Bon S. Roberts W.L. Pickett S.R. Massoulié J. Rosenberry T.L. Krejci E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34260-34265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unless some other modification occurred during the derivation of this cell line, this suggested that CutA might play a role in the assembly of AChET subunits with PRiMA. The structure of bacterial and mammalian CutA was analyzed by crystallography and found to contain a trimeric core, in both cases (10Arnesano F. Banci L. Benvenuti M. Bertini I. Calderone V. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45999-46006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Savchenko A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Watson J.D. Laskowski R.

Wang A.H.J. Chou S.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Each subunit of CutA contains two cysteines, within the trimeric region. In the trimer, the cysteines are distant from each other and cannot form intra- or intercatenary disulfide bonds. It was suggested that CutA might play a role in the control of oxidoreduction in the cell (10Arnesano F. Banci L. Benvenuti M. Bertini I. Calderone V. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45999-46006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular localization of CutA has not been firmly established. Transcripts encoding CutA present alternative 5′ regions; the splicing pattern is more complex in the human than in the mouse, but in both cases one variant contains three in-frame ATG codons, and reports differ on the identity of the translation initiation site. A CutA protein starting at the first methionine might contain a secretion signal peptide, but the prediction is ambiguous. Alternatively, a recent immunofluorescence study concluded that CutA is imported into mitochondria (9Yang J. Yang H. Yan L. Yang L. Yu L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2009; 36: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the subcellular localization of CutA and the effect of its expression on the synthesis and fate of AChE. We present evidence that CutA is partly cytosolic and partly secreted, some of it retaining its N-terminal peptide. In addition we show that co-expression with CutA influences the trafficking of AChE in the secretory pathway and the assembly of AChE oligomers. cDNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All constructs were expressed in the pEF-Bos vector (14Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 15Legay C. Bon S. Vernier P. Coussen F. Massoulié J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel et al. (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Rat AChET subunits were tagged with an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA), inserted before the stop codon at the C terminus of the t peptide of rat AChET. Transfection and Culture of COS Cells and Treatment with Metabolic Inhibitors—COS cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (17Bon S. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3007-3015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using up to 2 μg of pEF-BOS vector per 60-mm dish. After transfection, COS cells were incubated for 3–4 days at 37 °C in a medium containing 10% Nuserum (Inotech, Dottikon, Switzerland), which had been pretreated with 10-6 m soman to inactivate serum cholinesterases. In some experiments, transfected COS cells were treated with an inhibitor of secretion, brefeldin A (30 μg/ml), or with inhibitors of proteasomal degradation MG132 (10 μm) and clasto-β-lactacystin (50 μm). They were incubated for 8 h with brefeldin A or overnight with the proteasome inhibitors before collection of the culture medium and cells. To study the degradation of cellular proteins, synthesis was blocked with 0.4 mg/ml cycloheximide. Extracts from Transfected COS Cells—Three days after transfection, the cells were collected and homogenized in the extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm MgCl2) containing 2.5 mm benzamidine, a protease inhibitor, at 20 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, for 10 min at 4 °C. The culture media were also collected and centrifuged for analysis of secreted proteins. Subcellular Fractionations—For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, transfected COS cells were first washed in the culture dish with 1 ml of PBS and then treated on ice with 1 ml per 60-mm dish of 150 μg/ml digitonin (in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 110 mm K+ acetate, 2 mm MgCl2) for 6 min. The supernatant containing cytosolic proteins was collected, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS. They were then treated with 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. For preparation of a mitochondrial fraction, we used the Qproteome mitochondria isolation kit from Qiagen, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed in 0.9% NaCl, pelleted at 1,000 × g, and resuspended in the “disruption buffer” to release cytosolic proteins. A 1,000 × g pellet containing nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells was discarded. Following a subsequent 6,000 × g centrifugation, the supernatant contained the microsomal fraction, and the pellet containing the mitochondria was resuspended in a “mitochondrial purification buffer” and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial fraction was then pelleted three times in the “storage buffer” and finally resuspended in the extraction buffer, as above, for Western blot analyses. Determination of AChE Activity—AChE activity was determined by the colorimetric method of Ellman et al. (18Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar), using acetylthiocholine as substrate. Enzyme samples (usually 10 μl) were added to 0.2 ml of Ellman assay medium, and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm with a Labsystems Multiskan RC automatic plate reader (Helsinki, Finland); the optical density was recorded at 20-s intervals over a period of 10 min. Under those conditions, 1 mOD corresponds to the hydrolysis of 22.5 pmol of acetylthiocholine. Sedimentation Analysis in Sucrose Gradients—For sedimentation analyses of AChE molecular forms, 100–400-μl samples were mixed with Escherichia coli β-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, as internal sedimentation markers, layered onto 5–20% sucrose gradients (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 20 mm MgCl2, containing either 1% Brij-97 or 0.2% Triton X-100), and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 36,000 rpm, for 17 h 30 min at 6 °C. Fractions of ∼100 μl were collected and assayed for AChE, β-galactosidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities, as described previously (19Noureddine H. Schmitt C. Liu W.Q. Garbay C. Massoulié J. Bon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3487-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western Blots—For analysis of proteins by Western blotting, samples were submitted to electrophoresis in 10 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. We used colored proteins as mass standards (PAGE regular prestained protein ladder SM0671 from Fermentas and HiMark prestained high molecular weight protein standards LC5699 from Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, proteins from the gel were electroblotted with the Bio-Rad mini-Protean II transblot system onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h 30 min. After transfer, the membrane was saturated with 5% milk powder in a buffer containing Tween 20 (20 mm Tris-HCl; 137 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20; pH 7.6) for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 16 °C with appropriate antibodies. The rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody and the anti-FLAG M2 and anti-TOM-22 mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal anti-BiP antibody was from BD Biosciences. These antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution. The secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies, from Jackson ImmunoResearch, were used at 1:10,000 dilution. The immunocomplexes were visualized using the ECL method (Supersignal West Pico kit, from Pierce). Exposure time was usually 1–5 min. Cross-linking of CutA Oligomers—A 100 mm stock solution of the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) from Pierce was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Transfected COS cells were washed in PBS and then incubated in the culture dish at 20 °C for 2 h with PBS containing 1.5 mm DSS. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 20 °C. The cells were then washed in PBS, scraped from the dish, and extracted with the extraction buffer, as above. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Protein bands were excised manually from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, collected, and stored in microtubes containing 1% acetic acid before analysis. After reduction (10 mm dithiothreitol; 100 mm NH4HCO3) and protein alkylation (55 mm iodoacetamide; 100 mm NH4HCO3), the samples were digested with 9–12 ng/μl trypsin (Roche Applied Science), for 2 h at 37 °C, in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2 (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Proteolytic peptides were solubilized in 10 μl of 2% aqueous formic acid (v/v), desalted, and concentrated using a ZipTip® C18 microcolumn (Millipore, Molsheim, France). For MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, 0.3 μl of each sample was deposited with 0.6 ml of a CHCA matrix solution (acetonitrile/H2O, 6:4 v/v, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid v/v). MS analysis was performed with a 4800 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applera Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the positive ion reflectron mode, and MS/MS data were obtained using 2 keV of collision energy. External calibration was achieved with a standard peptide mix (Proteomix peptide mix4, LaserBioLabs, Sophia Antipolis, France). Autolysis products of trypsin were used for internal calibration. The top seven peptides were selected automatically for the MS/MS analysis. GPS Explorer™ software version 2.0 (Applera Applied Biosystems) was used to create and search files. Data were searched against Swissprot from UniProtKB release 9.6 using Mascot 2.2 (Matrixscience). Search parameters were as follows: 2 miscleavages, taxonomy restricted on Mus musculus, accuracy 50 ppm in MS, 0.3 Da in MS/MS, oxidation of methionines, and carbamidomethylation of cysteines. Validation was performed manually using an in-house data base containing the sequences of the specific constructions of interest, and considering N-terminal acetylation as an additional potential modification. Human and Mouse CutA Variants—Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the human and mouse genes encoding the CutA isoforms/variants. These isoforms possess a very conserved region involved in the formation of a trimer and differ only by their N-terminal regions, within each species. Human CutA presents three isoforms, one of which has no equivalent in the mouse. The shorter of the other two isoforms, which exist in both species, is contained in the longer one but starts at a downstream methionine encoded by a different exon (Fig. 1B); in the mouse, the corresponding methionines are Met1 and Met24 (the residues are numbered according to the longer protein) (Fig. 1C). A downstream in-frame ATG codon, encoding Met44, is located in the same exon and might also serve as a translation initiation site (6Navaratnam D.S. Fernando F.S. Priddle J.D. Giles K. Clegg S.M. Pappin D.J. Craig I. Smith A.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in some transcripts, the ATG codons corresponding to these methionines are preceded by upstream ATGs, which are not in-frame with the CutA coding sequence, and are therefore not considered as translation initiation sites (Fig. 1A). In this study, we focused on the mouse CutA isoforms, and we considered three possible variants, starting at the three inframe methionines, Met1, Met24, and Met44, that precede the trimerization domain. To study the production and distribution of CutA, we transfected COS cells with mouse CutA containing FLAG or HA epitopes at the N- and C-terminal extremities (Fig. 1D). As indicated in Fig. 1D, we mutated the three ATG codons in the 5′ region of the coding sequence, as well as the two conserved cysteines of CutA, and added an endoplasmic retention motif at the C terminus (KDEL). Expression of Endogenous and Transfected CutA in COS Cells and Heavy and Light Components—Using CutA-specific primers, RT-PCR analysis of mRNA from untransfected COS cells produced an amplimer corresponding to peptide 49–99 from Macaca CutA (data not shown), which is identical to the corresponding fragment of human CutA (Fig. 1, A and C). This indicates that CutA is endogenously expressed in the simian COS cells, in agreement with its ubiquitous tissue distribution (9Yang J. Yang H. Yan L. Yang L. Yu L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2009; 36: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The endogenous Macaca CutA protein could be recognized by an antiserum directed against an N-terminal and a C-terminal peptide of mouse CutA, whereas the transfected mouse CutA was labeled with N-terminal or C-terminal epitopes (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed a heavy band (H, 20 kDa), which was recognized by antibodies directed against both N- and C-terminal epitopes, and a light band (L, 15 kDa), which was only recognized by antibodies against C-terminal epitopes. The endogenous proteins were not detected in the medium, because of the poor sensitivity of our antibodies, but the epitope-tagged bands were readily observed in the culture medium as well as in cell extracts; the heavy band was predominant in cell extracts and the light band in the medium. The fact that we obtained the same pattern in the cell extracts for the transfected and endogenous proteins shows that the production of both H and L proteins represents a normal processing of CutA and not an aberrant consequence of overexpression. Both heavy and light bands contain the C terminus of CutA, because they were labeled by antibodies against the anti-C-terminal peptide and against a C-terminal HA epitope (Fig. 2). In contrast, an N-terminal FLAG epitope was found only in the heavy band. Therefore, the heavy band (H) represents the full-length protein, starting at Met1, whereas the light band (L) does not contain the N-terminal region. The fact that it was not recognized by an antibody directed against the 44–57 peptide indicates that the cleavage probably occurs downstream of the third methionine (Met44). Mass spectrometry showed that the heavy bands from the N- and C-terminal flagged CutA contain the corresponding N-terminal peptides, MDYKDDDDKNWAR and MNWAR, cleaved by trypsin after the first arginine (Arg5). In both cases, the N-terminal methionine was N-acetylated, which may reflect a metabolic stabilization. These peptides were not found in the light bands under identical experimental conditions. In the culture medium, an N-flagged heavy band could be detected by Western blots. This implies that the longer CutA variant can be secreted without cleavage of an N-terminal signal peptide, as discussed below. Effect of Mutations of the Three Potential In-frame Translation Initiation Sites on the Production and Secretion of Long and Short Variants—The presence of heavy and light components of CutA in the cells and in the medium raised two questions related to the presence of three in-frame ATG codons encoding methionines Met1, Met24, and Met44 (Fig. 1C). First, could several variants of CutA be produced by alternative usage of these potential translation initiation sites? Second, would any of these possible alternative proteins possess a secretory signal peptide? The full-length CutA, starting at methionine Met1, is predicted to possess a secretory signal peptide with a probability of 0.99 by the SignalP 3.0 server, and the mature protein would start either at Arg33 or Ser48, as indicated in Fig. 1C, but the scores assigned to these potential cleavage sites are much lower than for conventional secreted proteins such as AChE (0.13 versus 0.84). A protein starting at Met24 is also predicted to possess a secretory signal peptide, with a cleavage site before Ser48 (although its score is also low, 0.34) so that the first two possible translation start sites might produce the same final mature protein. In contrast, a protein starting at Met44 is not predicted to possess a secretory signal peptide. The presence of FLAG or HA epitopes, added immediately after Met1, does not affect the predicted probability of a signal peptide or the cleavage position. To assess the possible use of the ATG codons for initiation of translation, we mutated them individually and in pairs, in constructs containing a C-terminal HA epitope. The first ATG was mutated to a stop codon, to avoid the possible use of an upstream initiation site, and the downstream ones to serine codons. The resulting mutants were designated according to presence or absence of ATG codons at each position: CutA(24,44), CutA(1,44), CutA(1,24), CutA(1), CutA(24), CutA(44), and CutA(-). Note that CutA(24,44) corresponds to the splice variant 2 (Fig. 1, B and C). Western blots corresponding to these mutants are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the CutA(-) mutant, lacking all three ATGs, was not found to produce any CutA-related protein, in agreement with the fact that the codons corresponding to the other two methionines of CutA (Met149 and Met150) are preceded by out of frame ATGs. We find that the heavy component (20 kDa) was produced only by mutants containing the first ATG (CutA(1,44), CutA(1,24), and CutA(1)), whereas others produced only lighter components. The mutant possessing only the first ATG (CutA(1)) produced mostly the heavy component, but also some light component, both in the cells and in the medium (Fig. 3). This shows that the L components may result from post-translational proteolytic cleavage of the full-length H protein. The fact that similar L components were obtained with CutA(24) and CutA(44) suggests that they may also be produced by the use of the downstream ATGs. A post-translational cleavage of these shorter proteins might explain why the L components produced by the different CutA mutants appear very similar or identical. Initiation of the translation at the second or third ATGs appears likely because the level of the L component was markedly higher for the wild type CutA, possessing its three ATGs, than with CutA(1), possessing only the first one. In addition, the CutA(1) and CutA(24) mutants were produced about five times less than the wild type, whereas the cellular level of CutA(44) was about 20-fold higher than that of CutA(1). This may reflect different rates of protein translation, because the third ATG may be a more efficient initiation start site. Whereas none of the three possible translation initiation codons is included in a classical Kozak consensus environment ((A/G)CCATGG) (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), only the third one is followed by a G. However, mutating nucleotides around the first ATG (TGGATGC to AGCATGG) only increased the level of cellular CutA(1) about 3-fold (not shown), far from that obtained for CutA(44). Fig. 3 shows that all mutant CutA proteins were released in the medium as follows: about 1.5% of the cell content per h for CutA and CutA(1), 0.2% for CutA(24), and 0.1% for CutA(44). This is markedly lower than the release of AChET (about 15%/h). The heavy component (H) was found in the medium, for CutA as well as for mutants containing the first ATG start codon (CutA(1), CutA(1,24), and CutA(1,44)), but the light component (L) was predominant. Because the release of the heavy component occurs without cleavage of a signal peptide, it might reflect a leakage from damaged cells. We therefore examined the effect of brefeldin A, an inhibitor of secretion. After 8 h of incubation with brefeldin A, the cellular level of CutA did not change significantly, but we observed an additional component slightly heavier than the H band and a weak reduction of the secreted protein (Fig. 4). We also studied a CutA mutant to which we added a C-terminal KDEL peptide, downstream of the HA epitope (CutAHA-KDEL). The cellular level of this mutant was lower than that of CutAHA, and the fraction of cellular content released per h was not reduced, perhaps because the KDEL motif did not act as a functional endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, as discussed below in the case of AChE mutants (Fig. 10, A and B). However, both heavy and light bands formed by CutAHA-KDEL appeared as doublets in Western blots (Fig. 4). The heavier components, with an apparent mass about 2 kDa higher than the H and L bands observed for the wild type, probably resulted from a post-translational modification because H corresponds to the full-length protein.FIGURE 10AChE mutants possessing a C-terminal KDEL motif; effect of CutA on the cellular and secreted activities.

https://openalex.org/W2033444808,"Body pattern formation during early embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster relies on a zygotic cascade of spatially restricted transcription factor activities. The gap gene Krüppel ranks at the top level of this cascade. It encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein that interacts directly with cis-acting stripe enhancer elements of pair rule genes, such as even skipped and hairy, at the next level of the gene hierarchy. Krüppel mediates their transcriptional repression by direct association with the corepressor Drosophila C terminus-binding protein (dCtBP). However, for some Krüppel target genes, deletion of the dCtBP-binding sites does not abolish repression, implying a dCtBP-independent mode of repression. We identified Krüppel-binding proteins by mass spectrometry and found that SAP18 can both associate with Krüppel and support Krüppel-dependent repression. Genetic interaction studies combined with pharmacological and biochemical approaches suggest a site-specific mechanism of Krüppel-dependent gene silencing. The results suggest that Krüppel tethers the SAP18 bound histone deacetylase complex 1 at distinct enhancer elements, which causes repression via histone H3 deacetylation.

However, for some Krüppel target genes, deletion of the dCtBP-binding sites does not abolish repression, implying a dCtBP-independent mode of repression. We identified Krüppel-binding proteins by mass spectrometry and found that SAP18 can both associate with Krüppel and support Krüppel-dependent repression. Genetic interaction studies combined with pharmacological and biochemical approaches suggest a site-specific mechanism of Krüppel-dependent gene silencing. The results suggest that Krüppel tethers the SAP18 bound histone deacetylase complex 1 at distinct enhancer elements, which causes repression via histone H3 deacetylation. Kr (Krüppel) is an essential gene of the segmentation gene hierarchy in Drosophila melanogaster. It encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein necessary for the formation of thoracic and abdominal body parts of the embryo (1Gaul U. Jäckle H. Adv. Genet... 1990; 27: 239-275Google Scholar, 2Jäckle H.

Nature.. 1985; 313: 703-706Google Scholar). Kr is expressed in the central region of the embryo where it controls transcription of pair rule genes, such as eve (even skipped) and h (hairy) (4Pankratz M.J. Jäckle H. Trends Genet... 1990; 6: 287-292Google Scholar, 5Pankratz M.J. Seifert E. Gerwin N. Billi B. Nauber U. Jäckle H. Cell.. 1990; 61: 309-317Google Scholar). The Kr protein (Kr) binds to multiple specific DNA-binding sites (6Pankratz M.J. Hoch M. Seifert E. Jäckle H. Nature.. 1989; 341: 337-340Google Scholar, 7Stanojevic D. Hoey T. Levine M. Nature.. 1989; 341: 331-335Google Scholar) within distinct cis-acting stripe elements of pair rule genes and provides repression in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, Kr functions later in embryogenesis by acting as a key regulator of multiple developmental genes necessary for the formation of various organs (8Hartmann C. Landgraf M. Bate M. Jäckle H. EMBO J.. 1997; 16: 5299-5309Google Scholar, 9Hoch M. Jäckle H. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 5766-5775Google Scholar, 10Hoch M. Schröder C. Seifert E. Jäckle H.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of Kr in imaginal eye discs interferes with their normal development by causing an Irregular facet gain-of-function phenotype (12Abrell S. Carrera P. Jäckle H. Chromosoma.. 2000; 109: 334-342Google Scholar, 13Carrera P. Abrell S. Kerber B. Walldorf U. Preiss A. Hoch M. Jäckle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 10779-10784Google Scholar). The available evidence suggests that Kr acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar, 15Sauer F. Jäckle H.

Genes Dev... 1991; 5: 827-839Google Scholar, 18Stanojevic D. Small S. Levine M. Science.. 1991; 254: 1385-1387Google Scholar) and is likely to control several hundred target genes (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar, 19Berman B.P. Nibu Y. Pfeiffer B.D. Tomancak P. Celniker S.E. Levine M. Rubin G.M. Eisen M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 757-762Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Kr-dependent transcriptional repression is still not fully understood. Initial in vitro studies showed that Kr is capable of forming concentration-dependent homodimers that interact with the basal transcriptional machinery and prevent transcription (20Sauer F. Fondell J.D. Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G. Jäckle H. Nature.. 1995; 375: 162-164Google Scholar). Although this mechanism would explain a concentration-dependent action of Kr, its relevance for in vivo action of Kr has not yet been demonstrated. A second mechanism of Kr-dependent repression rests on multiple and overlapping DNA-binding sites for activators within the enhancer region of target genes. In this context, binding of Kr can compete for binding of activators and thereby prevent gene activation (21La Rosee A. Häder T. Taubert H. Rivera-Pomar R. Jäckle H. EMBO J.. 1997; 16: 4403-4411Google Scholar, 22Nibu Y. Senger K. Levine M. Mol. Cell Biol... 2003; 23: 3990-3999Google Scholar). Finally, the C terminus of Kr contains functional binding sites for the corepressor dCtBP (22Nibu Y. Senger K. Levine M. Mol. Cell Biol... 2003; 23: 3990-3999Google Scholar, 23Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Google Scholar) and acts as a repressor via distinct cis-acting enhancers such as the eve stripe 2. In the absence of the dCtBP-binding sites, eve stripe 2 expression cannot be repressed by Kr, and thus, the expression domain extends into the Kr expression domain. Conversely, overexpression of Kr throughout the blastoderm embryo causes repression of eve stripe 2 expression, whereas overexpression of mutant Kr lacking the dCtBP-binding sites has no such effect. Although the dCtBP-dependent repression by Kr is firmly established, the mechanism of this type of repression is not yet elucidated. In contrast to the eve stripe 2 enhancer, dCtBP does not seem to be necessary for Kr-dependent regulation of the h stripe 7 enhancer. Overexpression of Kr in maternal dCtBP mutant embryos still represses h stripe 7 expression (24La Rosee-Borggreve A. Häder T. Wainwright D. Sauer F. Jäckle H. Mech. Dev... 1999; 89: 133-140Google Scholar), suggesting that there must be an additional and dCtBP-independent repressor function of Kr. To seek a factor that confers this missing repressor function on Kr and to elucidate the mechanism of this type of repressor action, we performed a protein-protein interaction screen to identify proteins that associate with Kr. We found dSAP18, a protein that is known to associate with components of the histone deacetylase complex 1 (dHDAC1) 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; CtBP, C terminus-binding protein; ESI-MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PepSpot, peptide spot; TSA, trichostatin A; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; xChIP, cross-linked ChIP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. (25Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell.. 1997; 89: 357-364Google Scholar). The results suggest that Kr participates in the site-specific deacetylation of histone 3 at the h stripe 7 element but not at the eve stripe 2 enhancer. We propose a model in which DNA-bound Kr associates with dSAP18 and thereby tethers dHDAC1 at the respective loci to silence target genes by local histone deacetylation. Fly Genetics—The following fly stocks were used: bprcnwx KrIf-1 (Tübingen stock collection), the balancers y,w; Sco/CyO, P(hb-lacZ) and y,w; Ly/TM3, Sb, and hs-Kr/CyO, P(hb-lacZ); h7-lacZ (for details see Ref. 24La Rosee-Borggreve A. Häder T. Wainwright D. Sauer F. Jäckle H. Mech. Dev... 1999; 89: 133-140Google Scholar). The +/CyO, P(hb-lacZ); h7-lacZ fly stock was generated from hs-Kr/CyO, P(hb-lacZ); h7-lacZ and y w; Ly/TM3, Sb flies to obtain the genotype +/CyO, P(hb-lacZ); h7-lacZ. The P element insertion G13322 (dsap18 w+,EP) was obtained from the GenExel fly stock center. sap18R7–18/TM3, ftz-lacZ and sap18-14/TM3, ftz-lacZ and the dSap18 rescue stock y w; P(y+ dSap18 on the II-chr.); sap18R7–18 were described earlier (26Singh N. Zhu W. Hanes S.D. Dev. Biol... 2005; 278: 242-254Google Scholar). Germ line clones (27Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics.. 1992; 131: 643-653Google Scholar, 28Chou T.B. Perrimon N. Genetics.. 1996; 144: 1673-1679Google Scholar) homozygous for sap18-14 were generated as described (26Singh N. Zhu W. Hanes S.D. Dev. Biol... 2005; 278: 242-254Google Scholar) involving sap18-14/ovoD1 virgins that were mated to sap18-14/TM3, ftz-lacZ or hs-Kr/CyO, P(hb-lacZ); h7-lacZ males. Liquid Chromatography-coupled ESI-MS/MS—Proteins were excised from SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin (29Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem... 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar), and subjected to analysis by HPLC-coupled ESI-MS/MS. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS was carried out under standard conditions on a hybrid triple quadruple/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (4000 Qtrap; Applied Biosystems) coupled to an Agilent 1100 nanochromatography system (30Deckert J. Hartmuth K. Boehringer D. Behzadnia N. Will C.L. Kastner B. Stark H. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell Biol... 2006; 26: 5528-5543Google Scholar). Peptide fragment spectra were searched in the NCBInr data base using Mascot as search engine. Mass accuracy was 1.4 Da and 400 milli-mass units, respectively, for samples analyzed on the linear ion trap. The peptides were constrained to be tryptic with a maximum of one missed cleavage site. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines and oxidation of methionine residues were considered as variable modifications. The highest scoring peptide from each protein as well as single hit peptides were manually inspected to eliminate the false positives in the data set. PepSpot™ Microarray Analysis and in Vitro Translation Assay—Cellulose-bound peptide arrays (31Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods.. 2002; 267: 13-26Google Scholar) were prepared by JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (Berlin, Germany). One peptide array (PepSpot39) contained 39 spots of 14-mer peptides representing the Krüppel protein (amino acids 301–502; see Fig. 1A) with seven amino acid overlaps. A second peptide array (PepSpot54) contained 54 species of partially overlapping 16-mer peptides representing the full-length Krüppel sequence with an overlap length of four amino acids (supplemental Table S1). To prevent oxidation of SH groups, cysteine residues of the PepSpot54 array were replaced by serines. In Vitro Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled full-length dSAP18 was produced from the pETWZ1 plasmid (32Zhu W. Hanes S.D. Gene (Amst.).. 2000; 245: 329-339Google Scholar) using the TnT® T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega; L1170) supplemented with Redivue® PRO-MIX 35S label (65 Mbq, 1.75 mCi of methionine; Amersham). Prior to incubation with membranes, the 35S-labeled dSAP18 (80 μl) was diluted five times in TBS buffer (10 mm of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and filtered through a Durapore® membrane (Ultrafree®-MC, 0.22 micron; Millipore). Unincorporated [35S]methionine and low molecular weight solutes were removed by ultrafiltration using the regenerated cellulose filter (Microcon YM-10; 10,000 molecular weight cut-off) at 4,000 rpm. The PepSpot membranes were blocked with the blocking buffer (Sigma) to minimize nonspecific binding of dSAP18. Autoradiographs were obtained after exposure for 40 h, followed by scanning with the Typhoon™ 8600 laser-scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Signal quantification was done with a QuantityOne™ software tool (Bio-Rad). As a control, dSAP18 was tagged with an N-terminal His6 epitope and expressed in a coupled TnT in vitro system as described above (except that nonradioactive methionine was added) using the pETWZ2 plasmid as a template. The peptide spots bound by the His6-dSAP18 were visualized by mouse monoclonal anti-His6 primary antibodies (DIA900; Dianova) followed by goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody detection (Pierce). Enhanced luminescence was recorded by CCD-based Lumi-Imager™ (Roche Applied Science). Heat Shock and TSA Treatments—Embryos were collected (100 min; 23 °C) from flies bearing a single Kr cDNA transgene under control of the heat-inducible hsp70 promoter balanced over a CyO balancer chromosome carrying a hb-lacZ transgene (second chromosome) and two h7-lacZ transgenes (third chromosome). The embryos were aged (20 or 60 min; 23 °C), dechorionated, and permeabilized (20–30 s) with octane (Fluka) (33Strecker T.R. McGhee S. Shih S. Ham D. Biotech. Histochem... 1994; 69: 25-30Google Scholar) and incubated in a 30 μm TSA (Biomol; dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) solution of 1× phosphate-buffered saline solution. Control embryos were treated in parallel but without TSA. The embryos were either exposed to 37 °C (30–60 min) or kept at room temperature (23 °C). After recovery (20 min; 23 °C), the embryos were fixed (in situ hybridization) or snap-frozen (liquid nitrogen, RNA isolation, Western blot analysis). For heat shock-induced Kr expression in maternal dSAP18 mutant embryos, the embryos were collected from a cross of females with homozygous dSAP18 mutant germ lines and males bearing the hs-Kr and h7-lacZ transgenes. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization and Antibody Staining—lacZ and eve expression were examined by in situ hybridization to whole mount preparations using antisense RNA probes as described (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar). Kr expression was monitored by staining embryos with rabbit-raised anti-Kr antiserum followed by staining with goat anti-rabbit Cy2-conjugated fluorescent antibody (Dianova). For chromatin immunoprecipitation, affinity-purified anti-acetyl K9,14histone 3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Millipore-Upstate) were used. Western blots and PepSpot39 binding assays were performed with anti-His6 mouse monoclonal antibody (Dianova). Affinity-purified anti-histone H2A serum, anti-acetylK9, and anti-acetylK14 histone 3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Millipore-Upstate) were used for quantitative Western blot experiments. Goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody and goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Pierce) were employed as secondary antibodies. For in situ detection of protein and digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes, we used anti-Kr rabbit polyclonal antiserum, goat anti-rabbit Cy2-conjugated antibodies (Dianova), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche Applied Science), sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and donkey anti-sheep IgG biotinylated antibodies. In Silico Analysis and Statistical Methods—In silico prediction of nucleosome patterns at the h stripe 7 and eve stripe 2 elements (including the respective 10-kb flanking regions) were carried out using the available nucleosome/DNA interaction models (34Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thastrom A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature.. 2006; 442: 772-778Google Scholar) and the Genomica software tool. To test the significance of differences between medians representing relative enrichment factors as revealed by xChIP analysis via semi-quantitative PCR, the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric statistical test was used (Analyze-it®, standard edition, v.2.03, Analyze-it Software, Ltd.). In Vitro Pulldown Experiments—GST-(N)Kr2–502 aa. fusion protein was produced as described (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar). Constructs expressing different fragments of Kr fused N-terminally to the GST moiety were produced using primer pairs containing either EcoRI (forward primers) or XhoI (reverse primers) sites (supplemental Table S2) for cloning into the pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Kr sequences were fused N-terminally to GST via the thrombin sensitive linker. The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 bacterial cells (see Ref. 14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar) to produce the respective GST-Kr fusions. The proteins were purified by binding to GSH-Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) and washed under moderate stringency conditions (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% glycerol). The amount of GSH-Sepharose for binding was adjusted to yield resins containing GST-Kr (concentration of 1 mg/ml). Fusion protein was covalently fixed to the affinity resin (homobifunctional imidoester cross-linker, dimethyl adipimidate; Pierce) and processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Drosophila S2 Schneider cells were grown to confluency (0.5–1 × 108 cells), harvested into a 50-ml Falcon tube, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cross-linked with 10 mm of dimethyl adipimidate (room temperature). The cells were disrupted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 5% glycerol, and 1 mm of dithiothreitol) by sonication with ultrasound (five bursts; 30 s each). Triton X-100 was added to 0.05%. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Lysate was passed through the sterile filter (pore size, 0.2 μm). Prior to incubation with the GST-Kr-bound resins, the lysates were depleted of GST-interacting molecules by three incubations with excess amounts of the GST-bound resin. Resins loaded with GST-Kr fusion protein were incubated with preconditioned lysate (2 h, 4 °C, constant agitation), collected by a short spin, and washed with several changes of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture). GST-Kr bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 100 mm of glycine, pH 2.5, precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma), flushed with 100% acetone (-20 °C), air-dried, redissolved in the Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were stained with fluorescent dye SYPROR Ruby (Molecular Probes, S-12000), visualized by the Lumi-Imager™ (Roche Applied Science), and processed for mass spectrometry. His6-dSAP18 (amino acid region 11–150) fusion protein was produced in the E. coli BL21 cells using a pET28a-vector. His-tagged fusion protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose CL-6B matrix (Qiagen). For pulldown assays, 4 μg of imidazol-eluted protein was incubated with 15-μl resin aliquots loaded with 15 μg of either GST or GST-Kr. Incubations were carried out in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) containing 3% bovine serum albumin as nonspecific competitor (2 h, 4 °C). After incubation, resins were centrifuged and washed five times with binding buffer. The proteins were eluted (boiling in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer) and separated by 13.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (anti-His6 mouse monoclonal antibodies, DIA900; Dianova), visualized by goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce). Enhanced luminescence was induced using SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). The signals were visualized on Kodak BioMax XAR film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Semi-quantitative PCR—Chromatin was prepared from ∼500 μl of 110–230-min-old embryos. Immunoprecipitations of cross-linked chromatin (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar) were carried out with affinity-purified anti-acetyl K9,14histone 3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Millipore-Upstate; about 3000 ng/ml). 100 μl of Affi-Prep® protein A support beads (Bio-Rad) were used to adsorb the antibody-chromatin complexes from 10 ml of immunoprecipitation solution, resulting in between 300 and 500 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA/500 μl of embryos. Primers to amplify h stripe 7, eve stripe 2 or dSec23 sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2. To estimate enrichment of full-length sequences of the eve2 (772 bp) and h7 (799 bp) enhancers, as well as the quantification of the small genomic fragments (sizes around 200 bp; see Fig. 5, C and D), semi-quantitative PCR was performed as described (14Matyash A. Chung H.R. Jäckle H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 30689-30696Google Scholar). The relative enrichment (vertical axis values in the Fig. 5, D and G) was calculated as (w/x)/(y/z), where w is the ChIP target fragment, x is the ChIP reference fragment, y is the input target fragment, z is the input reference, and all values are the sums of pixel intensities for each band (local background was subtracted). The numbers reflect the relative immunoprecipitation efficiency; values less than 1 are not unexpected. The increased acetylation in response to TSA (Fig. 5E, gray bars) was calculated as [(w/x)/(y/z)]with TSA/[(w/x)/(y/z)]no TSA. The relative sensitivity to sonication (Fig. 5E, black bars) was calculated as (y/z)no TSA/(y/z)with TSA. To increase the range of the exponential amplification phase, PCR was paused after 18 cycles of the following conditions: 40 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 54 °C, and 90 s (600–900-bp fragments) or 30 s (200-bp fragments) at 72 °C. The reaction mix was diluted twice with freshly activated 1× PCR Mastermix (total volume, 50 μl) prior to adding 12 cycles (conditions as described above). Each reaction was done in triplicate. PCR fragments were size fractionated on polyacrylamide gels and stained with EtBr followed by imaging and signal quantification (Lumi-Imager™; Roche Applied Science). PCR products were controlled by sequencing. Quantitative Western Blots—Embryos (50-μl aliquots) were thawed in 300 μl of Laemmli buffer, ground, and heated (95 °C, 10 min). Aliquots of the supernatant with equal amount of protein were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membranes were stained (0.1% Ponceau S; Sigma; in 5% acetic acid) to estimate the protein content and probed with either anti acetylK9H3 or anti acetylK14H3 antibody (Millipore). ECL was quantified with LAS-1000 (Fujifilm). As controls, the antibodies were removed with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed with anti-histone H2A antibodies (catalog number 07-146; Upstate). Krüppel Binds dSAP18 in Vitro—To identify proteins that interact with the transcription factor Kr (Fig. 1A), we isolated proteins from crude extracts of Drosophila S2 Schneider cells that bind to a GST-Kr fusion protein. The GST-Kr-associated proteins were identified by liquid chromatography coupled ESI-MS/MS subsequent to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The Kr-bound proteins included dCtBP (35Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science.. 1998; 280: 101-104Google Scholar) and dSAP18 (also called dBin1 (Bicoid-interacting protein 1)), a transcriptional corepressor known to be active during early Drosophila embryogenesis (26Singh N. Zhu W. Hanes S.D. Dev. Biol... 2005; 278: 242-254Google Scholar). Because Kr was shown to require an unknown corepressor in addition to dCtBP (24La Rosee-Borggreve A. Häder T. Wainwright D. Sauer F. Jäckle H. Mech. Dev... 1999; 89: 133-140Google Scholar), we asked whether dSAP18 could serve this function. Previous results had shown that such a factor must bind to a region N-terminal to the dCtBP-binding domain of Kr (24La Rosee-Borggreve A. Häder T. Wainwright D. Sauer F. Jäckle H. Mech. Dev... 1999; 89: 133-140Google Scholar). To determine the SAP18-binding region of Kr, we used pulldown experiments involving a set of GST fusions that contain various parts of Kr. We confirmed that dCtBP binds to the C-terminal portion (amino acids 400–502) of Kr (22Nibu Y. Senger K. Levine M. Mol. Cell Biol... 2003; 23: 3990-3999Google Scholar, 23Nibu Y. Zhang H. Bajor E. Barolo S. Small S. Levine M. EMBO J.. 1998; 17: 7009-7020Google Scholar), whereas dSAP18 binds to the amino acid region 168–399, which includes the C2H2 zinc finger domain (Fig. 1A). MALDI-TOF-MS control experiments identified N-terminal peptides of dSAP18 that were associated with full-length Kr (Fig. 1C) but not with GST fusions that lack the Kr168–399.-region, and pulldown experiments with bacterially expressed His-tagged dSAP18 protein confirmed strong in vitro binding of dSAP18 to the central region of Kr (amino acid region 168–399) as well as weak binding to the C-terminal part (Fig. 1D). We also expressed GST fusions containing the N-terminal region of Kr, but they were not soluble under the conditions used for the other GST fusions of Kr. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that dSAP18 is capable of binding also to the N-terminal portion of Kr. To determine the dSAP18-binding sites of Kr, we performed peptide array analysis employing tiled 16-mer peptides (see supplemental material), which cover the entire Kr sequence (peptides 1–54; Fig. 1E). In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled dSAP18 bound strongly to three overlapping peptides (peptides 30–32; Fig. 1E) that contain the region 342KFRRR346 of the fifth zinc finger motif of Kr. Two additional sites were found in the third zinc finger motif (293LRRHLRVH300, peptide 25) and the C-terminal domain (amino acid interval 431NIARRKAQ438, peptide 46), respectively (Fig. 1, A and E). A complementary immunological approach with His-tagged dSAP18 confirmed the identified binding sites (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that dSAP18 binds to a short stretch of basic amino acids in an unspecific manner only, we also tested a total of 14 arbitrary peptides of comparable basicity. No binding was observed except when the consensus sequence RR(K/R)H(H/K) was present in target peptides. This motif was found in a number of Drosophila transcription factors including Bicoid, which was previously shown to functionally interact with dSAP18 (26Singh N. Zhu W. Hanes S.D. Dev. Biol... 2005; 278: 242-254Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the dSAP18-binding sites in Drosophila transcription factors and their functional requirement will be presented elsewhere. 3A. Matyash and H. Jäckle, manuscript in preparation. We also note that the binding of Kr sequences and dSAP18 withstands salt concentrations up to at least 300 mmol (see “Experimental Procedures”). Taken together, our results indicate that dSAP18 can bind Kr in vitro and that the binding involves distinct binding sites. Genetic Interactions Suggest That SAP18 and Kr Interact in Vivo—To establish a functional basis for an interaction between Kr and dSap18, we performed genetic studies using a loss-of-function mutant allele, sap18R7–18 (26Singh N.

Jäckle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 10779-10784Google Scholar). If causes ectopic Kr activity in the developing eye imaginal discs, resulting in a dosage-dependent slit-like eye phenotype (13Carrera P. Abrell S. Kerber B. Walldorf U. Preiss A. Hoch M. Jäckle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 10779-10784Google Scholar). The If mutant phenotype is modified in response to reduced activity of zygotically expressed genes that act in the same developmental pathway (12Abrell S. Carrera P. Jäckle H. Chromosoma.. 2000; 109: 334-342Google Scholar, 13Carrera P. Abrell S. Kerber B. Walldorf U. Preiss A. Hoch M. Jäckle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 10779-10784Google Scholar), and it responds to reduced maternally expressed gene activities, resulting in an outgrowth of transformed adult eye tissue (36Sollars V. Lu X. Xiao L. Wang X. Garfinkel M.D. Ruden D.M. Nat. Genet... 2003; 33: 70-74Google Scholar). Such transformations are observed in low frequency, providing evidence for an epigenetic “inherited maternal effect” caused by histone acetylation/deacetylation events (36Sollars V. Lu X. Xiao L. Wang X. Garfinkel M.D. Ruden D.M. Nat. Genet... 2003; 33: 70-74Google Scholar). sap18R7–18 mutants alone have no scorable effects on eyes. Crosses between the If-1 homozygous males and heterozygous sap18R7–18 or sap18w+ EP females did not alter the If mutant phenotype (Fig. 2, A–D) but resulted in transformations in about 2% of the offspring (Fig. 2, E and F). No transformation was observed in more than 500 individuals resulting from reciprocal crosses between heterozygous sap18 males and If-1 females. Thus, the modifier effect was neither allele-specific nor dependent on the genetic background of the female flies, and it was not due to reduced zygotic dSap18 activity. It can be attributed to an earlier reported maternal"
