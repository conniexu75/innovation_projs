https://openalex.org/W2032037224,"The interaction between the erbB tyrosine kinase receptors and their ligands plays an important role in tumor growth via the regulation of autocrine and paracrine loops. We report the effect of heregulin beta1, the ligand for erbB-3 and erbB-4 receptors, on the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, using a panel of breast and lung cancer cell lines with constitutive erbB-2 overexpression or engineered to stably overexpress the erbB-2 receptor. We demonstrate that heregulin beta1 induces VEGF secretion in most cancer cell lines, while no significant effect was observed in normal human mammary and bronchial primary cells. Overexpression of erbB-2 receptor results in induction of the basal level of VEGF and exposure to heregulin further enhances VEGF secretion. This is associated with increased VEGF mRNA expression. In contrast, VEGF induction is significantly decreased in a T47D cell line where erbB-2 is functionally inactivated. Conditioned media from heregulin-treated cancer cells, but not from normal cells, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation; this paracrine stimulation is inhibited by co-exposure to a specific VEGF neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, heregulin-mediated angiogenesis is observed in the in vivo CAM assay. This study reports the first evidence of VEGF regulation by heregulin in cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W1972334859,"Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy that is consistently associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but which very rarely has p53 gene mutations in primary tumours. Since the tumour suppressor p53 is mutated in most human cancers or the wild type protein is inactivated in a significant number of the remainder, here we have investigated cellular factors that could compromise p53 function in primary NPC. Twenty-five primary tumours were judged to carry only wild type p53 by SSCP analysis of all exons and sequence determination of exons 4–9. Only one tumour was found to express significant levels of hMdm2 and in 24/25 there were no detectable mutations or deletions in exons 1β and 2 of the p14ARF gene. However, immunohistochemistry consistently revealed that all the tumour cells express substantial amounts of the p53-related protein p63. Semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis of mRNA from tumour biopsies showed that the dominant species expressed was invariably the truncated ΔN-isotype. Since this can block p53-mediated transactivation, it is potentially a dominant-negative isoform. In normal nasopharyngeal epithelium the distribution of p63 was restricted to the proliferating basal and suprabasal layers. We suggest that ΔN-p63 is a good candidate as a suppressor of wild type p53 function in these tumours and also that it may prove to be a valuable diagnostic marker for undifferentiated NPC."

https://openalex.org/W2323027157,"Growth Regulated Oncogene-alpha (GRO-alpha) is an autocrine growth factor in melanoma and is a member of the C-X-C family of chemokines which promote chemotaxis of granulocytes and endothelia through binding to CXC Receptor 2. We found previously that variants of murine squamous cell carcinoma PAM 212 which grow and metastasize more rapidly in vivo constitutively express increased levels of murine GRO-alpha, designated mGRO-alpha, or KC. We have examined the possible role of mGRO-alpha expression in malignant progression of squamous cell carcinoma PAM 212 in homologous BALB/c and BALB CXC Receptor-2 deficient mice. Transfection of the PAM 212 cell line which exhibits low expression of GRO-alpha and malignant potential with a pActin-KC vector encoding mGRO-alpha enabled isolation of PAM-KC expressing cell lines. These PAM-KC transfectants displayed an increased rate of growth and metastasis in BALB/c mice, similar to the highly malignant phenotype observed in spontaneously occurring metastatic variants. Furthermore, the PAM-KC tumors showed an increase in infiltration of host leukocytes and CD31+ blood vessels, consistent with increased CXC chemokine activity. The increased growth of PAM-KC cells was attenuated in CXCR-2 deficient mice, indicating that the increased growth was dependent in part upon host cells responsive to the CXC chemokine. Together, these results show that a CXC chemokine such as GRO-alpha can promote malignant growth of murine squamous cell carcinoma by a host CXCR-2 dependent pathway. Oncogene (2000) 19, 3477 - 3486"

EDG-1 is a G protein-coupled receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) that is expressed in endothelial cells and has been implicated in diverse vascular signal transduction pathways. We analyzed the subcellular distribution of EDG-1 in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with cDNA constructs encoding epitope-tagged EDG-1. Subcellular fractionation of cell lysates resolved by ultracentrifugation in discontinuous sucrose gradients revealed that ∼55% of the EDG-1 protein was recovered in fractions enriched in caveolin-1, a resident protein of caveolae. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that EDG-1 could be specifically precipitated by antibodies directed against caveolin-1 and vice versa. The targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae-enriched fractions was markedly increased (from 51 ± 11% to 93 ± 14%) by treatment of transfected cells with S1P (5 μm, 60 min). In co-transfection experiments expressing EDG-1 and eNOS cDNAs in COS-7 cells, we found that S1P treatment significantly and specifically increased nitric-oxide synthase activity, with an EC50 of 30 nm S1P. Overexpression of transfected caveolin-1 cDNA together with EDG-1 and eNOS markedly diminished S1P-mediated eNOS activation; caveolin overexpression also attenuated agonist-induced phosphorylation of EDG-1 receptor by >90%. These results suggest that the interaction of the EDG-1 receptor with caveolin may serve to inhibit signaling through the S1P pathway, even as the targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae facilitates the interactions of this receptor with ligands and effectors that are also targeted to caveolae. The agonist-modulated targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae and its dynamic inhibitory interactions with caveolin identify new points for regulation of sphingolipid-dependent signaling in the vascular wall.

Anderson R.G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane protein caveolin is the key scaffolding protein in caveolae. Caveolin directly interacts with several signaling proteins and may serve a broad role in modulating receptor-activated signaling pathways in caveolae. In addition to serving as sites for targeting of specific proteins, plasmalemmal caveolae also have a distinctive lipid composition; caveolae are relatively depleted of phospholipids and are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). The specific lipid composition of caveolae serves to create a “liquid-ordered phase” within these small membrane structures (3Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) that may thereby facilitate the physical proximity and interactions of the various signal transducing proteins targeted to caveolae. In addition to this essential structural role, sphingolipids have become increasingly appreciated as serving key roles in signal transduction in a variety of cellular pathways. Sphingolipids are acylated derivatives of sphingosine, the core structure of this class of lipids. As was described previously for phospholipid-derived compounds, it has been observed more recently that sphingolipids and their metabolites appear to be active in a variety of signaling pathways in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). One biologically active sphingolipid is sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P),1 which has been implicated in intercellular as well as intracellular signaling (reviewed in Ref. 5Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Thangada S. Thompson B.D. Kluk M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). S1P may elicit biological responses as diverse as cellular proliferation (6Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), hypertrophy (7Sekiguchi K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that responses to S1P are mediated, at least in some cells, by the binding of S1P to the EDG-1 receptor (11Lee M., J. Van Brocklyn J., R. Thangada S. Liu C., H. Hand A., R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The EDG-1 receptor (endothelial differentiationgene-1) was originally cloned as an orphan gene that is induced upon the stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with phorbol esters (8Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EDG receptor family is now known to comprise at least seven independent subtypes (13Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 14Yamazaki Y. Kon J. Sato K. Tomura H. Sato M. Yoneya T. Okazaki H. Okajima F. Ohta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The EDG-1 receptor belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (16Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); receptor activation by S1P can lead to the activation of numerous downstream effectors, including the mobilization of intracellular calcium and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (17Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that S1P-mediated activation of EDG-1 receptor leads to morphological alterations in cultured vascular endothelial cellsin vitro and induces vessel structure formation in vivo (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), thus implicating S1P/EDG-1 in signal transduction pathways leading to angiogenesis. However, the subcellular targeting of EDG-1, the proximal interactions of EDG-1 with other membrane-associated signaling proteins, and the relationship of EDG-1 to nitric oxide signaling pathways all remain less well understood. It seemed plausible to us that the targeting of S1P precursors in caveolae might provide a mechanism for the activation of the EDG-1 receptor if it were similarly localized in this organelle. Moreover, the biological responses elicited by S1P share some features with pathways involved in nitric oxide signaling, an observation made more compelling by the fact that the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae (18Shaul P.W.

In the present study, we provide evidence demonstrating that the EDG-1 receptor is targeted to caveolae and explore the implications of this discovery for the involvement of eNOS and caveolin in sphingolipid-mediated signal transduction. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, CT); all other cell culture reagents, media, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. S1P was from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). S1P was solubilized in methanol following the supplier's instruction and stored at −20 °C; the same volume of methanol was used as a vehicle-control for S1P, and the final concentration of methanol did not exceed 0.4% (v/v) in any experiment. [3H]l-Arginine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein determinations were made with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Anti-eNOS monoclonal and anti-caveolin polyclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Super Signal substrate for chemiluminescence detection, nonimmune IgG and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. [32P]Orthophosphate was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA).

Lisanti (Albert Einstein Medical College) and cloned into pcDNA3 atHindIII and BamHI sites. eNOS cDNA subcloned into pBK-CMV was described previously (20Robinson L.J. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in culture as described previously (21Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The day before transfection, cells were split at a ratio of 1:8 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (11Lee M., J. Van Brocklyn J., R. Thangada S. Liu C., H. Hand A., R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). For most experiments, cells in a 100-mm culture plate were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA encoding FLAG/EDG-1, using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocols. In co-transfection experiments analyzed for quantitation of intracellular eNOS activity, cells in a 60-mm plate were co-transfected with cDNAs encoding FLAG/EDG-1 (2 μg), eNOS (0.03 μg), and/or caveolin-1 (0.04 μg). In co-transfection experiments studying phosphorylation of EDG-1 receptor, cells in a given well of a 6-well plate were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs encoding FLAG/EDG-1 (0.5 μg) and caveolin-1 (0.03 μg). Each (co)-transfection condition was optimized through preliminary experiments using varying amounts of DNA for the different combinations of plasmid DNAs and experimental conditions. When cells were co-transfected with multiple plasmid DNAs, “empty” vector (no cDNA insert) was used to normalize the total amount of transfected DNAs among the groups. Approximately 30 h after transfection, culture medium was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, and incubation proceeded for 16 h prior to the experiments. Caveolae-enriched fractions were separated by using ultracentrifugation with a discontinuous sucrose gradient system as described previously (22Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells from 2–100-mm dishes were scraped together into 2 ml of carbonate buffer containing 500 mm sodium carbonate (pH 11), 25 mm MES and 150 mm NaCl, and the cells were homogenized (40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer) and sonicated (3 × 20 s bursts in a Branson Sonifier 450). The resulting cell suspension was brought to 45% sucrose (w/v) by adding 2 ml of carbonate buffer containing 90% sucrose and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous gradient was formed above the 45% sucrose bed by adding 4 ml each of 35 and 5% sucrose solutions prepared in carbonate buffer. After centrifugation as described (22Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), 12 × 1 ml fractions were collected starting at the top of each gradient. An equal volume of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and probed for FLAG epitope or caveolin with corresponding antibodies, as described previously (23Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were lysed in 500 μl of buffer containing n-octyl β-glucopyranoside (OG buffer, described in Ref. 24Feron O. Michel J.B. Sase K. Michel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were precleared with corresponding nonimmune IgG (1 μg) incubated together with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were then incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody or anti-caveolin antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Nonimmune mouse IgG1 (for anti-FLAG antibody) or rabbit IgG (for anti-caveolin antibody) were used as a negative control, respectively. Cell lysates were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose (for anti-FLAG antibody) or protein A-Sepharose (for anti-caveolin antibody) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A or G beads were then extensively washed with OG buffer. Proteins were eluted from beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously (23Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). eNOS enzyme activity was quantified as the formation of [3H]l-citrulline from [3H]l-arginine as described previously, with minor modifications (25Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-7 cells in a 60-mm dish were incubated in 2 ml of buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, 109 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm glucose (pH 7.3) for 1 h at 37 °C. eNOS activity was assayed by adding a mixture of unlabeledl-arginine (10 μm), [3H]l-arginine (10 μCi/ml) and S1P (5 μm) or vehicle to the culture (each treatment was performed in duplicate cultures, and then each was assayed in duplicate). Following incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of solution containing 20 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm l-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mmEGTA (pH 5.5) followed by sonication. An aliquot was withdrawn for determination of the total protein content and total cellular3H incorporation, and the remaining sample was applied to Dowex 50WX8–400 column to separate [3H]l-citrulline. The flow-through fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting; [3H]l-citrulline formation in COS-7 cells was expressed as fmol [3H]l-citrulline produced per mg of cellular protein/min. In parallel with the experiments above, another individual set of culture plates corresponding to each co-transfection protocol was analyzed to verify the expression levels of co-expressed FLAG/EDG-1, eNOS, and caveolin-1 proteins by Western blot analysis using anti-eNOS, anti-FLAG, or anti-caveolin antibodies. Transfected COS-7 cells in 6-well dishes were washed twice and incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μCi/ml of [32P]phosphate for 4 h at 37 °C and then stimulated with S1P for 5 min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (26Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of cell lysate was processed for Western blot analysis. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by autoradiography after proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Densitometric analyses of Western blots and autoradiograms were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha-Innotech). All experiments were performed at least three times. Mean values for individual experiments are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical differences were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's F test using STAT VIEW II (Abacus Concepts). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cell lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding FLAG/EDG-1 were analyzed by ultracentrifugation using a discontinuous sucrose gradient system that was previously shown to resolve caveolae-enriched subcellular fractions (22Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 27Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, almost all of the endogenously expressed caveolin-1 in COS-7 cells is recovered in the interface between the 5 and 35% sucrose solutions (fractions 4 and 5, corresponding to previously characterized “light vesicle” or caveolae-enriched fractions). By contrast, the vast majority of total cellular protein is distributed in the denser sucrose fractions (fractions 8–12); taken together, these results indicate that this ultracentrifugation method (22Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) resolves caveolin-enriched fractions in transfected COS-7 cells. Importantly, when the same gradient fractions were analyzed in Western blots probed for FLAG/EDG-1, a significant fraction (∼55%) of the total EDG-1 (with the expected molecular mass of ∼44 kDa) is recovered in fractions 4 and 5, demonstrating the presence of the EDG-1 receptor in caveolin-enriched fractions. As shown in Fig. 2, antibodies directed against caveolin co-immunoprecipitate FLAG/EDG-1, and, conversely, anti-FLAG antibodies co-immunoprecipitate caveolin. The specificity of these associations was explored in co-immunoprecipitation experiments that were identically configured but used nonimmune IgG, which yield no co-immunoprecipitation whatsoever (Fig. 2). The combination of subcellular fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation data provide complementary lines of evidence indicating that the EDG-1 receptor is targeted to caveolae. To test whether treatment of cells with S1P alters the targeting of EDG-1 receptor to caveolae, we treated COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG/EDG-1 cDNA with S1P for varying times, then harvested the cells, and analyzed subcellular fractions as described above. We used S1P at a concentration of 5 μm, because serum S1P concentration may reach micromolar range upon platelet activation (28Yatomi Y. Igarashi Y. Yang L. Hisano N. Qi R. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Kume S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar,29Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, although the majority of EDG-1 can be recovered in the caveolae-enriched fraction prior to S1P treatment, a substantive fraction of EDG-1 is present in the noncaveolar fractions (fractions 8–12). Within 20 min after the addition of S1P (5 μm), the proportion of EDG-1 in caveolae-enriched fractions begins to increase, with a concomitant decrease in the fraction of EDG-1 in the noncaveolar fractions; by 60 min almost all of the EDG-1 is recovered in the caveolae-enriched fractions. The overall recovery of EDG-1 protein (determined by immunoblot analyses of unfractionated cell lysates; data not shown) does not change following S1P treatment (30Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thereby indicating that EDG-1 undergoes a translocation from noncaveolar fractions to caveolae-enriched fractions following addition of agonist. By contrast, the subcellular distribution of endogenous caveolin-1 analyzed in these same transfected COS-7 cells shows no change following S1P treatment: ∼90% of the total caveolin-1 is recovered in the caveolae-enriched fractions at all time points following the addition of S1P (Fig.3). We next explored whether S1P activates eNOS by performing co-transfection experiments with cDNA constructs encoding eNOS and EDG-1. eNOS activity was quantitated by measuring the formation of l-citrulline, which is produced by the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of l-arginine to yield NO plus l-citrulline; the latter is an easily measured co-product (31Bredt D.S. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 249-255Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transiently expressing FLAG/EDG-1 and/or eNOS cDNAs were incubated with [3H]l-arginine and treated with S1P or vehicle; cells were harvested, and lysates were analyzed for [3H]l-citrulline formation as described above. As shown in Fig. 4 A, there is no detectable [3H]l-citrulline formation in cells not transfected with eNOS cDNA. When cells are transfected with plasmid cDNA encoding eNOS alone, there is a small increase in basal eNOS, which is seen either in the presence or absence of added S1P. However, when cells are co-transfected with plasmids cDNAs encoding FLAG/EDG-1 as well as eNOS, treatment with S1P (5 μm) leads to a marked increase in eNOS activity. We studied both FLAG epitope-tagged as well as untagged EDG-1 plasmid cDNAs and found an equivalent level of S1P-dependent eNOS activation mediated by the tagged and untagged constructs (data not shown). We performed dose response experiments with S1P (Fig.4 B), measuring eNOS activity in cells co-transfected with FLAG/EDG-1 and eNOS. The EC50 for S1P activation of eNOS in this experimental system is ∼30 nm, which is in good agreement with previous studies of S1P responses mediated by the EDG-1 receptor (11Lee M., J. Van Brocklyn J., R. Thangada S. Liu C., H. Hand A., R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 13Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). There is no change in the incorporation of [3H]arginine into the cells under any of these experimental conditions (data not shown). These results indicate that S1P activates eNOS in COS-7 cells only when these cells are co-transfected with cDNAs encoding both eNOS as well as the EDG-1 receptor, with an EC50 value in a physiologic range. We explored the functional consequences of the interaction between EDG-1 with caveolin by co-transfecting plasmid cDNA encoding FLAG/EDG-1 along with plasmids encoding eNOS and/or caveolin-1. When cells are co-transfected with constructs encoding caveolin-1, a new protein band is seen, appearing slightly larger than the endogenous caveolin band because of the Myc epitope tag on the recombinant protein (Fig.5, lower panel). The subcellular distribution of the transfected Myc epitope-tagged caveolin-1 is identical to that of endogenous caveolin-1 (data not shown). It appears that caveolin cDNA transfection of COS-7 cells increases the amount of caveolin-1 protein expression by approximately 2–3-fold overall (Fig. 5), but this figure may be an underestimate of the degree of overexpression in a given cell, because only a fraction of the cells are successfully transfected with exogenous plasmids. Moreover, the apparent increase in caveolin expression following cDNA transfection cannot be rigorously quantitated because of the potential differences in caveolin immunoreactivity that are secondary to species differences between the exogenous (canine) caveolin expressed by the cDNA and the endogenous (simian) caveolin present in COS-7 cells. We next analyzed eNOS activity in these co-transfection experiments, quantitated by measuring [3H]l-citrulline formation from [3H]l-arginine. As shown in Fig. 5(upper panel), eNOS activity is not detected in sham-transfected cells. Transfection of eNOS cDNA leads to a small increase in [3H]l-citrulline formation that is not affected by caveolin-1 overexpression. In cells expressing both EDG-1 and eNOS, treatment with S1P markedly increases eNOS activity (as seen also in Fig. 4). However, overexpression of exogenous caveolin-1 in addition to EDG-1 and eNOS abrogates the augmentation of NO production elicited by S1P (Fig. 5). These results indicate that overexpression of caveolin-1 has an inhibitory effect on the activation of eNOS elicited by S1P/EDG-1. Interpretation of this observation is confounded by the fact that caveolin itself directly inhibits eNOS activation (32Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is therefore difficult to discriminate the direct effects of caveolin on eNOS activity from any inhibitory effect of caveolin on EDG-1 itself. We therefore explored whether caveolin might regulate an independent agonist-dependent EDG-1-mediated response, namely the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the EDG-1 receptor (33Lee M.J. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22105-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, when COS-7 cells transfected with EDG-1 cDNA are treated with S1P, there is a striking increase in EDG-1 phosphorylation relative to vehicle-treated cells (5.0 ± 1.5-fold increase, p < 0.01). However, the co-transfection of caveolin-1 markedly attenuates the S1P-induced increase in EDG-1 phosphorylation. Expression of EDG-1 is unaffected by co-transfection with caveolin-1 (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results indicate that caveolin-1 overexpression inhibits agonist-induced EDG-1 receptor phosphorylation. These studies present several lines of experimentation indicating that the EDG-1 receptor is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae. Subcellular fractionation experiments (Fig. 1) reveal that a significant fraction of EDG-1 is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae in transfected COS-7 cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.2) indicate that caveolin and EDG-1 proteins associate with one another (of course, these data do not establish a directprotein-protein interaction between caveolin and EDG-1). We also found that treatment of FLAG/EDG-1-transfected COS-7 cells with S1P specifically alters the subcellular distribution of the EDG-1 receptor (Fig. 3); the receptor appears to undergo translocation from noncaveolae to caveolae-enriched fractions after prolonged treatment with S1P, whereas the distribution of caveolin is unaffected by S1P treatment. Interestingly, Liu et al. (30Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have previously observed that green fluorescent protein-tagged EDG-1 receptor can undergo translocation from sites in the plasma membrane to unidentified intracellular locales. The lack of availability of specific EDG-1 antibodies has hampered studies of the trafficking of endogenously expressed EDG-1 receptor in native cells. The present studies have identified plasmalemmal caveolae as the key intracellular site for the localization of recombinant EDG-1 and establish noteworthy parallels between EDG-1 and some other G protein-coupled receptors that similarly undergo agonist-modulated translocation from noncaveolar membranes to caveolae-enriched fractions (27Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These parallels suggest the presence of common cellular machinery that transport specific G protein-coupled receptors to caveolae after prolonged stimulation with their cognate ligands. Furthermore, the fact that the FLAG-tagged EDG-1 receptor undergoes agonist-dependent translocation from noncaveolar membranes to caveolae-enriched fractions indicates that the fundamental regulatory features of the native receptor are retained in the epitope-tagged construct (11Lee M., J. Van Brocklyn J., R. Thangada S. Liu C., H. Hand A., R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 16Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Specific caveolae-targeted sphingolipids, such as ceramide, may be converted to S1P by the actions of ceramidase and sphingosine kinase (13Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Ceramide has recently been found to activate eNOS in cultured endothelial cells (36Igarashi J. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Golan D.E. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12583-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it is intriguing to speculate that the targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae serves to facilitate the physical proximity of the EDG-1 receptor to the sphingolipid precursors of S1P present in caveolae. It must be noted, however, that the concentration of S1P in most cells is quite low, possibly reflecting the limited expression of its key synthetic enzyme, sphingosine kinase. Blood platelets represent a notable exception; platelets release substantial amounts of S1P and have a robust sphingosine kinase activity (13Goetzl E.J. An S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the expression of EDG-1 in endothelial cells may serve principally to transduce extracellular signals from platelet-derived S1P. We found an EC50 of 30 nmfor S1P activation of eNOS (Fig. 4 B); this figure is within the range of S1P concentrations found in human plasma, making it possible that S1P plays a role in the physiological regulation of NO synthesis. It remains to be determined whether endogenous S1P plays an autocrine role as a ligand for the EDG-1 receptor, although endothelial cell activation may be accompanied by an increase in intracellular S1P levels (10Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 37Xia P. Gamble J.R. Rye K.A. Wang L. Hii C.S. Cockerill P.

Thus, despite the proximity to sphingolipids afforded by the caveolar targeting of EDG-1, it is possible that the localization of EDG-1 in caveolae serves principally to sequester the receptor along with other signaling proteins similarly targeted to caveolae. These studies have identified a possible role for EDG-1 in modulating the activity of eNOS, a key signaling protein targeted to caveolae in endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes (23Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The localization of eNOS in caveolae is essential for the activation of the enzyme by cell surface receptors (38Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Receptors that activate eNOS have been localized in caveolae, including the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (27Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17744-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and the B2 bradykinin receptor (35de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Like these other G protein-coupled receptors, EDG-1 is known to mobilize intracellular calcium (17Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27104-27110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a key regulatory component of eNOS activation (39Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar,40Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways modulated by eNOS bear some striking parallels with the cellular responses elicited by S1P and EDG-1. For example, both eNOS and EDG-1 have been individually implicated as key modulators of angiogenesis, yet the role of nitric oxide synthesis in S1P-activated angiogenesis is not well understood. eNOS can be activated by polypeptide growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to angiogenesis (41Ku D.D. Zaleski J.K. Liu S. Brock T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H586-H592PubMed Google Scholar, 42He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar); in similar fashion, S1P, in a synergistic fashion with VEGF, markedly stimulates angiogenesis (12Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T. Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). We speculate that eNOS stimulated by the S1P-activated EDG-1 receptor may modulate angiogenesis pathways in vascular endothelial cells. It should be noted that caveolin-1 also may regulate signaling pathways implicated in angiogenesis. For example, angiogenic polypeptide growth factors down-regulate the expression of caveolin-1 protein in an endothelial cell line (43Liu J. Razani B. Tang S. Terman B.I. Ware J.A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15781-15785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that caveolin tonically suppresses angiogenesis. Moreover, receptors for VEGF and related growth factors are markedly enriched in caveolae (reviewed in Ref. 44Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar); present data showing the targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae and inhibitory association with caveolin-1 may indicate a more general mechanism for the coordinated regulation of angiogenesis pathways by independently derived ligands. Whereas caveolae may thereby serve as sites to sequester these and other vascular signaling pathways, the inhibitory effects of caveolin may serve to tonically attenuate the activation of these pathways until their activation by agonist ligands. As indicated in Fig. 5, overexpression of caveolin-1 markedly attenuates S1P/EDG-1 mediated eNOS activation, but not the basal activity, in the co-transfected COS-7 cells. This inhibition of S1P/EDG-1 activation of eNOS by caveolin is intriguing but difficult to interpret. The eNOS enzyme activity is inhibited by caveolin in vitro (32Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and the possible inhibitory effects of caveolin overexpression on EDG-1 cannot be distinguished from the known direct inhibitory effects of caveolin on eNOS. By contrast, the inhibition by caveolin of ligand-induced phosphorylation of the EDG-1 receptor more strongly implicates a direct effect of caveolin on S1P-dependent signaling pathways that is independent of NO. The molecular locus for this inhibitory effect of caveolin on EDG-1 receptor phosphorylation remains to be defined. Although the specific protein kinases involved in agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the EDG-1 receptor have not yet been identified, it has been proposed that kinase pathways similar to those modulating agonist-dependent phosphorylation of other G protein-coupled receptors may be involved. If such is the case, the fact that caveolin overexpression so very dramatically influences ligand-induced EDG-1 receptor phosphorylation may indicate a role for caveolin-modulated pathways in the control of S1P signaling. In conclusion, we have presented evidence that the sphingolipid receptor EDG-1 is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae, where the receptor can be immunoprecipitated in a complex with caveolin. The targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae appears to facilitate its agonist-dependent activation of eNOS, identifying a potential locus for interactions between these two signaling pathways in the control of angiogenesis and other vascular responses. Caveolin appears to inhibit signaling pathways activated by S1P, suggesting that caveolin may attenuate sphingolipid-dependent signaling even as caveolar targeting may enhance the interactions of signaling molecules expressed in caveolae. The agonist-modulated targeting of EDG-1 to caveolae and its dynamic inhibitory interactions with caveolin identify new points for regulation of sphingolipid-dependent signaling in the vascular wall. We thank Drs. Timothy Hla and Michael P. Lisanti for providing cDNAs encoding FLAG/EDG-1 and caveolin-1, respectively. We are also grateful to Dr. Prakash Prabhakar for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2054836553,"The dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 has recently been identified as the tumor suppressor gene most frequently mutated and/or deleted in human tumors. Germline mutations of PTEN give rise to Cowden Disease (CD), an autosomal dominantly-inherited cancer syndrome which predisposes to increased risk of developing breast and thyroid tumors. However, PTEN mutations have rarely been detected in sporadic thyroid carcinomas. In this study, we confirm that PTEN mutations in sporadic thyroid cancer are infrequent as we found one point mutation and one heterozygous deletion of PTEN gene in 26 tumors and eight cell lines screened. However, we report that PTEN expression is reduced both at the mRNA and at the protein level - in five out of eight tumor-derived cell lines and in 24 out of 61 primary tumors. In most cases, decreased PTEN expression is correlated with increased phosphorylation of the PTEN-regulated protein kinase Akt/PKB. Moreover, we demonstrate that PTEN may act as a suppressor of thyroid cancerogenesis as the constitutive re-expression of PTEN into two different thyroid tumor cell lines markedly inhibits cell growth. PTEN-dependent inhibition of BrdU incorporation is accompanied by enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and can be overcome by simultaneous co-transfection of an excess p27kip1 antisense plasmid. Accordingly, in a subset of thyroid primary carcinomas and tumor-derived cell lines, a striking correlation between PTEN expression and the level of p27kip1 protein was observed. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that inactivation of PTEN may play a role in the development of sporadic thyroid carcinomas and that one key target of PTEN suppressor activity is represented by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1."

https://openalex.org/W2313319084,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins have been implicated in cytokine-regulated proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a regulator of granulocytic differentiation, induces a robust and sustained activation of STAT3. Here, we show that introduction of dominant negative (DN) forms of STAT3 interferes with G-CSF-induced differentiation and survival in murine 32D cells. G-CSF induces expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27(KiP1) (but not p21(CiP1)), which is completely blocked by DN-STAT3. The ability of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitution mutants of the G-CSF receptor to activate STAT3 strongly correlated with their capacity to induce p27 expression and their ability to mediate differentiation and survival, suggesting a causal relationship between STAT3 activation, p27 expression and the observed cellular responses. We identified a putative STAT binding site in the promoter region of p27 that showed both STAT3 binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and functional activity in luciferase reporter assays. Finally, we studied G-CSF-induced responses in primary bone marrow and spleen cells of p27-deficient mice. Compared with wild-type, myeloid progenitors from p27-deficient mice showed significantly increased proliferation and reduced differentiation in response to G-CSF. These findings indicate that STAT3 controls myeloid differentiation, at least partly, via upregulation of p27(Kip1)."

By analysing c-myb(-/-) chimaeras we show that no mature cells of any lymphoid or myeloid lineage can be detected in adult haemopoietic tissues. This demonstrates that the effects of c-myb ablation on haemopoiesis are cell autonomous and correlates with an absence in the c-myb(-/-) foetal liver of uni- and multilineage CFUs. Indeed, CFU assays performed on E8.5 yolk sac cells revealed that haemopoietic progenitors are already defective at this stage. However, although cells expressing high levels of c-Kit were absent, we could detect a high proportion of CD34+CD45+ cells in the c-myb(-/-) foetal liver. Examination of chimaeric embryos revealed that c-myb(-/-) donor-derived CD34+/Kit+ cells, representing committed definitive progenitors, initially populated the foetal liver, but are unable to expand like wild type progenitors. Our results showing no megakaryocytic CFUs and a reduction in the absolute numbers of megakaryocytes in the c-myb(-/-) foetal liver also refute early suggestions that megakaryopoiesis is unaffected by the absence of c-Myb."

Here, we demonstrate that the Mom1AKR allele consists of two genetic components. These include the secretory phospholipase Pla2g2a, whose candidacy as a Mom1 resistance modifier has now been tested with several transgenic lines. A second region, distal to Pla2g2a, has also been identified using fine structure recombinants. Pla2g2aAKR transgenic mice demonstrate a modest resistance to tumorigenesis in the small intestine and a very robust resistance in the large intestine. Moreover, the tumor resistance in the colon of Pla2g2aAKR animals is dosage-dependent, a finding that is consistent with our observation that Pla2g2a is expressed in goblet cells. By contrast, mice carrying the distal Mom1 modifier demonstrate a modest tumor resistance that is confined to the small intestine. Thus, the phenotypes of these two modifier loci are complementary, both in their quantitative and regional effects. The additive effects and tight linkage of these modifiers may have been necessary for the initial identification of the Mom1 region."

We have shown previously that shrinkage induces Fyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the cortical actin-binding protein, cortactin.

Shrinkage increased FER activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. These effects were abolished by the Src family inhibitor PP2 and strongly mitigated in Fyn-deficient but not in Src-deficient cells. FER overexpression caused cortactin phosphorylation that was further enhanced by hypertonicity. Exchange of tyrosine residues 421, 466, and 482 for phenylalanine prevented cortactin phosphorylation by hypertonicity and strongly decreased it upon FER overexpression, suggesting that FER targets primarily the same osmo-sensitive tyrosines. Because constituents of the cell-cell contacts are substrates of Fyn and FER, we investigated the effect of shrinkage on the adherens junctions. Hypertonicity provoked Fyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in β-catenin, α-catenin, and p120Cas and caused the dissociation of β-catenin from the contacts.

Although these responses are important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and integrity, little is known about the volume-dependent signaling pathways that convert the initial alteration to the compensatory or regulatory effector functions.

Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 11Huang C. Liu J. Haudeschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These features, together with the fact that upon cell stimulation cortactin localizes to peripheral membrane structures such as ruffles and lamellipodia (8Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 12Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that this protein may be an important organizer of the cortical cytoskeleton dynamics. In favor of this notion, overexpression (13Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or tyrosine phosphorylation (11Huang C. Liu J. Haudeschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) of cortactin has been associated with increased cell motility and invasiveness. Within the Src family, Fyn kinase seems to play a specific role in the osmotic cortactin response. This conclusion is based on our earlier findings that 1) Fyn but not Src itself is activated by osmotic shock and 2) the hypertonic cortactin phosphorylation is substantially reduced in Fyn-deficient but remains intact in Src-deficient cells (6Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent observations, however, suggest that the direct phosphorylation of cortactin might be catalyzed not (only) by Src-type kinases but also by FER kinase, a member of the c-FES family (14Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FER contains a unique kinase domain, a central SH2 domain, and two regions with homology to coiled-coil oligomerization domains (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Smithgall T.E. Rogers J.A. Peters L.K. Li J. Briggs D.S. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of FER activation apart from the fact that it coincides with the tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. This might be brought about by the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), by autophosphorylation following FER oligomerization (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell.

Briggs D.S. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the primary substrates of FER include key constituents of the cell-cell contact apparatus, such as β-catenin, and a related molecule, p120Cas (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These proteins link the transmembrane adhesion receptor cadherins to the actin skeleton (19Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and their tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to be a crucial mechanism in the regulation of adherens junctions (20Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that, besides FER, various Src family kinases also play a direct or indirect role in the phosphorylation of these contact elements (21Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanashi J. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J.

In most cases, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the junctional proteins has been associated with the disassembly of the contacts (22Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A.

The scenario described above offers intriguing possibilities regarding volume-related signaling: 1) It is conceivable that FER is a volume-dependent kinase, and if so, it might be involved in the shrinkage-induced cortactin phosphorylation. 2) The osmotic activation of FER might be related (downstream or upstream) to the activation of Fyn. 3) Hyperosmotic stress might induce the phosphorylation and reorganization of certain cell-cell contact proteins. An interesting implication of this latter assumption is that changes in cell size or shape might represent important inputs for the regulation and coordination of two interrelated functions: cell migration and cell-cell adhesion. The aim of the present work was to gain further insight into the volume-dependent signaling by testing these possibilities. Our results show that FER is phosphorylated and activated by osmotic stress in a Fyn-dependent manner, and it may contribute to the osmotic cortactin phosphorylation. Moreover, hypertonicity, through Fyn and presumably FER, provokes the tyrosine phosphorylation and redistribution of cell-cell contact proteins. Nigericin, [Val5]-angiotensin II, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.8 mg/ml benzamidine HCl, 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in pure ethanol was from PharMingen, and protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)1 acetoxy methylester and PP2 were from Calbiochem. Ultra-pure myelin basic protein, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), anti-cortactin, and anti-p120Cas were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal antibody against c-Myc(9E10) and polyclonal antibodies against ERK-2, α(E)-catenin, β-catenin, VE-, P-, and N-cadherin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-FER2 and -FER4 sera used in these studies were described previously (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG, the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Kit, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Goat IgG was obtained from Jackson. Bicarbonate-free RPMI 1640 was buffered with 25 mm Hepes to pH 7.4 (osmolarity 290 ± 5 mosm). The isotonic sodium medium (Iso-Na) consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmglucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). When required, the Iso-Na was made hypertonic by the addition of various amounts of sucrose (25–600 mm) or 300 mm urea, as indicated. If not stated otherwise, the hypertonic sodium medium used in most experiments refers to the isotonic medium supplemented with 300 mm sucrose (total osmotic concentration is 600 mosm). The hypertonic potassium medium used for the calibration of the intracellular pH contained 243 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes. The pH was set to 6.9, 7.4, or 7.9 using the necessary amount of Tris-OH. Osmolarity was checked with an Osmette osmometer. CHO cells (29Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in α-minimal essential medium, containing 25 mm NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% antibiotic suspension (penicillin and streptomycin, Sigma), under humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1) at 37 °C. Wild Type (WT), Fyn−/−, Src−/− fibroblasts were originally isolated from mouse embryos that were homozygous for disruption in the Src or Fyn gene and were immortalized with large T antigen (30Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These cell lines are identical with those used in our previous studies (6Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Sheila M. Thomas (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle). These cells as well as the Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All other conditions and treatments were similar to those used in CHO cells. The plasmid pMyc-cortactin encoding for the wild type murine cortactin tagged with the Myc epitope at its N terminus and pMyc-cortactinF421F466F482 encoding for a mutant version (Pcort) in which the listed residues were exchanged for phenylalanine were previously described (11Huang C. Liu J. Haudeschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For the expression of the Hemagglutinin-tagged WT and kinase inactive FER, the plasmids pCMV-HA-FER(WT) and pCMV-HA-FER(K591R) were used, as described before (14Kim L. Wong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23542-23548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transient transfection with the corresponding plasmids were performed on CHO cells using the FuGeneTM Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent cultures were incubated for 2–3 h in serum- and HCO3-free RPMI 1640 prior to experiments. Cells were preincubated in Iso-Na medium for 10 min and then subjected to various treatments as indicated. The medium was then aspirated, and the cells were vigorously scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4 and 20 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture. To obtain cell suspension from cultured cells, confluent monolayers were treated with Ca2+and Mg2+-free Iso-Na medium supplemented with 5 mm Na2EDTA (5 ml/10-cm dish). After 10 min, the detached cells (>90%) were vigorously pipetted until single cell suspension was attained. The suspension was then divided into two equal parts, and an equal volume of the same isotonic solution or this solution supplemented with 600 mm sucrose was added (i.e. final concentration, 300 mm sucrose). After 10 min with slow rotation at 37 °C, the samples were spun (3000 rpm for 3 min), the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was dissolved in cold lysis buffer. Lysates containing equal amount of protein were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, precleared for 1 h using 40 μl of 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads, and then incubated with the corresponding antibodies for at least 1 h. Immunocomplexes were captured using 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose, and the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as specified under the figures. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. To check effectiveness of transfer and similarity of protein amount, lanes were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the corresponding primary antibody. Binding of the antibody was visualized by the relevant (anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat), peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:3000 dilution) using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Quantification of the bands was performed using a Bio-Rad GS-690 Imaging Densitometer and the Molecular Analyst program as in Ref. 6Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. In vitro FER activity was determined essentially as described previously, using [Val5]-angiotensin II as substrate (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cell lysates obtained from iso- or hypertonically treated WT and Fyn−/− cells and containing equal amount of protein (500–1000 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-FER2 antibody. The precipitates were washed with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm MnCl2, pH 7.7) supplemented with 0.25 mm Na3VO4. The beads were then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 mm [Val5]-angiotensin II, 5 μm ATP (potassium salt), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 35 μl of ice-cold stop solution (20% trichloroacetic acid and 5 mm ATP). 35 μl of this mixture was layered onto P81 phosphocellulose squares, and after extensive washing with 0.85% phosphoric acid, radioactivity bound to the filters was measured by scintillation counting. The background, i.e. the activity detected in samples that had been incubated identically but without the substrate, was determined in each experiment and subtracted. Results were normalized to the amount of protein content of the cell lysate. For the determination of ERK-2 activity, lysates containing equal amounts of protein were immunocomplexed using the anti-ERK-2 antibody. The beads were washed with kinase buffer and preincubated with 20 μg of myelin basic protein/sample for 5 min on ice. The samples were then placed in a 30 °C waterbath, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of assay buffer containing 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 μm ATP, and 1.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 15 min later the reaction was terminated by 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and the samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Confluent cultures grown on coverslips were preincubated for 10 min in Iso-Na medium and treated as specified under the figures. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min in the same iso- or hypertonic medium as used for the experiment. The coverslips were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton for 20 min at room temperature, and blocked with 1% donkey serum plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with anti-β-catenin (1:100) for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides using the Anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes). The staining was visualized using a Leica Immunofluorescence microscope, and pictures were taken with the WinView® software. Changes in pHi were monitored fluorometrically using the indicator dye BCECF, as described before (29Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of WT and Fyn−/− cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 1 μm BCECF acetoxy methylester for 10 min in Iso-Na medium. Ratio fluorometry was performed on small populations of cells (6–12 cells/measurement) using a DeltaRAM illumination system from Photon Technologies, Inc. in the dual excitation (490 ± 5 nm/440 ± 5 nm), single emission (530 ± 30 nm) configuration. Each coverslip was mounted to form the bottom of a thermostatted, perfusable Leydig chamber into which 0.5 ml of isotonic medium was added and the basal fluorescence was recorded. The medium was then rapidly exchanged (by addition of 10 times 0.5 ml in less than 20 s) to a hypertonic solution. After each measurement, fluorescence was calibrated in terms of pHi by sequential perfusion of the chamber with nigericin-containing calibration media (see above). Data analysis was carried out using the Felix® software. Confluent CHO cells were detached using the Iso-Na medium supplemented with 5 mmNa2EDTA and suspended in Iso-Na, hypertonic sodium medium, or Iso-Na containing 300 mm urea for 10 min. The median cell volume was then determined by electronic sizing using a Coulter Counter model ZM equipped with a Channelyzer. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Data are presented as representative immunoblots of at least three similar experiments or as the means ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated (n). To assess whether FER kinase might be involved in the volume-dependent phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, we first investigated whether FER itself undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon cell shrinkage. To address this question, various cell types (CHO cells, embryonic fibroblasts, Swiss 3T3 cells) were challenged with isotonic or hypertonic solutions, and following cell lysis, FER kinase was immunoprecipitated from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. Under isotonic conditions FER was only minimally tyrosine phosphorylated, whereas osmotic shock (300 mm sucrose) induced a rapid and robust phosphotyrosine accumulation in the kinase in each fibroblastic cell line tested (Fig. 1, A andB for CHO cells, and C for embryonic fibroblasts; data not shown for 3T3). Phosphorylation was also evoked when tonicity was increased by sorbitol, or to a somewhat lesser extent by NaCl, indicating that the type of osmolyte was not critical as long as membrane-impermeant molecules were used (not shown). In contrast, the membrane-permeable urea, which elevates both intra- and extracellular osmolarity but causes only marginal volume change, failed to induce significant FER phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). This finding indicates that the critical stimulus for hypertonicity-induced FER phosphorylation, similar to that of cortactin, is a reduction in cell volume and not an increase in the osmolarity per se. The more detailed analysis of the dependence of FER phosphorylation on time and osmolarity was performed in embryonic fibroblast, because previously we used the wild type and Fyn-deficient versions of this cell type to show that Fyn kinase is involved in hypertonic cortactin phosphorylation (6Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C demonstrates that in these cells, FER phosphorylation triggered by 300 mm sucrose became clearly visible after 2 min and increased further with time, for as long as 30 min. Moreover, FER was sensitive to small changes in medium osmolarity; a 25–50 mosm increase in the external osmotic concentration for 10 min was sufficient to elicit detectable tyrosine phosphorylation, and the response became stronger with increasing hypertonicity. Changes in osmolarity did not affect the amount of immunoprecipitated FER. To test whether the increased phosphorylation of the kinase is associated with a rise in its activity, FER was immunoprecipitated from lysates obtained from isotonically or hypertonically treated cells, andin vitro kinase assays were performed using angiotensin II as a preferred FER substrate (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cell shrinkage resulted in ≈70% increase in FER activity (Fig.2 A, panel WT), an activation that is similar in magnitude to the effect of platelet-derived growth factor-induced FER stimulation is Swiss 3T3 cells (15Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data show that FER is an osmosensitive kinase that is both phosphorylated and activated by a decrease in cell volume.Figure 1Volume-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FER kinase. CHO cells (A andB) or wild type embryonic fibroblasts (C) were serum-deprived and then challenged with isotonic (ISO) or hypertonic (HYP) solutions. If not stated otherwise, hypertonicity was added in the form of 300 mm sucrose (final osmolarity, 600 mosm) for 10 min. Where indicated, CHO cells were preincubated with 10 μm PP2 and then exposed to the hypertonic solution containing the same drug concentration. After treatment the cells were lysed, and FER kinase was immunoprecipitated (IP) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The precipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (WB) using the indicated antibodies. A, blots were first probed with antiphosphotyrosine (Anti-PY), and then the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-FER.

https://openalex.org/W2325258348,"When 3T6 cells are confluent, they withdraw from the cell cycle. Concomitant with cell cycle arrest a significant reduction in RNA polymerase I transcription (80% decrease at 100% confluence) is observed. In the present study, we examined mechanism(s) through which transcription of the ribosomal genes is coupled to cell cycle arrest induced by cell density. Interestingly with an increase in cell density (from 3–43% confluence), a significant accumulation in the cellular content of hyperphosphorylated Rb was observed. As cell density increased further, the hypophosphorylated form of Rb became predominant and accumulated in the nucleoli. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated there was also a significant rise in the amount of hypophosphorylated Rb associated with the rDNA transcription factor UBF. This increased interaction between Rb and UBF correlated with the reduced rate of rDNA transcription. Furthermore, overexpression of recombinant Rb inhibited UBF-dependent activation of transcription from a cotransfected rDNA reporter in either confluent or exponential cells. The amounts or activities of the rDNA transcription components we examined did not significantly change with cell cycle arrest. Although the content of PAF53, a polymerase associated factor, was altered marginally (decreased 38%), the time course and magnitude of the decrease did not correlate with the reduced rate of rDNA transcription. The results presented support a model wherein regulation of the binding of UBF to Rb and, perhaps the cellular content of PAF53, are components of the mechanism through which cell cycle and rDNA transcription are linked."
https://openalex.org/W2044237765,"The Myc proto-oncogene family members have been identified as the cellular homologs of the transforming oncogene of avian retroviruses. They encode central regulators of mammalian cell proliferation and apoptosis, and they associate with the bHLHZip protein Max to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate the expression of genes important for cell cycle progression. The other family members, Mad1, Mxi1, Mad3, Mad4 and Rox (Mnt) antagonize their activities. The Mads and Rox compete with Myc in heterodimerizing with Max and in binding to the same specific target sequences. These Mads:Max and Rox:Max dimers repress transcription through binding to the mSIN3 corepressor protein and by tethering histone deacetylase-containing complexes to the DNA. In a screen for Rox interactors we isolated Mlx, a bHLHZip protein previously identified in a screen for Mad1 interactors. In the present work we extend the known dimerization partners of Mlx by demonstrating its ability to interact with Rox. Moreover, we show that contrary to previous reports Mlx is able to homodimerize and to bind E-box sequences at low concentration levels. The possible role of Mlx in an emerging regulatory pathway and acting parallel to the Max driven network is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1974376869,"Fibronectin extracellular matrix plays a critical role in the microenvironment of cells. Loss of this matrix frequently accompanies oncogenic transformation, allowing changes in cell growth, morphology, and tissue organization. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line is deficient in formation of fibronectin matrix fibrils but assembly can be induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Here we show that fibronectin assembly can also be restored by stimulation of alpha5beta1 integrin with activating antibody or with Mn2+ suggesting that integrin activity is reduced in these cells. While dexamethasone promoted actin stress fiber formation, actin filaments remained cortical following Mn2+ treatment showing that the dexamethasone effect is not due solely to cytoskeletal changes. HT1080 cells have one activated allele of N-ras and PD98059 inhibition of signaling from Ras through ERK increased fibronectin matrix accumulation. Conversely, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 blocked induction of matrix and increased ERK phosphorylation. Thus, two MAP kinase pathways contribute to the control of integrin-mediated fibronectin assembly. ERK activity and fibronectin assembly were linked in three different ras-transformed cell lines but not in SV40- or RSV-transformed cells indicating that oncogenic Ras uses a distinct mechanism to down-regulate cell-fibronectin interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2008119136,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 is a positive modulator of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and a putative substrate of the transforming non-receptor tyrosine kinase v-Src. To characterize the role of Shp-2 in cellular transformation and signaling by v-Src, we expressed v-Src in normal and Shp-2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts. Expression of Shp-2 was found to be necessary for morphological transformation by v-Src: Shp-2+/+ cells became rounded or spindly upon v-Src expression, whereas Shp-2-deficient cells remained relatively flat. v-Src-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of podosomes were compromised in Shp-2-deficient cells. Shp-2 deficiency also reduced v-Src-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic protein kinase Akt. The reduced activation of Akt in Shp-2-deficient cells correlated with a reduction in the association of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase with the adapter protein Cbl. Activation of PI3-kinase by v-Src may be mediated by the association of the adapter protein Cbl with the p85 subunit. Since activation of Akt is dependent on PI3-kinase, this suggests that the effect of Shp-2 on Akt activation may be mediated, at least in part, by its effects on the interaction between PI3-kinase and Cbl. The defect in activation of the Akt survival pathway also correlated with enhanced sensitivity of Shp-2-deficient cells to an apoptosis-inducing agent. These results implicate Shp-2 in v-Src-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and activation of the Akt cell survival pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2057874510,"The c-myc gene is frequently over-expressed in human cancers and is involved in regulation of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. c-Myc is a transcription factor that acts primarily by regulating the expression of other genes. However, it has been very difficult to identify bona fide c-Myc target genes that explain its diverse biological activities. The recent generation of c-myc deficient Rat1A fibroblasts with a profound and stable growth defect provides a new system to search for genes that can substitute for c-myc in proliferation. In this study, we have attempted to identify genes that rescue the slow growth phenotype of c-myc null cells through introduction of a series of potent cell cycle regulatory genes and several retroviral cDNA expression libraries. None of the candidate genes tested, including SV40 T-antigen and adenovirus E1A, caused reversal of the c-myc null growth defect. Furthermore, extensive screens with high-complexity retroviral cDNA libraries from three different tissue sources revealed that only c-myc and N-myc rescued the c-myc null slow-growth phenotype. Our data support the notion that there are no functional equivalents of the myc family of proto-oncogenes and also suggest that there are no c-Myc-activated genes that alone can substitute for c-Myc in control of cell proliferation."

The activatory effects of norepinephrine and retinoic acid (RA) on rodent ucp1gene transcription have been well characterized. These effects are mediated by a 211-base pair (bp) enhancer which is also sufficient to restrict expression to brown adipose tissue. The molecular mechanisms controlling the transcription of the human ucp1 gene are unknown. In order to study the transcriptional regulation of the human gene, we set up chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs containing the entire or deleted 5′ regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of the gene. These constructs were transiently transfected in a mouse cell line. A 350-bp hormone response region showing a significant homology with the rat ucp1 enhancer and located between theBclI polymorphic site and an AatII site (bp −3820/−3470) was detected. This region was sufficient to mediate the stimulation by RA and by combined treatments (RA + isoproterenol (ISO), RA + thiazolidinedione (TZD), or RA + ISO + TZD). The highest stimulation, a 26-fold increase in basal activity, was obtained by RA + ISO + TZD treatment. In contrast to the rodent gene, under our conditions, the effect of ISO and/or TZD is dependent on RA stimulation. Analysis of 105 bp inside the 350-bp element by site-directed mutagenesis and gel retardation experiments demonstrated that a multipartite response element mediates the drug stimulation. This region binds RARs and RXRs nuclear factors, CREB/ATF factors, and also PPARγ despite the absence of a consensus peroxisome-proliferator response element.

UCP1 stimulates heat production by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation (1Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). The amount of UCP1 determines the thermogenic potential of BAT. In rodents it has been demonstrated that this tissue can dissipate energy as heat in response to cold exposure or to excessive ingestion of calories (2Himms-Hagen J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1985; 5: 69-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent results obtained with transgenic mice after genetic BAT ablation showed that these mice undergo excessive weight gain (3Lowell B.B. Susulic S.V. Hamann A. Lawitts J.A. Himms-Hagen J. Boyer B.B. Kozak L.P. Flier J.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). However, disruption of the mouseucp1 gene demonstrated that the main role of UCP1 was to maintain body temperature in a cold environment (4Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The main control of UCP1 biosynthesis is situated at the transcriptional level (5Ricquier D. Mory G.

Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in ucp1 gene transcription and ucp1 mRNA is observed within minutes of cold exposure or exogenous catecholamine administration (7Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Toumelin P. Mory G. Bazin R.

BAT sympathetic stimulation, via norepinephrine and cAMP, is the primary signal in activation of ucp1 expression in rodents, but other factors, such as thyroid hormones, are critical for a full physiological response (see Ref. 9Silva J.E. Rabelo R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar for review). It has also been reported that retinoids (10Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Larose M. Matamala J.C.

Over the last few years, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of rodent ucp1 gene expression have been partially elucidated. A 211-bp enhancer located at positions bp −2494 to bp −2283 upstream of the transcription start site in the ratucp1 gene has been described (14Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Gelly C. Fox N. Schrementi J. Raimbault S. Klaus S. Forest C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Using transgenic mice it has been concluded that the tissue specificity of the ucp1expression in the rat is only due to the 211-bp enhancer (15Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Gelly C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this enhancer, the presence of a ucp1-gene activating region (UAR) is absolutely required for norepinephrine and RA stimulation, but to achieve RA responsiveness 92-bp containing UAR and forming the 5′ moiety of the 211-bp enhancer are necessary (16Rabelo R. Reyes C. Schifman A. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3488-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Larose M. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Fleury C. Serra F. Champigny O. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31533-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies with the mouse gene have revealed a similar enhancer between bp −2530 and bp −2310 (18Kozak U.C. Kopecky J. Teisinger J. Enerback S. Boyer B. Kozak L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Two elements essential for mouse enhancer function (CRE-2/BRE-1) have been identified downstream of the rat UAR, in the equivalent 92-bp region (18Kozak U.C. Kopecky J. Teisinger J. Enerback S. Boyer B. Kozak L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). By using in vitro analysis, a PPRE element binding PPARγ-RXRα heterodimers was described (19Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This element is located in the equivalent 92-bp region of the mouse gene. It has previously been demonstrated that PPARγ plays an important role in processing preadipocyte differentiation (20Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). In humans, the functional role of BAT is still under discussion. BAT is detected in newborns but its thermogenic activity decreases rapidly after birth (21Lean M.E. James W.P. Jennings G. Trayhurn P. Clin. Sci. 1986; 71: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In young humans, BAT seems to be converted into white adipose tissue as has been described for ruminants (22Casteilla L. Champigny O. Bouillaud F. Robelin J. Ricquier D. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Finn D. Lomax M.A. Trayhurn P. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it is possible to detect BAT in certain conditions: in outdoor workers exposed to cold conditions (24Huttunen P. Hirvonen J. Kinnula V. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 46: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or in several pathological situations such as pheochromocytoma or hibernoma (21Lean M.E. James W.P. Jennings G. Trayhurn P.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 415-441Google Scholar). UCP1 anducp1 mRNA were detected by Western and Northern analysis in the perirenal fat of many patients (27Garruti G. Ricquier D. Int. J. Obes. 1992; 16: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). More recently,ucp1 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the adipose deposits of adults (28Krief S. Lonnqvist F. Raimbault S. Baude B. Van Spronsen A. Arner P. Strosberg A.D. Ricquier D. Emorine L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We previously cloned and sequenced the human ucp1 gene (29Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A polymorphic BclI site was described in the upstream region of the transcriptional unit at position bp −3826 (30Oppert J.M. Vohl M.C. Chagnon M. Dionne F.T. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Ricquier D. Perusse L. Bouchard C. Int. J. Obes. 1994; 18: 526-531PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Bouillaud F. Chagnon M. Gelly C. Dionne F.T. Oppert J.M. Bouchard C. Chagnon Y. Ricquier D. Int. J. Obes. 1996; 20: 278-279PubMed Google Scholar). This polymorphism was associated with percentage fat gain over time, suggesting a role for the ucp1 gene in regulation of fat content in humans. The aim of our study was to investigate the regulation of the humanucp1 gene expression. In this report, we describe that the transcription of the human ucp1 gene can be strongly activated by hormones and drugs. An enhancer, which is partly homologous to the rat and the mouse ucp1 enhancer, controls these effects. This region is located close to the polymorphicBclI site. Although the human enhancer is in part homologous to rodent enhancers, molecular mechanisms implicated in the stimulation by drugs are different. In particular, the β-adrenergic and the TZD stimulations have an effect only in the presence of RA. It is shown that a multipartite element mediates the stimulation of the humanucp1 gene by drugs. These studies will facilitate the search for compounds activating substrate oxidation and thermogenesis in humans. DNA restriction, modification enzymes, and oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) or New England Biolabs (Ozyme, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France).32P-Labeled nucleotide triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France). Fetal calf serum, LipofectAMINE, and culture products were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Antibodies against ATF and PPARγ were from Santa Cruz (Tebu, Le perray-en-Yvelines, France). The Gene-Editor Mutagenesis kit was from Promega Biotech (Charbonnieres, France), and the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). Columns for plasmid purification were from Qiagen (Courtaboeuf, France). Other chemical products were from Sigma Aldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). The sequence homologies of enhancers were analyzed using the DNA strider program (version 1.3). Polymerase chain reaction was done in Gene-amp-6000 from PerkinElmer Life Science (Courtaboeuf, France) and sequences were analyzed using the prism cyclic sequencing kits and an ABI 373 DNA sequencer. The humanucp1 −6300 bp chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid (−6300CAT) was constructed by ligating aBglII-KpnI fragment (bp −6233 to +91) from a 7-kb PstI fragment of the human ucp1 gene in theSalI blunt site of PBLCAT6 (32Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst. ). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Different restriction sites were used to generate several deleted 6300CAT constructs: −3820CAT plasmid (deletion BglII-BclI) and −2790CAT plasmid (deletion BglII-DraIII). After restriction digestion, plasmids were blunt-ended using Klenow polymerase and ligated. Internal deletions were generated from the 6300CAT construct. Three deletions were made after insertion of aBclI site by mutation at the required nucleotide: 6300CAT del 350 plasmid (deletion from bp −3820 to bp −3470), 6300CAT del 90 plasmid (deletion from bp −3820 to bp −3762), 6300CAT del 60 plasmid (deletion from bp −3762 to bp −3705). The 1-kb TK-CAT plasmid was constructed by insertion of the BclI/DraIII fragment of the human region as a blunt fragment in the repairedSalI site of PBLCAT5 (32Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst. ). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in both orientations: −3820/−2790TK and −2790/−3820TK. Successive deletions were generated using these constructions. After restriction digestion, plasmids were blunt-ended by Klenow polymerase and ligated: −3328/−2790TK (digestion by HindIII of the −3820/−2790TK), −3328/−3820TK (digestion by HindIII of the −2790/−3820TK), −3820/−3470TK named 350-TK-CAT (digestion byXbaI and AatII of the −3820/−2790TK), and −3470/−3820TK (digestion by AatII and HindIII of the −2790/−3820TK). The Bsu36I linearized 350-TK-CAT plasmid was used to perform constructs by using the Bal-31 exonuclease. After blunt endings, fragments were ligated, transformed, and analyzed. Three plasmids were selected: 350bal 51 (bp −3820/−3622 to bp −3527/−2790), 350bal1 (bp −3820/−3682 to bp −3600/−2790), 350bal15 (bp −3820/−3716 to bp −3602/−2790). We also generated two deleted plasmids from the 350TK-CAT plasmid: 350TK del60 and 350TK del47. They were created by insertion of a BclI site as described previously on the 6300CAT and after deletion from bp −3762 to −3705 and bp −3734 to −3684, respectively. The 105-TK-CAT plasmid was constructed by insertion of a 105-bp double strand oligonucleotide (bp −3743/−3636) in the blunt-ended SalI site of PBLCAT5 in the two orientations. Mutations in the 105-TK-CAT construct were inserted by using the Promega Gene-Editor kit, except for the E105TK mutant where the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit was used. Deletions and mutations of all clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. An immortalized mouse adipocyte cell line expressing the ucp1 gene, termed 1B8, was used (17Larose M. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Fleury C. Serra F. Champigny O. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31533-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 1B8 cells were grown in standard adipocyte culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After cells reached confluence, fetal calf serum content was reduced to 5% and supplemented with 1 nm T3 and 20 nm insulin until complete differentiation about 1 week later (33Klaus S. Choy L. Champigny O. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Ross S. Spiegelman B. Ricquier D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1B8 cells were transiently transfected in suspension by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Cassard-Doulcier A.M.

In all transfection experiments, 2 μg of plasmid expressing β-galactosidase was included to assess the efficiency of separate transfections. 20 μg of the reporter CAT plasmid was used. After transfection, cells were treated or not with drugs in medium supplemented with 5% charcoal fetal calf serum. After 20 h of treatment, the cells were collected by scraping and β-galactosidase and CAT assays were carried out (34Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst. ). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Each transfection was performed a minimum of 3 times, and at least 2 different preparations of each DNA construct were used. The CAT activity was normalized for variation in transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase activity as standard. Drug concentrations for treatments were 10−6m for thiazolidinedione BRL 49653, all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA, isoproterenol, and norepinephrine, and 10−3m for dibutyryl-cAMP. RA receptor (RARα, RARβ, RARγ, and RXRα) and PPARγ were overexpressed in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of PSG5 expression vector containing RARα, RARβ, RARγ, RXRα, or PPARγ cDNAs by the LipofectAMINE method. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 2 μg in each transfection. After transfection, cells were grown for 20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in L buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thawing. After centrifugation the supernatant was aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear proteins were isolated from 1B8 cells according to a Shapiro modified preparation (35Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, oligonucleotides were end-labeled using α-dATP and Klenow polymerase enzyme and purified on spin columns. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) was included in each reaction mixture as a nonspecific competitor. The final reaction volume was 20 μl. Nuclear extracts were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min with dI-dC in the reaction buffer before the addition of 0.3 ng of a32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe (30000 cpm) and followed by a second 20-min incubation in the presence of the probe. In the competition experiments, a 25-, 50-, or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was included in each binding reaction. When antiserum was used, binding reactions were incubated with antiserum for 20 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of the probe. The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides were as follows from the 5′ to 3′ extremities: 43 (agctAAGGGTCAGTTGCCCTTGCTCATACTGACCTATTCTTTACCTC), 43mutB (agctAACCCTCTGTTGCCCTTGCTCATACTGACCTATTCTTTACCTC), 43mutC (agctAAGGGTCAGTTGCCCTTTTTCTTACTGACCTATTCTTTACCTC), 43mutE (agctAAGGGTCAGTGACTAGTGCTCATACTGACCTATTCTTTACCTC), 43mutD (agctAAGGGTCAGTTGCCCTTGCTCATACGACTAGATTCTTTACCTC), 43mutB/C (agctAACCCTCTGTTGCCCTTTTTCTTACTGACCTATTCTTTACCTC), RA/CREB (aaTTGCTACGTCATAAAGGGTCAGTTGCCCTTGCTCATACTG), CREB consensus (aattCCAGGGCTTTGGGAGTGACGCGCGTCTG), DR1 (aattCTGTGACCTCTGACCTAG). A 2-kb upstream region of the human ucp1gene has been cloned and sequenced (29Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, this region was not able to direct specific expression of ucp1 gene in brown adipose cells. 2A-M. Cassard-Doulcier, unpublished data. A 7-kb fragment of the 5′ region of the human ucp1 gene was cloned and entirely sequenced. The start site has not yet been well defined due to difficulties in obtaining high quality poly(A)+mRNA from human brown adipose tissue and the first T of the TATA box was defined as the +1 (29Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the upstream region, a plasmid containing the entire 5′ region (bp −6233 to +91) upstream of the bacterial cat gene was constructed. This plasmid was referred to as −6300CAT construct and was used in transient transfection experiments of mouse 1B8 cells. After 20 h of incubation in the presence or absence of drugs, CAT activity was determined in cell lysates and the values were normalized for differences in transfection efficiency. Treatment with retinoids (all-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA) caused a slight increase in the basal activity (Fig. 1). No stimulation by only β-adrenergic agonists as ISO (Fig. 1) or norepinephrine (data not shown), or by cAMP (data not shown), was detected. In addition, thiazolidinedione alone (BRL 49653-TZD) had no effect (Fig. 1). Combined treatments were tested and in those conditions a stimulation was detected by RA and TZD or RA and ISO. No stimulation was noted with a combined TZD and ISO treatment (data not shown). The addition of TZD increased more than 3-fold the stimulation obtained by RA alone whereas the effect of ISO was only less than twice. The combination of the three drugs (RA, ISO, and TZD) induced a very large increase in the basal activity. These results underlined that RA was necessary to observe a stimulation by ISO and/or TZD. ISO was described previously as an inducer of the rodent gene (7Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Toumelin P. Mory G. Bazin R. Arch J. Penicaud L. J. Biol.

To verify that under our conditions, there was not any possible defect in the ISO transduction signal, the same experiments were repeated with the rat ucp1 gene. β-Adrenergic agonist alone increased the transcriptional activity of the rat transgene 6-fold (data not shown), in agreement with previous results (14Cassard-Doulcier A.M.

The stimulation of the endogenous mouseucp1 gene transcription in the presence of ISO, or the other drugs used, was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). These observations were in agreement with a normal ISO transduction signal in 1B8 cells. The ISO response, under the same conditions, was different for the rodent genes compared with the human gene, so the different behavior seemed intrinsic to the human gene. Nevertheless, it should be considered that transient transfections were made in a 1B8 mouse cell line, which could interfere with the normal activity of the human gene. It is possible that the dependence of the human gene to retinoids could be due to different intrinsic level of retinoids in human brown adipose cells compared with 1B8 mouse cells. To further delineate the regulating regions of the humanucp1 gene, several CAT constructs containing different fragments of the 6300-bp region were performed. The −2790CAT construct did not show any drug stimulation (Fig. 1). In contrast, the −3820CAT construct was able to drive a transcriptional activity stimulated by drugs alike the original plasmid (−6300CAT) although the maximal stimulation (RA + ISO + TZD) was lower. Therefore, since the qualitative characteristics of the original promoter were retained in this construct we continued our studies by examining the region comprised between bp −3820 and −2790. This region was cloned in either orientation in front of the tk-heterologous promoter and the cat reporter gene (−3820/−2790TK and −2790/−3820TK in Fig. 2). Since according to previous experiments the presence of RA is a prerequisite for stimulation of the human ucp1 promoter, the effect of ISO and TZD were examined in the context of the RA stimulation. Results presented in the Fig. 2 showed that the bp −3820 to −2790 region was able to trigger stimulation by drugs. It should be noticed that the maximal rate of stimulation obtained with the −3820/−2790TK construct in the presence of the three drugs (35-fold increase in Fig. 2) was higher than with the original −6300CAT construct (16-fold increase in Fig. 1). The pattern was slightly different since stimulation by RA alone was markedly enhanced with the 1-kb region constructs. This reinforced the idea that the essential regulatory elements mediating the RA, ISO, and TZD effects were retained within the bp −3820 to −2790 region.Figure 1Stimulation of human ucp1gene promoter by retinoids and other drugs. Delineation of a responding sequence between bp −3820 and −2790. Duplicate dishes of 1B8 cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of the reporter gene and 2 μg of a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase under the control of SV40 promoter. The cells were incubated for 20 h in medium supplemented with 5% charcoal fetal calf serum and treated or not with drugs. The plasmids used were: −6300CAT, −3820CAT, and −2790CAT. They have been previously described (see “Experimental Procedures”). Drug concentrations were: 10−6m thiazolidinedione BRL 49653 (TZD), 10−6m all-trans-RA (RA), 10−6m isoproterenol (ISO).

https://openalex.org/W2050935005,"Burkitt's lymphomas harbour chromosomal translocations bringing c-MYC into the vicinity of one of the immunoglobulin gene loci. Point mutations have been described within c-MYC in several Burkitt's lymphomas and it has been proposed that translocation into the Ig loci might have transformed c-MYC into a substrate for the antibody hypermutation mechanism. Here we test this hypothesis by exploiting a Burkitt's lymphoma line (Ramos) that we have previously shown to hypermutate its immunoglobulin genes constitutively. We find that, during in vitro culture, Ramos mutates the c-MYC allele that is translocated into the IgH locus whilst leaving the untranslocated c-MYC and other control genes essentially unaffected. The mutations are introduced downstream of the c-MYC transcription start with the pattern of substitutions being characteristic of the antibody hypermutation mechanism; the mutation frequency is 2-3-fold lower than for the endogenous functional IgH allele. Thus chromosomal translocations involving the Ig loci may not only contribute to transformation by deregulating oncogene expression but could also act by potentiating subsequent oncogene hypermutation."

It thus appears that the inhibition of NF-κB by ASK1 may result at least in part from the disruption of the TRAF6·TAK1 complex formation in the IL-1 signaling pathway.

In the MAPK signaling cascades, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) phosphorylates and activates MAPK, and MAPKK is phosphorylated and activated by an immediately upstream kinase termed MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). The MAPK cascade (MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK) is evolutionarily conserved and plays essential roles from yeast to metazoan (5Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Int. Rev.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) was identified as a member of the MAPKKK family that activated two different MAPK cascades, SEK1/MKK7-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also called stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)) and MKK3/MKK6-p38 pathways (9Ichijo H.

Overexpression of wild-type or the constitutively active form of ASK1 has been reported to induce apoptosis in various cell types (9Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T.

On the other hand, we have recently found that in naive PC12 cells moderate expression of a constitutively active form of ASK1 induced neuronal differentiation or even survival (15Takeda K. Hatai T. Hamazaki T. Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, low and high expression of exogenous ASK1 in keratinocytes induced differentiation and apoptosis, respectively. 2K. Sayama, Y. Hanakawa, Y. Shirakata, K. Yamasaki, Y. Sawada, L. Sun, K. Yamanishi, H. Ichijo, and K. Hashimoto, submitted for publication. These results suggest that ASK1 has a broad range of biological activities depending on cell types, cellular context, or the extent of ASK1 activation. Importantly, ASK1 expression was highly but transiently induced upon epithelial wounding (17Funato N. Moriyama K. Saitoh M. Baba M. Ichijo H. Kuroda T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 477-483PubMed Google Scholar) and spinal cord injury (18Nakahara S. Yone K. Sakou T. Wada S. Nagamine T. Niiyama T. Ichijo H. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), indicating that regulation of ASK1 expression may also be an important step to control pathophysiological roles of ASK1 in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), another MAPKKK family protein (19Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), can also be activated by a number of stimuli, including TGF-β, TNF, Fas, IL-1, ultraviolet, sorbitol, and ceramide (19Yamaguchi K.

In addition, TAK1 mediates the IL-1-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar); IL-1 induces recruitment of TAK1 to an adaptor protein known as TRAF6 and thereby activates TAK1 kinase activity. Activated TAK1 phosphorylates and activates another MAPKKK-like kinase named NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase), which ultimately induces NF-κB activation through the IκB kinase-IκB-NF-κB cascade. NF-κB plays a broad range of roles in controlling gene expression such as inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, chemokines, interferons, growth factors, and viruses (23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that the activation of NF-κB leads to protection of cells from apoptosis. Mice lacking RelA/p65, a member of the NF-κB family, die embryonically from extensive apoptosis in the liver (24Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). In addition, the sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis is enhanced in some cells expressing a dominant negative form of IκB (25Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 26Antwerp D.V. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a close link between death and survival signals involving MAPK and NF-κB cascades. In the present study, we identified TAK1 as an interacting partner of ASK1. ASK1 inhibited IL-1-, TRAF6-, or TAK1- but not NIK-induced NF-κB activation. ASK1 dissociated TAK1 but not NIK from TRAF6, suggesting that the disruption of the IL-1-induced TRAF6-TAK1 complex may be one of the mechanisms how ASK1 inhibits IL-1-induced NF-κB activity. The human embryonic kidney 293 cells and IL-1 type I receptor-transfected 293 cells (293 IL-1 RI) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing a high concentration of glucose (4.5 mg/ml), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Recombinant human IL-1 β was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A human fetal brain cDNA library in the pJG4–5 prey plasmid was screened for proteins that interact with ASK1-K709R using the EGY188 yeast host strain as described previously (10Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Plasmids of positive clones were recovered; the cDNA inserts were sequenced, and TAK1 (347–579 amino acids) was identified. To assay the interaction between TAK1 and mutant ASK1, TAK1 and ASK1 constructs were cotransformed along with the reporter plasmid pJK103 into EGY48 yeast strain. Then Ura+Trp+ His+ transformants were tested on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Calbiochem)-containing plates. Hemagglutinin (HA)-or Myc-tagged ASK1 cDNAs and adenovirus constructs encoding HA-tagged wild-type ASK1 or β-galactosidase have been described previously (9Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P.

The full length of TAK1 yeast expression plasmid, HA- or Myc-tagged TAK1 expression plasmid, TAB1 expression plasmid, and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against TAK1, TAB1, and TRAF6 were previously described (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 31Kashiwada M. Shirakata Y. Inoue J.I. Nakano H. Okazaki K. Okumura K. Yamamoto T. Nagaoka H. Takemori T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged TRAF6 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Transfection was performed with Tfx-50 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine protein interaction in 293 cells, transfected cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1.5% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were divided and incubated with 1 μg of the anti-HA antibody (Clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 5 μg of the anti-FLAG antibody (Clone M2, SIGMA), or 1 μg of the anti-Myc antibody (Clone 9E10, Calbiochem). After addition of protein A-, or protein G-Sepharose 4B conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), the lysates were incubated for an additional 30 min, and the beads were washed two or three times with the lysis buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) in the presence of 10 mmdithiothreitol, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C-super, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or anti-HA (Clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibody. The aliquots of whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to confirm appropriate expression of transfected expression plasmids. The proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 293 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates. On the following day, the cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors using Tfx-50 (Promega). The total amount of cDNA was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Every transfection included 100 ng of the reporter plasmid, together with either 10 ng of pSV7d-β-galactosidase or pEF-Renilla for normalization of transfection efficiency. As a reporter plasmid, the Ig-κ-luciferase reporter gene that contains three tandem repeats of κB motifs was used (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were lysed in a luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Where indicated, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml IL-1β for 6 h. The lysates were divided and analyzed for firefly luciferase andRenilla activities using a luminometer (LB953, EG & G Berthold). β-Galactosidase activities were determined by the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega) using a plate reader at 405 nm (Immuno-mini NJ-2300, Intermed). All of the luciferase experiments were performed in duplicate. To confirm appropriate expressions of transfected plasmids, the lysates of duplicated wells were combined and subjected to Western blot analysis. Essentially identical results were obtained when an E-selectin promoter-derived NF-κB luciferase reporter was used in the same sets of experiment (data not shown). To explore the roles of ASK1, we have employed a yeast two-hybrid screening using kinase-inactive form of ASK1 as bait (10Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin was recently isolated by this assay and was shown to be a physiological inhibitor of ASK1 (10Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). During the course of screening, we identified several positive clones that are unrelated to thioredoxin. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that one of them encoded a member of MAPKKK family known as TAK1. To localize the TAK1-interacting region in ASK1, we tested a set of ASK1 deletion mutants for TAK1 binding by a two-hybrid assay (Fig.1 A). Wild-type (ASK1-WT), N-terminal (ASK1-NT), and C-terminal (ASK1-CT) fragments of ASK1, but not a fragment of the kinase domain alone (ASK1-K), directly interacted with full-length TAK1 (Fig. 1 A). We next determined whether the association between ASK1 and TAK1 occurs in mammalian cells. Myc-tagged wild-type TAK1 (Myc-TAK1) was transiently transfected in 293 cells together with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged mutant forms of ASK1. Cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and coimmunoprecipitated TAK1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 B, top panel). Consistent with the two-hybrid assays, TAK1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with ASK1-WT, ASK1-NT, and ASK1-CT but not with ASK1-K (Fig. 1, B andC). These results indicate that ASK1 can form a complex with TAK1 through its N- and C-terminal noncatalytic domains. Since ASK1 and TAK1 have both been shown to activate JNK and p38 MAPK cascades, we first examined whether formation of ASK1·TAK1 complex within the cells may synergize to activate these MAPK cascades. To this end, expression vectors of JNK or p38 were cotransfected in 293 cells together with ASK1 and/or TAK1, and the JNK and p38 activity was determined, respectively. However, no synergistic activation of JNK or p38 was observed in the presence of ASK1 and TAK1 (data not shown). Certain MAPKKKs such as TAK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), and tumor progression locus 2 (Tpl-2) have been reported to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway as well (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar,32Sakurai H. Shigemori N. Hasegawa K. Sugita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, TAK1 was clearly shown to activate NF-κB in response to IL-1 (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether ASK1 is involved in the IL-1-induced NF-κB pathway by using NF-κB-dependent reporter gene assays. Without IL-1 treatment, overexpression of ASK1-WT had no effect on the basal activity of the reporter gene (Fig.2 A, columns 1–4); however, IL-1-induced NF-κB activity was significantly reduced by the expression of ASK1-WT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A, columns 5–8). In the IL-1 signaling pathway, TRAF6-TAK1-NIK cascade has been reported to constitute an essential axis (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), in that IL-1-induced TRAF6·TAK1 complex activates TAK1 kinase and the activated TAK1 phosphorylates and activates NIK (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). To examine whether ASK1 targets TAK1 in this pathway, the effect of ASK1 expression on the TAK1-induced NF-κB activity was determined. Myc-TAK1 and its activator TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 1 (28Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with ASK1, and the NF-κB activities were determined by luciferase assay (Fig. 2 B). TAK1 strongly activated NF-κB as previously reported (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). Coexpression of ASK1-WT inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation without changing the expression level of TAK1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–10). ASK1-KM, a catalytically inactive form of ASK1, inhibited also the TAK1-dependent NF-κB activation, indicating that the observed inhibition does not require the kinase activity of ASK1. Moreover, ASK1-NT and ASK1-CT, but not ASK1-K, inhibited TAK1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11–22), which is consistent with the binding properties of these mutants to TAK1 as shown in Fig. 1. These results suggest that binding of ASK1 may physically interfere with the TAK1-dependent NF-κB activation. To identify the mechanism how ASK1 inhibits TAK1-induced NF-κB activity, we first examined whether ASK1 disrupts TAB1·TAK1 active complex (Fig. 3 A). HA-TAK1, Myc-TAB1, and Myc-ASK1 were transiently cotransfected into 293 cells, and TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody to detect TAK1-bound TAB1 and ASK1. In the presence or absence of ASK1, the amount of TAB1 coprecipitated with TAK1 was unchanged (Fig.3 A, top panel, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that ASK1 binds TAK1 without affecting the TAB1-TAK1 interaction. This suggests that ASK1 may inhibit TAK1-induced NF-κB activity in a mechanism independent of TAB1·TAK1 complex formation.Figure 3ASK1 dissociates TAK1 but not NIK from TRAF6. A, ASK1 does not disrupt the TAB1·TAK1 complex. HA-TAK1, Myc-TAB1, and Myc-ASK1-WT were transiently cotransfected into 293 cells, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. The expression of transfected plasmid was verified by Western blotting in the same lysates.

After 24 h, cells were treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody.

Yeh W. Sarori I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Most important, we have previously shown that TRAF6 interacts with ASK1 (27Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). ASK1 might thus target TRAF6 as well as TAK1 to exert its inhibitory effect on NF-κB. We examined the effects of ASK1 on TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2 C). Overexpression of TRAF6 activated NF-κB activity (37Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 38Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C, lane 7). Very similar to TAK1-induced NF-κB activity, ASK1-WT, ASK1-KM, ASK1-NT, and ASK1-CT but not ASK1-K inhibited TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 C, lanes 8–20). In contrast, NIK-induced NF-κB activity was not affected by the expression of ASK1 (Fig. 2 D), indicating that ASK1-dependent inhibition of NF-κB activity is not a nonspecific event. Based on the above data indicating that ASK1 specifically targets TRAF6 and TAK1 in the IL-1-induced TRAF6-TAK1-NIK signaling module, we hypothesized that ASK1 may affect TRAF6-TAK1 binding and thereby inhibit IL-1-induced NF-κB activity. We thus investigated the effect of ASK1 expression on the TRAF6-TAK1 interaction. FLAG-TRAF6, Myc-TAK1, and HA-ASK1 were transiently cotransfected into 293 cells, and TRAF6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies to detect TRAF6-bound TAK1 and ASK1, respectively. TAK1 was clearly found to associate with TRAF6 in the absence of ASK1 expression (Fig. 3 B, top panel, lane 7). When ASK1 was coexpressed, TAK1 bound to TRAF6 was greatly decreased (Fig. 3 B, top panel, lanes 8–10). Reciprocally, ASK1 was found to associate with TRAF6 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B, second panel, lanes 8–10). When the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, coprecipitated TRAF6 was detected in TAK1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 C, top panel, lane 6). When ASK1 was coexpressed (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7–9), TRAF6 bound to TAK1 became undetectable. In contrast, ASK1 was coprecipitated with TAK1 (Fig. 3 C, second panel, lanes 7–9). These results strongly suggest that overexpression of ASK1 takes TRAF6 and TAK1 away from the TRAF6·TAK1 complex and thereby inhibits TRAF6·TAK1 signaling complex leading to NF-κB activation. To confirm that this mechanism is operating indeed when ASK1 inhibits IL-1-induced NF-κB activation, IL-1-induced complex formation between endogenous TAK1 and TRAF6 was determined in the presence of ASK1 (Fig.3 D). Adenovirus-mediated expression of ASK1 but not control β-galactosidase blocked the IL-1-induced coimmunoprecipitation of TRAF6 with TAK1 (Fig. 3 D, top panel), indicating that ASK1 inhibits IL-1-induced NF-κB activation at least in part via disruption of TRAF6·TAK1 signaling complex. It has been reported that TRAF6 interacts with NIK as well (39Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We thus also tested whether ASK1 has a similar effect on TRAF6-NIK binding. FLAG-tagged NIK (FLAG-NIK) and Myc-tagged TRAF6 (Myc-TRAF6) were transiently cotransfected, and NIK was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Coimmunoprecipitated TRAF6 with NIK was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. TRAF6 associated with NIK (Fig.3 E, lane 7); in contrast to TRAF6-TAK1 interaction, however, TRAF6-NIK interaction was unaffected by the coexpression of ASK1 (Fig.3 E, lanes 8–10). These results again confirmed that ASK1 specifically targets TRAF6·TAK1 complex in the IL-1-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. Several MAPKKKs or MAPKKK-like molecules, including TAK1, NIK, MEKK1, and tumor progression locus 2/COT, have been demonstrated to activate NF-κB with distinct molecular mechanisms (22Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

In contrast, we show here for the first time that another MAPKKK, ASK1, negatively regulates NF-κB activity. ASK1 had no effect on the basal activity of NF-κB. ASK1 inhibited, however, IL-1-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that ASK1 may play important roles in the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB signaling. Although NF-κB is a central mediator of immune response and required for induction of various inflammatory cytokines (16Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar), NF-κB activity must be shut off after some periods of inflammation in vivo. ASK1 might have such a role. In support of this notion, strong induction of ASK1 expression has been observed in certain pathological situations in vivo, including epithelial wound healing and spinal cord injury (17Funato N. Moriyama K. Saitoh M. Baba M. Ichijo H. Kuroda T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 477-483PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakahara S. Yone K. Sakou T. Wada S. Nagamine T. Niiyama T. Ichijo H. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Finally, this is the first demonstration that a MAPKKK directly interacts with another MAPKKK and influences signals responsible for cell activation. It will be interesting to examine whether other MAPKKKs or MAPKKK-like molecules also cross-talk to each other. Such studies will shed light on how the highly divergent biological activities can be elicited by the limited number of MAP kinase superfamily members. We are grateful to Dr. K. Miyazono for valuable comments and support. We also thank all the members of Cell Signaling Laboratory for their critical comments."
https://openalex.org/W2334639861,"To determine whether the apoptotic machinery of thyroid cancer cells is functional and could be activated for tumoricidal purposes, we examined the apoptosis induced by the cytokines TNF-alpha, Fas and TRAIL in thyroid cancer cell lines, NPA and SW579. Interestingly, out of these cytokines, only TRAIL was able to trigger significant apoptosis. The tumoricidal effect of TRAIL was further enhanced by CHX, suggesting the presence of CHX-sensitive inhibitor(s) of apoptosis in these thyroid cancer cell lines. The anti-apoptotic proteins like FLAME-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are believed to be such CHX-sensitive inhibitors in various types of cancer cells. We, however, provide the evidence using NPA and SW579 cell lines that these proteins were not affected by the CHX treatment in thyroid cancer cells. The apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells was mediated by the classical activation of caspases that in turn activated the DNA Fragmentation Factor (DFF-45). To elucidate the role of individual caspases in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, the inhibitory effects of several general and specific tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors were studied. The inhibitors of caspase-1, -6, -8, and -9 as well as general upstream inhibitors of apoptosis could dramatically inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells. Caspase-2 and -3 inhibitors, on the other hand, had no significant effect. When the cells were treated with either agonistic Fas antibody (CH11) or TNF-alpha, no apoptotic changes were observed. The apoptosis induced by agonistic Fas Ab could be seen only after a prolonged exposure (24 h) to CHX, whereas TNF-alpha had no effect even in the presence of CHX. The efficacy of TRAIL was also tested on other types of thyroid cancer cells like ARO, FRO (anaplastic carcinoma) and TPC-1 (papillary carcinoma) and compared to that triggered by other death inducing cytokines FasL and TNF-alpha. Again TRAIL was more potent in triggering apoptosis than Fas and TNF-alpha. Since TRAIL is effective in selectively killing thyroid tumor cells without affecting normal thyrocytes and also does not cause organ toxicity and inflammation in vivo, its potential for the treatment of thyroid cancer seems very promising."

Subtraction hybridization identified a novel gene associated with transformation progression in mutant adenovirus type 5, H5ts125, transformed rat embryo cells, progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-3). To define the mechanism by which expression of PEG-3 is enhanced as a function of cancer progression a 5′-flanking promoter region of ∼2.0-kb, PEG-Prom, was isolated, cloned and characterized. The full-length and various mutated regions of the PEG-Prom were linked to a luciferase reporter construct and evaluated for promoter activity during cancer progression. These assays demonstrate a requirement for AP1 and PEA3 sites adjacent to the TATA box region of PEG-3 in mediating basal promoter activity and the enhanced expression of PEG-3 in progressed H5-ts125-transformed rat embryo cells. An involvement of AP1 and PEA3 in PEG-3 regulation was also confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and transfection studies with cJun and PEA3 expression vectors. Our findings document the importance of both AP1 and PEA3 transcription factors in mediating basal and elevated expression of PEG-3 in H5ts125-transformed rat embryo cells displaying an aggressive and progressed cancer phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2325138210,"The expression of the monocyte-chemoattractant-protein-1 (MCP-1) is closely linked with a non-tumorigenic phenotype in somatic cell hybrids made between the human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV 18) positive cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and normal human fibroblasts. In contrast, MCP-1 transcription is absent in tumorigenic segregants derived from the same hybrids or in parental HeLa cells. Selectivity of MCP-1 transcription, which is regulated at the level of initiation of transcription, is mainly based on differences in the location and extension of DNAse I-hypersensitive regions (DHSR) at both ends of the gene. While TNF-alpha only moderately increases the sensitivity of pre-existing 5'-DHSRs, a 3'-end DHSR became strongly induced exclusively in non-malignant hybrids. DNA sequencing showed that the 3'-DHSR coincides with an additional AP-1 site located approximately 600 bp downstream of the polyadenylation site. Analyses of AP-1 composition revealed that MCP-1 is only expressed in those cells where jun-family members were mainly heterodimerized with the fos-related protein fra-1. In contrast, in tumorigenic cells the 1: 1 ratio between jun and fra-1 is disturbed and the MCP-1 gene is no longer expressed. Hence, alterations in the heterodimerization pattern of AP-1 and its selective accessibility to opened chromatin may represent a novel regulatory pathway in the regulation of chemokines in malignant and non-malignant HPV-positive cells."

Dynactin is a multisubunit complex that has been proposed to both link dynein with cargo and activate dynein motor function. The mechanisms by which dynactin regulates dynein activity are not clear. In this study, we examine the role of dynactin in regulating dynein ATPase activity. We show that dynein-microtubule binding and ATP-dependent release of dynein from microtubules are reduced in dynactin null mutants, Δro-3 (p150Glued) and Δro-4(Arp1), relative to wild-type. The dynein-microtubule binding activity, but not the ATP-dependent release of dynein from microtubules, is restored by in vitro mixing of extracts from dynein and dynactin mutants. Dynein produced in a Δro-3 mutant has ∼8-fold reduced ATPase activity relative to dynein isolated from wild-type. However, dynein ATPase activity from wild-type is not reduced when dynactin is separated from dynein, suggesting that dynein produced in a dynactin mutant is inactivated. Treatment of dynein isolated from the Δro-3mutant with λ protein phosphatase restores the ATPase activity to near wild-type levels. The reduced dynein ATPase activity observed in dynactin null mutants is mainly due to altered affinity for ATP.

Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans, and in Drosophila have provided strong support to the hypothesis that dynactin is required for cytoplasmic dynein-based motility (19Li Y.-Y.

However, the mechanisms by which dynactin activates dynein motor activity and hence translocation of cargo are not well understood. A number of studies have shown that the phosphorylation state of dynein and dynactin subunits varies with alterations in dynein-dependent transport in vivo (27Lin S.X.H. Ferro K.L. Collins C.A. J.

Analysis of dynein in rat kidney fibroblasts revealed that increased phosphorylation of dynein heavy chain correlated with activated dynein-dependent motor function (27Lin S.X.H. Ferro K.L. Collins C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat cells with okadaic acid and activators of protein kinase A and protein kinase C resulted in increased vesicular transport and enhanced phosphorylation of p150Glued (28Farshori P. Holzbaur E.L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In axons, the phosphorylation state of dynein has been characterized, and it has been proposed that increased phosphorylation of dynein heavy chain enhances dynein-based transport in vivo (29Dillman J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 127: 1671-1681Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, in vitro studies have suggested that the increased phosphorylation of dynein heavy chain and dynein intermediate chains results in inhibition of dynein ATPase activity (32Runnegar M.T. Wei X.H. Hamm-Alvarez S.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The intermediate chains of dynein and p150Glued of dynactin have been found to be hyperphosphorylated during M phase in HeLa cells, suggesting that dynein intermediate chains and p150Glued phosphorylation may positively regulate mitotic processes or negatively regulate interphase processes such as minus-end directed membrane trafficking (31Huang C.Y.F.

Dynein light chains have also been proposed to play a role in regulating dynein activity. Supportive evidence for a regulatory role of light chains comes primarily from work on axonemal dynein. To date, eight light chains have been identified for axonemal dynein and three light chains for cytoplasmic dynein (5Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S.B.

Activated motility of sperm, primarily by activated axonemal dynein, has been correlated with phosphorylation of the dynein light chain LC2 (35Inaba K. Kagami O. Ogawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In Paramecium tetraurelia, cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of an axonemal polypeptide (29 kDa) that copurifies with 22 S dynein arm has been shown to activate microtubule translocation velocity and swimming speed (36Hamasaki T.

A direct interaction of light chains and motor domain of axonemal dynein heavy chain has also been shown (37Wu H. Maciejewski M.W. Marintchev A. Benashski S.E. Mullen G.P. King S.M. Mol. Biol.

We have developed a genetic screen that allows the isolation of hundreds of N. crassa mutants (referred to as ropy mutants) that are defective in cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin function (24Plamann M.

We have shown that the N. crassa ro-1 gene encodes cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, whereas the ro-2, ro-3,ro-4, ro-7, andro-12 genes encode the dynactin subunits p62, p150Glued, Arp1, Arp11, and p25, respectively (24Plamann M.

Lee and M. Plamann, submitted for publication., 2P. F. Minke, I. H. Lee, A. Iyer, J. H. Tinsley, and M. Plamann, submitted for publication.Determining the specific roles of these various subunits requires biochemical characterization of dynein isolated from these mutants. Recently, we reported the isolation and characterization of dynein ATPase from wild-type N. crassa (45Kumar S. Lee I.H. Plamann M. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have isolated dynein from dynactin null mutants (Δro-3 and Δro-4) to understand the mechanism by which dynactin regulates cytoplasmic dynein activity. Our results indicate that dynein ATPase is regulated by dynactin-dependent phosphorylation that appears to involve 20- and 8-kDa dynein light chains. Wild-type N. crassa (74-OR23-1VA; FGSC 2489) was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Department of Microbiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. The Δro-3 and Δro-4 mutants were as described (24Plamann M. Minke P.F. Tinsley J.H. Bruno K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Tinsley J.H. Minke P.F. Bruno K.S. Plamann M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Media were as described (46Davis R.H. deSerres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 27A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Mycelia were harvested from wild-type grown for 18 h and from Δro-3 or Δro-4 mutants grown for 24 h in liquid media inoculated with 1 × 106conidia/ml. The mycelia were harvested by filtration, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C before use. For the32P-radiolabeling experiment, mycelia were grown in a low phosphate medium consisting of 0.1 mg/ml potassium phosphate and 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. Tubulin was purified from bovine brain white matter by cycles of polymerization and depolymerization as described (47Sloboda R.D. Dentler W.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Subsequently, microtubule-associated proteins were removed by using an S15 cation exchanger membrane as described (48Sloboda R.D. Belfi L.M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One bovine brain (100 g) yielded about 20 mg of microtubule-associated protein-free tubulin. Final tubulin preparations contained negligible ATPase activity, which did not interfere with purification of N. crassa dynein or dynein ATPase assays. Frozen mycelia (1 g) were suspended in 1.5 ml of extraction buffer (EB3; 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/mlNα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) (49Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Zirconium beads (1 g) were added, and mycelia were ground using a mortar and pestle. Ground hyphae were centrifuged at 7,000 ×g for 10 min and then 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove zirconium beads, unbroken cells, and insoluble material. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a Beckman Ti 100.3 rotor for 60 min to clear the extract of membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Exogenous microtubules (0.2 mg/ml), apyrase (2 units), and taxol (20 μm) were added to 1 ml of cell extract containing 5 mg/ml soluble protein. The solution was incubated for 60 min, overlaid over a 7.5% sucrose cushion, and then centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman 100.3 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of EB containing 3 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol. The resuspended pellet was incubated for 15 min prior to centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of EB, containing 20 μm taxol and 10 mm ATP, and incubated for 2 h. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti 100.3 rotor for 30 min. Proteins contained within supernatant and pellet after each step were analyzed by silver staining (50Bloom H. Beier H. Gross H.S. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (RO1) and p150Glued (RO3) were detected by Western blotting (51Minke P.F. Lee I.H. Tinsley J.H. Bruno K.S. Plamann M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Large scale preparations of dynein/dynactin from N. crassa were performed using a published protocol, designed for the purification of mammalian cytoplasmic dynein, with slight modifications (49Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using the protocol described above for dynein-microtubule binding and ATP-dependent release, extracts were prepared from 10 g of frozen mycelia resuspended in 25 ml of EB. All other procedures were as described above, except that no apyrase was added while binding to microtubules, and no taxol was added during the ATP release step to ensure near 100% recovery from microtubules. The supernatant containing ATP-released cytoplasmic dynein was used for sucrose density gradient fractionation. One ml of supernatant, containing ATP-released dynein, was loaded onto a 10-ml 5–20% sucrose gradient in fractionation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) as described (49Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Centrifugation of the sucrose gradient was performed at 125,000 ×g in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 16 h. Eleven 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and 60 μl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain and Western blot analysis. All operations were performed at 4 °C. An alternate method was also used to isolate dynein ATPase activity by gel filtration (45Kumar S. Lee I.H. Plamann M. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this method, high speed cell extracts were loaded onto a Sepharose CL-4B (bed volume, 100 ml) column, pre-equilibrated with 150 ml of fractionation buffer (9Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) without DTT. One-ml fractions were collected, and each fraction was assayed for ATPase activity. All the operations were performed at 4 °C. ATPase assays were performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. In a standard assay reaction, 10 μl of enzyme fractions and 4 mm ATP were incubated with assay buffer at 37 °C for 40 min. Reactions were stopped using highly acidic malachite green reagent as described, and absorbance was read at 660 nm (52Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The results shown are the average of three independent experiments. The amount of inorganic phosphate released in the enzymatic reaction was calculated using a standard calibration curve generated with inorganic phosphate. The control in this assay contained all ingredients of the reaction mixture, but the reaction was stopped immediately. Microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity was determined by the addition of 12.5 μg of microtubules/reaction. Treatment of dynein/dynactin containing fractions with λ phosphatase were performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mmDTT, and 400 units of λ phosphatase. The control contained all the ingredients except λ phosphatase, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following treatment with λ phosphatase, ATPase activities were measured as described above. Wild-type and Δro-3 mycelia (1.0 g each), grown in the presence of 5 mCi of [32P]phosphoric acid, were suspended in 2.5 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl with protease inhibitors as described (38Beckwith S.M. Roghi C.H. Liu B. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were made as described above. Dynein ATPase was isolated by a gel fitration method as described previously (45Kumar S. Lee I.H. Plamann M. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Samples (0.5 ml) were taken from the peak fractions for the ATPase activity and treated with 2000 units of λ phosphatase as described above and then assayed for ATPase activity. Nonidet P-40 was added to final concentration of 1% to the λ phosphatase-treated and untreated peak fraction and then 1 ml of NET-gel buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, and 0.02% sodium azide) was added. Ten μl of affinity-purified anti-RO1 antibody was added to the above solution and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Afterward, 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added and continued to incubate for an additional 3 h at 4 °C. The pellet was isolated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 s and rinsed twice with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 20 μl of 4× sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–20%). Dynein heavy chain was detected by Western blotting using anti-RO1 antibody, and 32P-labeled dynein-associated proteins were identified using a Storm PhosphorImager. As a first step in the investigation of how dynactin mutations affect cytoplasmic dynein activity, we have examined cytoplasmic dynein-microtubule binding and its ATP-dependent release from microtubules using extracts from wild-type and the dynactin null mutants Δro-3(p150Glued) and Δro-4 (Arp1). N. crassa cell extracts were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules, and the microtubules were pelleted. The microtubules were then incubated with GTP to release kinesin and kinesin-related proteins, followed by incubation with 10 mm ATP to release microtubule-associated cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin (45Kumar S. Lee I.H. Plamann M. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 48Sloboda R.D. Belfi L.M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1998; 13: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Approximately 50% of the cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin contained in wild-type cell extracts bound to microtubules, and both dynein and dynactin were released to the same extent (∼50%) following ATP addition in the presence of taxol (Fig.1, lanes 1–5). In contrast, reduced cytoplasmic dynein-microtubule binding was observed (∼25%) from extracts of the Δro-3 and Δro-4 dynactin mutants (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). ATP-dependent release of dynein from microtubules was much reduced in the dynactin mutants relative to wild-type at 10 mm ATP (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5). The amounts of inorganic phosphate produced in these extracts were ∼30% that of wild-type (data not shown), and this suggested that there was very low ATP hydrolysis in these mutants. Addition of higher amounts of ATP to the dynein-microtubule complexes from the dynactin mutants resulted in about 30% and 60% of dynein released at 25 and 50 mm ATP, respectively (data not shown). This result suggested that the affinity of ATP for dynein ATPase was reduced in dynactin mutants.Figure 1Microtubule binding and ATP-dependent release of N. crassa cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin. Cell extracts were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g. Lanes 1 and 2 represent supernatant and pellet, respectively. Lane 3 represents supernatant after GTP extraction of pelleted microtubule-binding proteins. Lanes 4 and5 represent supernatant and pellet, respectively after ATP extraction of GTP-extracted and pelleted microtubule-binding proteins. Equal proportions of supernatant and pellet (v/v), were loaded on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and RO1 (cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain) and RO3 (p150Glued) were detected by Western blot analysis.WT, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduced microtubule binding and ATP-dependent release of cytoplasmic dynein isolated from dynactin mutants could be due to either the absence of dynactin or to the modification of cytoplasmic dynein when produced in a dynactin mutant. To explore this, in vitro complementation tests were conducted by mixing an equal amount of protein fromro-1(B15) and Δro-3 cell extracts, which lack cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (RO1) and p150Glued (RO3), respectively. Following the mixing of extracts, microtubule-binding, GTP wash and ATP-dependent release experiments were carried out as before. The ro-1(B15) and Δro-3 cell extracts were treated in parallel experiments to serve as controls. Dynactin from the ro-1(B15) mutant did not bind to microtubules in the absence of cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, microtubule-binding of dynein was improved when extracts were mixed (ro-1(B15) + Δro-3) (Fig. 1, lanes 1and 2). However, ATP-dependent release of cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin from microtubules at 10 mmATP was not improved when the cell extracts were mixed (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 5). Only at a high concentration of ATP (50 mm) was dynein released from microtubules at a level similar to that of wild type (data not shown). These results indicate that cytoplasmic dynein microtubule binding activity, but not ATP-dependent release from microtubules, can be rescued in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2410929282,"NF kappa B is an important transcriptional regulator of multiple pro-inflammatory genes. In non-stimulated cells NF kappa B is anchored in the cytoplasm via the inhibitory protein I kappa B alpha. Following exposure to diverse pro-inflammatory signals (e.g. TNF alpha, IL1, LPS) various signal transduction cascades are initiated converging on the I kappa B kinase (IKK). IKK phosphorylates I kappa B alpha on serines 32 and 36 signaling the inhibitory protein for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The SCF beta-TRCP complex is the ubiquitin ligase responsible for mediating phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha. Here we reconstitute phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha using recombinant components. Our results suggest that the cullin specificity of the SCF complex may reflect its ability to associate with Rbx1. We demonstrate specific ubiquitination of I kappa B alpha by Ubc3 and Ubc4 in a phosphorylation and SCF beta-TRCP dependent manner and that both are capable of associating with the SCF beta-TRCP complex isolated from human cells. Finally, we show that Ubc4 is in excess to Ubc3 in THP.1 cells and 19 times more efficient in catalyzing the reaction, suggesting that Ubc4 is the preferentially used Ubc in this reaction in vivo. Our results also suggest that ubiquitin is transferred directly from the Ubc to phospho-I kappa B alpha in a SCF beta-TRCP dependent reaction. Oncogene (2000) 19, 3529 - 3536"

https://openalex.org/W2083318555,"Amlexanox binds S100A13 and inhibits the release of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Because members of the S100 gene family are known to be involved with the function of the cytoskeleton, we examined the ability of amlexanox to modify the cytoskeleton and report that amlexanox induces a dramatic reduction in the presence of actin stress fibers and the appearance of a random, non-oriented distribution of focal adhesion sites. Correspondingly, amlexanox induces the complete and reversible non-apoptotic inhibition of cell migration and proliferation, and although amlexanox does not induce either the down-regulation of F-actin levels or the depolymerization of actin filaments, it does induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, a Src substrate known to regulate actin bundling. In addition, a dominant negative form of Src is able to partially rescue cells from the effect of amlexanox on both the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. In contrast, the inhibition of cell proliferation by amlexanox correlates with the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression without interference of the receptor tyrosine kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Last, the ability of amlexanox to inhibit FGF1 release is reversible and correlates with the restoration of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role for the actin cytoskeleton in the FGF1 release pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2026577261,"32D cells expressing v-Ha-Ras fail to show a transformed phenotype. Since Ras requires an active IGF-1R for transformation of fibroblasts, we asked whether expression of IRS-1 or Shc (two of the major substrates of the IGF-1R) could co-operate with oncogenic Ras in transforming 32D cells. We find that IRS-1, but not Shc, in combination with v-Ha-Ras generates a fully transformed phenotype in 32D cells. 32D cells expressing both IRS-1 and v-Ha-Ras (32D/IRS1/Ras) survive and proliferate in the absence of IL-3, do not undergo granulocytic differentiation in the presence of G-CSF and form tumors in nu/nu and syngeneic mice. In contrast, 32D cells expressing singly IRS-1 or v-Ha-Ras exhibit only a block in differentiation capacity. Over-expression of Shc proteins, by itself, promotes differentiation of 32D cells. Concomitant expression of IRS-1 and v-Ha-Ras synergistically phosphorylates ERK-1 and ERK-2 whereas a MEK inhibitor rapidly induces death of 32D/IRS1/Ras transformed cells. Furthermore, transformed 32D/IRS1/Ras cells display high levels of PI3-K activation and undergo rapid apoptosis when exposed to PI3-K inhibitors. The data indicate that: (1) a fully transformed phenotype in 32D cells is generated when a block in differentiation (v-Ha-Ras) is coupled with another differentiation block (IRS-1); (2) PI3-K and MAPK activity are required for the survival of transformed cells; (3) the signals generated by IRS-1 and oncogenic Ras converge on ERK and PI3-K resulting in high levels of activation."
https://openalex.org/W2315055737,"p53 exhibits 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and the significance of this biochemical function is currently not defined. In order to gain information about the potential role(s) of this exonuclease activity, recombinant and wild-type human p53 was examined for excision of nucleotides from defined synthetic DNA substrates. p53 removes nucleotides threefold faster from single-strand DNA than from DNA duplexes, exhibits a 1.5-fold preference for 3′-terminals of DNA that contain a single nucleotide mispair (mismatch) as compared to correctly paired DNA and efficiently excises nucleotides from 3′-ends of blunt and cohesive (staggered) DNA double-strand breaks. The p53 exonuclease is predominantly non-processive on DNA which is 17 nucleotides long (or shorter) and processive on the longer 30-mers. The processivity of nucleotide excision is decreased in the presence of 50 mM potassium phosphate and eliminated when full-length p53 is replaced with the core domain, comprised of amino acids 82–292. Photoaffinity labeling indicates that (1) p53 monomers, rather than dimers, bind to single-strand forms of these oligomers; (2) complexes between p53 and 30-mers are more stable than those formed with 17-mers. The stability of these complexes determines processivity during nucleotide removal and modulates the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of p53. The relevance of substrate specificity of the p53 exonuclease to DNA repair is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2314870467,"Cells rely on the ability to receive and interpret external signals to regulate growth, differentiation, and death. Positive transduction of these signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus has been extensively characterized, and genetic studies in Drosophila have made major contributions to the understanding of these pathways. Less well understood, but equally important, are the mechanisms underlying signal down-regulation. Here we report biochemical and genetic characterization of the Drosophila homologue of c-Cbl, a negative regulator of signal transduction with ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. A new isoform of D-Cbl, D-CblL, has been identified that contains SH3-binding and UBA domains previously reported to be absent. Genetic analysis demonstrates that Dv-cbl, analogous to the mammalian v-cbl oncogene, is a dominant negative mutation able to enhance signalling from the Drosophila Egfr and cooperate with activating mutations in the sevenless pathway to produce melanotic tumours. In addition, our data show genetic and biochemical links between D-Cbl and proteins involved in endocytosis and ubiquitination, suggesting that v-Cbl may exert its oncogenic effect by enhancing receptor signalling as a consequence of suppressing receptor endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2086951061,"Argos, the inhibitor of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, remains the only known extracellular inhibitor of this family of receptors in any organism. The functional domain of Argos includes an atypical EGF domain and it is not clear whether it binds to the EGF receptor or if it acts via a distinct receptor to reduce Egfr activity indirectly. Here we present two lines of evidence that strongly suggest that Argos directly interacts with the EGF receptor. First, Argos is unable to inhibit a chimeric receptor that contains an extracellular domain from an unrelated RTK, indicating the need for the EGF receptor extracellular domain. Second, Argos can inhibit the Drosophila EGF receptor even when expressed in human cells, implying that no other Drosophila protein is necessary for inhibition. We also report that Argos and the Drosophila activating ligand, Spitz, can influence mammalian RTK activation, albeit in a cell-type specific manner. This includes the first evidence that Argos can inhibit signalling in mammalian cells, raising the possibility of engineering an effective human EGF receptor/ErbB antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W2314384238,"To analyse the effect of p53 on liver tumor development, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type p53 in the liver and crossed them with transgenic mice in which the expression of the SV40 large T antigen (TAg) induces hepatic tumors. Remarkably, whereas preneoplastic TAg liver exhibited anisocaryosis and anisocytosis, TAg/p53 liver never presented any dysplastic cells. Moreover, whereas expression of p53 did not affect hepatic development, its constitutive expression in tumorigenic livers resulted in a significantly enhanced apoptosis once nodules had appeared. In contrast, p53 overexpression did not modify the elevated proliferation of TAg-transformed hepatocytes and had no effect on hepatocarcinoma progression. In vitro analysis of primary hepatocytes exposed to various genotoxic agents showed that p53 failed to sensitize normal or TAg-transformed hepatocytes to apoptosis, except when high doses of doxorubicin, UV-B and UV-C radiation were used. Our results confirmed that the hepatocyte cell type is very resistant to genotoxic agents and showed that constitutive expression of p53 failed to improve their responsiveness. In addition, our results showed that suppression of dysplastic cells, probably by restoring normal cytokinesis and karyokinesis, and enhancement of apoptosis by means of p53 overexpression were insufficient to counteract or delay the TAg-induced liver tumoral progression."

PSA biosynthesis is catalyzed by two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV. The catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes are unknown. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, ST8SiaIV is responsible for PSA expression. In the complementation group 2A10, the ST8SiaIV gene is disrupted. Investigating the molecular defects in this complementation group, seven clones with missense mutations in ST8SiaIV were found. Mutations cause replacement of amino acids that are highly conserved in α2,8-sialyltransferases. To verify the physiological relevance of identified mutations, identical amino acid substitutions were introduced into epitope-tagged variants of hamster ST8SiaIV and murine ST8SiaII and recombinant proteins were tested in vivo andin vitro. None of these constructs reconstituted PSA synthesis in 2A10 cells, although the proteins were expressed and with the exception of the cysteine variants ST8SiaIV-C356F and ST8SiaII-C371F correctly targeted to the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, two mutations (ST8SiaIV-R277G and -M333V and the corresponding mutants ST8SiaII-R292G and -M348V) could be partially rescued if tested in vitro.

PSA synthesis in mammals involves two closely related, but independently expressed polysialyltransferases (see Ref. 26Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Murau M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Rahmann H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, and literature cited therein), ST8SiaII, formerly named STX, and ST8SiaIV, formerly named PST-1 or PST (for review, see Ref. 27Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo. ). 1996; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The modi of operation of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV seem to be very similar, if not identical. Minor differences have been described with respect to NCAM isoform specificity and length of PSA chains synthesized (28Kojima N. Tachida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo. ). 1997; 122: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A very recent study describes ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV to have different affinities for the two PSA acceptor sites within the NCAM molecule. Co-expression of both polysialyltransferases led to maximal PSA expression in transfected cells (30Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanisms used by polysialyltransferases are still obscure, and nothing is known about the structural elements that separate polysialyltransferases from other sialyltransferases. Recently, we reported an unusual autocatalytic property of ST8SiaIV termed “autopolysialylation” (31Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PSA synthesis in this reaction involves N-glycosylation sites present in the enzyme. Moreover, because soluble forms of the recombinant ST8SiaIV isolated from the supernatant of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were found to carry PSA and immaturely glycosylated enzyme forms were shown to be inactive, this study already demonstrated that autopolysialylation occurs at the cellular level and is a prerequisite for an active enzyme. Later studies confirmed autopolysialylation for ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV (30Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Close B.E. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34586-34593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and a recent study shows that in human ST8SiaIV asparagine 74 is the major acceptor site for autocatalytically produced PSA (33Close B.E. Tao K. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4484-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this study the molecular defects that inactivate ST8SiaIV in 2A10 cells have been analyzed. In a panel of 31 clones, 7 were found to be inactive due to missense mutations in ST8SiaIV. Amino acid replacements caused by the mutations in all cases concern positions that are highly conserved in the family of α2,8-sialyltransferases. Five mutations inactivate ST8SiaIV completely, whereas two were found to affect mainly the autopolysialylation capacity. Mutations identified in ST8SiaIV were introduced in ST8SiaII and caused identical defects. With this study we confirm earlier data suggesting a functional link between auto- and NCAM polysialylation (31Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

Polyadenylated RNA (mRNA) was isolated from total RNA using Oligotex beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The purification step was carried out twice to obtain poly(A)+ RNA. 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose, 1m formaldehyde gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Qiagen).

Open table in a new tab 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was reverse transcribed with 200 units of Superscript™II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using primer ME54. Full-length cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using primers ME21 and ME22. The amplification was carried out for 40 cycles with Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma) and 80 s of elongation time. PCR products were electrophoresed on an agarose gel and cDNAs of the expected size excised and extracted using GFX™ PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To increase the yield of PCR products, gel-extracted cDNAs were used as a template in a second amplification round (40 cycles) with the same primer combination. PCR products were purified by electrophoresis, extracted from the gel as described, and ligated into the vector pGEM® T (Promega). The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using α-[35S]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type and mutant forms of ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV were tested for enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, two sets of epitope-tagged proteins were constructed: (i) full-length forms with N-terminal Flag-HA tags and (ii) soluble forms with C-terminal Myc-His epitopes. To generate the N-terminally Flag-HA-tagged full-length constructs, the entire coding sequences of murine ST8SiaII and hamster ST8SiaIV were amplified by PCR without the start codons using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) with primers MW28 and MM32 for ST8SiaII and primers MW5 and AB6 for ST8SiaIV. PCR products were ligated into theXhoI/XbaI sites of vector pcDNA3-Flag-HA. pcDNA3-Flag-HA is a derivative of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), obtained after ligating the Flag-adaptor sequence MDYKDDDDK (encoded by the oligonucleotides FlagM5as (5′-GATCCCTTATCATCATCATCCTTGTAGTCCATGGTGGCGGTAC-3′) and FlagM5s (5′-CGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGATGATGATGATAAGG-3′)) into theKpnI/BamHI sites and the HA-adapter sequence YPYDVPDYASL (encoded by the oligonucleotides HABglIIs (5′-GATCTTACCCTTATGACGTCCCCGATTACGCCAGCCTGC-3′) and HANotIas (5′-GGCCGCAGGCTGGCGTAATCGGGGACGTCATAAGGGTAA-3′)) into the BamHI/NotI sites of pcDNA3. Vector constructs harboring the full-length wild type polysialyltransferases were named pFlag-HA-ST8SiaII and pFlag-HA-ST8SiaIV. Soluble forms of C-terminally Myc-His-tagged ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV were generated with the aid of the vector pSecTag B (Invitrogen). Nucleotides 94–1125 of murine ST8SiaII and nucleotides 76–1077 of hamster ST8SiaIV were amplified by PCR with primer pairs MM29/MM30 and MM26/MM31, respectively. Fragments obtained afterBamHI/XbaI digestion were cloned into the according vector sites. Vector constructs allow the translation of proteins, in which the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (amino acids 1–31 in ST8SiaII, and 1–25 in ST8SiaIV) are substituted by the signal sequence of the Igκ light chain and which contain Myc-His epitopes at the C terminus. The plasmids containing the wild type sequences were named pMyc-ST8SiaII and pMyc-ST8SiaIV. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. ST8SiaIV mutations identified in clones of the 2A10 complementation group were introduced into the wild type sequences of pFlag-HA-ST8SiaII, pFlag-HA-ST8SiaIV, pMyc-ST8SiaII, and pMyc-ST8SiaIV by either subcloning of restriction fragments or site directed mutagenesis. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Details concerning the construction of mutants are available upon request. Soluble Myc-tagged forms of wild type and mutant ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV were immunoisolated from the supernatants of transiently transfected 2A10 cells. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 2.4×106 cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and for transfection overlaid with a mixture consisting of 6 μg of DNA and 24 μl of LipofectAMINE™ in 4 ml of OptiMEM I (Life Technologies). After 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 4 ml of medium with 10% FCS were added, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h. Thereafter, the medium was exchanged against 8 ml of medium containing 5% FCS and incubation continued. After 48 h, the supernatants were collected and fusion proteins were immunoisolated with the anti-Myc mAb 9E10 covalently coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 μl of 9E10-coated beads were used per 6 ml of supernatant. Auto- and NCAM polysialylation were analyzed in vitro using the soluble Myc-tagged polysialyltransferases. MAb 9E10 covalently bound to protein G-Sepharose was used to immunoisolate epitope-tagged proteins from the supernatants of transiently transfected 2A10 cells. Beads were washed three times with reaction buffer (10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 10 mm MnCl2) and subdivided into three equal aliquots. In aliquot 1, autopolysialylation was started by addition of 5.55 kBq of CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac in a final volume of 60 μl of reaction buffer. After 2 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by washing twice with PBS and adding 20 μl of Laemmli buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) with 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were heated to 65 °C for 20 min and analyzed by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography. For the NCAM polysialylation assay, the remaining two aliquots of the bead fraction preloaded with the recombinant polysialyltransferases were used to extract a soluble protein A-NCAM fusion protein from the supernatant of transfected 2A10 cells as described previously (31Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described for autopolysialylation. To control the specificity of the reaction product, one aliquot was treated with endoNE (100 ng of endoNE in 60 μl of PBS, 37 °C, 30 min) before loading on a 7% SDS-PAGE. Samples were displayed by autoradiography. In order to make results obtained in the auto- and NCAM polysialylation assay comparable, dried gels were exposed in parallel to the same film. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) in 7% or 9.5% gels under reducing conditions. Gels were either vacuum-dried and exposed (4 weeks) on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for autoradiography or used to transfer proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Western blots were developed as follows. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in blocking solution A (2% nonfat dry milk in PBS) and incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution A (5 μg/ml mAb 735 and KD11, 2.5 μg/ml mAb M5, 1.5 μg/ml mAb 9E10). Blots were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse Ig-AP conjugate 1:2000 in blocking solution A). Thereafter, blots were washed twice with PBS and once with AP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and bound secondary antibody-conjugates displayed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. Variant forms of pFlagHA-ST8SiaII and pFlagHA-ST8SiaIV were transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells using Effectene™ (Qiagen). Glass coverslips were placed into 12-well plates, and 2×104 cells were seeded per well. Cells were incubated for 18 h (37 °C and 5% CO2). Transfections were carried out with 0.16 μg of DNA, 75 μl of buffer EC, 1.76 μl of Enhancer, and 1.67 μl of Effectene™ in 400 μl of medium according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cells on coverslips were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 9 min. After three additional washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in blocking solution B (20% horse serum in PBS), washed with PBS, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution B (mAb M5, 2.5 μg/ml; α-mannosidase II antiserum, 1:2000). After three washing steps with PBS, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with anti-mouse Ig-DTAF or anti-rabbit Ig-TRITC, each diluted 1:200 in blocking solution B. Cells were finally washed three times in PBS, rinsed in water, and mounted in Mowiol. Samples were visualized under a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. CHO mutants belonging to the complementation group 2A10 are characterized by a loss of PSA expression. 2A10 cells were used to isolate ST8SiaIV, the only polysialyltransferase expressed in CHO cells (34Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The molecular defects causing loss of PSA expression in 2A10 cells were investigated in this study. First, the presence of ST8SiaIV mRNA was analyzed. The Northern blot in Fig. 1 shows that wild type (wt) CHO cells express two ST8SiaIV mRNAs of about 6.5 and 2.3 kilobase pairs. In only 3 out of 31 2A10 clones were ST8SiaIV-specific hybridization signals detectable, and only 1 clone (7G11) gave a band pattern identical to the wild type. In clone 8F8, the upper band was drastically reduced and migrated slightly faster than the corresponding wt band. In clone 2A10, a weak 6.5-kilobase pair signal was visible. The majority of clones, however, were negative in Northern blot analysis (see, e.g., clone 9G2 in Fig. 1). RT-PCR was used to reinvestigate the presence of ST8SiaIV mRNA in 2A10 cells. Six additional clones (2D8, 4C4, 5C3, 7F11, 9C8, and 9D8) were found to be positive for ST8SiaIV transcripts (data not shown). To determine the sequence of ST8SiaIV-transcripts present in 2A10 mutants, RT-PCR products were subcloned and individual colonies were sequenced. RT-PCR and sequencing were carried out at least twice in parallel samples to eliminate PCR artifacts. Mutations identified are listed in Table II. Single point mutations that allow the translation of full-length proteins with single amino acid exchanges were found in six clones. In clone 2D8 the simultaneous occurrence of a nucleotide transition (A997G) and transversion (G1067T) led to the amino acid exchanges M333V and C356F, respectively. The nucleotide transition C103T introduces a premature stop codon in clone 2A10. In clone 8F8 skipping of exon 3 inactivates ST8SiaIV. It is likely that an element involved in RNA-splicing (e.g. splice donor or acceptor site) is destroyed at the genomic level.Table IIST8SiaIV mutations identified in cells of the complementation group 2A10MutantNorthern blot signalRT-PCRNucleotide exchange(s)Amino acid exchange(s)2A10++C103TQ35stop2D8−+A997G/G1067TM333V/C356F4C4−+G437AG146E5C3−+G841AG281S7F11−+G437AG146E7G11++G566AT189I8F8++ΔA247–G504ΔK83–R1689C8−+G1006AE336K9D8−+A829GR277GΔ, deletion; amino acid residues are given in the single-letter code. Open table in a new tab Δ, deletion; amino acid residues are given in the single-letter code. Missense mutations identified in 2A10 cells are displayed in Fig.2. All cause the exchange of amino acids that are highly conserved in the subfamily of α2,8-sialyltransferases. Only methionine 333 is leucine in ST8SiaIII, and only glycine 281 is invariant in all sialyltransferases. Glycine 146 and glutamic acid 336 are also found in other sialyltransferases, whereas threonine 189, arginine 277, and cysteine 356 are restricted to α2,8-sialyltransferases. These positions may, therefore, contribute to the determination of α2,8 linkage specificity. From the finding that ST8SiaIV mRNA levels are drastically reduced in 2A10 clones (see Fig. 1), the possibility arises that loss of PSA expression is due to subthreshold expression of mutated proteins. To investigate this possibility, recombinant ST8SiaIV variants were generated and enzymatic activity was tested in vivo and in vitro. To decide on the importance of each of the two mutations found in clone 2D8, the amino acid exchanges were separately introduced into the wild type enzyme. The full-length ST8SiaIV cDNA cloned into the vector pcDNA3-Flag-HA was subject of site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were verified by sequencing and cDNAs transiently expressed in 2A10 cells. 48 h after transfection, whole cell lysates were analyzed in Western blot with the mAb 735 to display PSA (35Frosch M. Gorgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and with mAb KD11 to display NCAM (36Gerardy-Schahn R. Eckhardt M. Ledermann J. Kemshead J.T. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 1994; 8: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, 2A10 cells express the NCAM isoforms 140 and 180. NCAM bands are present at comparable concentrations in all samples and demonstrate equal loading of the gel. A broad microheterogeneous signal representing polysialylated NCAM could be detected in 2A10 cells transfected with wt Flag-HA-ST8SiaIV, and a very weak PSA signal was visible in cells transfected with the mutant R277G (see Fig. 3 A). None of the other ST8SiaIV variants was able to reconstitute PSA expression in 2A10 cells. The two mutations observed in clone 2D8 independently inactivate ST8SiaIV (see M333V and C356F in Fig. 3), and therefore were investigated separately in subsequent experiments. To control the expression of recombinant Flag-HA-ST8SiaIV proteins, aliquots of the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb 12CA5 and analyzed in Western blot with anti-Flag mAb M5. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed, indicating that not absence of proteins but mutations in ST8SiaIV are responsible for the lack of PSA expression. Double or triplet bands visible in Fig. 3 B represent nascent, incompletely glycosylated Flag-HA-ST8SiaIV proteins. It is important to mention, at this point, that differences in the protein expression levels (e.g. see Fig. 3 B and subsequent experiments) are due to the experimental system and varied between parallel experiments, but did not affect their results."

https://openalex.org/W2327261337,"Serum-stimulation of quiescent mouse fibroblasts results in transcriptional activation of tissue factor (TF), the cellular initiator of blood coagulation. This requires the rapid entry of c-Fos into specific AP-1 DNA-binding complexes and can be strongly inhibited by the adenovirus EIA 12S gene product. In this study, we utilized a panel of E1A mutants deficient in cellular protein binding to analyse the molecular basis for EIA inhibition of a minimal, c-Fos-dependent TF promoter/ reporter construct in mouse AKR-2B fibroblasts. Mutations which impaired binding of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein family members pRB, p107, and p130 relieved E1A-mediated inhibition of transcription in response to serum-stimulation or c-Fos overexpression. Inhibition was restricted to the G0 to G1 transition, consistent with the specificity of E1A for hypophosphorylated forms of RB proteins. Although E1A mutants deficient in CBP/p300 binding retained the ability to inhibit TF transcription, deletion of the amino-terminal portion of the CBP/p300 interaction domain was required to permit rescue of TF promoter activity by coexpression of pRB. Moreover, ectopic p107 could effectively substitute for pRB in relieving E1A-mediated repression. In primary mouse embryo fibroblasts, activity of the minimal AP-1-dependent TF promoter was suppressed in Rb(-/-) cells compared to parallel Rb(+/-) and Rb(+/+) transfectants. Ectopic expression of either pRB or p107 markedly enhanced TF promoter activity in Rb(-/-) fibroblasts. Collectively, these data imply that pRB and p107 can cooperate with c-Fos to activate TF gene transcription in fibroblasts and suggest a requirement for another, as yet unidentified, E1A-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1981362220,"We have previously demonstrated that CD45 physically associates with the endoplasmic reticulum processing enzyme glucosidase II (GII). GII consists of the catalytic α-chain and an associated β-chain. To gain insight into the basis of the association between CD45 and GII, we examined the biochemical requirements for the interaction. We show that the α-subunit is essential for the interaction. Interestingly, only a higher molecular weight form of GIIα is capable of associating with CD45 in a competitive situation where multiple GIIα isoforms are expressed. Further, transfection studies demonstrate that only isoforms containing the alternatively spliced sequence Box A1 are capable of binding CD45, although all isoforms are catalytically active. The interaction between CD45 and GII is dependent on the active site of GII, is mediated through the carbohydrate on CD45, and can be inhibited with mannose. Taken together, these results suggest that GIIα acts as a lectin and binds to CD45 in an exon-dependent manner. This lectin activity of GII may be a novel mechanism for the regulation of CD45 biology and play a role in immune function, possibly by regulating CD45 glycosylation.

Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic phosphatase activity of CD45 has been shown to be essential for the early signal transduction events leading to both thymocyte maturation and T cell activation (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence to suggest that CD45 regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src family kinases (2Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The external domain of CD45 is extremely heterogeneous with respect to size and carbohydrate content primarily because of three alternatively spliced exons that encode for potential O-linked glycosylations (4Thomas M.L. Lefrancois L. Immunol. Today. 1989; 9: 320-326Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The usage of these exons appears to be developmentally regulated (4Thomas M.L. Lefrancois L. Immunol. Today. 1989; 9: 320-326Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As well, the extracellular domain encodes attachment sites for numerous N-linked glycans, and these glycosylations appear to be important for cell surface expression and protein stability of CD45 (5Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, although CD45 is a cell surface protein, no specific ligand for the extracellular domain has been definitively identified. Perhaps relevant to the present study, there have been studies suggesting that some lectins such as CD22 (6Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T.

Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that the carbohydrate processing enzyme α-glucosidase II (GII)1 physically interacts with CD45 (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GII is found within the ER and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the inner two α1,3-linked glucose residues present on allN-linked immature oligosaccharides (12Lucocq J.M. Brada D. Roth J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2137-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard S.C. Ivatt R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 555-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This processing of glucose in the ER has been shown to be intimately involved in protein folding by regulating the interaction between the nascent polypeptide and the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin. More specifically, removal of the first α1,3-linked glucose by GII creates a substrate for calnexin/calreticulin binding (14Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hydrolysis of the second α1,3-linked glucose is necessary for the progression of properly folded glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi (21Sousa M. Parodi A.J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The GII enzyme is composed of a 116-kDa α-subunit that contains a catalytic motif of the Family 31 glucosidases (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Flura T. Brada D. Ziak M. Roth J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We and others hypothesize that the β-chain is involved in enzyme localization (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both subunits of GII have been shown to be alternatively spliced (25Arendt C.W. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There is one alternatively spliced sequence (Box B1) within GIIβ that gives rise to two potential isoforms, whereas within GIIα, there are two alternatively spliced sequences (Box A1 and A2) that have the potential to generate four distinct isoforms (25Arendt C.W. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These different splice forms may vary in their subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, or substrate specificity. The association between CD45 and GII may be surprising given the subcellular distribution and function of the two proteins; nevertheless, this interaction may prove to be instrumental in elucidating aspects of CD45 biology. Therefore, we wished to dissect the biochemical basis for this stable interaction. We found that only isoforms of GIIα containing Box A1 are capable of interacting with CD45. It also appears that the active site of GIIα is required for the interaction with the N-linked carbohydrate on CD45. As well, the addition of mannose significantly decreases the association between CD45 and GII. Together, these data suggest that the association between GII and CD45 is a lectin-based interaction. BW5147 (BW), and a CD45-negative variant (BW/T200−), mouse T-lymphoma cells were maintained as described previously (26Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PHAr2.7 cell line, generously provided by Dr. Ian Trowbridge (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), is a BW-derived mutant deficient in GIIα subunit expression (23Flura T. Brada D. Ziak M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that was maintained in an identical manner to the parental BW line. Monoclonal antibody I3/2.3, which was also provided by Dr. Ian Trowbridge, recognizes a pan-specific determinant within the CD45 extracellular region. I3/2.3 was purified and directly coupled to cyanogen-activated Sepharose 4B. Rabbit antiserum H2, specific for GIIβ, was described previously (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas rabbit antiserum J37 was generated to the tandem intracellular phosphatase domains of CD45. The anti-GIIα antiserum was purchased from Stressgen (Vancouver, Canada). Complete sequences of clones 116FL.A (A1−/A2−), 116 FL.E (A1−/A2−), 116FL.B (A1+/A2−), and 6R5–14 (A1+/A2+) were obtained by the dideoxy chain termination method and compared with a previously published GII α-sequence (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 116FL.A sequence contained no mutations, whereas mutations/truncations in the 116FL.B and 6R5–14 sequences were repaired by standard subcloning procedures. The 116FL.E and corrected 6R5–14 clones were then used to construct the A1-A2+ clone, and all four final clones were resequenced as above. Upon sequence verification, the cDNA fragments were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and endotoxin-free preparations of the four constructs were prepared using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit. 20 μg of endotoxin-free DNA was electroporated into BW/PHAr cells using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 300 mV. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24–36 h, after which G-418 (Life Technologies) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Selected transfectants were grown up in presence of G-418 and screened for expression of GIIα by Western blotting. Cells were lysed at a density of 5 × 107/ml in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Post nuclear supernatants were incubated for 1–2 h with I3/2 coupled beads or for 20–30 min with polyclonal antiserum followed by a 1–2 h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in reducing sample buffer, and boiled. The reconstitution assay was performed as described previously (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD45 immunoprecipitates were washed three times in 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, to remove bound GII, followed by one wash in lysis buffer. A BW/T200−lysate was then added to the CD45 immunoprecipitate for 1–2 h, followed by three washes with lysis buffer. All antibody incubations took place at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride-Immobilon (Millipore) as described previously (26Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2313-2319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was carried out with the indicated antiserum, followed by protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CD45 or GIIβ immunoprecipitates were prepared as described above. For treatment under reducing and denaturing conditions, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmphosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, then allowed to cool before the addition of 0.3 unit of Endo F (Sigma). The beads were then incubated at 33 °C for 16–18 h. For treatment under native conditions a 50 mm imidazole pH 6.8 buffer was used. The beads were incubated for 16–18 h at 33 °C in 50 μl of imidazole buffer and 0.3 unit of Endo F (Sigma). The reactions were quenched by adding reducing sample buffer and boiling, or the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer prior to the addition of reducing sample buffer and boiling. Determination of the GII enzymatic activity was performed as described previously (27Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated with 5 mm p-nitrophenyl α-d-gluocopyranoside (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for 16–18 h at room temperature. Color change was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Background absorbance, defined as the average value obtained when the colorimetric reagent was incubated with lysis buffer alone, was subtracted from all values obtained. Deoxynorjirmycin (dNM) and australine (Oxford Glycosystems, Wakefield, MA) were reconstituted with water to a concentration of 100 mm, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Lysates were treated with the inhibitors for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Samples of inhibited lysates were kept and analyzed for GII activity as described above. Recently, it was demonstrated that the BW5147 mutant cell line BW/PHAr is deficient in expression of the GIIα subunit (23Flura T. Brada D. Ziak M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, we find that BW/PHAr expresses normal levels of CD45 and GIIβ (Fig.1). We were therefore able to utilize the BW/PHAr cell line to determine which GII subunit mediates the interaction with CD45 that we have described previously (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An association of both GII subunits with CD45 is observed in the BW cells, but neither subunit associates with CD45 in the BW/PHArcells (Fig. 1). This result demonstrates two important features of the CD45-GII association. First, expression of the GIIα subunit is required for the association of the GII complex with CD45. Second, the β-subunit alone cannot interact directly with CD45; rather, GIIβ associates with CD45 by virtue of its binding to GIIα. This observation does not preclude the possibility that GIIβ might enhance binding of GIIα to CD45 perhaps through a protein-protein interaction or by a causing a conformational change in GIIα. As stated previously, there are four potential protein isoforms of GIIα that can be generated by alternative splicing (25Arendt C.W. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Variable isoform usage has not yet been conclusively demonstrated at the protein level, mainly because of a lack of specific antibody reagents. In comparing the molecular weight of GIIα that co-immunoprecipitates with CD45 and the total GIIα pool found in lysates, it appears that a higher molecular weight isoform of GIIα is found in association with CD45 (Fig. 1). This higher molecular weight isoform is not readily detectable in a Western blot of total lysate and is therefore thought to constitute a minor portion of total GIIα. When we compare CD45 and GIIβ immunoprecipitates from BW cells, a higher molecular weight isoform of GIIα is observed in CD45 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). This is the same pattern that was observed when comparing CD45 immunoprecipitates and total cell lysate from BW cells (Fig. 1). The difference in relative mobility of GIIα subsets can arise from at least two distinct mechanisms. First, the difference may be the result of alternative splicing with a different size polypeptide backbone, and second, the difference may arise from post-translational modifications such as differential glycosylation. To address this issue, CD45 and GIIβ immunoprecipitates were digested with Endo F under reducing and denaturing conditions, followed by Western blot analysis for GIIα. The samples were spiked with additional Endo F enzyme periodically throughout the incubation to achieve complete digestion. When the CD45 associated GIIα was treated with Endo F, the entire band shifted to a faster migrating form owing to the release of the N-linked carbohydrate (Fig. 2). Therefore, all of the CD45 associated GIIα appears to be glycosylated. When the GIIβ associated GIIα is digested with Endo F, two distinct bands are revealed (Fig. 2) likely representing two distinct polypeptide backbones that contain or lack the larger differentially spliced sequence (Box A1). From the data presented in Fig. 2, it appears that only a higher molecular weight form of GIIα associates with CD45. It is possible, however, that other isoforms of GIIα are capable of associating with CD45. To address this issue, we employed a sequential reconstitution strategy. First, CD45 immunoprecipitates were prepared for reconstitution assays by washing with 0.5% deoxycholate to remove endogenously bound GII. Next, a BW/T200− lysate was added to the first CD45 immunoprecipitate. After incubation, that same lysate was then added to the second CD45 immunoprecipitation. This was repeated for a total of six CD45 immunoprecipitates. A sample of the BW/T200− lysate before and after the sequential reconstitution assays was taken and examined for the presence of GIIα protein and GII enzymatic activity. We found that only the higher molecular weight GIIα associated with CD45, and no lower molecular weight GIIα associated with CD45 even after depletion of the higher molecular weight form of GIIα (Fig. 3). In examining the lysate after the sequential reconstitutions, there was little change in the amount of the lower molecular weight isoform of GIIα (Fig. 3), demonstrating that there was still plenty of GIIα available. As well, there was still 75% of the initial GII enzymatic activity remaining, so loss of activity cannot explain the lack of binding. Therefore, in a competitive situation where multiple GIIα isoforms are expressed, a higher molecular weight form of GIIα preferentially associates with CD45. The observation that only a higher molecular weight isoform of GIIα is capable of association with CD45 raises the obvious question regarding the molecular identity of this isoform. To answer this question, we performed transfection studies utilizing the BW/PHAr cell line. Stable transfectants expressing each of the four isoforms of GIIα were generated in the BW/PHAr cells and used for immunoprecipitation experiments. In examining CD45 immunoprecipitates from lysates of the BW, BW/PHAr parentals and each of the transfectants, it is clear that the association between CD45 and GII only occurs in cells that express GIIα isoforms containing the alternatively spliced sequence A1 (Fig.4), whereas the second alternatively spliced region (Box A2) does not appear to influence the binding of GII to CD45 (Fig. 4). Therefore, the binding of GII to CD45 is dictated by presence of Box A1. Of note, all isoforms appear to have similar catalytic activities, and therefore, alteration of GII activity cannot account for the isoform-specific GII binding to CD45 (data not shown). From the data presented in Fig. 1, GIIα protein is required for binding of GII to CD45. We next wanted to determine whether or not GIIα activity is necessary for CD45 binding by making use of competitive, active site-directed inhibitors. We performed a reconstitution assay where CD45 immunoprecipitates from BW cells were stripped of endogenously bound GII. To these immunoprecipitates, we added BW/T200− lysates pretreated with either dNM, a GII inhibitor (28Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or australine, a glucosidase I-specific inhibitor (29Tropea J.E. Molyneux R.J. Kaushal G.P. Pan Y.T. Mitchell M. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2027-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When dNM-treated lysates were added to CD45 immunoprecipitates devoid of GII, the ability of GII from that lysate to bind CD45 was inhibited (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, australine-treated lysates showed no impairment of GII binding to CD45 (Fig. 5 A). Further, treatment of GII bound CD45 immunoprecipitates with dNM, but not australine, resulted in a loss of GII binding (data not shown). These data indicate that to initiate the formation of the CD45-GII complex, an unoccupied GII active site is required. Another interesting point can be made regarding these data. In the 0.01 mm dNM-treated lysate, there was almost a complete inhibition of reconstitution; yet there was still 81% of the GII activity remaining in the lysate (Fig. 5 A). Because all isoforms appear to have a similar enzymatic inhibition curve with dNM (data not shown), these data indicate that the binding of GIIα to CD45 is inhibited at a lower concentration of inhibitor than is the activity, which may reflect a differential affinity of GII for CD45 and substrate. In a previous report, we demonstrated that to reconstitute the association between CD45 and GII, Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate on CD45 was required (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, in this report, we show that an unoccupied active site on GII is also required to reconstitute the association (Fig. 5 A). We then asked whether we could disrupt the preformed complex by removing theN-linked carbohydrate. To determine the contribution ofN-linked carbohydrate to the association, we needed a buffering system that maintained the association in native form, yet allowed Endo F enzymatic activity. Therefore, we utilized a 50 mm imidazole pH 6.8 buffer and treated CD45 immunoprecipitates with Endo F. Treatment of CD45 immunoprecipitates with Endo F resulted in the loss of GII association, whereas mock treatment preserved the interaction (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that removal of the N-linked carbohydrate on both GII and CD45, while GII is bound, will disrupt the interaction between CD45 and GII. This experiment does not discriminate between the contribution of CD45 N-linked carbohydrate and the contribution of GIIα N-linked carbohydrate. Given our previous reconstitution experiments, however, it is reasonable to suggest that the N-linked carbohydrate on CD45 is important for the interaction (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This does not preclude the possibility of GIIα N-linked carbohydrate contributing to the association. From the data presented in Fig. 5, the association between CD45 and GII requires both the active site of GII and the CD45 N-linked carbohydrate. These data suggest that the association between CD45 and GII is based on a lectin interaction. A report from Grinna and Robbins (30Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2255-2258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that to obtain optimal GII enzymatic activity, branched mannose residues are required. It is therefore possible that GII also possess a mannose binding activity. To address the issue of whether or not GII does indeed possess a mannose binding function, we performed a reconstitution assay where either glucose or mannose monosaccharides were included in the reconstitution assay. Although the addition of 10 mmglucose caused little change in the ability of GII to bind CD45, the addition of 10 mm mannose significantly inhibited the binding of GII to CD45 (Fig. 6). As well, the addition of either glucose or mannose had no effect on the enzymatic activity of GII (data not shown). Therefore, these data indicate that the presence of mannose can inhibit the association of CD45 and GII and suggest that GII does in fact possess mannose binding activity. In a previous report, we described the physical association between the protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45 and the resident ER protein glucosidase II (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This association appears to be extremely stable and has the ability to be reconstituted in vitrounder the appropriate conditions (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As well, to reconstitute the association between CD45 and GII, there is a dependence on Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate on CD45 suggesting that GII is binding via a lectin-like interaction (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our present studies sought to further elucidate the biochemical basis for the association between CD45 and GII in an attempt to understand the potential implications of this association on CD45 biology. In this report, we show that CD45 appears to strongly interact with a minor, higher molecular weight form of GIIα. Through our transfection studies, we found that only the Box A1+/A2+ and the A1+/A2− isoforms are capable of binding CD45. Therefore, the alternatively spliced sequence A1 is necessary for the interaction of GIIα with CD45, whereas Box A2 is dispensable for binding. This finding is consistent with our amino acid sequencing data obtained from the α-subunit purified on the basis of its association with CD45, which demonstrated that the first alternatively spliced sequence was present (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig. 3 suggest that the higher molecular weight CD45-interacting GIIα is only a relatively minor subset of total GIIα found in the BW cell line. Consistent with this, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of a number of different cell lines indicated that transcripts containing the first alternatively spliced exon were significantly less abundant than the transcripts that lacked this sequence (25Arendt C.W. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fact that CD45 only associates with a minor population of GIIα indicates that there is a high degree of specificity to the interaction. This association is not taking place simply because CD45 is an abundant, carbohydrate-containing protein and because GII is an enzyme that is capable of modifying this carbohydrate. In further support of the specificity of this interaction, we have never been able to detect an association of GII with other abundant N-linked glycan containing proteins such as Class I major histocompatibility complex (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), LFA-1, or CD44. 2T. A. Baldwin and H. L. Ostergaard, unpublished results.. Taken together, these results suggest that CD45 specifically associates with a minor Box A1-containing subset of GII. Because of the requirement for the first alternatively spliced sequence in GIIα, we posit that Box A1 functions to stabilize the association between CD45 and GII. Based on the primary sequence, Box A1 is not adjacent to the active site (11Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); however, the tertiary structure of the protein may place this sequence in close proximity to the active site, thereby modifying the enzymatic properties of GII resulting in binding but not glucose cleavage. We find this possibility unlikely because all isoforms contain equal activity (data not shown). Furthermore, CD45-associated GII is fully active (data not shown). We find it more likely that Box A1 could provide GIIα with a novel binding activity or stabilize an existing binding activity. Interestingly, we show that the addition of mannose can inhibit the ability of GII to associate with CD45. Therefore, Box A1-containing GIIα not only possesses a glucose-specific catalytic activity but also displays a mannose-specific lectin activity. This lectin activity is not of high enough affinity to allow GIIα to bind to branched mannose oligosaccharides alone because incubation of lysates from any one of the GIIα transfectants with mannan-agarose beads does not result in the binding GIIα to the beads (data not shown). From these data, we believe that both the active site and the lectin activity of Box A1 containing GIIα are required for the stable binding of GII to the N-linked carbohydrate on CD45. The finding of lectin activity in addition to the enzymatic activity within a carbohydrate processing enzyme, though unusual, is not unprecedented. Both structural and biochemical evidence exists in the literature for this type of enzyme organization. The interplay between enzymatic activity and the lectin binding domain can be quite complex and unpredictable. For example, mutations in the ricin-like lectin motif of UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase do not affect the activity of the enzyme (31Hagen F.K. Hazes B. Raffo R. deSa D. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, in the case of cell surface β1,4-galactosyltransferase, the galactosyl transferase activity of depends on the ability of its lectin domain to bind its substrate, laminin (32Begovac P.C. Shi Y.X. Mansfield D. Shur B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31793-31799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the physical state of the enzyme can alter its substrate binding and affect enzymatic activity yet maintain its lectin binding capabilities. This is the case for β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase where dimerization reduces donor substrate binding but does not affect galactose binding (33Ma J. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7758-7766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that by utilizing both the GIIα active site and the lectin-binding domain, there may be modulation of either one or both of the activities causing the stable association of GII with CD45. For example, simultaneous engagement of the active site and the lectin domain may result in a stable association. It is reasonable to deduce that the association between CD45 and GII may have significant biological implications for CD45. GII may act as a molecular chaperone that could help to retain CD45 within the ER longer than other proteins to allow for further post-translational modifications, the interaction with additional proteins, or regulated cell surface expression of CD45. The association with GII may also affect the enzymatic activity of CD45. While in the ER, reduced phosphatase activity could prevent the inappropriate dephosphorylation of proteins. In other compartments reduced activity may alter the signaling thresholds for cellular functions. As well, the stable interaction of GII with CD45 could perhaps lead to additional modifications on the carbohydrate of CD45, which could regulate CD45 function. Determining where the association between CD45 and GII occurs will be of interest. Our preliminary data suggest that the association does not take place on the cell surface, and because GII is an ER protein, we believe the interaction is at least initiated within the ER, thus supporting a function related to ER localization. To date, most of the potential ligands and binding proteins of CD45 have been shown to interact with the carbohydrate on CD45, the biological significance of which is elusive. Our data suggest that GII is another example of a lectin that binds CD45. It is possible that CD45 does not have just one single ligand; rather there are multiple ligands that bind to CD45 carbohydrate and regulate the function of CD45. We have begun to understand the biochemical basis for the GII-CD45 association, and this information has provided us with insight into the possible biological functions related to the interaction. These biological functions may help to identify the role that the carbohydrate and extracellular region CD45 plays in lymphocyte biology. As well, by understanding how GII interacts with its substrates, we hope to gain information into the role GII plays in the quality control system within the ER.

https://openalex.org/W2335569705,"We have previously reported that the human transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) gene encodes three forms of TGF-alpha precursors, designated wild type (WT), variant I (VaI), and variant II (VaII), derived from alternative splicing. The two carboxyl-terminal valine residues of WT are replaced by 5 (GCRLY) or 4 (ATLG) amino acids in VaI or VaII, respectively. When overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, VaI and ValI, but not WT, support autonomous growth. We detected tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 in the absence of serum, in CHO cells expressing WT, VaI, or VaII, but not in mock transfectants. These observations prompted us to investigate possible interactions between the ErbBs and the TGF-alpha precursors in CHO cells. All TGF-alpha precursors were found to co-immunoprecipitate with the ErbBs, but with different specificity. WT co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB4, but not with ErbB1, ErbB2, or ErbB3. VaI and VaII co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB2, but not with ErbB1, ErbB3, or ErbB4. Confocal fluorescent microscopy analysis demonstrated that WT, VaI, and VaII all distribute equally to the cell surface while, as expected, a WT mutant lacking the two C-terminal valine residues does not. Point and deletion mutants involving the unique carboxyl-terminal residues of WT, VaI and VaII, indicated that the interactions between the three TGF-alpha precursors and the ErbBs were mediated by their carboxyl-terminal regions, which constitute distinct protein-binding motifs. A chimera of the intracellular domain of WT TGF-alpha linked to exogenous transmembrane and extracellular domains retained both the cell surface distribution and the specific interaction with ErbB4 of full-length WT, confirming that this interaction is mediated by the C-terminus of the TGF-alpha precursor. While interactions of WT and variant TGF-alpha with the ErbBs all result in ErbB2 activation, they produce different biological consequences, suggesting that the various TGF-alpha precursors differentially modulate ErbB signaling."
