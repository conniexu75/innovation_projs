https://openalex.org/W2057191493,"MELANINS can be extracted from hair by dilute caustic soda solution and purified by chromatography on calcium and magnesium carbonates1,2. The extraction with 0.05 N caustic soda is easier with rabbit hair and sheep wool than with human head hair. Owing to this ease of extraction, which is important in order to obtain pure melanins, but also because we had in mind an analysis of the phenogenesis of melanic pigmentation3,4, we have studied chiefly melanins from rabbits of known genotypic constitution. Nevertheless, the similarity of the data for mammalian hair melanins generally with those for rabbit hair melanins suggests that our conclusions are applicable to hair melanins in general and to melanins of other tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2003126932,"GLUCOSE oxidase was discovered by Müller1,2 in Aspergillus niger and Penicillium glaucum. He found that this enzyme catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid by means of molecular oxygen, and that at a much slower rate it also oxidizes mannose and galactose but not other sugars. The activity of the enzyme was found by him not to be affected by cyanide. The enzyme was reinvestigated by Franke and Lorenz3 and by Franke and Deffner4 Who, working with a more purified enzyme preparation, demonstrated that during the catalytic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide. They found also a certain proportionality between the activities of different preparations and their flavin content, and concluded that the enzyme must be a flavoprotein. More recently, Coulthard, Michaelis, Short, Sykes, Skrimshire, Standfast, Birkinshaw and Raistrick5, while investigating the antibacterial properties developing in culture media of Penicillium notatum, were able to isolate a substance described by them as notatin. They identified this substance as glucose oxidase and showed that the marked antibacterial property which it exhibits in presence of glucose and air is due to hydrogen peroxide produced by the reduction of atmospheric oxygen. They isolated and purified the enzyme on a large scale and obtained a product which can be considered as pure glucose oxidase. This enabled them to re-determine its properties and to establish its flavoprotein nature. They did not, however, determine the exact structure of its prosthetic group, although they suggested that it “could readily be determined whether notatin is of alloxazine-adenine-dinucleotide type by testing it for enzyme activity in the d-amino acid oxidase system”."

During the study of the food and feeding habits of this form1, it was noticed that appreciable numbers of free zooxanthellæ invariably occur in the stomach, especially of big specimens. The presence of zooxanthellæ in the stomach of Tridacna was previously recorded by Boschma2 and Yonge3. The latter author concluded that such zooxanthellæ were introduced accidentally through handling after the animal was opened for examination."

Since we have been forced to abandon this work for the time being, owing to the desirability of studying some of the nutritional problems in Germany, we have decided to publish our preliminary observations for the benefit of those who may be interested in the subject."

https://openalex.org/W2046534363,The age of the chicken in which the Rous sarcoma is grown has an influence on the variation and subsequent adaptation of the causative virus to ducks. Adaptation is relatively easy to accomplish when the tumor has been grown in adult chickens several months of age. It has never been accomplished when the tumor has been grown in chicks and only occasionally when it has been grown in old chickens.

https://openalex.org/W1969126070,"IT is well known that the change in the structure of cellulose in ramie produced by the action of caustic soda solution and by subsequent treatment with water depends largely on the concentration of the alkali used, the temperature and the magnitude of tension to which the fibre is subjected during the treatment. Hess and Trogus1 showed that if unstretched ramie is treated with 12.5–18 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and afterwards washed with water, the product gives the X-ray pattern of hydrated cellulose. Sakurada and Hutino2 later pointed out that unstretched ramie treated with 16 percent sodium hydroxide solution and washed with water for five minutes gives in the moist state a structure different from that of hydrated cellulose, and this product in the moist state was designated as 'water cellulose' by them. On being dried at 24° C. for three days in free air, water cellulose is converted to hydrated cellulose."

In this country the old custom of making bread from meals of 90–100 per cent extraction, which are ground in small local mills, has lingered on in many of our rural areas. Moreover, since May 1941 all meal used for bread-making has been standardized at an extraction-level of at least 95 per cent—usually somewhat higher."
https://openalex.org/W2094067252,"IT is well established that some of the toxic effects of sulphonamides on animals fed purified diets are caused by inhibition of bacterial synthesis of some B vitamins in the intestine, with consequent development of deficiency states. Few attempts have been made, however, to determine if the sulphonamides have a more fundamental effect on the metabolism of the B vitamins in the animal body. The purpose of the present communication is to make a preliminary report on experiments which suggest that sulphadiazine has an effect on the metabolism of aneurin in the animal body."

Colwell and McCall2 found that cysteine antagonizes the antibacterial action of 2-methyl 2-methyl-3-chloro- and 2: 6-dimethyl-l: 4-naphthaquinone on B. coli, but not that of 2-methyl-3-methoxy-l: 4-naphthaquinone, and postulated that inactivation might be caused by reaction of the sulphydryl group from the cysteine at the 3-position of the quinone. Geiger and Conn6 have suggested a somewhat similar mechanism for the inactivation of patulin and penicillic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2002366877,"I HOPED that my first letter on this subject would draw from some mathematician a statement on the uniqueness of the condition mentioned therein, and I am grateful to Mr. Kendall for responding and also for his kindness in sending me an early copy of his letter. From the physical point of view the position remains, I think, as stated in my second letter. The thermal relativity theory requires that the radiation formula shall satisfy a certain condition, which in fact it does. The theory is thus to that extent supported. The condition, however, is much less restrictive than I at first thought possible, and does not itself demand the Planck formula."
https://openalex.org/W2008838750,"ON May 15 last, a joint meeting of the Royal Meteorological Society and the British Ecological Society was held in the rooms of the Royal Society, Burlington House, at which a series of papers on the relation of ecology to climate was read. The importance of a proper understanding of climatic factors fpr the elucidation of many ecological problems needs no stressing: nor does the inadequacy of the climatological data usually available at present, particularly when information is needed with regard either to local climates as determined by topographical variations, or micro-climates arising within particular types of vegetation. This meeting was organised as a means of bringing meteorologists and ecologists into closer touch with each other and with problems which have aspects of interest to each and which cannot be solved satisfactorily without their co-operation."
https://openalex.org/W2017344086,"Kinsey and Grant1 have shown that the dynamics of accumulation of various electrolytes from the blood into the aqueous humor of the eye can be explained on the assumption that the rate of entrance is proportional to the concentration in the blood but independent of the concentration in the aqueous humor itself. They consider this to prove that electrolytes enter the eye by secretion. However, real ultrafiltration, involving bulk movement of fluid (as contrasted to dialysis), would give the same relationship. Their work therefore only shows that electrolytes do not enter the aqueous humor by diffusion."

https://openalex.org/W4252994036,"RETTING is the process by which the pectic material which binds the fibres to the remainder of the flax stem is broken down and the fibres are liberated. When flax is immersed in water the straw becomes softened and the soluble constituents, which include carbohydrates, glucosides and nitrogen compounds, are extracted. These provide abundant food for growth of the micro-organisms naturally present on the flax plant, and a rapid development of the mixed flora is then accompanied by characteristic chemical changes both in the liquid and in the straw. The retting is effected by certain types of bacteria which break down the pectic complex of the middle lamella of the flax plant, the fibre bundles being first separated from each other and from the cortex and then themselves split lengthwise into fibres."

https://openalex.org/W4233849755,"A COMMON Cold Research Unit is being established by the Medical Research Council and Ministry of Health, and will start work in July. It will be housed at the Harvard Hospital, near Salisbury, which was built and equipped in 1941, and given to the Ministry of Health by Harvard University and the American Red Cross as a place for research into communicable diseases. The problem of the common cold is a particularly complex one, made more difficult because, apart from chimpanzees, which are unsatisfactory for experimental purposes, it has not yet proved possible to study it in animals. Progress towards the discovery of effective means preventing a number of other diseases has not been made until some way of observing the disease in animals became available. For example, an effective vaccine against yellow fever became possible only when rhesus monkeys, and later mice, were found to be susceptible to the virus of the disease. Similarly, not until it was discovered that ferrets were susceptible to influenza virus was any progress made with the study of influenza. Therefore, the first objective on the present investigations into the common cold is to find a susceptible animal or, better still, some other laboratory technique which will permit a scientific approach to the problem."

https://openalex.org/W2050487450,"THE view has often been expressed that some at least of the difficulties encountered in the quantum-mechanical theory of the electron arise from the inadequateness of the underlying classical model. Perhaps some progress might be achieved by substituting a spin particle obeying the laws of relativistic dynamics for the spinless particle used as starting-point by Dirac. At least two different relativistic models of an electron (or, more generally, of any elementary particle with spin, as it seems probable that it is only through the process of quantization that the individuality of different sorts of particles is brought in) may be thus constructed, corresponding to the first and the second cases dealt with in earlier communications1. I shall only comment here on the second model."
https://openalex.org/W2983861058,"TWELVE discourses given by scientists and economists of the first rank were delivered at a symposium arranged by the American Philosophical Society to discuss “Atomic Energy and its Implications” ; they have now been published*. Four of these are purely physical: “Fifty Years of Atomic Physics”, by H. D. Smyth ; “Resonance Reactions”, by E. P. Wigner ; “Problems and Prospects in Elementary Particle Research”, by J. A. Wheeler ; “Methods and Objectives in the Separation of Isotopes”, by H. C. Urey. One by R. S. Stone deals with the health protection activities of the plutonium project. E. Fermi contributes a fascinating account of the development of the first chain-reacting pile, leading up to the historic event of December 2, 1942, when on the removal of about eight feet of the last cadmium strip, “the [neutron] intensity started rising slowly, but at an increasing rate, and kept on increasing until it was evident that it would actually diverge”. Nuclear energy had for the first time been produced in appreciable quantities under human control. Fermi says that this first successful pile in the squash court at Chicago University proved exceedingly easy to control. “All the operator has to do is to watch an instrument that indicates the intensity of the reaction and move the cadmium strips in if the intensity shows a tendency to rise and out if the intensity shows a tendency to drop.”The strips operate by absorbing neutrons which would otherwise multiply by causing fission in uranium nuclei, and so preventing the chain reaction from becoming diverging."

https://openalex.org/W4243769212,"THE major problem of re-settlement in Britain, and all the implications of the Government schemes for dealing with some four million ex-Service men and women in civilian life, are the subject of two broadsheets issued by Political and Economic Planning. It is doubtful whether either the Forces or the general public appreciate the sheer magnitude of this operation, coupled with inter-industrial transfers, or the many difficulties, particularly psychological, which are likely to arise. The first of these broadsheets, No. 238, “The Disabled Ex-Serviceman”, deals with one limited aspect of re-settlement: the question of how the community can best fulfil its obligation to the men and women who have suffered lasting disability as a result of their war service. The main reason for treating this subject separately is that the official schemes appeared to be yielding too high a proportion of failures ; but even in this broadsheet it is pointed out that in many respects the distinction between the fit and the disabled is artificial. Both alike need not only the service of efficient re-settlement machinery, but also sympathetic help and advice from officials who like o and understand their fellows. Fundamentally, re-settlement is an exercise in the art of treating people as free human beings, not arbitrarily classified units ; and the second broadsheet, No. 239, “Re-settlement”, is largely confined to a survey of the outstanding needs and problems involved in re-settlement, and a description of the ways in which the Government, reinforced by voluntary effort, proposes to tackle them."
