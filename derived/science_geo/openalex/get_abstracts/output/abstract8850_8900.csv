These purified peroxisomes were tested for the presence of crotonase, beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and thiolase using spectroscopic techniques that utilize the characteristic absorption bands of the appropriate 4-carbon acyl-CoA substrates. All three enzymes were found. Analysis of the fractions from equilibrium density centrifugation revealed major peaks of these enzyme activities in peroxisomes and excluded contamination by mitochondria as an explanation of the results. In the presence of excess CoA the purified peroxisomes oxidized palmitoyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, and reduced NAD, with a 1:5:5 stoichiometry. The peroxisomes were inactive with butyryl-CoA and less active with octanoyl-CoA than with lauroyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA; they appear specialized for the beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids."

Biochem. (Tokyo) 82, 287-289). This activator has now been identified as the modulator protein known to be a Ca2+-dependent regulator for phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, and ATPases. The identification is based on the quantitative cross-reactivity of muscle activator protein and brain modulator protein in activating myosin light chain kinase and brain phosphodiesterase and identical properties of both proteins in regard to sensitivities to Ca2+, UV absorption spectra, UV absorption difference spectra with or without Ca2+, and mobilities upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of modulator protein, the activity of myosin light chain kinase was reversibly controlled by the physiological concentration of Ca2+. We suggest that two Ca2+-receptive proteins, i.e. modulator protein and troponin-C, may play roles in the contraction-relaxation cycle of skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1594165376,"An acyl coenzyme A hydrolase (thioesterase II) has been purified to near homogeneity from lactating rat mammary gland. The enzyme is a monomer of molecular weight 33,000 and contains a single active site residue. The enzyme is specific for acyl groups, as acyl-CoA thioesters, containing eight or more carbon atoms and can also hydrolyze oxygen esters. Thioesterase II is capable of shifting the product specificity of rat mammary gland fatty acid synthetase from predominately long chain fatty acids (C14, C16, and C18) to mainly medium chain fatty acids (C8, C10, and C12). Thioesterase II can restore the capacity for fatty acid synthesis to fatty acid synthetase in which the thioesterase component (thioesterase I) has been inactivated with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or removed by trypsinization. No evidence was found of significant levels of thioesterase II in lactating rat liver. The presence of thioesterase II in the lactating mammary gland and the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze acyl-fatty acid synthetase thioesters of intermediate chain length, are indicative of a major role for this enzyme in the synthesis of the medium chain fatty acids characteristic of milk fat."
https://openalex.org/W1749735570,"Rat liver mitochondria were found to hydroxylate epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine to produce beta-hydroxy-epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine, an intermediate in carnitine biosynthesis. The hydroxylating system requires alpha-ketoglutarate, Fe2+, and ascorbate, but does not require NADPH nor NADH. No activity was found in the microsomal or soluble fractions of liver extracts. The hydroxylated alpha-amino acid was isolated and characterized by column chromatography using Dowex 50-H+ and Chelex 100-Cu2+ resins and by high voltage paper electrophoresis. The enzymatically produced beta-hydroxy-epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine was shown to be periodate-sensitive and one periodation product was characterized as gamma-butyrobetaine aldehyde. The hydroxylated product was acted upon by crystalline serine transhydroxymethylase (EC 2.1.2.1) to yield gamma-butyrobetaine aldehyde and glycine. Conversion of about 40% of the epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine to beta-hydroxy-epsilon-N-trimethyl-L-lysine was accomplished by this system with little or no further metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2061945596,"ULTRASONIC vocalisations commonly occur during social interactions among rodents. During mating, adult male and female rats (Rattus norvegicus) emit brief 50–60 kHz ultrasonic calls1; however, the function of these vocalisations is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that these mating calls have a precise function for communication. Specifically, 50-kHz vocalisations elicit sexual activity in female rats. Female rats exhibit a series of solicitation patterns during sexual behaviour, including orientation, darting and ear wiggling. These movements excite the male and enhance the likelihood of mounting, thereby facilitating copulation2–4. (Beach has emphasised the importance of solicitation by the female during mating and has suggested the term ‘proceptivity’ to include the female's behaviour in the initiation and maintenance of copulation.) Although the presence of an intact male is usually a prerequisite for solicitation behaviour, the specific sensory cues which elicit it are not known. Isolated oestrous female rats exposed to ultrasonic vocalisations from a male exhibited a shorter latency to, and higher rate of darting when subsequently placed in a mating situation5. Although the auditory cues primed oestrous females to display increased solicitation behaviour when later confronted with an intact male, there was no indication that these ultrasonic vocalisations had a direct function for communication in the induction of these behaviour patterns. The objective of the present report was to determine if ultrasonic mating calls of rats have a direct function for communication during copulation."

https://openalex.org/W1547919818,"The ability of methylated vaccinia virus mRNA to bind to ribosomes derived from wheat germ of rabbit reticulocyte lysates has been studied after beta elimination, to remove the 5'-terminal m7G, and after recapping of beta-eliminated mRNA molecules using guanylyltransferase.guanine-7-methyltransferase complex from vaccinia virions. Removal of m7G from the mRNA results in significant loss of ability to bind to ribosomes and to simulate protein synthesis in vitro. Readdition of m7G, but not of unmethylated guanosine to the 5' end results in recovery of both of these functions. To evaluate the role of 2'-O-methylation of the penultimate ribonucleoside, mRNAs containing m7G-(5')pppA- and m7G(5')pppG- as well as m7G(5')pppAm- and m7G(5')pppGm- ends were synthesized in vitro at limiting S-adenosylmethionine concentrations by vaccinia virus cores. By comparing the cap sequences of ribosome-bound and unbound mRNAs, we concluded that 2'-O-methylation has at most a minor effect compared to that of m7G upon ribosome binding under in vitro conditions. Only at high input mRNA concentrations, at which competition might occur, was there some ribodomal enrichment of mRNAs containing a specific terminal structure, namely m7G(5')pppAm-."

https://openalex.org/W1590579324,"Abstract Oligodendroglia isolated in bulk from dissected white matter of lamb or calf brain can now be maintained in culture for several days. The cells remain intact and viable during this time. The in vitro incorporation of various radiolabeled precursors into lipids or proteins was examined, and its was found that oligodendroglia synthesize the lipids which are predominant in brain, and especially in myelin. They actively synthesize cholesterol, cerebrosides, sulfatides, and all of the phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine. In addition, they produce a variety of radiolabeled proteins, with those of high molecular weight exhibiting the most radioactivity. Thus the cells are metabolically very active in vitro and can be used as a model system to study turnover of lipids in the cell, as well as the synthesis of myelin-specific components."

https://openalex.org/W1591014235,"Adenylate cyclase from the bovine cerebral cortex has been solubilized with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. The physical properties of the enzyme have been determined. These are: sedimentation coefficient, 8.1 S; Stokes radius, 70 A; partial specific volume, 0.79 ml/g; mass, 305,000 daltons; f/f0 1.5. The high partial specific volume measured in the presence of detergent indicates that the enzyme binds a large quantity of detergent (0.28mg of Triton X-100/mg of protein). The mass of the enzyme protein alone is 220,000 daltons. The size and detergent-binding properties of adenylate cyclase from bovine cerebral cortex are different from those previously reported for adenylate cyclase from the rat renal medulla (Neer, E. J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6527-6531). The renal enzyme is smaller by 60,000 daltons than the cerebral enzyme and does not bind measurable amounts of detergent. The amount of detergent bound by cerebral adenylate cyclase is characteristic of intrinsic membrane proteins. It suggests that there is a hydrophobic region on the surface of the molecule by which it is held in the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1502351078,"The rate of oxidation of L-[1-14C]leucine to 14CO2 by isolated rat hepatocytes is increased by pyruvate and dichloroacetate. This effect is specific for L-leucine, not being observed for L-valine, L-isoleucine, or D-leucine. Transamination, the rate-limiting step of L-leucine catabolism in the liver, is the site of stimulation, because uptake of L-leucine by the cells and the oxidation of its transamination product, alpha-ketoisocaproate, are not increased. Measurement of steady state levels of alpha-ketoisocaproate indicate that both pyruvate and dichloroacetate promote the transamination of L-leucine, thereby increasing the availability of substrate for decarboxylation by the alpha-ketoisocaproate dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.3). Pyruvate stimulation of transamination is secondary to the provision of keto acid acceptors for the amino group of L-leucine. The mechanism of the effect of dichloroacetate remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1502676233,"Excess vitamin A stimulated the incorporation of mannose into rat liver mannosylretinylphosphate (MRP), dolichylmannosylphosphate (DMP), and into glycoproteins by over 200% during a 20-min labeling period. The glycoproteins were digested with pronase and separated into three components by molecular sieve chromatography. The stimulation of mannose incorporation was greatest in the Peak II glycopeptide (Mr = 6500). In contrast, the incorporation of galactose into glycolipids or glycopeptides was not altered by vitamin A treatment. Analysis of the glycopeptide stimulated by vitamin A treatment showed it to contain mannose, glucose, galactose, and glucosamine in the respective molar ratios of 7:10:17:1 and to be rich in glutamic acid, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, and threonine. The results suggest that excess vitamin A stimulates the incorporation of mannose into glycoproteins by enhancing the synthesis of lipid intermediates involved in specific mannosyl transfer reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1980504354,"The polypeptide composition of murine fibroblast cells and the effect of infection by RNA sarcoma and leukemia viruses were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tryptic peptide mapping. The polypeptide maps of NIH Swiss mouse embryo fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) and BALB/c mouse embryo fibroblasts (BALB/3T3) were very similar except for two major polypeptides of about 65,000 and 75,000 daltons which were not detected in BALB/3T3 cells. NIH/3T3 cells infected with either Rauscher or Gross oncoviruses and outbred Swiss mouse embryo fibroblasts (3T3 FL) showed two major polypeptrides of about 73,000 and 80,000 daltons not found in uninfected NIH/3T3 cells. The 3T3 FL cells, although uninfected, were also found to contain a high concentration of envelope glycoprotein of an endogenous oncovirus. 3T3 FL cells transformed by Moloney sarcoma virus showed changes in many polypeptides, including several major components: the disappearance or modification of a component of 60,000 daltons, an increased concentration and shift in pl of a glycoprotein of 48,000 daltons, and the apparent loss of several smaller polypeptides. None of the major changes of the transformed cells were associated with cell surface proteins labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination."

https://openalex.org/W2005214453,"THE Zoological Society of London has a large collection of owls (Strigiformes) at Regent's Park. Usually, between 50 and 70 individuals of 25 species can be seen in the collection at one time. Between March 1974 and September 1976, 55 owls of 21 species died. This was an unusually large number, because these species present relatively few management problems. We now report that a significant proportion of the dead owls contained dieldrin residue, which could be traced back to the mice on which they were fed, and in turn to the sawdust used as bedding for the mice."

https://openalex.org/W1483240539,The fluorescence of rhodamine 6G is completely quenched in glucagon solutions in 0.6 M K2HOP4 at pH 10.6. The absorption of rhodamine 6G is red-shifted by the same reaction. A single rhodamine 6G molecule appears to be bound to a hydrophobic patch in the center of the trimer of glucagon. Since the glucagon monomer has almost no organized structure this site exists only in the associated trimer form of glucagon. The self-association of glucagon to the trimer has been determined from the variation in rhodamine 6G fluorescence and absorption measured over a 60-fold range of dye concentration. The self-association constant agrees with values determined by other methods in the absence of dye. The binding isotherms of rhodamine 6G to glucagon shift with glucagon concentration and exhibit negative cooperativity.
https://openalex.org/W1511397738,"Abstract Three proteinase inhibitors designated as I, II, and III were isolated from the excretory gland cells of the swine kidney worm, Stephanurus dentatus. The inhibitors, which were trichloroacetic acid-soluble, were purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The homogeneity of each inhibitor was shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrofocusing. The molecular weights of the inhibitors estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis fell within a limited range of 9300 to 9700, and the isoelectric points were 6.45, 6.20, and 5.34 for Inhibitors I, II, and III, respectively. The inhibitors formed complexes with trypsin having apparent dissociation constants (Ki) of 2.9 X 10(-11), 7.6 X 10(-11), and 6.4 X 10(-11) M, respectively. Each inhibitor inhibits the esterolytic and proteolytic activities of both trypsin and chymotrypsin. A proteinase inhibitor present in the reproductive organs, intestines, body walls, and esophagi was identical with Inhibitor II found in the excretory gland cells. Culture medium collected after 24-h incubation with adult worms contained the same three inhibitors as the excretory gland cells. These data suggest that the gland cells may secrete the inhibitors internally and externally."
