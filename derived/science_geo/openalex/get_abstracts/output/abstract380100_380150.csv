https://openalex.org/W2170121306,"In 2002, world leaders committed, through the Convention on Biological Diversity, to achieve a significant reduction in the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. We compiled 31 indicators to report on progress toward this target. Most indicators of the state of biodiversity (covering species' population trends, extinction risk, habitat extent and condition, and community composition) showed declines, with no significant recent reductions in rate, whereas indicators of pressures on biodiversity (including resource consumption, invasive alien species, nitrogen pollution, overexploitation, and climate change impacts) showed increases. Despite some local successes and increasing responses (including extent and biodiversity coverage of protected areas, sustainable forest management, policy responses to invasive alien species, and biodiversity-related aid), the rate of biodiversity loss does not appear to be slowing."

For full-scale displacement of petroleum as the chemical industry's primary feedstock, alternative conversion technologies will be necessary. Holm et al. (p. 602 ) have found that Lewis acidic zeolite derivatives suspended in methanol can catalyze the selective conversion of glucose, fructose, and sucrose sugars to methyl lactate, a versatile synthetic intermediate for commercial products. The catalysts were easily separated from product mixtures and proved robust over six reaction and regeneration cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1971775718,"Self-assembly is a powerful technique for the bottom-up construction of discrete, well-defined nanoscale structures. Large multicomponent systems (with more than 50 components) offer mechanistic insights into biological assembly but present daunting synthetic challenges. Here we report the self-assembly of giant M24L48 coordination spheres from 24 palladium ions (M) and 48 curved bridging ligands (L). The structure of this multicomponent system is highly sensitive to the geometry of the bent ligands. Even a slight change in the ligand bend angle critically switches the final structure observed across the entire ensemble of building blocks between M24L48 and M12L24 coordination spheres. The amplification of this small initial difference into an incommensurable difference in the resultant structures is a key mark of emergent behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2001720244,"Drusen are extracellular lesions characteristic of aging and age-related maculopathy, a major retinal disease of the elderly. We determined the relative proportions of lipids and proteins in drusen capped with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in RPE isolated from non-macular regions of 36 human retinas with grossly normal maculas obtained <6 hr after death.Druse pellets were examined by light and electron microscopy. Component proteins were extracted using novel methods for preserved tissues, separated, subjected to tryptic digestion and LC-MS(MS)(2) analysis using an ion trap mass spectrometer, and identified with reference to databases. Lipid classes were separated using thin layer chromatography and quantified by densitometry. Major druse components were esterified cholesterol (EC), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and protein (37.5+/-13.7, 36.9+/-12.9, and 43.0+/-11.5 ng/druse, respectively). Lipid-containing particles (median diameter, 77 nm) occupied 37-44% of druse volume. Major proteins include vitronectin, complement component 9, apoE, and clusterin, previously seen in drusen, and ATP synthase subunit beta, scavenger receptor B2, and retinol dehydrogenase 5, previously seen in RPE. Drusen and RPE had similar protein profiles, with higher intensities and greater variability in drusen. C8, part of the complement membrane attack complex, was localized in drusen by immunofluorescence.At least 40% of druse content is comprised by lipids dominated by EC and PC, 2 components that are potentially accounted for by just one pathway, the secretion of lipoproteins by RPE. Manipulating genes encoding apolipoprotein pathways would be a fruitful approach to producing drusen with high EC content in laboratory animals. Therapies that directly mitigate drusen should prepare for the substantial volume of neutral lipids. The catalog of major druse proteins is nearing completion."
https://openalex.org/W2050431763,"Learning to Work Together In group endeavors, there is often a tension between working for the greater good of the group as a whole versus working for one's own benefit. Sometimes these paths coincide and sometimes they do not; furthermore, the choices made by other group members can influence the calculation of which path to take. A pair of studies now approaches this challenge from experimental and theoretical points of view. In a forest or fishery, harvesting of wood or food needs to take into account the renewable character of the resource, as well as spatial heterogeneity. Janssen et al. (p. 613 ; see the Perspective by Putterman ) show that communication among the group members is key, both to establishing a maintainable rate of harvesting, as well as enforcement via punishment of noncompliers. Boyd et al. (p. 617 ; see the Perspective by Putterman ) develop a model showing that punishment, which is a costly activity, is most effectively levied when implemented with the approval of group members; that is, coordinated punishment works to the benefit of the whole, whereas individual actions do not."

Carbon isotope signatures from rocks in Australia measured by Swanson-Hysell et al. (p. 608 ) suggest that an organic carbon reservoir formed between two global glaciations, or “snowball Earth,” several hundred million years earlier than expected. Anoxic sulfate-limited waters, caused by increased river outputs from melting glaciers, may have prohibited bacterial respiration, allowing for the accumulation of organic carbon. As organic carbon levels dropped, CO 2 was released, allowing the atmosphere to warm, preventing further glaciations, and permitting the eventual accumulation of oxygen in the oceans that led to the Cambrian explosion."

https://openalex.org/W2069104338,"The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in controlling gene expression has garnered increased interest in recent years. Sequencing projects, such as Fantom3 for mouse and H-InvDB for human, have generated abundant data on transcribed components of mammalian cells, the majority of which appear not to be protein-coding. However, much of the non-protein-coding transcriptome could merely be a consequence of 'transcription noise'. It is therefore essential to use bioinformatic approaches to identify the likely functional candidates in a high throughput manner.We derived a scheme for classifying and annotating likely functional lncRNAs in mammals. Using the available experimental full-length cDNA data sets for human and mouse, we identified 78 lncRNAs that are either syntenically conserved between human and mouse, or that originate from the same protein-coding genes. Of these, 11 have significant sequence homology. We found that these lncRNAs exhibit: (i) patterns of codon substitution typical of non-coding transcripts; (ii) preservation of sequences in distant mammals such as dog and cow, (iii) significant sequence conservation relative to their corresponding flanking regions (in 50% cases, flanking regions do not have homology at all; and in the remaining, the degree of conservation is significantly less); (iv) existence mostly as single-exon forms (8/11); and, (v) presence of conserved and stable secondary structure motifs within them. We further identified orthologous protein-coding genes that are contributing to the pool of lncRNAs; of which, genes implicated in carcinogenesis are significantly over-represented.Our comparative mammalian genomics approach coupled with evolutionary analysis identified a small population of conserved long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are potentially functional across Mammalia. Additionally, our analysis indicates that amongst the orthologous protein-coding genes that produce lncRNAs, those implicated in cancer pathogenesis are significantly over-represented, suggesting that these lncRNAs could play an important role in cancer pathomechanisms."

The activities of the rate-limiting enzymes for glycogenesis and glycogenolysis also show circadian rhythms, and the balance between them forms the circadian rhythm of the hepatic glycogen content. However, no direct evidence has yet implicated the circadian clock in the regulation of glycogen metabolism at the molecular level. We show here that a Clock gene mutation damps the circadian rhythm of the hepatic glycogen content, as well as the circadian mRNA and protein expression of Gys2 (glycogen synthase 2), which is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenesis in the liver. Transient reporter assays revealed that CLOCK drives the transcriptional activation of Gys2 via two tandemly located E-boxes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of liver tissues revealed that CLOCK binds to these E-box elements in vivo, and real time reporter assays showed that these elements are sufficient for circadian Gys2 expression in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2001924203,"Down the Drain A pervasive cooling event affected much of the Northern Hemisphere approximately 9300 years ago. This event was accompanied by changes in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic, forced presumably by a large injection of fresh water produced by melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, but the source, magnitude, and routing of the meltwater remain unknown. Yu et al. (p. 1262 , published online 29 April) present evidence that the trigger for this cooling episode was an outburst flood from Lake Superior. Reconstructing lake-level changes in the Superior basin suggests that a rapid fall of lake level of about 45 meters occurred 9300 years ago, possibly due to the sudden failure of a drift dam. Rapid drainage through the North Bay–Ottawa River–St. Lawrence River valleys into the North Atlantic should have been sufficient to disturb ocean circulation in line with the geologic record."
https://openalex.org/W2046625490,"Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa causes an active-chronic inflammation that is strongly linked to the development of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. However, greater than 80% of individuals infected with H. pylori are asymptomatic beyond histologic inflammation, and it is unknown what factors influence the incidence and character of bacterial-associated gastritis and related disorders. Because previous studies demonstrated that the Muc1 epithelial glycoprotein inhibited inflammation during acute lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we asked whether Muc1 might also counter-regulate gastric inflammation in response to H. pylori infection. Muc1(-/-) mice displayed increased bacterial colonization of the stomach and greater TNF-alpha and keratinocyte chemoattractant transcript levels compared with Muc1(+/+) mice after experimental H. pylori infection. Knockdown of Muc1 expression in AGS human gastric epithelial cells by RNA interference was associated with increased phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, augmented activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, and enhanced production of interleulin-8 compared with Muc1-expressing cells. Conversely, Muc1 overexpression was correlated with decreased NF-kappaB activation, reduced interleulin-8 production, and diminished IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)/IKKgamma coimmunoprecipitation compared with cells expressing Muc1 endogenously. Cotransfection of AGS cells with Muc1 plus IKKbeta, but not a catalytically inactive IKKbeta mutant, reversed the Muc1 inhibitory effect. Finally, Muc1 formed a coimmunoprecipitation complex with IKKgamma but not with IKKbeta. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Muc1 binds to IKKgamma, thereby inhibiting formation of the catalytically active IKK complex and blocking the ability of H. pylori to stimulate IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, NF-kappaB activation, and downstream inflammatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W2123408996,"AKAP5 (also referred to as AKAP150 in rodents and AKAP79 in humans) is a scaffolding protein that is highly expressed in neurons and targets a variety of signaling molecules to dendritic membranes. AKAP5 interacts with PKA holoenzymes containing RIIalpha or RIIbeta as well as calcineurin (PP2B), PKC, calmodulin, adenylyl cyclase type V/VI, L-type calcium channels, and beta-adrenergic receptors. AKAP5 has also been shown to interact with members of the MAGUK family of PSD-scaffolding proteins including PSD95 and SAP97 and target signaling molecules to receptors and ion channels in the postsynaptic density (PSD). We created two lines of AKAP5 mutant mice: a knockout of AKAP5 (KO) and a mutant that lacks the PKA binding domain of AKAP5 (D36). We find that PKA is delocalized in both the hippocampus and striatum of KO and D36 mice indicating that other neural AKAPs cannot compensate for the loss of PKA binding to AKAP5. In AKAP5 mutant mice, a significant fraction of PKA becomes localized to dendritic shafts and this correlates with increased binding to microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2). Electrophysiological and behavioral analysis demonstrated more severe deficits in both synaptic plasticity and operant learning in the D36 mice compared with the complete KO animals. Our results indicate that the targeting of calcineurin or other binding partners of AKAP5 in the absence of the balancing kinase, PKA, leads to a disruption of synaptic plasticity and results in learning and memory defects."

The mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown. In this study, we report the influence of UN on excitation-contraction coupling, Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in particular, and transverse (t)-tubule structure. UN was induced in male Lewis rat hearts by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from the transplanted hearts after 4 wk and studied using whole-cell patch clamping, confocal microscopy, and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Recipient hearts were used as control (C). UN reduced the volume of cardiomyocytes by 56.5% compared with C (UN, n=90; C, n=59; P<0.001). The variance of time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transients was significantly increased in unloaded cardiomyocytes (UN 227.4+/-24.9 ms(2), n=42 vs. C 157.8+/-18.0 ms(2), n=40; P<0.05). UN did not alter the action potential morphology or whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) current compared with C, but caused a significantly higher Ca(2+) spark frequency (UN 3.718+/-0.85 events/100 mum/s, n=47 vs. C 0.908+/-0.186 events/100 microm/s, n=45; P<0.05). Confocal studies showed irregular distribution of the t tubules (power of the normal t-tubule frequency: UN 8.13+/-1.12x10(5), n=57 vs. C 20.60+/- 3.174x10(5), n=56; P<0.001) and SICM studies revealed a profound disruption to the openings of the t tubules and the cell surface in unloaded cardiomyocytes. We show that UN leads to a functional uncoupling of the CICR process and identify disruption of the t-tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum interaction as a possible mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2030686662,"Plague, one of the most devastating diseases in human history, is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The bacteria use a syringe-like macromolecular assembly to secrete various toxins directly into the host cells they infect. One such Yersinia outer protein, YopJ, performs the task of dampening innate immune responses in the host by simultaneously inhibiting the MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways. YopJ catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups to serine, threonine, and lysine residues on target proteins. Acetylation of serine and threonine residues prevents them from being phosphorylated thereby preventing the activation of signaling molecules on which they are located. In this study, we describe the requirement of a host-cell factor for full activation of the acetyltransferase activity of YopJ and identify this activating factor to be inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). We extend the applicability of our results to show that IP6 also stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of AvrA, the YopJ homologue from Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, an IP6-induced conformational change in AvrA suggests that IP6 acts as an allosteric activator of enzyme activity. Our results suggest that YopJ-family enzymes are quiescent in the bacterium where they are synthesized, because bacteria lack IP6; once injected into mammalian cells by the pathogen these toxins bind host cell IP6, are activated, and deregulate the MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways thereby subverting innate immunity.

The genus Yersinia of Gram-negative bacteria comprises eleven species of which three are pathogenic to humans. While Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of bubonic plague, the common enteric pathogens Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are responsible for gastroenteritis and lymphadenitis. All pathogenic Yersinia species harbor a 70-kb plasmid (pCD1 in Y. pestis and pYV in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis) that is essential for virulence. This plasmid encodes a Type III secretion system comprising a secretion apparatus, chaperones, and secreted effectors. The Type III secretion system mediates host-cell contact-dependent delivery of bacterial virulence proteins known as Yops (Yersinia outer proteins) (1Mueller C.A. Broz P. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Whereas some Yops are required to form the translocation apparatus and to control the process of translocation, a bouquet of six effector Yops is directly injected into the cytosol of target mammalian cells. These secreted toxins YopE, YopT, YopO, YopH, YopM, and YopJ act synergistically to rapidly overwhelm the host immune response (2Trosky J.E. Liverman A.D. Orth K. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Innate immunity provides the first line of defense against infectious diseases; however, many pathogens are able to avoid host recognition or to diminish the subsequent immune activation through interactions with host response molecules. All three pathogenic species of Yersinia share a marked tropism for lymphoid tissue where they use the arsenal of effector Yop proteins to resist uptake by phagocytic cells thus enabling extracellular replication. The effector Yops interfere with critical signaling processes of the host immune response. YopJ (from Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis; homologous to YopP from Y. enterocolitica) abrogates the innate immune response by inhibiting the MAPK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMKKMAPK kinaseMEK1,2MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 and 2AcCoAacetylcoenzyme AMRCMedical Research CouncilCMVcytomegalovirusMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSIPMKinositol phosphate multikinaseIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateIP5inositol pentakisphosphateIP6inositol hexakisphosphateIP7diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphateIP8bis-diphosphoinositol-tetrakisphosphatePP-IP4diphosphoinositol-tetrakisphosphateIS6inositol hexakissulfate. and NFκB signaling pathways, preventing the production of protective cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 8 (3Monack D.M.

GST-YopJ was expressed in Escherichia coli using the plasmid pGEX6P; as was GST-MEK2. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and bead-bound fusion proteins were digested with PreScission protease to liberate YopJ and MEK2, which were then purified by gel filtration.

IP6, when included, was typically present at a final concentration of 100 nm. Reaction products were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, de-stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. 20 confluent 90-mm dishes of HeLa cells (∼6 × 107 cells) were harvested in 6 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol (TEND Buffer) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 20 min using a TLA 100.2 rotor in a Beckman benchtop ultracentrifuge. The clarified supernatant (3 mg/ml protein) was harvested; 1 ml of which was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of TEND buffer (to remove endogenous AcCoA) and used in acetyltransferase assays. The remaining 5 ml of the HeLa cytosol described above was concentrated to 2 ml using a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off filter and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TEND buffer, and 2-ml fractions were collected. 15 μl of each fraction were then included in acetyltransferase reactions using 5 μg of MEK2, 1 μg of YopJ, and [1-14C]AcCoA to identify the fractions that contained cofactor activity. Initially, acid extracts were made from HeLa cells by precipitating proteins from the cleared lysate using either 10% trichloroacetic acid or 5% perchloric acid. Subsequently, a modification of the method described by Azevedo and Saiardi (11Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2416-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended directly in 1 m perchloric acid/3 mm EDTA and kept on ice for 10 min with intermittent vortexing. The extract was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a tabletop microcentrifuge. The clear supernatant was then neutralized using 1 m potassium carbonate/3 mm EDTA. Precipitated salt was removed by brief centrifugation. The clear supernatant recovered at the end of the procedure represented the acid extract of cells and was verified to be at near neutral pH before use in assays. This protocol was used to make extracts from the different cell types described in this study. Yeast cells were vortexed in the presence of glass beads. A HeLa cell pellet corresponding to ∼2 × 108 cells was thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of 1 m perchloric acid/3 mm EDTA solution and vortexed. This extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and the clear supernatant was harvested and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The extract was then neutralized using 1 m potassium carbonate/3 mm EDTA and centrifuged. The clarified, neutralized extract containing the cofactor was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and mixed with a 1-ml slurry of AG1-X8 strong anion-exchange resin (Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with acetate. After overnight incubation at room temperature the mixture was poured into an empty chromatography column; the flow-through was discarded and the resin washed with 30 ml of water. Bound material was eluted from the resin using 10 ml of 2 n hydrochloric acid, lyophilized to remove the acid, and taken up in 200 μl water. This preparation was assayed for the presence of cofactor activity (Fig. 3A) and then subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry to help identify the cofactor. The elution described above was subjected to MALDI-MS, in the reflectron negative ion mode, to measure the m/z of the substance(s) present. 0.7 μl of the sample was applied onto a stainless steel target, and 0.7 μl of 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone matrix was added. The matrix had been prepared by dissolving 10 mg of 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone matrix in 1 ml of acetonitrile/5 mg/ml diammonium citrate (1:1, v/v). All spectra were acquired with an Ultraflex III TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). A single major species with m/z = 658.823 was observed and was selected for MALDI-MS/MS fragmentation in negative LIFT mode. The fragmentation ion series of [M-H]−1 = 658.823 showed the loss of H3PO4 and HPO3 ions thereby indicating that the elution contained IP6. This identification was confirmed by comparing with the MS/MS fragment spectrum of commercially available IP6 acquired under the same conditions. The following strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were generously provided by A. Saiardi (MRC Laboratory for Molecular and Cell Biology, University College London, London, UK). Wild-type strains: BY4741 (MATa; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0) and DDY1810 (MATa, leu2, ura3–52, trp1, prb1–1122, pep4–3, pre1–451). Mutant strains: ipk1Δ and ipk1Δkcs1Δ (in the BY4741 background) and ipmkΔ and kcs1Δ (in the DDY1810 background). Mutants in the BY4741 background were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418, whereas those in the DDY1810 background were cultured in the absence of leucine. The growth of ipk1Δ yeast is comparable to that of wild-type yeast, whereas the remaining mutant strains grow slower. The optical densities of the cultures were monitored, and an equal number of yeast cells from each culture was used for the preparation of yeast acid extracts. Protein tryptophan fluorescence of AvrA (5.6 μm in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) was excited at 280 nm, and emission at 330 nm was monitored at 20 °C over time in a 200-μl volume using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Yvon Spex). The addition of IP6 (10 μm) resulted in a saturable decrease of fluorescence. Far UV (from 195 to 250 nm) CD spectra of AvrA (10 μm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl were recorded at 20 °C using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette (200-μl sample volume) in a JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer. Successive spectra were recorded after the addition of different amounts of IP6 (0 μm, 0.5 μm, 1 μm, 2 μm, 3 μm, 4 μm, 5 μm, and 10 μm). Spectra recorded after the addition of IP6 showed a drop in signal at 208 nm and 222 nm indicating a gain in helicity by AvrA. There was no further decrease after addition of IP6 at concentrations higher than 10 μm. Time course of change in ellipticity of AvrA upon addition of IP6 was measured in an Aviv 202SF spectrometer. AvrA (5 μm) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl was taken in a stirred 1- × 1-cm cuvette (2.5-ml sample volume), and, upon establishment of a stable baseline, IP6 was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. Expression of YopJ in cultured mammalian cells results in the acetylation of cellular MEK1/2. We discovered that acetylation of the activation loop of MEK1/2 resulted in the loss of immunodetection of MEK1/2 by the antiserum CST9122 (Fig. 1A) (6Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This antiserum, raised against a peptide comprising the residues of the activation loop of MEK1/2, efficiently recognizes unmodified MEK1/2 but does not recognize MEK1/2 that has been acetylated by YopJ on the serine and threonine residues within the activation loop. Loss of signal on a Western blot thus provided us a stringent readout for the assessment of the extent of YopJ-mediated modification of MEK1/2. The 47E6 antibody, on the other hand, was not sensitive to the modification and allowed visualization of total amounts of MEK1/2. Using the antiserum CST9122 as a readout of MEK modification, we had earlier (6Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) concluded that even very small amounts of YopJ expressed in mammalian cells were sufficient to cause the acetylation of most, if not all, of the MEK1/2 in cells, suggesting that YopJ is a very efficient acetyltransferase. A similar inference has also been made by others, wherein it has been reported that as little as 1 ng of transfected YopJ or VopA (the YopJ homologue from V. parahemeolyticus) results in inhibition of MAPK signaling (12Trosky J.E. Mukherjee S. Burdette D.L. Roberts M. McCarter L. Siegel R.M. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51953-51957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most bacterial toxins are very active in terms of their enzymatic activities; YopH, another type III effector from Yersinia that manifests a protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, has been recognized as one of the most potent protein-tyrosine phosphatases isolated to date (13Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase activity of YopJ can also be observed in vitro using purified recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria (5Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 6Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Acetylation of purified MEK2 by YopJ could be monitored by the inclusion of radioactive [14C]-AcCoA in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1B). However, analysis of the same reactions by Western blotting showed that only a small percentage of the total MEK molecules had been modified when enzymatic concentrations of YopJ were used. Increasing the concentration of AcCoA, raising the temperature or duration of incubation of the reaction mixture did not result in any significant improvement in the extent of acetylation. The poor efficiency of acetylation in vitro, which contrasted with the extremely efficient modification of MEK in mammalian HeLa cells, led us to wonder if there might be a mammalian cell cofactor required for the activation of the acetyltransferase activity of YopJ. Indeed, inclusion of dialyzed HeLa cytosol resulted in a marked stimulation of the acetyltransferase activity of YopJ (Fig. 1C). Not only was there a significantly higher acetylation of MEK but also an increase in YopJ autoacetylation. These observations suggested that mammalian cell cytosol contains a cofactor that stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of YopJ. This observation is not without precedent. Another type III effector protein from Yersinia, YpkA (YopO), requires eukaryotic cell actin as an activator. Binding of G-actin to YpkA stimulates the serine-threonine kinase activity of YpkA (14Juris S.J. Rudolph A.E. Huddler D. Orth K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9431-9436Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Actin is also reported to be a cofactor required for maximal activity of the adenovirus protease adenain (15Brown M.T. McBride K.M. Baniecki M.L. Reich N.C. Marriott G. Mangel W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46298-46303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a first step toward identifying the cofactor required for YopJ we decided to fractionate HeLa cytosol by size-exclusion chromatography. HeLa cytosol corresponding to 30 mg of total protein was resolved over S75 Superdex resin, and 2-ml fractions were collected. 15 μl of each fraction was analyzed for the presence of the cofactor. Cofactor activity was observed (supplemental Fig. S1) to elute from the gel-filtration column as a relatively broad peak starting at Fraction 52, indicating that the cofactor was likely a low molecular mass molecule (smaller than the 12.4-kDa cytochrome c standard). YopJ has been suggested to act as a deubiquitinase (16Zhou H. Monack D.M. Kayagaki N. Wertz I. Yin J. Wolf B. Dixit V.M. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Sweet C.R. Conlon J. Golenbock D.T. Goguen J. Silverman N. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2700-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), although we have not been able to observe any significant deubiquitinase activity associated with YopJ (expressed as recombinant protein in bacteria or in insect cells). We thus examined whether ubiquitin (molecular mass of 8.5 kDa) might be serving as the low molecular weight activating cofactor for YopJ, but this was not the case. Inclusion of various amounts of ubiquitin in YopJ-catalyzed acetyltransferase assays did not result in any stimulation of YopJ activity. We then tried various treatments on Fraction 52 (obtained from size-exclusion chromatography described above) to better understand the nature of the cofactor. Significantly, heating Fraction 52 at 95 °C for 30 min did not destroy the cofactor activity (Fig. 2A). Protease, nuclease, and phosphatase treatments of Fraction 52 also did not significantly affect cofactor activity (except at very high doses). The results obtained thus far suggested that YopJ required a mammalian cell, low molecular weight, heat-stable cofactor for activation of its acetyltransferase activity. Furthermore, the cofactor did not seem to be proteinaceous or composed of nucleic acids. Consistent with these observations, an acid extract of HeLa cells was found to contain cofactor activity (Fig. 2B). This treatment removes most protein and nucleic acid components and leaves intact only small molecules and metabolites. We next examined whether the cofactor was specific to mammalian cells. Acid extracts were prepared from bacteria, yeast, slime mold, HeLa cells and from rat brain, neutralized, and tested for the presence of cofactor. Interestingly, it was discovered that only bacteria lacked the cofactor (Fig. 2C). The activatory cofactor for YopJ was thus exclusively eukaryotic and not found in bacteria. This observation immediately suggested that the powerful acetyltransferase YopJ is likely kept quiescent in Yersinia by virtue of the lack of a eukaryotic cofactor. Having narrowed down the cofactor to an acid extract of eukaryotic cells, we next employed the ion-exchange resin AG1-X8 to further fractionate the extract. Neutralized acid extracts of HeLa cells were passed over acetate-equilibrated AG1-X8 resin, and the resin was subsequently washed with water. Bound material was eluted with hydrochloric acid and tested for cofactor activity in YopJ-catalyzed acetyltransferase assays. Fig. 3A shows that the stimulatory cofactor was, indeed, enriched on AG1-X8 resin. The eluate from the AG1-X8 resin was then analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the molecule(s) contained therein. MS analysis in the negative ion mode revealed the presence of a predominant species with m/z = 658.823 in the elution (Fig. 3B). This moiety was further subjected to fragmentation analysis using MALDI-MS/MS and displayed peaks corresponding to the loss of H3PO4 and HPO3 ions (Fig. 3C). The MS analyses presented in Fig. 3 (B and C) suggested that the cofactor present in the elution was likely IP6. The presence of fragments corresponding to breakdown products of IP6, namely IP5 (m/z = 578.9 Da), IP4 (m/z = 498.9 Da), and other fragments resulting from the loss of H2O from these species, were also seen (Fig. 3C). The identification was confirmed by comparing with the MS/MS fragment spectrum of commercially available IP6 acquired under the same conditions (Fig. 3D). These results establish that the activatory cofactor for YopJ purified from mammalian cells using AG1-X8 resin is IP6, also known as phytic acid or phytate. Efficient analysis of inositol phosphates is difficult, because the compounds do not absorb visible or UV light nor can they easily be identified using specific colorimetric reagents. To verify that IP6 is indeed the activatory cofactor we performed in vitro acetyltransferase assays using chemically pure IP3, IP6, and inositol hexakissulfate (IS6). IS6 has similar structure and charge density compared with IP6 and can be used to examine the specificity of the requirement for IP6 (18Macbeth M.R. Schubert H.L. Vandemark A.P. Lingam A.T. Hill C.P. Bass B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is seen in Fig. 4A that IP3 and IS6 could not substitute for IP6 as cofactors of YopJ. This observation indicates that YopJ is selective in its requirement for phosphate groups and that three phosphates, as in IP3, are insufficient to stimulate the activity of YopJ. The enzyme phytase (myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate 6-phosphohydrolase), naturally present in many plants and microorganisms, breaks down IP6 (phytate) releasing phosphate (19Haefner S. Knietsch A. Scholten E. Braun J. Lohscheidt M. Zelder O. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We observed (Fig. 4B) that phytase destroyed the cofactor activity of both IP6 and of the mammalian cell extract (two dilutions); alkaline phosphatase, on the other hand, did not. This result constitutes further proof of IP6 being the activatory cofactor. We then examined the extent of MEK acetylation using the discriminatory CST9122 antiserum. As seen in Fig. 4C inclusion of IP6 in acetyltransferase reactions resulted in very high levels of modification of MEK as inferred by the significant loss of immunodetection by the CST9122 antiserum (lanes 1 and 2); also, inclusion of progressively higher amounts of the HeLa cell extract led to progressively higher modification of MEK within the duration of the assay (1 h). This result shows that inclusion of IP6 or HeLa extract can stimulate the acetyltransferase activity of YopJ to achieve near complete acetylation of MEK. Taken together, these results identify IP6 as the mammalian cell cofactor required by YopJ for activation of its acetyltransferase activity. This is manifested in increased autoacetylation as well as increased substrate acetylation by YopJ. Our results establish YopJ as the second Yersinia effector, after YpkA, which requires a host cell molecule for stimulation of its enzymatic activity. Binding of eukaryotic cell actin has been shown to result in increased autophosphorylation of YpkA resulting in elevated kinase activity of YpkA toward substrates (20Trasak C. Zenner G. Vogel A. Yüksekdag G. Rost R. Haase I. Fischer M. Israel L. Imhof A. Linder S. Schleicher M. Aepfelbacher M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2268-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we observed that prior autoacetylation of YopJ was not required for acetylation of MEK by YopJ (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, unlike the autoacetylation of transcription factor IIB (21Choi C.H. Hiromura M. Usheva A.

Unconventionally, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), a member of the RGS-RhoGEFs, binds tightly to both nucleotide-free and activated RhoA (RhoA.GTP). We have characterized the interaction between PRG and activated RhoA and determined the structure of the PRG-DH.PH-RhoA.GTPgammaS (guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate) complex. The interface bears striking similarity to a GTPase-effector interface and involves the switch regions in RhoA and a hydrophobic patch in PRG-PH that is conserved among all Lbc RhoGEFs. The two surfaces that bind activated and nucleotide-free RhoA on PRG-DH.PH do not overlap, and a ternary complex of PRG-DH.PH bound to both forms of RhoA can be isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. This novel interaction between activated RhoA and PH could play a key role in regulation of RhoGEF activity in vivo."

Using live cell microscopy, we show that fluorophore-tagged p130Cas is a component of FAs throughout the FA assembly and disassembly stages, although it resides transiently in FAs with a high mobile fraction. Deletion of either the N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain or the Cas-family C-terminal homology (CCH) domain significantly impaired p130Cas FA localization, and deletion of both domains resulted in full exclusion. Focal adhesion kinase was implicated in the FA targeting function of the p130Cas SH3 domain. Consistent with their roles in FA targeting, both the SH3 and CCH domains were found necessary for p130Cas to fully undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and promote cell migration. By revealing the capacity of p130Cas to function in FAs throughout their lifetime, clarifying FA targeting mechanism, and demonstrating the functional importance of the highly conserved CCH domain, our results advance the understanding of an important aspect of integrin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2054931905,"Chronic oxidative stress results in decreased responsiveness to insulin, eventually leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway can mediate many of the effects of stress on insulin resistance through inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. By contrast, exercise, which acutely increases oxidative stress in the muscle, improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in patients with Type 2 diabetes. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the contrasting effects of acute versus chronic oxidative stress on insulin sensitivity, we used a cellular model of insulin-resistant muscle to induce either chronic or acute oxidative stress and investigate their effects on insulin and JNK signaling. Chronic oxidative stress resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated (activated) JNK in the cytoplasm, whereas acute oxidative stress led to redistribution of JNK-specific phosphatase MKP7 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, reduction in cytoplasmic phospho-JNK, and a concurrent accumulation of phospho-JNK in the nucleus. Acute oxidative stress restored normal insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in insulin-resistant muscle cells, and this effect was dependent on MKP7. We propose that the contrasting effects of acute and chronic stress on insulin sensitivity are driven by changes in subcellular distribution of MKP7 and activated JNK."
https://openalex.org/W2022982095,"beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta42) is the core protein of amyloid plaque in Alzheimer disease. The intracellular accumulation of Abeta42 in the endosomal/lysosomal system has been under investigation for many years, but the direct link between Abeta42 accumulation and dysfunction of the endosomal/lysosomal system is still largely unknown. Here, we found that both in vitro and in vivo, a major portion of Abeta42 was tightly inserted into and a small portion peripherally associated with the lysosomal membrane, whereas its soluble portion was minimal. We also found that the Abeta42 molecules inserted into the membrane tended to form multiple oligomeric aggregates, whereas Abeta40 peptides formed only dimers. Neutralizing lysosomal pH in differentiated PC12 cells decreased the lysosomal membrane insertion of Abeta42 and moderated Abeta42-induced lysosomal labilization and cytotoxicity. Our findings, thus, suggest that the membrane-inserted portion of Abeta42 accumulated in lysosomes may destabilize the lysosomal membrane and induce neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2024749532,"Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the so-called unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling pathway that drives the transcription of genes such as chaperones and folding enzymes. Nevertheless, the activity of the UPR accounts only for a part of the gene expression program activated upon ER stress. Moreover, the mechanism(s) for how cells adapt and survive to this stress are largely unknown. Here, we show that the yeast high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway plays a role in ER stress resistance. Strains lacking the MAPK Hog1p displayed sensitivity to tunicamycin or beta-mercaptoethanol, whereas hyperactivation of the pathway enhanced their resistance. However, these effects were not due to Hog1p-mediated regulation of the UPR. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Hog1p controls the tunicamycin-induced transcriptional change of GPD1 and that wild-type cells exposed to the drug accumulated glycerol in a Hog1p-dependent manner. Consistent with this, deletion of genes involved in glycerol synthesis caused increased sensitivity to tunicamycin, whereas overexpression of GPD1 provided higher tolerance to both wild-type and hog1Delta mutant cells. Quite remarkably, these effects were mediated by the basal activity of the MAPK because tunicamycin exposure does not trigger the phosphorylation of Hog1p or its nuclear import. Hence, our results describe new aspects of the yeast response to ER stress and identify additional functions of glycerol and the Hog1p MAPK to provide stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2028371876,"The ability to communicate anxiety through chemosensory signals has been documented in humans by behavioral, perceptual and brain imaging studies. Here, we investigate in a time-sensitive manner how chemosensory anxiety signals, donated by humans awaiting an academic examination, are processed by the human brain, by analyzing chemosensory event-related potentials (CSERPs, 64-channel recording with current source density analysis).In the first study cerebral stimulus processing was recorded from 28 non-socially anxious participants and in the second study from 16 socially anxious individuals. Each individual participated in two sessions, smelling sweat samples donated from either female or male donors (88 sessions; balanced session order). Most of the participants of both studies were unable to detect the stimuli olfactorily. In non-socially anxious females, CSERPs demonstrate an increased magnitude of the P3 component in response to chemosensory anxiety signals. The source of this P3 activity was allocated to medial frontal brain areas. In socially anxious females chemosensory anxiety signals require more neuronal resources during early pre-attentive stimulus processing (N1). The neocortical sources of this activity were located within medial and lateral frontal brain areas. In general, the event-related neuronal brain activity in males was much weaker than in females. However, socially anxious males processed chemosensory anxiety signals earlier (N1 latency) than the control stimuli collected during an ergometer training.It is concluded that the processing of chemosensory anxiety signals requires enhanced neuronal energy. Socially anxious individuals show an early processing bias towards social fear signals, resulting in a repression of late attentional stimulus processing."
https://openalex.org/W2082555884,"The first Swiss human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line, CH-ES1, has shown features of a malignant cell line. It originated from the only single blastomere that survived cryopreservation of an embryo, and it more closely resembles teratocarcinoma lines than other hESC lines with respect to its abnormal karyotype and its formation of invasive tumors when injected into SCID mice. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular basis of the oncogenicity of CH-ES1 cells, we looked for abnormal chromosomal copy number (by array Comparative Genomic Hybridization, aCGH) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To see how unique these changes were, we compared these results to data collected from the 2102Ep teratocarcinoma line and four hESC lines (H1, HS293, HS401 and SIVF-02) which displayed normal G-banding result. We identified genomic gains and losses in CH-ES1, including gains in areas containing several oncogenes. These features are similar to those observed in teratocarcinomas, and this explains the high malignancy. The CH-ES1 line was trisomic for chromosomes 1, 9, 12, 17, 19, 20 and X. Also the karyotypically (based on G-banding) normal hESC lines were also found to have several genomic changes that involved genes with known roles in cancer. The largest changes were found in the H1 line at passage number 56, when large 5 Mb duplications in chromosomes 1q32.2 and 22q12.2 were detected, but the losses and gains were seen already at passage 22. These changes found in the other lines highlight the importance of assessing the acquisition of genetic changes by hESCs before their use in regenerative medicine applications. They also point to the possibility that the acquisition of genetic changes by ESCs in culture may be used to explore certain aspects of the mechanisms regulating oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2103884287,"The relationship between host density and parasite transmission is central to the effectiveness of many disease management strategies. Few studies, however, have empirically estimated this relationship particularly in large mammals. We applied hierarchical Bayesian methods to a 19-year dataset of over 6400 brucellosis tests of adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) in northwestern Wyoming. Management captures that occurred from January to March were over two times more likely to be seropositive than hunted elk that were killed in September to December, while accounting for site and year effects. Areas with supplemental feeding grounds for elk had higher seroprevalence in 1991 than other regions, but by 2009 many areas distant from the feeding grounds were of comparable seroprevalence. The increases in brucellosis seroprevalence were correlated with elk densities at the elk management unit, or hunt area, scale (mean 2070 km(2); range = [95-10237]). The data, however, could not differentiate among linear and non-linear effects of host density. Therefore, control efforts that focus on reducing elk densities at a broad spatial scale were only weakly supported. Additional research on how a few, large groups within a region may be driving disease dynamics is needed for more targeted and effective management interventions. Brucellosis appears to be expanding its range into new regions and elk populations, which is likely to further complicate the United States brucellosis eradication program. This study is an example of how the dynamics of host populations can affect their ability to serve as disease reservoirs."

The phase I response displays a rapid and steep decline in VO(2) that is independent of body temperature (T(b)) and ambient temperature (T(a)). It is followed by a phase II decline that is linked to T(b) and moderated by T(a). Altering the dosages of 5'-AMP from 0.25- to 2-fold does not change the phase I response. For mice, a T(a) of 15 degrees C is effective for induction of DH with the appropriate dose of 5'-AMP. Erythrocyte uptake of 5'-AMP leads to utilization of ATP to synthesize ADP. This is accompanied by increased glucose but decreased lactate levels, suggesting that glycolysis has slowed. Reduction in glycolysis is known to stimulate erythrocytes to increase intracellular levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a potent allosteric inhibitor of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Our studies showed that both 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and deoxyhemoglobin levels rose following 5'-AMP administration and is in parallel with the phase I decline in VO(2). In summary, our investigations reveal that 5'-AMP mediated hypometabolism is probably triggered by reduced oxygen transport by erythrocytes initiated by uptake of 5'-AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2096801771,"Background WRN is a multi-functional protein involving DNA replication, recombination and repair. WRN acetylation has been demonstrated playing an important role in response to DNA damage. We previously found that WRN acetylation can regulate its enzymatic activities and nuclear distribution. Methodology/Principal Finding Here, we investigated the factors involved in WRN acetylation and found that CBP and p300 are the only major acetyltransferases for WRN acetylation. We further identified 6 lysine residues in WRN that are subject to acetylation. Interestingly, WRN acetylation can increase its protein stability. SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of WRN reverses this effect. CBP dramatically increases the half-life of wild type WRN, while mutation of these 6 lysine residues (WRN-6KR) abrogates this increase. We further found that WRN stability is regulated by the ubiquitination pathway and WRN acetylation by CBP significantly reduces its ubiquitination. Importantly, we found that WRN is strongly acetylated and stabilized in response to mitomycin C (MMC) treatment. H1299 cells stably expressing WRN-6KR, which mimics unacetylated WRN, display significantly higher MMC sensitivity compared with the cells expressing wild-type WRN. Conclusion/Significance Taken together, these data demonstrate that WRN acetylation regulates its stability and has significant implications regarding the role of acetylation on WRN function in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2088154590,"Two distinctive features characterize the way in which sensations including pain, are evoked by heat: (1) a thermal stimulus is always progressive; (2) a painful stimulus activates two different types of nociceptors, connected to peripheral afferent fibers with medium and slow conduction velocities, namely Adelta- and C-fibers. In the light of a recent study in the rat, our objective was to develop an experimental paradigm in humans, based on the joint analysis of the stimulus and the response of the subject, to measure the thermal thresholds and latencies of pain elicited by Adelta- and C-fibers. For comparison, the same approach was applied to the sensation of warmth elicited by thermoreceptors. A CO(2) laser beam raised the temperature of the skin filmed by an infrared camera. The subject stopped the beam when he/she perceived pain. The thermal images were analyzed to provide four variables: true thresholds and latencies of pain triggered by heat via Adelta- and C-fibers. The psychophysical threshold of pain triggered by Adelta-fibers was always higher (2.5-3 degrees C) than that triggered by C-fibers. The initial skin temperature did not influence these thresholds. The mean conduction velocities of the corresponding fibers were 13 and 0.8 m/s, respectively. The triggering of pain either by C- or by Adelta-fibers was piloted by several factors including the low/high rate of stimulation, the low/high base temperature of the skin, the short/long peripheral nerve path and some pharmacological manipulations (e.g. Capsaicin). Warming a large skin area increased the pain thresholds. Considering the warmth detection gave a different picture: the threshold was strongly influenced by the initial skin temperature and the subjects detected an average variation of 2.7 degrees C, whatever the initial temperature. This is the first time that thresholds and latencies for pain elicited by both Adelta- and C-fibers from a given body region have been measured in the same experimental run. Such an approach illustrates the role of nociception as a ""double level"" and ""double release"" alarm system based on level detectors. By contrast, warmth detection was found to be based on difference detectors. It is hypothesized that pain results from a CNS build-up process resulting from population coding and strongly influenced by the background temperatures surrounding at large the stimulation site. We propose an alternative solution to the conventional methods that only measure a single ""threshold of pain"", without knowing which of the two systems is involved."

However, features within Hsp70s that determine Hsp40 specificity are undefined. To investigate this question, we introduced mutations into the ER-lumenal Hsp70, BiP/Kar2p, and found that an R217A substitution in the J domain-interacting surface of BiP compromised the physical and functional interaction with Sec63p, an Hsp40 required for ER translocation. In contrast, interaction with Jem1p, an Hsp40 required for ER-associated degradation, was unaffected. Moreover, yeast expressing R217A BiP exhibited defects in translocation but not in ER-associated degradation. Finally, the genetic interactions of the R217A BiP mutant were found to correlate with those of known translocation mutants. Together, our results indicate that residues within the Hsp70 J domain-interacting surface help confer Hsp40 specificity, in turn influencing distinct chaperone-mediated cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W2136751995,"Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are present in atherosclerotic plaques and are now considered novel attractive therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers as they contribute to the development of atherosclerosis through lipoprotein-dependent and independent mechanisms. We have previously shown that hGX-sPLA2-phospholipolyzed LDL (LDL-X) induces proinflammatory responses in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs); here we explore the molecular mechanisms involved. Global transcriptional gene expression profiling of the response of endothelial cells exposed to either LDL or LDL-X revealed that LDL-X activates multiple distinct cellular pathways including the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mechanistic insight showed that LDL-X activates UPR through calcium depletion of intracellular stores, which in turn disturbs cytoskeleton organization. Treatment of HUVECs and aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with LDL-X led to activation of all 3 proximal initiators of UPR: eIF-2α, IRE1α, and ATF6. In parallel, we observed a sustained phosphorylation of the p38 pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of AP-1 downstream targets. This was accompanied by significant production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Our study demonstrates that phospholipolyzed LDL uses a range of molecular pathways including UPR to initiate endothelial cell perturbation and thus provides an LDL oxidation-independent mechanism for the initiation of vascular inflammation in atherosclerosis.—Gora, S., Maouche, S., Atout, R., Wanherdrick, K., Lambeau, G., Cambien, F., Ninio, E., Karabina, S.-A.

https://openalex.org/W2080343832,"Human embryogenesis is believed to involve an integrated set of complex yet coordinated development of different organs and tissues mediated by the changes in the spatiotemporal expression of many genes. Here, we report a genome-wide expression analysis during wk 4–9 of human embryogenesis, a critical period when most organs develop. About half of all human genes are expressed, and 18.6% of the expressed genes were significantly regulated during this important period. We further identified >5000 regulated genes, most of which previously were not known to be associated with animal development. Our study fills an important gap in mammalian developmental studies by identifying functional pathways involved in this critical but previously not studied period. Our study also revealed that the genes involved here are distinct from those during early embryogenesis, which include three groups of maternal genes. Furthermore, we discovered that genes in a given developmental process are regulated coordinately. This led us to develop an easily searchable database of this entire collection of gene expression profiles, allowing for the identification new genes important for a particular developmental process/pathway and deducing the potential function of a novel gene. The validity of the predictions from the database was demonstrated with two examples through spatiotemporal analyses of the two novel genes. Such a database should serve as a highly valuable resource for the molecular analysis of human development and pathogenesis.—Yi, H., Xue, L., Guo, M.-X. Ma, J., Zeng, Y., Wang, W., Cai, J.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2013936241,"Background Over the past thirty years several reports of the pairing or association of non-homologous centromeres during meiotic prophase have appeared in the literature. Recently, the homology-independent pairwise association of centromeres, termed centromere coupling, was also reported in budding yeast. It seems paradoxical that centromeres would pair with non-homologous partners during a process intended to align homologous chromosomes, yet the conservation of this phenomenon across a wide range of species suggests it may play an important role in meiosis. Principal Findings To better define the role of this phenomenon in budding yeast, experiments were preformed to place centromere coupling within the context of landmark meiotic events. Soon after the initiation of the meiotic program, centromeres were found to re-organize from a single cluster into non-homologous couples. Centromere coupling is detected as soon as chromosome replication is finished and persists while the recombination protein Dmc1 is loaded onto the chromosomes, suggesting that centromere coupling persists through the time of double strand break formation. In the absence of the synaptonemal complex component, Zip1, centromere coupling was undetectable, at all times examined, confirming the essential role of this protein on this process. Finally, the timely release of centromere coupling depends on the recombination-initiating enzyme, Spo11, suggesting a connection between events in homologous pairing/recombination and the regulation of centromere coupling. Conclusions Based on our results we propose a role for centromere coupling in blocking interactions between homologous centromeres as recombination initiation is taking place."
https://openalex.org/W2086561928,"Accumulated evidence indicates that oxidative stress causes and/or promotes insulin resistance; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which oxidative stress induced by paraquat impairs insulin-dependent glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We confirmed that paraquat-induced oxidative stress decreased glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the cell surface, resulting in repression of insulin-dependent 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Under these conditions, oxidative stress did not affect insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2, or binding of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) p85 regulatory subunit or p110alpha catalytic subunit to each IRS. In contrast, we found that oxidative stress induced by paraquat inhibited activities of PI 3-kinase bound to IRSs and also inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, the downstream serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to play an essential role in insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of active form Akt (myr-Akt) restored inhibition of insulin-dependent glucose uptake by paraquat, indicating that paraquat-induced oxidative stress inhibits insulin signals upstream of Akt. Paraquat treatment with and without insulin treatment decreased the activity of class Ia PI 3-kinases p110alpha and p110beta that are mainly expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, paraquat treatment did not repress the activity of the PI 3-kinase p110alpha mutated at Cys(90) in the p85 binding region. These results indicate that the PI 3-kinase p110 is a possible primary target of paraquat-induced oxidative stress to reduce the PI 3-kinase activity and impaired glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2039086468,"Microtubule drugs are effective anti-cancer agents, primarily due to their ability to induce mitotic arrest and subsequent cell death. However, some cancer cells are intrinsically resistant or acquire a resistance. Lack of apoptosis following mitotic arrest is thought to contribute to drug resistance that limits the efficacy of the microtubule-targeting anti-cancer drugs. Genetic or pharmacological agents that selectively facilitate the apoptosis of mitotic arrested cells present opportunities to strengthen the therapeutic efficacy.We report a natural product Celastrol targets tubulin and facilitates mitotic cell death caused by microtubule drugs. First, in a small molecule screening effort, we identify Celastrol as an inhibitor of neutrophil chemotaxis. Subsequent time-lapse imaging analyses reveal that inhibition of microtubule-mediated cellular processes, including cell migration and mitotic chromosome alignment, is the earliest events affected by Celastrol. Disorganization, not depolymerization, of mitotic spindles appears responsible for mitotic defects. Celastrol directly affects the biochemical properties of tubulin heterodimer in vitro and reduces its protein level in vivo. At the cellular level, Celastrol induces a synergistic apoptosis when combined with conventional microtubule-targeting drugs and manifests an efficacy toward Taxol-resistant cancer cells. Finally, by time-lapse imaging and tracking of microtubule drug-treated cells, we show that Celastrol preferentially induces apoptosis of mitotic arrested cells in a caspase-dependent manner. This selective effect is not due to inhibition of general cell survival pathways or mitotic kinases that have been shown to enhance microtubule drug-induced cell death.We provide evidence for new cellular pathways that, when perturbed, selectively induce the apoptosis of mitotic arrested cancer cells, identifying a potential new strategy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of conventional microtubule-targeting anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2086155795,"Background Envelope protein 53R was identified from frog Rana grylio virus (RGV), a member of the family Iridoviridae, and it plays an important role in the virus assembly. Although inhibition of iridovirus major capsid protein (MCP) by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) has been shown to cause resistance to viral infection in vitro, RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit aquatic animal virus envelope protein gene product has not been reported. Methodology We devised artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) that target a viral envelope protein gene RGV 53R. By incorporating sequences encoding amiRNAs specific to 53R of RGV into pre-miRNA155 (pSM155) vectors, which use the backbone of natural miR-155 sequence and could intracellularly express 53R-targeted pre-amiRNAs. The pre-amiRNAs could be processed by the RNase III-like enzyme Dicer into 21–25 nt amiRNAs (amiR-53Rs) in fish cell lines. The levels of 53R expression were analyzed through real-time PCR and RGV virions assembly were observed by electronic microscopy in fish cells transfected with or without amiR-53Rs at 72 h of RGV infection. Conclusion/Significance The results argue that viral envelope protein RGV 53R can be silenced and the virions assembly was deficient by amiR-53R-1, and further identified the first amiRNA of envelope protein gene from iridovirus that was able to cause resistance to virus infection in fish cells. The data demonstrate that the viral infection is efficiently suppressed (58%) by amiR-53R-1 targeting positon 36–57 of RGV 53R. Moreover, electron microscopic observations revealed virion assembly defect or reduced virions assembly capacity was closely correlated to expression of amiR-53R-1. Based on real time PCR of the Mx gene, we found no evidence of activation of IFN by amiR-53R-1."
https://openalex.org/W2134525392,"Class II diterpene cyclases mediate the acid-initiated cycloisomerization reaction that serves as the committed step in biosynthesis of the large class of labdane-related diterpenoid natural products, which includes the important gibberellin plant hormones. Intriguingly, these enzymes are differentially susceptible to inhibition by their Mg(2+) cofactor, with those involved in gibberellin biosynthesis being more sensitive to such inhibition than those devoted to secondary metabolism, which presumably limits flux toward the potent gibberellin phytohormones. Such inhibition has been suggested to arise from intrasteric Mg(2+) binding to the DXDD motif that cooperatively acts as the catalytic acid, whose affinity must then be modulated in some fashion. While further investigating class II diterpene cyclase catalysis, we discovered a conserved basic residue that seems to act as a counter ion to the DXDD motif, enhancing the ability of aspartic acid to carry out the requisite energetically difficult protonation of a carbon-carbon double bond and also affecting inhibitory Mg(2+) binding. Notably, this residue is conserved as a histidine in enzymes involved in gibberellin biosynthesis and as an arginine in those dedicated to secondary metabolism. Interchanging the identity of these residues is sufficient to switch the sensitivity of the parent enzyme to inhibition by Mg(2+). These striking findings indicate that this is a single residue switch for Mg(2+) inhibition, which not only supports the importance of this biochemical regulatory mechanism in limiting gibberellin biosynthesis, but the importance of its release, presumably to enable higher flux, into secondary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2050761856,"Background Gut microbial communities of mammals are thought to show stable differences between individuals. This means that the properties imparted by the gut microbiota become a unique and constant characteristic of the host. Manipulation of the microbiota has been proposed as a useful tool in health care, but a greater understanding of mechanisms which lead to community stability is required. Here we have examined the impact of host immunoregulatory phenotype on community dynamics. Methods and Findings Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyse the faecal bacterial community of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and C57BL/6 mice deficient for either type I interferon (IFN) signalling (IRF9 KO mice) or type I and type II IFN signalling (STAT1 KO mice). Temporal variation was found in all mouse strains. A measure of the ability for a community structure characteristic of the host to be maintained over time, the individuality index, varied between mouse strains and available data from pigs and human models. IRF9 KO mice had significantly higher temporal variation, and lower individuality, than other mouse strains. Examination of the intestinal mucosa of the IRF9 KO mice revealed an increased presence of T-cells and neutrophils in the absence of inflammation. Significance The high temporal variation observed in the gut microbiota of inbred laboratory mice has implications for their use as experimental models for the human gut microbiota. The distinct IRF9 and STAT1 phenotypes suggest a role for IRF9 in immune regulation within the gut mucosa and that further study of interferon responsive genes is necessary to understand host-gut microbe relationships."

We tested if adiposity parameters and body fat distribution could predict cognitive decline in older persons with DM vs. normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methodology 693 older persons with no dementia were enrolled: 253 with DM in good metabolic control; 440 with NGT (age range:65–85 years). Longitudinal study comparing DM and NGT individuals according to the association of baseline adiposity parameters (body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC) and total body fat mass) to cognitive change (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), a composite score of executive and attention functioning (CCS) over time. Findings At baseline, in DM participants, MMSE correlated with WHR (β = −0.240; p = 0.043), WC (β = −0.264; p = 0.041) while CCS correlated with WHR (β = −0.238; p = 0.041), WC (β = −0.326; p = 0.013) after adjusting for confounders. In NGT subjects, no significant correlations were found among any adiposity parameters and MMSE, while CCS was associated with WHR (β = −0.194; p = 0.036) and WC (β = −0.210; p = 0.024). Participants with DM in the 3rd tertile of total fat mass showed the greatest decline in cognitive performance compared to those in 1st tertile (tests for trend: MMSE(p = 0.007), CCS(p = 0.003)). Logistic regression models showed that 3rd vs. 1st tertile of total fat mass, WHR, and WC predicted an almost two-fold decline in cognitive function in DM subjects at 2nd yr (OR 1.68, 95%IC 1.08–3.52). Conclusions Total fat mass and central adiposity predict an increased risk for cognitive decline in older person with DM."

These observations are the first evidence for a function of Flotillin-1 outside of lipid rafts and suggest its critical role in the maintenance of a pool of active Aurora B. IntroductionAs a signaling regulatory molecule, Flotillin-1 tethers protein complexes to lipid rafts through interactions with the sorbin homology domains of the recruited proteins (1Langhorst M.F.

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Flotillins oligomerize to form microdomain scaffolds that regulate the assembly of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and transmembrane proteins, favoring the communication with intracellular signal-transducing molecules (1Langhorst M.F.

Several membrane-resident receptor kinases, upon triggering by their cognate growth factors, form a ternary complex with the receptor-phosphorylated Cbl-associated protein and the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, and localize to lipid rafts via interaction with flotillins to initiate signaling (4Baumann C.A.

In addition to its cell membrane-associated signaling functions, Flotillin-1 regulates clathrin-independent endocytic pathways, phagosome traffic, and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (6Dermine J.F.

An indication for a function of Flotillin-1 in non-membrane compartments was provided by the observation that it can translocate to the nucleus upon mitogenic stimuli (10Santamaría A. Castellanos E.

In that study, nuclear localization was shown to be required for Flotillin-1 to induce cell proliferation. Here we report that Flotillin-1 regulates the abundance and activity of the mitotic regulator Aurora B kinase.RESULTSWe had previously observed that Flotillin-1 depletion causes a significant inhibition of cell proliferation (10Santamaría A. Castellanos E. Gómez V. Benedit P. Renau-Piqueras J. Morote J. Reventós J. Thomson T.M. Paciucci R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To further investigate this effect, we tested siRNA duplexes (siRNA-92, -93, and -94) or shRNAs (shRNA-1 and -2) that target five distinct sequences on the Flotillin-1 mRNA and deplete protein levels with different efficiencies (Fig. 1A). Of these, siRNA-94 and shRNA-2 reproducibly inhibited Flotillin-1 expression at significant levels and were used in subsequent experiments (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The ensuing proliferative inhibition showed a good correlation with the degree of Flotillin-1 depletion, obtained with two different shRNA sequences (shRNA-1 and -2, Fig. 1B). Growth inhibition was accompanied with the accumulation of a significant fraction of cells with aberrant mitotic events, including uncongressed and lagging chromosomes, multispindle cells (Fig. 1, C–E), multinucleated and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1D, and supplemental Fig. S1). Cells treated with control siRNA or shRNA duplexes presented normal mitotic morphologies and correct chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, with <5% showing aberrant mitoses in all cases. Knockdown of Flotillin-1 caused an accumulation of cells in prometaphase and a decrease in the proportion of cells distributed in metaphase, anaphase, and telophase (Fig. 1F), without affecting the mitotic index (Fig. 1G) or the cell cycle phase distribution (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 2Depletion of Flotillin-1 causes the down-regulation of Aurora B. A, representative image of the depletion of Flotillin-1 by different shRNAs or siRNAs causing a significant decline of Aurora B levels and of phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser-10).

Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Indeed, RNA interference depletion of Aurora B in HeLa cells led to a similar failure of chromosomes to congress, failure to complete cytokinesis, and the accumulation of multinucleated cells (Fig. 1D; see also Fig. 2D).Because of the above phenotype, we hypothesized the occurrence of a functional association between Flotillin-1 and Aurora B. Depletion of Flotillin-1 by siRNA-94 or shRNA-2 was followed by a significant decline in Aurora B protein levels (Fig. 2, A and B). The decrease in Aurora B was paralleled by a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, a major substrate of Aurora B activity (12Giet R. Glover D.M. J.

Likewise, depletion of Flotillin-1 caused a reduction in the levels of INCENP, a protein tightly associated with Aurora B (Fig. 2, C and E). The stability and relative abundance of Aurora B and INCENP are strongly interdependent (14Honda R. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), and therefore the down-regulation of INCENP after Flotillin-1 knockdown could be an indirect consequence of the depletion of Aurora B. Because INCENP is an activator of Aurora B (11Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), its concomitant decrease after Flotillin-1 knockdown might also contribute to the significant reduction of histone H3 (Ser-10) phosphorylation observed. Transfection of cells depleted of endogenous Flotillin-1 with HA-Flotillin-1, resistant to siRNA-94 and specifically targeting the endogenous protein, re-established the levels of Aurora B and the levels of phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, expression in these cells of an Myc-tagged form of Aurora B led to the complete correction of the chromosomal abnormalities caused by Flotillin-1 depletion (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the mitotic phenotypes caused by knockdown of Flotillin-1 are due to a down-regulation of Aurora B. Supportive of these results, the depletion of Flotillin-1 and the concomitant down-regulation of Aurora B and phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) levels were also detected in PC3 prostate cancer cells (supplemental Fig. S4).The best described function of Aurora B is in mitosis. As expected, in mitotically enriched nocodazole-treated cells, depletion of Flotillin-1 clearly diminished the levels of Aurora B and phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser-10) (Fig. 2E). In addition, INCENP levels also diminished in both mitotic and asynchronous cells depleted of Flotillin-1, although changes in other CPC components in mitotic cells were not significant. The decrease in Aurora B levels that follows knockdown of Flotillin-1 might reflect a decrease in the amount of holo-CPC formed in mitosis, as also suggested by the altered mitotic phenotypes observed. To explore this possibility, equal amounts of proteins from cells depleted of Flotillin-1 and treated, or not, with nocodazole were immunoprecipitated with Aurora B antibody (Fig. 2F). The amount of Aurora B and co-immunoprecipitated INCENP and survivin was decreased in Flotillin-1-depleted cells, suggesting a depletion of both the Aurora B/INCENP subcomplex and the holo-CPC in cells depleted of Flotillin-1 (11Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 14Honda R. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 131: 271-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Knockdown of Flotillin-1 by shRNAs did not significantly affect the levels of Aurora B or INCENP transcripts, as shown by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2G), ruling out a direct effect on their mRNA levels and suggesting that the down-regulation of Aurora B and INCENP proteins in Flotillin-1-depleted cells is a post-transcriptional effect. Treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin or epoxomicin restored to control levels the Aurora B protein levels that were down-regulated upon Flotillin-1 depletion, suggesting that Flotillin-1 depletion might affect the stability of Aurora B (supplemental Fig. S5). However, the half-life of the kinase was not significantly different in Flotillin-1-depleted from control cells (supplemental Fig. S6), suggesting that mechanisms other than protein stability might be involved in the regulation of Aurora B levels by Flotillin-1.Next, we ascertained if the functional association observed between Flotillin-1 and Aurora B involved physical interactions between these proteins. Both endogenous and transfected Flotillin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Aurora B and INCENP but not with borealin or survivin (Fig. 3(A and B) and supplemental Fig. S7). In reciprocal experiments, anti-Aurora B brought down Flotillin-1 and, as expected, also survivin, borealin and INCENP (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S7). Moreover, GST-Aurora B, but not GST-survivin, pulled down endogenous and exogenous Flotillin-1 (Figs. 3C and 4A). As controls, both GST-Aurora B and GST-survivin pulled down the CPC protein borealin (Fig. 3C). Conversely, GST-Flotillin-1 pulled down endogenous Aurora B and INCENP from whole cell extracts (Fig. 3D). In vitro translated Flotillin-1 specifically interacted with immobilized GST-Aurora B, evidencing a direct interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 3E). These results support the occurrence of a complex between Flotillin-1 and Aurora B distinct from the canonical CPC. Although Aurora B forms a tight tetrameric complex with the CPC proteins in mitotic cells (15Jeyaprakash A.A. Klein U.R. Lindner D. Ebert J. Nigg E.A. Conti E. Cell. 2007; 131: 271-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), a substantial pool of Aurora B is found in other complexes (16Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J.

Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), which does not target to any defined structure during mitosis and might have functions distinct from the CPC (15Jeyaprakash A.A. Klein U.R. Lindner D. Ebert J. Nigg E.A. Conti E. Cell. 2007; 131: 271-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This subcomplex has been suggested to be directly responsible for the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 (13Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 19Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Consistent with its association with this non-CPC Aurora B/INCENP complex, Flotillin-1 did not localize to kinetochores during mitosis (supplemental Fig. S8), and, in mitotic cells depleted of Flotillin-1, no changes were seen in the expected localization of the CPC proteins Aurora B, survivin, and INCENP (supplemental Fig. S9).FIGURE 3Flotillin-1 interacts with Aurora B in vivo and in vitro. A, transfected HA-Flotillin-1 and endogenous Flotillin-1 (B) co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous Aurora B. Endogenous Flotillin-1 associated with Aurora B and INCENP but not borealin or survivin. In reciprocal experiments, Aurora B co-immunoprecipitated with Flotillin-1, survivin, borealin, and INCENP. C, GST-Aurora B, but not GST-survivin, pulled down endogenous Flotillin-1. HeLa cell lysates were incubated with beads loaded with GST-survivin or GST-Aurora B for 1 h at 4 °C and washed, and eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.

A, Flotillin-1 interacts with Aurora B through its SPFH domain. GST-Aurora B was used in pulldown assays performed with lysates of cells transfected with HA-Flotillin-1, HA-FLOT-domain, or HA-SPFH-domain, visualized by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. B, the SPFH domain, but not the FLOTILLIN domain, is sufficient for nuclear localization of Flotillin-1. Confocal images are representative of subdomains localization: anti-HA antibody identifies transfected cells. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258. Quantification of nuclear localization, scored in at least 300 cells, is shown at the bottom. C, Aurora B localizes to nucleus and does not partition to lipid rafts. Nuclear and non-nuclear fractions were separated, and the latter was fractionated on discontinuous sucrose gradients. Lipid rafts were fractionated at 20% sucrose, as shown by enrichment of Flotillin-1. Reactivity with tubulin indicates a correct fractionation. D, overexpression of GFP-NLS-Flotillin-1 induces increased Aurora B protein levels and greatly induces the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10. Western blotting of cells transfected with pGFP (2 μg, lane 1), HA-Flotillin-1 (2 μg, lane 2), or GFP-NLS-Flot1 (2 μg, lane 3; and 4 μg, lane 4). Antibody to Flotillin-1 identifies GFP-NLS-Flot1 (*), HA-Flot1 (**), and the endogenous protein (***). Actin levels were used as protein loading controls and as normalization standards for the Western blotting signals. Quantifications of proteins levels are shown in panel E.

Hoegg M.B. Robbins S.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 394-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Pulldown experiments with lysates from cells transfected with HA-Flot1-SPFH, expressing only the SPFH domain, or with HA-Flot1-FLOT, expressing only the FLOTILLIN coiled-coil domain, showed that the SPFH domain, but not the FLOTILLIN domain of Flotillin-1, was sufficient to associate with Aurora B (Fig. 4A). Immunofluorescent analysis of cells transfected with full-length or deletion variants showed that the SPFH domain of Flotillin-1, but not its coiled-coil domain, retained the capacity for nuclear localization, comparable to that of the full-length protein (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, subcellular fractionation and sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that, unlike Flotillin-1, Aurora B did not sediment in the lipid raft fraction, whereas both Flotillin-1 and Aurora B co-purified in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that Flotillin-1 and Aurora B interact outside of lipid rafts and mainly in the nucleus, through the SPFH domain of Flotillin-1.To study the effects of overexpression and nuclear localization of Flotillin-1 on Aurora B protein levels, HeLa cells were transfected either with HA-Flotillin-1 or a form forcefully directed to the nucleus through the inclusion of a nuclear localization signal at the N terminus of the protein, GFP-NLS-Flot1. Transfection of increasing amounts of the latter plasmid, but not a control plasmid expressing GFP alone, resulted in corresponding increases in the levels of Aurora B (Fig. 4, D and E). Transfection of GFP-NLS-Flot1 induced a large enhancement of histone H3 (Ser-10) phosphorylation that was significantly superior to the increase in Aurora B levels observed in the same experiments (Fig. 4, D and E), suggesting that Flotillin-1 regulates not only the protein levels but also the enzymatic activity of the kinase. In contrast, transfection of Flotillin-1-HA or HA-Flotillin-1ΔC, forms that are deficient in nuclear translocation and are unable to induce cell proliferation (10Santamaría A. Castellanos E. Gómez V. Benedit P. Renau-Piqueras J. Morote J. Reventós J. Thomson T.M. Paciucci R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), did not induce increased levels of Aurora B (supplemental Fig. S10). In these experiments, the levels of endogenous Flotillin-1 were significantly increased after transfection of HA-Flot1 or GFP-NLS-Flot1 (Fig. 4, D and E; see also Fig. 2C), suggesting that overexpression of exogenous Flotillin-1 leads to the accumulation of the endogenous protein. It has been shown that the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomers stabilizes Flotillin-1 (25Lampson M.A. Renduchitala K. Khodjakov A. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the significant decline in Aurora B protein levels upon depletion of Flotillin-1, reinforce the hypothesis of a direct correlation between levels and nuclear localization of Flotillin-1 with levels and activity of Aurora B.DISCUSSIONAurora B kinase activity peaks in mitosis, when it promotes the destabilization and release of microtubules that are incorrectly attached to kinetochores (11Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). After metaphase, the kinase either associates with the central spindle in anaphase or is inactivated by PP2A (21Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Termination of Aurora B is also achieved by APC/C ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (22Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Nguyen H.G. Chinnappan D. Urano T. Ravid K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4977-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Aurora B leads to mono-orientated and mal-orientated chromosomes (24Hauf S. Cole R.W. LaTerra S. Zimmer C. Schnapp G. Walter R. Heckel A. van Meel J. Rieder C.L. Peters J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 25Lampson M.A. Renduchitala K. Khodjakov A. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and impairs cytokinesis with appearance of multinucleated cells (11Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 12Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 14Honda R. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Aurora B also has functions outside of mitosis, as exemplified by its regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin activity whereby it is required for the G1- to S-phase transition (18Song J. Salek-Ardakani S. So T. Croft M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Our observations suggest that Aurora B protein levels and activity are dependent on the levels of Flotillin-1. In our experiments, knockdown of Flotillin-1 caused a decline in cell proliferation that was associated with a decrease in the levels and function of Aurora B. Conversely, overexpression of Flotillin-1 was associated with increased Aurora B levels and cell proliferation and significantly stimulated phosphorylation of its major substrate histone H3 (Ser-10).Our evidence also suggests that Flotillin-1 forms a complex with Aurora B and INCENP that does not contain survivin or borealin, and it is therefore different from the chromosomal passenger complex (14Honda R. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17Lange B.M. Rebollo E. Herold A. González C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5364-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In agreement with its association with a non-CPC Aurora B/INCENP complex, Flotillin-1 failed to localize to kinetochores in mitosis. Flotillin-1 interacted with Aurora B directly through its SPFH domain and, when it was directed to the nucleus, greatly induced the activity of the kinase on its substrate histone H3 (Ser-10). Our observation that only nuclear Flotillin-1 participates in the regulation of Aurora B is in agreement with our previous findings showing that only forms of Flotillin-1 capable of nuclear translocation are able to stimulate cell proliferation (10Santamaría A. Castellanos E. Gómez V. Benedit P. Renau-Piqueras J. Morote J. Reventós J. Thomson T.M. Paciucci R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1900-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although Flotillin-1 does not interact with the CPC at mitosis, it might affect its function by determining the amount of Aurora B available to enter the complex, as suggested by our observation that depletion of Flotillin-1 was accompanied with a concomitant depletion of holo-CPC.The requirement for Flotillin-1 to maintain Aurora B function and holo-CPC abundance represents a new function for Flotillin-1, possibly related to the chaperone functions found for other SPFH domain-containing proteins (26Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Winter A. Kämäräinen O. Hofmann A. Proteins. 2007; 68: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Prohibitins show a partial homology with GroEL/Hsp60 that has suggested a chaperone function for oligomerized prohibitins, defined as “holdases,” for the assembly of the respiratory chain complexes in mitochondria (28Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Artal Sanz M. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Tatsuta T. Model K. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Similarly, the notion that flotillins form scaffolds for protein assemblies that are involved in signaling across the plasma membrane is supported by several evidences (1Langhorst M.F. Reuter A. Stuermer C.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2228-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30Neumann-Giesen C. Falkenbach B. Beicht P. Claasen S. Lüers G. Stuermer C.A. Herzog V. Tikkanen R.

The chaperone activity of Kar2p is regulated by its intrinsic ATPase activity that can be stimulated by two different nucleotide exchange factors, namely Sil1p and Lhs1p. Here, we demonstrate that the binding requirements for Lhs1p are complex, requiring both the nucleotide binding domain plus the linker domain of Kar2p. In contrast, the IIB domain of Kar2p is sufficient for binding of Sil1p, and point mutations within IIB specifically blocked Sil1p-dependent activation while remaining competent for activation by Lhs1p. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the interactions between Kar2p and its two nucleotide exchange factors can be functionally resolved and are thus mechanistically distinct."

https://openalex.org/W1968700052,"Population variation in the degree of seasonal polymorphism is rare in birds, and the genetic basis of this phenomenon remains largely undescribed. Both sexes of Scandinavian and Scottish Willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) display marked differences in their winter phenotypes, with Scottish grouse retaining a pigmented plumage year-round and Scandinavian Willow grouse molting to a white morph during winter. A widely studied pathway implicated in vertebrate pigmentation is the melanin system, for which functional variation has been characterised in many taxa.We sequenced coding regions from four genes involved in melanin pigmentation (DCT, MC1R, TYR and TYRP1), and an additional control involved in the melanocortin pathway (AGRP), to investigate the genetic basis of winter plumage in Lagopus. Despite the well documented role of the melanin system in animal coloration, we found no plumage-associated polymorphism or evidence for selection in a total of approximately 2.6 kb analysed sequence.Our results indicate that the genetic basis of alternating between pigmented and unpigmented seasonal phenotypes is more likely explained by regulatory changes controlling the expression of these or other loci in the physiological pathway leading to pigmentation."

https://openalex.org/W1964919153,"The stability of the hemopexin-heme (Hx-heme) complex to dissociation of the heme prosthetic group has been examined in bicarbonate buffers in the presence and absence of various divalent metal ions. In NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 7.4, 20 mm, 25 °C) containing Zn2+ (100 μm), 14% of the heme dissociates from this complex (4.5 μm) within 10 min, and 50% dissociates within 2 h. In the absence of metal ions, the rate of dissociation of this complex is far lower, is decreased further in KHCO3 solution, and is minimal in NaHCO3. In NH4HCO3 buffer, dissociation of the Hx-heme complex is accelerated by addition of divalent metals with decreasing efficiency in the order Zn2+ > Cu2+ ≫ Ni2+ > Co2+≫Mn2+. Addition of Ca2+ prior to addition of Zn2+ stabilizes the Hx-heme complex to dissociation of the heme group, and addition of Ca2+ after Zn2+-induced dissociation of the Hx-heme complex results in re-formation of the Hx-heme complex. These effects are greatly accelerated at 37 °C and diminished in other buffers. Overall, the solution conditions that promote formation of the Hx-heme complex are similar to those found in blood plasma, and conditions that promote release of heme are similar to those that the Hx-heme complex should encounter in endosomes following endocytosis of the complex formed with its hepatic receptor. The stability of the hemopexin-heme (Hx-heme) complex to dissociation of the heme prosthetic group has been examined in bicarbonate buffers in the presence and absence of various divalent metal ions. In NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 7.4, 20 mm, 25 °C) containing Zn2+ (100 μm), 14% of the heme dissociates from this complex (4.5 μm) within 10 min, and 50% dissociates within 2 h. In the absence of metal ions, the rate of dissociation of this complex is far lower, is decreased further in KHCO3 solution, and is minimal in NaHCO3. In NH4HCO3 buffer, dissociation of the Hx-heme complex is accelerated by addition of divalent metals with decreasing efficiency in the order Zn2+ > Cu2+ ≫ Ni2+ > Co2+≫Mn2+. Addition of Ca2+ prior to addition of Zn2+ stabilizes the Hx-heme complex to dissociation of the heme group, and addition of Ca2+ after Zn2+-induced dissociation of the Hx-heme complex results in re-formation of the Hx-heme complex. These effects are greatly accelerated at 37 °C and diminished in other buffers. Overall, the solution conditions that promote formation of the Hx-heme complex are similar to those found in blood plasma, and conditions that promote release of heme are similar to those that the Hx-heme complex should encounter in endosomes following endocytosis of the complex formed with its hepatic receptor. The plasma protein hemopexin (Hx, 2The abbreviations used are: HxhemopexinMWmolecular weight. MW ∼58,000) is a positive acute phase reactant glycoprotein with the primary role of scavenging heme released from methemoglobin and other heme proteins as the result of hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, or ischemia-reperfusion injury (1Delanghe J.R.

Hx may also have a role in protection of neural tissue, and it exhibits other activities that include inhibition of necrosis and adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (8Tolosano E.

Subsequent to endocytosis, heme is dissociated from the Hx-heme complex and oxidized by heme oxygenase-1 to release iron that is then added to ferritin stores (13Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P.

The Hx-heme complex is an unusual b-type hemeprotein in that the axial ligands that coordinate the heme iron are not located in a structurally constrained region of the protein, and one of the axial histidine ligands is located in the flexible linker region that connects the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein (10Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Paoli M. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Morgan W.T. Smith A. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Physiologically, Hx must bind heme with extremely high affinity so that it can scavenge heme in circulating blood under conditions where it is released by myoglobin and hemoglobin, but Hx must also release heme in hepatic endosomes potentially liberating apoHx to return to circulation. While the high affinity of Hx for heme may be attributed to bisimidazole axial coordination, to packing of hydrophobic residues around the heme, and to the hydrogen bonding interactions of the heme propionate groups (21Paoli M. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Morgan W.T. Smith A. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 23Deeb R.S. Muller-Eberhard U. Peyton D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), structural characteristics of the protein that might promote the release of heme when required are less evident. Our recent studies of human Hx have focused on the effects of metal ions on the structural dynamics of this protein (24Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9301-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the thermal stability of the Hx-heme complex (10Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Nat. Prod.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1872-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the influence of heme orientation on interaction of the protein with metal ions (26Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reduction potential of the rabbit Hx-heme complex has been shown to be sensitive to the ionic composition of the solution and pH (27Flaherty M.M. Rish K.R. Smith A. Crumbliss A.L. Biometals. 2008; 21: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the human Hx-ferroheme complex exhibits greater thermal instability (lower Tm (25Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G.

Nevertheless, the physiological significance of the many metal ion binding sites of Hx (10Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Nat. Prod.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and of heme insertion isoforms exhibited by the Hx-heme complex remain uncertain. Recently, we have reported the ability of metal ions to induce heme release from a variety of b-type heme proteins (30Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 16976-16983Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) at alkaline pH in bicarbonate buffer. We have now extended these studies to consideration of the Hx-heme complex and find that the stability of this complex also responds to electrolytes and metal ions at physiological pH but in a manner that should promote preferential binding of heme to apoHx in plasma. The possible implications of these results for the physiological function of Hx are discussed. Human Hx was isolated from plasma cryosupernate (Canadian Blood Services) without heme bound (apoHx), and the Hx-ferriprotoporphyrin IX complex (Hx-heme) was prepared by addition of ferriheme (Frontier Scientific) as described previously (24Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9301-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The electronic absorption and CD spectra of the protein used in the current study were consistent with Form β of Hx-heme (26Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Hx-heme complex was exchanged (≥4 × 105-fold) into water by ultrafiltration (AmiconUltra 10,000 NMWL Millipore) prior to dilution (∼50-fold) into buffers used for data collection. Hx-heme complex concentrations were determined on the basis of a molar absorptivity of 136,000 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31Seery V.L. Hathaway G. Eberhard U.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Horse heart myoglobin (Mb; Sigma cat. no. M1882) was converted to metmyoglobin (metMb) with K3Fe(CN)6 and passed over a column of Dowex 1X-8 (32Linder R.E. Records R. Barth G. Bunnenberg E. Djerassi C. Hedlund B.E. Rosenberg A. Benson E.S. Seamans L. Moscowitz A. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The concentration of metMb was determined from the molar absorptivity (188,000 m−1 cm−1) at 408 nm (pH 6.4) (33Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., London1971Google Scholar). Spectroscopy and kinetics experiments were conducted with Cary Models 6000 and 3 spectrophotometers. All samples were thermostatted in Teflon-stoppered cuvettes with 1 cm pathlength (Hellma). Dissociation of heme from the Hx-heme complex was monitored at the Soret maximum (413.5 nm). Complete dissociation of heme from its normal binding site resulted in a 69.2% decrease in absorbance intensity at this wavelength (pH 7.4, 25 °C). Titrations of the Hx-heme complex with Ca2+ were monitored by following the rate of heme release as a function of the amount of CaCl2 added and were fit by non-linear regression analysis (Scientist, vers. 2, MicroMath) as described previously (34Mauk M.R. Ferrer J.C. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12609-12614Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Near UV and visible CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco Model J-810 spectropolarimeter. Prior to monitoring the exchange of heme from metMb to apoHx, each protein was exchanged (>5 × 104-fold) into buffer by centrifugal ultrafiltration. The transfer of heme from metMb to apoHx was monitored at the wavelength at which the greatest change in absorbance is observed for this reaction (404.5 nm). Glass-distilled water passed through a Barnstead Nanopure Diamond Life Sciences purification system was used throughout. All buffers (Fisher and Sigma) and salt solutions were air-saturated at 22 °C prior to adjusting pH. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate was purchased from Sigma. Metal ion solutions were prepared either by dilution from Titrosol (E. Merck) standards (CoCl2, CuCl2, MnCl2, and ZnCl2) or gravimetrically from metal chloride or sulfate salts (Fisher and Sigma). SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions (29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to check for protein hydrolysis using PageRuler (Fermentas Life Sciences) molecular weight standards. Gels were analyzed with a ChemiGenius2 Bio Imaging System and associated software (GeneSnap 6.05 for image acquisition and GeneTools 3.06 for data analysis, Syngene). The spectrum of the Hx-heme complex is initially the same in either sodium or ammonium bicarbonate buffer (Fig. 1, spectrum a). With addition of Zn2+ (100 μm), half of the heme dissociates from this complex (4.3 μm) after 20 h in the presence of sodium bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4, 22 °C) (Fig. 1, spectrum e) whereas just 2.5 h is required for half of the heme to dissociate from the complex in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4, 22 °C)(Fig. 1, spectrum d) and >97% of the heme was released after 22 h under these conditions. In ammonium bicarbonate buffer without added metal ions, the spectrum changes slowly in a manner that is consistent with dissociation of some (13% in 24 h) of the heme. This change in spectrum was unaffected by the presence of EDTA. In the absence of added metal ions, the spectrum of the Hx-heme complex changed <1% in sodium bicarbonate buffer in 24 h. This behavior of the Hx-heme complex is in marked contrast to our previous observations with other b-type heme proteins (30Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 16976-16983Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for which the dissociation of heme from the protein-heme complex was observed only after the addition of metal ions and the stability of heme binding was much greater in ammonium bicarbonate buffer than in sodium bicarbonate. While heme dissociates from the Hx-heme complex in the absence of metal ions in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.8), complete dissociation of the complex was not achieved even after more than 2 weeks at 15 °C (Fig. 2B). Electronic absorption spectra exhibited the same isosbestic points in the Soret and visible regions (395, 491, 507, and 590 nm) for the reaction with or without metal ions present (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The influence of monovalent cations on the stability of the Hx-heme complex was examined in bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0 ± 0.2) by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at the Soret band (Fig. 3). These data were collected at 15 °C to ensure the stability of any apoHx formed during these extended reaction times. While the stability of the Hx-heme complex was only slightly diminished in potassium relative to sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate had a pronounced destabilizing effect. This effect could result from an increase in the rate of release of heme from the Hx-heme complex (off-rate) or a decrease in the rate at which heme rebinds to apoHx (on-rate) or some combination of both as the counter ion is changed from sodium to potassium to ammonium. The effects of divalent metal cations (100 μm) on the rate of heme dissociation from the Hx-heme complex (4.3 μm) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4, 25 °C) are shown in Fig. 4. Metal ion concentrations of 100 μm were selected to saturate the principal metal ion binding sites of the protein as determined from potentiometric titrations (29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enhancement of heme dissociation from the Hx-heme complex in ammonium bicarbonate buffer by various metal ions decreased in the order Zn2+ > Cu2+ ≫ Ni2+ > Co2+. The kinetics of all of these reactions are multiphasic (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). In the presence of divalent metal ions, the rate constant for association of heme with Hx is likely to be diminished because the metal ions presumably compete with the heme iron for coordination to the histidyl residues that normally provide axial ligands (10Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Subtle changes in protein structure lower the Tm for the Hx-heme complex in the presence of these four metal ions (24Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9301-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1872-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These metal ion-induced structural changes are also expected to influence the rate constants for both association and dissociation of the Hx-heme complex. Notably, the addition of Mn2+ had little or no effect on the release of heme from the Hx-heme complex (Fig. 4). Previous potentiometric studies of Mn2+ binding to apoHx (29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a high affinity binding site for Mn2+ on apoHx that is not exhibited by the Hx-heme complex. Changing the counter ion of the added metal ions from Cl− (200 μm) to SO42− (100 μm) produced no significant differences in the reaction rates. However, we note that the concentration of counter ion introduced with the metal salts is small relative to the concentration of Cl− (∼1.7 mm) required to lower the pH of the bicarbonate solutions to 7.4. In contrast to the other metal ions evaluated in this work, Ca2+ did not induce the release of heme from the Hx-heme complex in bicarbonate buffers but promoted the rebinding of any heme that had been released from the Hx-heme complex in either bicarbonate buffer alone or in bicarbonate with other metal ions such as Zn2+ added (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that binding of Ca2+ to the Hx-heme complex stabilizes the complex and decreases the rate of complex dissociation. This stabilization of heme binding to Hx by Ca2+ is observed in both ammonium (Fig. 5A) and potassium bicarbonate (Fig. 5C) and at 37 °C (Fig. 5, B and C) as well as at 15 °C (Fig. 5A). The rebinding of heme at 15 °C is slow and is likely influenced by the aggregation state of the released heme (30Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 16976-16983Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 35Kuzelová K. Mrhalová M. Hrkal Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Stabilization of heme binding to Hx by Ca2+ is consistent with the previous observation that Ca2+ increases the Tm for loss of tertiary structure and for release of heme from the Hx-heme complex in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mm) (10Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the Hx-heme complex formed as the result of Ca2+-induced rebinding of heme (data not shown) indicates regeneration of Form β (26Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which was the original form of the Hx-heme complex used in this study. The effects of metal ions described here are not expected to depend on the orientation of heme binding within the Hx-heme complex because Forms α and β exhibit the same metal ion-induced decreases in Tm for thermally-induced dissociation of the Hx-heme complex (25Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1872-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding was examined in potassium bicarbonate buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0, 37 °C) by monitoring the rate of heme release as a function of added Ca2+. The data were fitted (Fig. 6) to a two-site binding model (34Mauk M.R. Ferrer J.C. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12609-12614Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although this fit suggests the occurrence of two binding sites with affinities that differ by ∼3-fold, the inherent uncertainty of the data that could be collected for this process was sufficiently great that a more quantitative numerical analysis was not possible. The influence of Ca2+ on the kinetics of heme transfer from metMb to apoHx was investigated in an initial effort to evaluate the effect of this metal ion on heme exchange between proteins (Fig. 7). This reaction was monitored at the wavelength expected to exhibit the greatest change in absorbance (404.5 nm) as determined from the Hx-heme complex minus metMb difference spectrum (Fig. 7, inset) under conditions similar to those used to evaluate the effect of Ca2+ on the stability of the Hx-heme complex (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). The concentration of Ca2+ used (10 μm) was based on the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding (Fig. 6). No precipitation of either apoMb or apoHx was observed under these conditions. Notably, both the rate and the extent of heme transfer from met Mb to apoHx increase in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7). The relative stability of the Hx-heme complex (15 °C, pH 7.9) in the presence of ammonium salts (∼20 mm) of several common anions is shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen, these anions stabilize heme binding to Hx in the order Cl− ≥ HPO42− > HCO3−. The NH4Cl (20 mm) and NH4H2PO4 (10 mm) solutions were adjusted to pH 7.9 ± 0.1 with NH4OH such that the final ammonium concentrations were 21.6 and 22.1 mm, respectively. The extent of stabilization by chloride was difficult to establish quantitatively because maintaining the pH of NH4Cl solutions under aerobic conditions is difficult, and additionally, the chief contaminant in NH4Cl is NaCl (36O'Neil M.J. Merck Index. Twelfth Ed. Merck & Co., White House Station2006Google Scholar). As noted above, Na+ has a pronounced stabilizing effect on the Hx-heme complex relative to NH4+. Further clarification of the effect of chloride was sought by examining the stability of the Hx-heme complex in tetramethylammonium chloride (tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (20 mm) adjusted to pH 8 with HCl ([Cl−]final = ∼18.6 mm)). Under these conditions, the stability of heme binding to Hx was intermediate between that observed in the presence of ammonium chloride and ammonium phosphate during initial incubation at 15 °C (Fig. 8). However, after prolonged exposure (∼5 days) to tetramethylammonium chloride, the Hx-heme complex exhibited sufficient turbidity that further analysis was precluded. The stabilizing effects of various electrolytes described above appear to be additive such that sodium phosphate buffer stabilizes the Hx-heme complex more than any of the other buffer combinations examined (Fig. 9). Interestingly, the electronic absorption spectrum of Hx-heme samples diluted into sodium phosphate buffers exhibited an increase in intensity of up to ∼4% at the Soret maximum (413.5 nm) over 24–48 h, and no further change was observed following prolonged incubation in this buffer (Fig. 9A). We attribute this increase in absorbance to rebinding of the small amount of heme that can be released from the Hx-heme during extended buffer exchange and storage in water. Addition of metal ions to the Hx-heme complex also promotes dissociation of heme in phosphate buffers although the effect is much smaller than observed in bicarbonate buffers as shown for addition of Zn2+ in Fig. 9B. The relationship between the ability of metal ions to destabilize the Hx-heme complex and the buffer composition is complex. For example, in sodium phosphate buffer (Fig. 9C) the relative effectiveness of Zn and Cu in promoting heme release is the opposite of that observed in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (Fig. 3). The possibility of metal ion promoted hydrolysis of Hx during the kinetics experiments was evaluated by analysis of these samples by SDS-PAGE in the presence of dithiothreitol (data not shown). No cleavage of Hx (apparent MW ∼74,000 (29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) was observed even after exposure to metal ions for 2 weeks at 15 °C except for samples containing Ni2+ (100 μm with 4–6 μm Hx). Analysis of samples of the Hx-heme complex following incubation with Ni2+ at 15 °C detected no hydrolysis of the Hx-heme complex but did detect cleavage of apoHx that formed during incubation (∼30% of the apoHx present hydrolyzed each day). The products of the Ni2+-catalyzed reaction exhibit apparent MWs of 28 kDa (one band) and 46 kDa (two bands that differ by ∼2 kDa). This banding pattern does not change upon further incubation at 15 °C, indicating no further hydrolysis occurred. At temperatures >22 °C, cleavage of apoHx by Ni2+ was significantly diminished or undetectable, consistent with our previous observations (24Rosell F.I. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9301-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Ni2+ has been reported recently to hydrolyze the peptide bond preceding the Thr residue in model peptides possessing several sequences, including the sequence Thr-His-His (37Krezel A. Mylonas M. Kopera E. Bal W. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2006; 53: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Krezel A. Kopera E. Protas A.M. Poznański J. Wyslouch-Cieszyńska A. Bal W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3355-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which occurs in human Hx (residues 225–227). While the hydrolysis we observe occurred at 15 °C, suggesting a limited physiological importance, we interpret the products formed by exposure of Hx to Ni2+ to correspond to the C-terminal residues 225–439 (MWcalc = 23,772 plus 1 carbohydrate chain) and the N-terminal residues 1–224 (MWcalc = 25,542 plus 5 carbohydrate chains). We assign the 46 kDa band from the SDS-PAGE to the N-domain based on this larger than anticipated apparent MW as well as the electrophoretic heterogeneity of native Hx reported previously (26Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Mauk M.R. Rosell F.I. Lelj-Garolla B. Moore G.R. Mauk A.G.

Our fragment sizes also agree well with apparent molecular weights reported for the N- and C-domains generated by proteolytic hydrolysis (40Muller-Eberhard U.
