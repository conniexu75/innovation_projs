https://openalex.org/W3004280078,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1-4. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV."

https://openalex.org/W3004318979,"Lung cancer is the world’s leading cause of cancer death and shows strong ancestry disparities. By sequencing and assembling a large genomic and transcriptomic dataset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in individuals of East Asian ancestry (EAS; n = 305), we found that East Asian LUADs had more stable genomes characterized by fewer mutations and fewer copy number alterations than LUADs from individuals of European ancestry. This difference is much stronger in smokers as compared to nonsmokers. Transcriptomic clustering identified a new EAS-specific LUAD subgroup with a less complex genomic profile and upregulated immune-related genes, allowing the possibility of immunotherapy-based approaches. Integrative analysis across clinical and molecular features showed the importance of molecular phenotypes in patient prognostic stratification. EAS LUADs had better prediction accuracy than those of European ancestry, potentially due to their less complex genomic architecture. This study elucidated a comprehensive genomic landscape of EAS LUADs and highlighted important ancestry differences between the two cohorts. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in Asia indicates that Asian LUADs have fewer mutations, lower driver prevalence and fewer copy number alterations than European LUADs."
https://openalex.org/W3004392981,"Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic mutations but few of these mutations drive tumor development. Current approaches either identify driver genes on the basis of mutational recurrence or approximate the functional consequences of nonsynonymous mutations by using bioinformatic scores. Passenger mutations are enriched in characteristic nucleotide contexts, whereas driver mutations occur in functional positions, which are not necessarily surrounded by a particular nucleotide context. We observed that mutations in contexts that deviate from the characteristic contexts around passenger mutations provide a signal in favor of driver genes. We therefore developed a method that combines this feature with the signals traditionally used for driver-gene identification. We applied our method to whole-exome sequencing data from 11,873 tumor-normal pairs and identified 460 driver genes that clustered into 21 cancer-related pathways. Our study provides a resource of driver genes across 28 tumor types with additional driver genes identified according to mutations in unusual nucleotide contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3003850371,"Cytokines that stimulate T cell proliferation, such as interleukin (IL)-15, have been explored as a means of boosting the antitumor activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, constitutive cytokine signaling in T cells and activation of bystander cells may cause toxicity. IL-23 is a two-subunit cytokine known to promote proliferation of memory T cells and T helper type 17 cells. We found that, upon T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation, T cells upregulated the IL-23 receptor and the IL-23α p19 subunit, but not the p40 subunit. We engineered expression of the p40 subunit in T cells (p40-Td cells) and obtained selective proliferative activity in activated T cells via autocrine IL-23 signaling. In comparison to CAR T cells, p40-Td CAR T cells showed improved antitumor capacity in vitro, with increased granzyme B and decreased PD-1 expression. In two xenograft and two syngeneic solid tumor mouse models, p40-Td CAR T cells showed superior efficacy in comparison to CAR T cells and attenuated side effects in comparison to CAR T cells expressing IL-18 or IL-15. The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in solid tumor models is enhanced by interleukin-23 engineering."
https://openalex.org/W3003228485,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 but requires lifelong medication due to the existence of a latent viral reservoir1,2. Potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a potential alternative or adjuvant to ART. In addition to suppressing viremia, bNAbs may have T cell immunomodulatory effects as seen for other forms of immunotherapy3. However, this has not been established in individuals who are infected with HIV-1. Here, we document increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the peripheral blood of all nine study participants who were infected with HIV-1 with suppressed blood viremia, while receiving bNAb therapy during ART interruption4. Increased CD4+ T cell responses were detected in eight individuals. The increased T cell responses were due both to newly detectable reactivity to HIV-1 Gag epitopes and the expansion of pre-existing measurable responses. These data demonstrate that bNAb therapy during ART interruption is associated with enhanced HIV-1-specific T cell responses. Whether these augmented T cell responses can contribute to bNAb-mediated viral control remains to be determined. T cell responses specific for HIV-1 Gag peptides increased in HIV-positive recipients of two broadly neutralizing antibodies with prolonged suppression of blood viremia during antiretroviral treatment interruption."
https://openalex.org/W3003867301,"Approaches to increase the activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells against solid tumors may also increase the risk of toxicity and other side effects. To improve the safety of CAR-T-cell therapy, we computationally designed a chemically disruptable heterodimer (CDH) based on the binding of two human proteins. The CDH self-assembles, can be disrupted by a small-molecule drug and has a high-affinity protein interface with minimal amino acid deviation from wild-type human proteins. We incorporated the CDH into a synthetic heterodimeric CAR, called STOP-CAR, that has an antigen-recognition chain and a CD3ζ- and CD28-containing endodomain signaling chain. We tested STOP-CAR-T cells specific for two antigens in vitro and in vivo and found similar antitumor activity compared to second-generation (2G) CAR-T cells. Timed administration of the small-molecule drug dynamically inactivated the activity of STOP-CAR-T cells. Our work highlights the potential for structure-based design to add controllable elements to synthetic cellular therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3004223337,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous with convergent symptomatology, suggesting common dysregulated pathways. In this study, we analyzed brain transcriptional changes in five mouse models of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), a syndromic form of ASD caused by mutations in the TCF4 gene, but not the TCF7L2 gene. Analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) highlighted oligodendrocyte (OL) dysregulation, which we confirmed in two additional mouse models of syndromic ASD (Ptenm3m4/m3m4 and Mecp2tm1.1Bird). The PTHS mouse models showed cell-autonomous reductions in OL numbers and myelination, functionally confirming OL transcriptional signatures. We also integrated PTHS mouse model DEGs with human idiopathic ASD postmortem brain RNA-sequencing data and found significant enrichment of overlapping DEGs and common myelination-associated pathways. Notably, DEGs from syndromic ASD mouse models and reduced deconvoluted OL numbers distinguished human idiopathic ASD cases from controls across three postmortem brain data sets. These results implicate disruptions in OL biology as a cellular mechanism in ASD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3003171204,"Under proteotoxic stress, some cells survive whereas others die. The mechanisms governing this heterogeneity in cell fate remain unknown. Here we report that condensation and phase transition of heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcriptional regulator of chaperones1,2, is integral to cell-fate decisions underlying survival or death. During stress, HSF1 drives chaperone expression but also accumulates separately in nuclear stress bodies called foci3-6. Foci formation has been regarded as a marker of cells actively upregulating chaperones3,6-10. Using multiplexed tissue imaging, we observed HSF1 foci in human tumours. Paradoxically, their presence inversely correlated with chaperone expression. By live-cell microscopy and single-cell analysis, we found that foci dissolution rather than formation promoted HSF1 activity and cell survival. During prolonged stress, the biophysical properties of HSF1 foci changed; small, fluid condensates enlarged into indissoluble gel-like arrangements with immobilized HSF1. Chaperone gene induction was reduced in such cells, which were prone to apoptosis. Quantitative analysis suggests that survival under stress results from competition between concurrent but opposing mechanisms. Foci may serve as sensors that tune cytoprotective responses, balancing rapid transient responses and irreversible outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3003974482,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) promote fertility in many animals. However, whether this is due to their conserved role in repressing repetitive elements (REs) remains unclear. Here, we show that the progressive loss of fertility in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking piRNAs is not caused by derepression of REs or other piRNA targets but, rather, is mediated by epigenetic silencing of all of the replicative histone genes. In the absence of piRNAs, downstream components of the piRNA pathway relocalize from germ granules and piRNA targets to histone mRNAs to synthesize antisense small RNAs (sRNAs) and induce transgenerational silencing. Removal of the downstream components of the piRNA pathway restores histone mRNA expression and fertility in piRNA mutants, and the inheritance of histone sRNAs in wild-type worms adversely affects their fertility for multiple generations. We conclude that sRNA-mediated silencing of histone genes impairs the fertility of piRNA mutants and may serve to maintain piRNAs across evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3003239522,"RNA secondary structure is critical to RNA regulation and function. We report a new N3-kethoxal reagent that allows fast and reversible labeling of single-stranded guanine bases in live cells. This N3-kethoxal-based chemistry allows efficient RNA labeling under mild conditions and transcriptome-wide RNA secondary structure mapping. The authors designed a chemical probe, azido-kethoxal, to specifically label guanosine in single-strand RNAs in live cells that could be used to determine transcriptome-wide RNA secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W3004159088,"Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused significant disease, with widespread cases of neurological pathology and congenital neurologic defects. Rapid vaccine development has led to a number of candidates capable of eliciting potent ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies (reviewed in refs. 1–3). Despite advances in vaccine development, it remains unclear how ZIKV vaccination affects immune responses in humans with prior flavivirus immunity. Here we show that a single-dose immunization of ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV)4–7 in a dengue virus (DENV)-experienced human elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to both ZIKV and DENV. Using a unique ZIKV virion-based sorting strategy, we isolated and characterized multiple antibodies, including one termed MZ4, which targets a novel site of vulnerability centered on the Envelope (E) domain I/III linker region and protects mice from viremia and viral dissemination following ZIKV or DENV-2 challenge. These data demonstrate that Zika vaccination in a DENV-experienced individual can boost pre-existing flavivirus immunity and elicit protective responses against both ZIKV and DENV. ZPIV vaccination in Puerto Rican individuals with prior flavivirus experience yielded similar cross-neutralizing potency after a single vaccination, highlighting the potential benefit of ZIKV vaccination in flavivirus-endemic areas. Zika virus vaccination elicits Zika and dengue virus cross-neutralizing antibodies in flavivirus-exposed individuals, potentially enhancing the protective efficacy of the vaccine in flavivirus-endemic regions."
https://openalex.org/W3004145072,"The Hippo and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways are the two predominant growth-control pathways that dictate proper organ development. We therefore explored potential crosstalk between these two functionally relevant pathways to coordinate their growth-control functions. We found that the LATS1 and LATS2 kinases, the core components of the Hippo pathway, phosphorylate S606 of Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1, to attenuate mTORC1 activation by impairing the interaction of Raptor with Rheb. The phosphomimetic Raptor-S606D knock-in mutant led to a reduction in cell size and proliferation. Compared with Raptor+/+ mice, RaptorD/D knock-in mice exhibited smaller livers and hearts, and a significant inhibition of elevation in mTORC1 signalling induced by Nf2 or Lats1 and Lats2 loss. Thus, our study reveals a direct link between the Hippo and mTORC1 pathways to fine-tune organ growth."
https://openalex.org/W3005359476,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) promote the development of the neonatal intestinal, immune, and nervous systems and has recently received considerable attention. Here we investigated how the maternal diet affects HMO biosynthesis and how any diet-induced HMO alterations influence the infant gut microbiome and immunity. Using capillary electrophoresis and MS-based analyses, we extracted and measured HMOs from breast milk samples and then correlated their levels with results from validated 24-h diet recall surveys and breast milk fatty acids. We found that fruit intake and unsaturated fatty acids in breast milk were positively correlated with an increased absolute abundance of numerous HMOs, including 16 sulfonated HMOs we identified here in humans for the first time. The diet-derived monosaccharide 5-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) was unambiguously detected in all samples. To gain insights into the potential impact of Neu5Gc on the infant microbiome, we used a constrained ordination approach and identified correlations between Neu5Gc levels and Bacteroides spp. in infant stool. However, Neu5Gc was not associated with marked changes in infant immune markers, in contrast with sulfonated HMOs, whose expression correlated with suppression of two major Th2 cytokines, IL-10 and IL-13. The findings of our work highlight the importance of maternal diet for HMO biosynthesis and provide as yet unexplored targets for future studies investigating interactions between HMOs and the intestinal microbiome and immunity in infants.

Incorporation of diet-derived Neu5Ac into new glycoconjugates has been well-established. Dietary Neu5Ac is primarily observed glycosidically bound to other biomolecules, but it must be released into its free form by neuraminidases expressed by the GI mucosa or microbes before incorporation into infant tissue (28Röhrig C.H. Choi S.S. Baldwin N. The nutritional role of free sialic acid, a human milk monosaccharide, and its application as a functional food ingredient.Crit. Rev. Food Sci.

Among the clearest evidence of salvaging of dietary Neu5Ac in vivo comes from studies of the structurally related analog 5-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Humans are unable to biosynthesize Neu5Gc, instead obtaining it from the diet, with red meat and dairy products being particularly rich sources; however, human metabolic enzymes do not differentiate between Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac in vitro (29Bardor M. Nguyen D.H. Diaz S. Varki A. Mechanism of uptake and incorporation of the non-human sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid into human cells.J. Biol.

Experiments with mice unable to biosynthesize Neu5Gc have demonstrated that diet-derived Neu5Gc that is glycosidically bound is more bioavailable than free Neu5Gc (31Banda K. Gregg C.J. Chow R.

To date, Neu5Gc incorporation into HMOs has not been demonstrated, although it has been detected in a single sample of whole, pooled human milk (32Lacomba R. Salcedo J. Alegría A. Barberá R. Hueso P.

Establishing the capacity of diet-derived Neu5Gc to be incorporated into newly biosynthesized HMOs is relevant to infant health because the human immune system is able to distinguish between Neu5Ac- and Neu5Gc-containing glycans, specifically recognizing the latter as foreign (33Padler-Karavani V.

Recently, we tested the potential influence of diet on milk oligosaccharide biosynthesis in dairy cattle (38Vicaretti S.D. Mohtarudin N.A. Garner A.M. Zandberg W.F.

Cow milk shares some oligosaccharides in common with human milk, although the concentration and variety of those observed in cow milk are lower than that of human milk. This research led to identification of nine previously undescribed sulfonated milk oligosaccharides in bovine milk; these sulfonated glycoepitopes chemically resemble the O-glycans lining the infant GI tract (39Bum-Erdene K. Leffler H. Nilsson U.J. Blanchard H.

Accordingly, the research presented here sought to address three questions. Does the human diet impact the biosynthesis of HMOs? Are sulfonated HMOs present in human milk? If so, do these have an observable prebiotic effect in exclusively breast-fed infants? Our observations indicate that all three questions are answered in the affirmative. Red meat, (bovine) milk, and dairy products represent the most prevalent dietary sources of the nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc in the human diet (30Tangvoranuntakul P. Gagneux P. Diaz S. Bardor M. Varki N. Varki A. Muchmore E. Human uptake and incorporation of an immunogenic nonhuman dietary sialic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It has been hypothesized that in women, milk and dairy products would be the major dietary source of Neu5Gc and that this monosaccharide would consequently be observed at elevated levels in the HMOs biosynthesized by women consuming cow’s milk rather than alternative, almond-based beverages. Accordingly, breast milk samples from two groups of women (n = 8 for each), classified as milk or almond beverage consumers, as self-assessed on prestudy questionnaires, were selected from a larger cohort of samples obtained from donors who had completed a detailed diet recall survey for the 24-h period preceding milk collection. Close analysis of participants’ diets after group selection revealed that, although not all the women in the almond group refrained entirely from dairy products, these groups were different in their mean intake of milk (0.2 ± 0.06 versus 1.2 ± 0.45 food group equivalents (FTE), p = 0.028, one-tailed Student’s t test) and total dairy products (0.8 ± 0.32 versus 2.3 ± 0.39 FTE, p = 0.005). Based on the diet recalls, estimated levels of ingested Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were predicted for each participant (Fig. 1 and Table S1) by multiplying the FTE (i.e. mass) of each Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc source by its putative abundance in common sources, as evaluated previously (30Tangvoranuntakul P. Gagneux P. Diaz S. Bardor M. Varki N. Varki A. Muchmore E. Human uptake and incorporation of an immunogenic nonhuman dietary sialic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Overall, the estimated amounts of ingested Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc were similar in the milk- and almond-consuming groups; however, milk consumers obtained a greater fraction of Neu5Gc from dairy products than almond beverage consumers (Fig. 1a). Across both groups, the ratio of ingested Neu5Gc to Neu5Ac remained essentially constant. The actual levels of Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc glycosidically bound to HMOs were quantitated (42Wylie A.D. Zandberg W.F. Quantitation of sialic acids in infant formulas by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry: an assessment of different protein sources and discovery of new analogues.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2018; 66 (29730930): 8114-812310.1021/acs.jafc.8b01042Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in all samples (Fig. 1a). Intriguingly, low amounts of Neu5Gc were detected in all (n = 16) samples tested, representing, to our knowledge, the first conclusive report of the presence of this diet-derived monosaccharide on HMOs. However, despite estimated amounts of Neu5Gc being higher in dairy consumers, their levels in HMOs were unchanged relative to the almond group and, thus, not specifically associated with dairy intake. Differences in the levels of HMO-bound Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac between women in the milk- and almond beverage–consuming groups may have been obscured by genetic variability with respect to the Se status of individuals. Accordingly, monosaccharide levels, including Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, were compared (Fig. 1b) between Se+ or Se− individuals, groups that were defined on the basis of relative HMO levels as described below. However, Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac levels in HMOs did not vary significantly with secretor type. When considering a subset of Se+ samples only, it was observed that HMOs from women in the milk-consuming group (n = 5) contained essentially equivalent amounts of Neu5Gc as observed for almond beverage consumers (n = 3), although the former did contain higher average levels of Neu5Ac (p = 0.055, two-tailed Student’s t test). Because of the human inability to biosynthesize Neu5Gc, its presence in human milk is clear evidence of a direct dietary influence on HMO biosynthesis (Fig. S1). Spearman rank correlations were therefore determined to uncover potential associations between estimated levels of ingested Neu5Gc (from all possible sources) and the concentration of HMO-bound Neu5Gc in human milk (Fig. 1c). A positive but not significant association was observed between ingested and observed (on HMO) Neu5Gc levels. Interestingly, the opposite trend emerged for Neu5Ac, where a negative correlation was observed between the estimated levels of ingested Neu5Ac and the abundance of Gal in HMOs. Overall, these results reveal that, although Neu5Gc in HMOs depends on dietary intake, a clear correlation between estimated dietary intake within the previous 24 h and HMO prevalence was not apparent.

CE-LIF analysis of HMOs extracted from our 16 samples permitted up to 93 (median = 87) different oligosaccharides to be distinguished within 10 min (Fig. 2), 21 of which could be identified on the basis of their co-migration with HMO standards (Fig. S2). The absolute and relative peak areas for 70 HMOs present in the majority of samples were recorded (Table S2). Traces of lactose (Fig. 2, HMO17) remained in all samples, accounting for, on average, 13% ± 6% of the total integrated peak area; this peak was excluded in determination of relative HMO peak areas. The relative abundance of several HMOs, including 2′-fucosyllactose (2′FL), lactodifucotetraose (LDFT), and lacto-N-fucopentaose 1 (LNFP1), has been demonstrated to accurately establish an individual’s Se status (44Totten S.M.

Natural removal of suspended microplastics (MPs) by deposition is often limited by their excess buoyancy relative to water, but this can change with the attachment of biological matter. The extent to which the attached biological ballast affects MP dynamics is still not well characterised. Here, we experimentally demonstrate using a novel OMCEC (Optical Measurement of CEll colonisation) system that the biological fraction of MP aggregates has substantial control over their size, shape and, most importantly, their settling velocity. Polyurethane MP aggregates made of 80% biological ballast had an average size almost twice of those containing 5% biological ballast, and sank about two times slower. Based on our experiments, we introduce a settling velocity equation that accounts for different biological content as well as the irregular fractal structure of MP aggregates. This equation can capture the settling velocity of both virgin MPs and microbial-associated MP aggregates in our experiment with 7% error and can be used as a preliminary tool to estimate the vertical transport of MP aggregates made of different polymers and types of microbial ballast."

In adult mouse testes, most piRNAs are derived from long single-stranded RNAs lacking annotated open reading frames (ORFs). The mechanisms underlying how piRNA sequences are defined during the cleavages of piRNA precursors remain elusive. Here, we show that 80S ribosomes translate the 5'-proximal short ORFs (uORFs) of piRNA precursors. The MOV10L1/Armitage RNA helicase then facilitates the translocation of ribosomes into the uORF downstream regions (UDRs). The ribosome-bound UDRs are targeted by piRNA processing machinery, with the processed ribosome-protected regions becoming piRNAs. The dual modes of interaction between ribosomes and piRNA precursors underlie the distinct piRNA biogenesis requirements at uORFs and UDRs. Ribosomes also mediate piRNA processing in roosters and green lizards, implying that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved in amniotes. Our results uncover a function for ribosomes on non-coding regions of RNAs and reveal the mechanisms underlying how piRNAs are defined."

We previously reported that cell-free hemoglobin (CFH), elevated in 80% of patients with sepsis, increases lung microvascular permeability in an ex vivo human lung model and cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we augmented a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis with elevated circulating CFH to test the hypothesis that CFH increases microvascular endothelial permeability by inducing endothelial apoptosis. Mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of cecal slurry with or without a single intravenous injection of CFH. Severity of illness, mortality, systemic and lung inflammation, endothelial injury and dysfunction and lung apoptosis were measured at selected time points. We found that CFH added to CS increased sepsis mortality, plasma inflammatory cytokines as well as lung apoptosis, edema and inflammation without affecting large vessel reactivity or vascular injury marker concentrations. These results suggest that CFH is an endogenous mediator of increased endothelial permeability and apoptosis in sepsis and may be a promising therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W3004924913,"The endocannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoyl-gycerol (2-AG) modulates immune responses by activating cannabinoid receptors or through its multiple metabolites, notably eicosanoids. Thus, 2-AG hydrolysis inhibition might represent an interesting anti-inflammatory strategy that would simultaneously increase the levels of 2-AG and decrease those of eicosanoids. Accordingly, 2-AG hydrolysis inhibition increased 2-AG half-life in neutrophils. Under such setting, neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes synthesized large amounts of 2-AG and other monoacylglycerols (MAGs) in response to arachidonic acid (AA) and other unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). Arachidonic acid and UFAs were ~1000-fold more potent than G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Triascin C and thimerosal, which, respectively, inhibit fatty acyl-CoA synthases and acyl-CoA transferases, prevented the UFA-induced MAG biosynthesis, implying glycerolipid remodeling. 2-AG and other MAG biosynthesis was preceded by that of the corresponding lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). However, we could not directly implicate LPA dephosphorylation in MAG biosynthesis. While GPCR agonists poorly induced 2-AG biosynthesis, they inhibited that induced by AA by 25%-50%, suggesting that 2-AG biosynthesis is decreased when leukocytes are surrounded by a pro-inflammatory entourage. Our data strongly indicate that human leukocytes use AA and UFAs to biosynthesize biologically significant concentrations of 2-AG and other MAGs and that hijacking the immune system with 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitors might diminish inflammation in humans."

We aimed to map, in detail, the alterations in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations in relation to clinical outcome in MS patients treated with fingolimod. Methods Paired blood samples from relapsing-remitting MS patients (n = 19) were collected before and after one year of treatment with fingolimod (0.5 mg/day). Absolute counts and relative proportions of a broad set of T- B- and NK-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Blood samples from 18 healthy controls were used for baseline comparisons. Results Treatment with fingolimod markedly decreased the absolute numbers of all major lymphocyte subsets, except for NK cells. The reduction was most pronounced within the T helper (Th) and B cell populations (p<0.001). By phenotyping differentiation status of T cells, dramatic reductions within the naïve and central memory (CM) cell populations were found (p<0.001), while a less pronounced reduction was observed among effector memory (EM) cells (p<0.001). The numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also decreased (p<0.001), but to a lesser extent than other T cell populations, resulting in a relative preservation of Tregs with a memory phenotype (p = 0.002). Conclusions Our results confirm that fingolimod therapy markedly reduces lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood of MS patients. Subgroup analysis of T cells showed that naïve and CM Th cells were the most profoundly affected and that memory Tregs were relatively preserved."

High levels of ROS can cause oxidative stress, leading to protein, lipid and DNA damage, or even cell death. Under physiological conditions, the rate of autophagy remains stable; however, it can be accelerated by a number of exogenous stimuli such as oxidative stress, starvation or hypoxia, leading to cell death. The present paper examines the effect of Conidiobolus coronatus infection on the immune response, oxidative stress processes and autophagy in the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. Fungal infection was found to result in the disorganization of the cytoskeleton of the larval immune cells and the enhancement of oxidative defense processes. Lipid peroxidation and autophagy were also induced in the hemocytes. Our findings show that G. mellonella is an ideal model for exploring immune mechanisms."

Therefore, it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil. We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017. There were three peaks in the series of dengue notification in this period occurring in 2013, 2015 and in 2016. The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa, suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed and discarded chikungunya cases are almost independent of the cases of Zika, however, affecting the series of dengue. In conclusion, co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could have lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system. We argue that the routinely use of mathematical and statistical models in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population."
https://openalex.org/W3004615924,"Random regression models (RRM) are used extensively for genomic inference and prediction of time-valued traits in animal breeding, but only recently have been used in plant systems. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms provide a powerful means to collect high-dimensional phenotypes throughout the growing season for large populations. However, to date, selection of an appropriate statistical genomic framework to integrate multiple temporal traits for genomic prediction in plants remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a multi-trait RRM (MT-RRM) for genomic prediction of daily water usage (WU) in rice (Oryza sativa) through joint modeling with shoot biomass (projected shoot area, PSA). Three hundred and fifty-seven accessions were phenotyped daily for WU and PSA over 20 days using a greenhouse-based HTP platform. MT-RRMs that modeled additive genetic and permanent environmental effects for both traits using quadratic Legendre polynomials were used to assess genomic correlations between traits and genomic prediction for WU. Predictive abilities of the MT-RRMs were assessed using two cross-validation (CV) scenarios. The first scenario was designed to predict genetic values for WU at all time points for a set of accessions with unobserved WU. The second scenario was designed to forecast future genetic values for WU for a panel of known accessions with records for WU at earlier time periods. In each scenario we evaluated two MT-RRMs in which PSA records were absent or available for time points in the testing population. Weak to strong genomic correlations between WU and PSA were observed across the days of imaging (0.29-0.870.38-0.80). In both CV scenarios, MT-RRMs showed better predictive abilities compared to single-trait RRM, and prediction accuracies were greatly improved when PSA records were available for the testing population. In summary, these frameworks provide an effective approach to predict temporal physiological traits that are difficult or expensive to quantify in large populations."

It has recently been shown that axonemal dynein light chain-1 (LC1) binds to the microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of OADγ, leading to a decrease in its microtubule-binding affinity. However, it remains unclear how LC1 interacts with the MTBD and controls the microtubule-binding affinity of OADγ. Here, we have used X-ray crystallography and pulldown assays to examine the interaction between LC1 and the MTBD, identifying two important sites of interaction in the MTBD. Solving the LC1-MTBD complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at 1.7 Å resolution, we observed that one site is located in the H5 helix and that the other is located in the flap region that is unique to some axonemal dynein MTBDs. Mutational analysis of key residues in these sites indicated that the H5 helix is the main LC1-binding site. We modeled the ternary structure of the LC1-MTBD complex bound to microtubules based on the known dynein-microtubule complex. This enabled us to propose a structural basis for both formations of the ternary LC1-MTBD-microtubule complex and LC1-mediated tuning of MTBD binding to the microtubule, suggesting a molecular model for how axonemal dynein senses the curvature of the axoneme and tunes ciliary/flagellar beating.

Dyneins, which consist of heavy, intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains, are microtubule-based molecular motors that move along microtubules toward the minus end (1Roberts A.J. Kon T. Knight P.J. Sutoh K. Burgess S.A. Functions and mechanics of dynein motor proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14 (24064538): 713-72610.1038/nrm3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). They are divided into two groups, cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins, in terms of their physiological functions: cytoplasmic dynein is involved in intracellular transport and cell mitosis, whereas axonemal dynein produces the driving power for ciliary/flagellar beating. The axoneme of the cilia/flagella has the 9 + 2 structure, nine doublet microtubules surrounding two central microtubules (2Bui K.H. Sakakibara H. Movassagh T. Oiwa K. Ishikawa T.

Axonemal dyneins have a regular arrangement and are subdivided into two groups based on their location: dynein located on the outer side of the axoneme is called outer-arm dynein (OAD), 3The abbreviations used are: OADouter-arm dyneinIADinner-arm dyneinMTBDmicrotubule-binding domainLClight chainaaamino acidsCTTC-terminal tailbuffer A50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaClbuffer C50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole-HClbuffer D10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaClr.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. and that on the inner side is inner-arm dynein (IAD).

The heavy chain, which is the largest subunit in a dynein motor, possesses a principal motor function with ATPase activity. Its structure comprises several functional domains, including the tail, linker, AAA+ ring, stalk, microtubule-binding domain (MTBD), strut/buttress, and C-sequence (see Fig. 1A) (4Carter A.P. Cho C.

To move along a microtubule, the communication between ATP hydrolysis in the AAA+ ring, and microtubule binding at the MTBD must be properly controlled. However, the MTBD are structurally separated about 15 nm from the AAA+ ring by the long coiled-coil structure of the stalk. This long-range intramolecular communication is currently explained by the helix-sliding model, whereby a registry change occurs in the packing between two helices in the coiled-coil region of the stalk (9Gibbons I.R.

In this model, the MTBD is thought to switch between two structural conformations named the α- and β-registries. Indeed, microtubule co-sedimentation assays have confirmed that the α- and β-registries in both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins show high and low microtubule-binding affinity, respectively (9Gibbons I.R.

In several axonemal dyneins, there is a characteristic insertion in the MTBD, which is called the flap region. The structure of the flap has been determined in the MTBD structure of dynein-c (12Kato Y.S. Yagi T. Harris S.A. Ohki S.Y. Yura K. Shimizu Y. Honda S. Kamiya R. Burgess S.A. Tanokura M. Structure of the microtubule-binding domain of flagellar dynein.Structure. 2014; 22 (25450768): 1628-163810.1016/j.str.2014.08.021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), where it forms a β-hairpin structure extended from the globular domain. However, the biological function of the flap region remains unclear. In cilium/flagellum, axonemal dyneins need to respond to curvature of microtubules accompanied with beating to move precisely. There are many axonemal dynein heavy chains with and without the flap region (e.g. 14 in human) which are periodically aligned in the axoneme. A cryo-electron tomographic study had demonstrated that axonemal dyneins showed their different activity states in flagellum corresponding to the microtubule bending (13Lin J. Nicastro D. Asymmetric distribution and spatial switching of dynein activity generates ciliary motility.Science. 2018; 360 (29700238): eaar196810.1126/science.aar1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear what the functional role of each specific axonemal dynein is, which displayed different motor properties in vitro observed in gliding assays (14Kikushima K. Kamiya R.

The other dynein chains are called accessory chains and play regulatory roles in the cargo-binding or ATPase activity of the heavy chain. Most of the dynein accessory chains are considered to interact with the N-terminal tail domain of the heavy chain. The axonemal dynein light chain-1 (LC1) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii had been assumed to be bound to the AAA+ ring of the OAD γ-heavy chain (OADγ) (16King S.M. Patel-King R.S. Functional architecture of the outer arm dynein conformational switch.J. Biol.

Recently, however, it was unveiled that LC1 is bound to the MTBD of OADγ (17Ichikawa M. Saito K. Yanagisawa H.-A. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Yamaguchi S. Yajima J. Kushida Y. Nakano K. Numata O.

Mutational studies have shown that expression of an LC1 mutant leads to dominant-negative effects on swimming velocity and beat frequency in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (18Patel-King R.S. King S.M. An outer arm dynein light chain acts in a conformational switch for flagellar motility.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186 (19620633): 283-29510.1083/jcb.200905083Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that knockdown of LC1 leads to low beat frequency in planaria (19Rompolas P. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. An outer arm dynein conformational switch is required for metachronal synchrony of motile cilia in planaria.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 (20844081): 3669-367910.1091/mbc.e10-04-0373Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). LC1 is also highly conserved in vertebrates (e.g. DNAL1 in human), and mutations of LC1 causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (20Mazor M. Alkrinawi S. Chalifa-Caspi V. Manor E. Sheffield V.C. Aviram M. Parvari R. Primary ciliary dyskinesia caused by homozygous mutation in DNAL1, encoding dynein light chain 1.Am. J. Hum.

Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33 (15845866): 41-4710.1165/rcmb.2004-0335OCCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that LC1 binding to the MTBD decreases the microtubule-binding affinity of the heavy chain (17Ichikawa M. Saito K. Yanagisawa H.-A. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Yamaguchi S. Yajima J. Kushida Y. Nakano K. Numata O. Toyoshima Y.Y. Axonemal dynein light chain-1 locates at the microtubule-binding domain of the γ heavy chain.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 (26399296): 4236-424710.1091/mbc.e15-05-0289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the ATPase activity of the heavy chain is increased in the presence of microtubules (10Kon T. Imamula K. Roberts A.J. Ohkura R. Knight P.J. Gibbons I.R. Burgess S.A. Sutoh K. Helix sliding in the stalk coiled coil of dynein couples ATPase and microtubule binding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16 (19198589): 325-33310.1038/nsmb.1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the above-mentioned physiological and biochemical analyses imply that LC1 might change the ATPase activity of the AAA+ ring of OADγ from the remote MTBD region and thereby fine-tune ciliary/flagellar beating. However, the structural basis on how LC1 can tune ATPase activity through the MTBD and stalk regions remains unclear. Here, we have performed mutational and structural studies to investigate the interaction between LC1 and the MTBD of OADγ, identifying two important sites in the MTBD for interaction with LC1. Our findings enable us to provide the first structural model of the LC1 accessory function, showing how LC1 is able to fine-tune the ATPase activity of the heavy chain without any direct interaction with the AAA+ ring or microtubule, because of its tight binding to the MTBD. Furthermore, our structural model addresses the possible functional role of the flap region that is directly bound to LC1, leading to a unique stepping model of OADγ on the microtubule based on tethering and release of the flap region by LC1. We solved the crystal structure of the LC1-MTBD complex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at 1.7 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule each of LC1 and the MTBD, suggesting that LC1 is bound to the MTBD with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, as predicted previously (17Ichikawa M. Saito K. Yanagisawa H.-A. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Yamaguchi S. Yajima J. Kushida Y. Nakano K. Numata O. Toyoshima Y.Y. Axonemal dynein light chain-1 locates at the microtubule-binding domain of the γ heavy chain.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 (26399296): 4236-424710.1091/mbc.e15-05-0289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MTBD interacted with the hydrophobic core of LC1 mainly via two regions, the H5 helix and the flap region (Fig. 1B).Table 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsData collectionX-ray sourceSPring-8 BL44XUWavelength (Å)0.90000Space groupP212121Unit-cell parameters (Å)a = 44.55, b = 73.03, c = 94.56Resolution (Å)50.00–1.70 (1.73–1.70)Completeness (%)92.2 (89.4)Rmerge (%)aRmerge(I) = ∑|I(k) − 〈I〉|/∑I(k), where I(k) is the value of the kth measurement of the intensity of a reflection, 〈I〉 is the mean value of the intensity of that reflection, and the summation is the overall measurement.7.3 (76.6)〈I/σ(I)〉31.7 (2.7)RefinementResolution (Å)39.69–1.70RworkbRwork = ∑‖Fobs(hkl)| − |Fcalc(hkl)‖/∑ Fobs(hkl) ./RfreecRfree is the R factor computed for the test set of reflections that were omitted from the refinement process.

Open table in a new tab Next, we compared published NMR and X-ray structures (PDB ID: 1M9L and 5YXM) of LC1 alone (22Wu H. Blackledge M. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. King S.M.

The r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms between the new structure and the NMR or X-ray structure was 2.92 Å (134 aa) or 0.48 Å (194 aa), respectively, suggesting that the structure of LC1 in the MTBD complex is more similar to the X-ray structure than to the NMR structure. This is understandable; the X-ray structure is likely to mimic the complexed conformation because of overlap between interaction sites with the next crystallographic molecule and interaction sites with the MTBD (76.9% residues of shared interaction sites, Fig. S1). We also compared the structure of the MTBD in the LC1-MTBD complex to structures of the MTBD from Chlamydomonas dynein-c (PDB ID: 2RR7), mouse cytoplasmic dynein 1 (PDB ID: 5AYH), and human cytoplasmic dynein 1 (PDB ID: 3J1T) (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, the conformations of the axonemal dynein-specific flap region differed significantly between the LC1-complexed MTBD and the single MTBD of dynein-c. In the LC1-MTBD structure, the flap was kinked ˜90° around the axis parallel to the stalk as compared with that of dynein-c, indicating that the new conformation enables the flap to interact with LC1. We were also able to identify the structural state of the MTBD in terms of its affinity for microtubules, because the registry of the helical packing of stalk is exchangeable and linked to the microtubule-binding affinity. The r.m.s.d. of Cα atoms between the LC1-complexed MTBD and the MTBD of dynein-c or cytoplasmic dynein 1 (β-registry) was 2.13 Å (117 aa) or 1.74 Å (118 aa), respectively (11Nishikawa Y. Inatomi M. Iwasaki H. Kurisu G. Structural change in the dynein stalk region associated with two different affinities for the microtubule.J. Mol.

By contrast, between the complex and the MTBD of human cytoplasmic dynein 1 (α-registry) was 3.37 Å (111 aa) (24Redwine W.B. Hernandez-Lopez R. Zou S. Huang J. Reck-Peterson S.L. Leschziner A.E.

The LC1 molecule alone possesses conformational flexibility as suggested by NMR, but it is clear from the complex structure that LC1 fixes the MTBD conformation to the β-registry if no structural or nucleotide-based restraints exist. This is compatible with the previous report that LC1 binding to the MTBD decreases the microtubule-binding affinity of the heavy chain (17Ichikawa M. Saito K. Yanagisawa H.-A. Yagi T. Kamiya R. Yamaguchi S. Yajima J. Kushida Y. Nakano K. Numata O. Toyoshima Y.Y. Axonemal dynein light chain-1 locates at the microtubule-binding domain of the γ heavy chain.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26 (26399296): 4236-424710.1091/mbc.e15-05-0289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the interaction between LC1 and the MTBD by pulldown assay. The MTBD binds to LC1 through the H5 helix and flap region with several hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table S1). Complex formation involves a total of 41 residues (21 in LC1 and 20 in the MTBD) using a wide range of molecular surfaces. We selected 10 residues of LC1 for mutational analyses to assess the effect of electrostatic interaction (His-31 and Arg-79), hydrogen bonding (Ser-56, Thr-57, Asn-59, and Tyr-102), and hydrophobic interaction (Trp-99, Tyr-121, Met-182, and Ile-34). Mutational analysis showed that most of the mutations decreased binding activity slightly as compared with WT LC1 (Fig. 3C). Eight mutational sites (colored yellow and red in Fig. 3C) are involved in the interaction with the H5 helix and five with the flap (pink and red). Three residues (Thr-57, Arg-79, and Tyr-102), which are located in adjacent β-strands of the leucine-rich repeat in LC1, are the only residues that interact with both the H5 helix and the flap (Fig. 4).Figure 4Detailed view of the interactions between LC1 and the MTBD.

The interactions were calculated by using LigPlot+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the mutational sites interacting with the H5 helix, T57A and R79Q mutations led to a substantial loss of activity (Fig. 3C), implying that proper positioning of the adjacent Thr-57 and Tyr-102 residues around Arg-79 places Arg-79 in an optimal position for binding to both the H5 helix and the flap. The fact that these three residues, Thr-57, Arg-79, and Tyr-102, are conserved from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to Homo sapiens supports our interpretation. Among the five mutational sites (Ile-34, Thr-57, Asn-59, Arg-79, and Tyr-102) tested for interaction with the flap, only T57A and R79Q led to decreased binding, whereas the other three showed similar binding affinity to that of WT LC1 (Fig. 3C), possibly because several other strong interactions remained. Overall, this suggests that the contribution of the flap to the LC1-MTBD interaction is relatively minor relative to that of the H5 helix, although Arg-79 is central to connecting the two types of interaction with the H5 helix and the flap. Patel-King and co-workers have reported the phenotypic analysis of M182A mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (18Patel-King R.S. King S.M. An outer arm dynein light chain acts in a conformational switch for flagellar motility.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186 (19620633): 283-29510.1083/jcb.200905083Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is not surprising that mutation of Met-182 to Ala was least disruptive, because our mutational analysis in vitro showed almost no effect to the interaction between LC1(M182A) and MTBD as similarly as in vivo analysis. Using a mid-resolution cryo-EM structure of the microtubule-cytoplasmic dynein MTBD complex (PDB ID: 3J1T) (24Redwine W.B. Hernandez-Lopez R. Zou S. Huang J. Reck-Peterson S.L. Leschziner A.E.

Using the MTBD core region of the OADγ-MTBD, the LC1-MTBD structure was superimposed onto the cryo-EM structure of the MTBD-microtubule complex (24Redwine W.B. Hernandez-Lopez R. Zou S. Huang J. Reck-Peterson S.L. Leschziner A.E. Structural basis for microtubule binding and release by dynein.Science. 2012; 337 (22997337): 1532-153610.1126/science.1224151Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5) to predict the structure of the LC1-MTBD-microtubule complex. In this modeled structure, the OADγ-MTBD was bound to α- and β-tubulins without any steric hindrance. Surprisingly, LC1 was located apart from the tubulins with no possibility of direct interaction with them. This is not consistent with the previous experimental results that LC1 can bind dynein-depleted axonemes with low affinity, which seemed to result from the direct binding of LC1 to microtubules (16King S.M. Patel-King R.S. Functional architecture of the outer arm dynein conformational switch.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22157010): 3108-312210.1074/jbc.M111.286211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It should be noted that none of the reported structures contain the flexible C-terminal tail (CTT) region of tubulins with the posttranslational modification sites. Considering our structural model, it is possible that LC1 may bind to the invisible CTT regions of tubulins or to other accessory components contained in axonemes, which would position it near to the microtubules. In the ternary model, the flap region of the OADγ-MTBD is positioned to connect LC1 and the MTBD, as mentioned above. Intriguingly, however, a relatively recent cryo-EM study reported that the coulomb map of the axonemal dynein (DNAH7) MTBD bound on the microtubule shows an additional contact with the adjacent protofilament (25Lacey S.E. He S. Scheres S.H. Carter A.P. Cryo-EM of dynein microtubule-binding domains shows how an axonemal dynein distorts the microtubule.Elife. 2019; 8 (31264960): e4714510.7554/eLife.47145Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). That study concluded that an extended flap region of the DNAH7-MTBD contacts the adjacent protofilament when the MTBD binds to the microtubule. Considering the cryo-EM structure together with our modeled structure of the ternary LC1-MTBD-microtubule complex, it is possible that the folded flap region in our modeled structure may be released upon binding to the microtubule and interact with the adjacent protofilament, as suggested by the cryo-EM structure of the DNAH7-MTBD bound to microtubules. In this study, we revealed the complex structure of LC1 bound to the MTBD of OADγ by X-ray crystallography and identified two interaction sites of MTBD for LC1, the H5 helix, and the flap region. In addition to the structural analysis, we performed a structure-based mutational analysis using a pulldown assay and 10 LC1 mutants to evaluate the importance of these two sites. The interaction surface and points between LC1 and the MTBD are so wide (buried surface area: 1021.1 Å2) and intense (Fig. 3A) that the effects of a single mutation were not marked; however, mutation of Arg-79 in LC1, which is positioned between the H5 and flap interaction sites of the MTBD (Fig. 4A), weakened the interaction between the two proteins. We assume that Arg-79 may help in coordinating interactions by the H5 helix and the flap in the MTBD. In fact, Arg-79 and its surrounding residues, such as Thr-57 and Tyr-102, are well-conserved from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to Homo sapiens as mentioned above. The residues of MTBD interacting with LC1 were not entirely conserved in the other axonemal MTBDs (Fig. S2). This result might be a reason why LC1 binds only to OADγ. Our study indicates that LC1 is not able to bind directly to the microtubule track in its current binding geometry. Here it should be noted that LC1 is also able to interact with the MTBD stably even in α-registry. When we screened suitable constructs for crystallization, we prepared several variants with different coiled-coil lengths, and one of which fixed the α- or β-registry by the stable artificial coiled-coil at the base. The construct artificially fixed in the α-registry was designed as similarly as the case of previous cryo-EM analysis (26Uchimura S. Fujii T. Takazaki H. Ayukawa R. Nishikawa Y. Minoura I.

Although there is information about the contribution of specific proneural-progenitor populations to specific deep nuclei, and the distinct rhombomeric contribution, little is known about how progenitor cells from the LRL behave during neurogenesis and how their transition into differentiation is regulated. In this work, we investigated the atoh1 gene regulatory network operating in the specification of LRL cells, and the kinetics of cell proliferation and behavior of atoh1a-derivatives by using complementary strategies in the zebrafish embryo. We unveiled that atoh1a is necessary and sufficient for specification of LRL cells by activating atoh1b, which worked as a differentiation gene to transition progenitor cells towards neuron differentiation in a Notch-dependent manner. This cell state transition involved the release of atoh1a-derivatives from the LRL: atoh1a progenitors contributed first to atoh1b cells, which are committed non-proliferative precursors, and to the lhx2b-neuronal lineage as demonstrated by cell fate studies and functional analyses. Using in vivo cell lineage approaches we revealed that the proliferative cell capacity, as well as the mode of division, relied on the position of the atoh1a progenitors within the dorsoventral axis. We showed that atoh1a may behave as the cell fate selector gene, whereas atoh1b functions as a neuronal differentiation gene, contributing to the lhx2b neuronal population. atoh1a-progenitor cell dynamics (cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and neuronal migration) relies on their position, demonstrating the challenges that progenitor cells face in computing positional information from a dynamic two-dimensional grid in order to generate the stereotyped neuronal structures in the embryonic hindbrain."

Folate is also a crucial nutrient for SCN to complete its life cycle; SCN does not itself produce folate and therefore must rely on host plants as a source (21Goverse A. Smant G.

Perturbation of soybean folate metabolism linked to the two polymorphisms in Forrest SHMT8 could thus affect establishment and/or maintenance of the SCN feeding site. However, other possibilities, such as altered or novel enzymatic properties caused by the amino acid substitutions or impacts on protein–protein interactions in the cell, may also be relevant. To date, the role of soybean SHMT8 in SCN resistance has remained unclear. Here we present a comprehensive structural and biochemical comparison of SHMT8 from soybean cvs. Essex and Forrest. Crystal structures show that the two Forrest polymorphic residues (P130R and N358Y) flank a mobile loop located near the entrance of the THF-binding site. In Essex SHMT8, this loop becomes ordered upon binding of 5-formyl-THF (FTHF), consistent with micromolar binding affinity and robust enzyme activity. In contrast, Forrest SHMT8 has dramatically impaired binding to FTHF and a corresponding defect in its folate-dependent enzyme activity. The different biochemical phenotypes of SHMT8 from cvs. Essex and Forrest have implications for understanding the environment of the nematode feeding cell during SCN infection and the mechanism of resistance to this agricultural pathogen. Crystal structures of soybean SHMT8 from cvs. Essex and Forrest were determined with various ligands at resolutions ranging from 1.4 to 2.35 Å. Three complexes of Essex SHMT8 were obtained: 1) one bound to the cofactor PLP, 2) one complexed with the PLP-glycine (PLP-Gly) external aldimine product, and 3) a ternary complex with PLP-Gly and the tightly binding inhibitor/alternative product FTHF. Complexes of SHMT8 from cv. Forrest were also obtained with PLP and PLP-Gly; a complex with FTHF was not obtained. See Tables S1 and S2 for a summary of data collection and refinement statistics. SHMT8 from cvs. Essex and Forrest adopts a tetrameric assembly in the crystal lattice (Fig. 2A). Two tightly intertwined dimers (hereafter called the “obligate dimer”) assemble to form a dimer-of-dimers tetramer. Within each obligate dimer (Fig. 2, B and C), the ligand-binding sites are found at the interface of two protomers, with residues from both chains required to create a complete, functional active site. Each protomer consists of a N-terminal arm (residues 1–32), a large domain (33–308) that binds PLP at Lys-244, and a small domain (residues 309–471) (Fig. S1).

Structural superpositions of the various ligand complexes of SHMT8 from cvs. Essex and Forrest show a high degree of overall similarity (Fig. 3A). No major changes in the obligate dimer or tetrameric assemblies are observed. A minor difference in the Essex SHMT8 ternary complex entails a slight rotation of the small domain (Fig. 3B). Conserved quaternary structure in Essex and Forrest SHMT8 was confirmed in-solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation, both of which indicated tetrameric assemblies (Fig. S2 and Table S3). Crystal structures of Essex and Forrest SHMT8 complexed with PLP were determined to 1.85 and 2.1 Å, respectively. The SHMT8·PLP complexes represent the resting state of the active enzyme (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3). As observed in other SHMT structures, the PLP-binding pocket is located deep inside the obligate dimer (Fig. 2C). Lys-244 forms a covalent Schiff-base linkage (internal aldimine) with PLP. Nearby residues from both chains of the obligate dimer (Tyr-59′, Glu-61′, Ser-107, Asp-215, Thr-241, Arg-250, where prime indicates chain B) make conserved interactions with the phosphate, N1, and O3 hydroxyl of PLP, whereas the pyridine ring of PLP stacks against His-134. The PLP-binding pose and interactions of Forrest SHMT8 show no major perturbations compared with Essex (Fig. 4A). For reference, the Forrest polymorphic residues (positions 130 and 358) are >14 Å from PLP/PLP-Gly. Crystal structures of Essex and Forrest SHMT8 complexed with PLP-Gly were determined to 2.1 and 2.35 Å, respectively. The SHMT8·PLP-Gly complexes represent an intermediate step of the THF-dependent catalytic mechanism (Fig. S3). In the first step, l-Ser attacks the Schiff base linkage between Lys-244 and PLP to form a PLP-Ser external aldimine. Next, an active site general base deprotonates the hydroxyl side chain of l-Ser, liberating formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is attacked by THF N5, transferring the side chain of l-Ser to THF. The resulting external aldimine/quinonoid product is PLP-Gly (Fig. 4B and Fig. S3). We note that this PLP-Gly adduct can also be formed via a THF-independent retro-aldol mechanism (24Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Purification and characterization of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate dependent serine hydroxymethylase from lamb liver and its action upon beta-phenylserines.Biochemistry. 1977; 16 (921936): 5342-535010.1021/bi00643a027Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Essex SHMT8·PLP-Gly complex retains many of the enzyme–cofactor interactions as in the complex with PLP (Fig. 4B). Likewise, the Essex and Forrest SHMT8·PLP-Gly structures reveal nearly identical binding poses and active site interactions. Attachment of glycine as an external aldimine displaces the Lys-244 amino group, concomitant with rotation of the side chains of Thr-241 and/or Tyr-59. The pyridine ring shifts away from Lys-244, and the glycine moiety occupies space above Lys-244. A bidentate interaction is made between the glycine carboxylate group and Arg-389; additional interactions are made by Ser-39 and His-218. The Forrest SHMT8 PLP-Gly complex is similar to that of Essex except that the side chain of Tyr-69 has rearranged slightly to make an additional contact with the glycine carboxylate. Overall, the similarity in PLP and PLP-Gly binding poses and interactions between Essex and Forrest SHMT8 suggests no long-distance structural effects of the Forrest polymorphic residues. The crystal structure of the Essex SHMT8 ternary complex with PLP-Gly and FTHF was determined at 1.4 Å resolution (Fig. 4C). We note this exceeds the resolution of other SHMT·folate complexes in the PDB by 1.0 Å or more (PDB codes 1DFO (25Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T.

The THF-binding site in Essex SHMT8 comprises a channel that extends from the surface of the protein to the deeply buried PLP-binding site (Fig. 2). At the entrance of the channel, the FTHF glutamate moiety is exposed to solvent and has no specific interactions with the enzyme (Fig. 4C). This binding orientation suggests that the glutamate moiety of FTHF in the Essex ternary complex can accommodate the predominantly biologically relevant THF in plants, which is polyglutamylated (32Mehrshahi P.

The proximal section of the channel is lined with aliphatic and aromatic residues, including Tyr-68′, which stacks against the p-aminobenzyl ring of FTHF, and Tyr-139, which hydrogen bonds to a carbonyl group of the ligand. This Tyr–carbonyl interaction has not been seen in other SHMT complexes with folate derivatives, because Tyr is not conserved in these other members of the enzyme family. The pteridine ring of FTHF lies at the base of the channel, with the pteridine ring positioned within 4–5 Å of PLP-Gly and parallel to the PLP-Gly pyridine ring (Fig. 4C). Multiple residues interact with the pteridine moiety, including Leu-129, Gly-133, Leu-135, and Asn-374. These contacts are highly conserved in other SHMT·folate complexes (25Scarsdale J.N. Radaev S. Kazanina G. Schirch V. Wright H.T. Crystal structure at 2.4 A resolution of E. coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase in complex with glycine substrate and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296 (10656824): 155-16810.1006/jmbi.1999.3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pteridine ring N5 is the site of condensation with l-Ser–derived formaldehyde during the SHMT reaction, making FTHF a product analog in the multistep reaction (Fig. S3). Our 1.4 Å maps reveal two orientations of the formyl O atom (occupancies ∼0.33 and 0.66). In one orientation, the oxygen participates in a hydrogen bond with the side chain of His-134 and a water molecule and is 3.2–3.4 Å from the nitrogen atom of the glycine aldimine. In the other orientation, the oxygen interacts with Glu-61, the same water molecule, and the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr-69. The proximity of the pteridine ring to the PLP-Gly adduct, as well as the presence of well-conserved pteridine-SHMT contacts, suggests that FTHF is present in the native binding pose required for catalysis. Initial comparison of the three Essex SHMT8 complexes revealed different conformers of a loop near the entrance of the THF-binding site, spanning residues 377–385 (hereafter: the THF-binding loop). In the PLP and PLP-Gly complexes, the THF-binding loop is partially disordered, with electron density maps suggesting a mostly open, flexible conformation (Fig. 5). In contrast, in the atomic-resolution ternary complex, the loop is highly ordered, with backbone and side chain atoms of all residues visible, and adopts a closed conformation (Figs. 4D and 5). Although no specific contacts are found between the THF-binding loop residues and FTHF, the loop packs closely against the ligand (e.g. Ala-382 is <4 Å from multiple FTHF atoms). Amino acid positions 130 and 358, the two sites of the Forrest SHMT8 polymorphic residues, flank the THF-binding loop (Fig. 4C). In Essex SHMT8, Pro-130 is buried in a short helical region in the large domain of SHMT and is within 4 Å of the backbone of Asp-379 in the THF-binding loop. Likewise, Essex SHMT8 Asn-358 is positioned in a helix in the small domain and is also buried. It is also within 3.3 Å of the backbone of Leu-383, a residue in the THF-binding loop. Neither Pro-130 nor Asn-358 makes direct contact with FTHF (>8 Å away). In the Forrest SHMT8 PLP and PLP-Gly complexes, the THF-binding loop is also partially disordered, as seen in the analogous Essex structures. However, some differences relative to Essex are apparent in the unmodeled electron density for the loop (Fig. 5), suggesting possible changes in loop mobility/position. Electron density maps are consistent with the Arg-130 and Tyr-358 substitutions, although the arginine side chain is not clearly visible past Cβ. The introduced tyrosine is solvent-exposed and makes no specific interactions with other residues. Overall, it appears that the proximity of the Forrest SHMT8 polymorphic residues to the THF-binding loop and the increased steric bulk of the polymorphic substitutions may have an effect on loop dynamics and/or conformation. To investigate potential effects on folate binding in Forrest SHMT8, we determined binding constants in a two-substrate system that exploits a spectrophotometrically observable change associated with folate binding (34Florini J.R. Vestling C.S. Graphical determination of the dissociation constants for two-substrate enzyme systems.Biochim. Biophys.

The stimuli represent six basic expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, and surprised) and nine complex expressions (affectionate, attracted, betrayed, brokenhearted, contemptuous, desirous, flirtatious, jealous, and lovesick) that were posed by Black and White formally trained, young adult actors. All images were validated by a minimum of 50 adults in a 4-alternative forced choice task. Only images for which ≥ 50% of raters endorsed the correct emotion label were included in the final database.

Using a self-administered questionnaire, the study collected information on 420 Paediatric Hospital Paediatricians (PHPs) and 594 Family Care Paediatricians (FCPs). LCA was used to discover underlying response patterns, thus allowing identification of respondent groups with similar awareness, attitude, practice and satisfaction. A logistic regression model was used to investigate which independent variables influenced latent class membership. Analyses were performed using R 3.5.2 software. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Two classes were identified: Class 1 (n = 368, 36.29%) ""Untrained and poorly satisfied"" and Class 2 (n = 646, 63.71%) ""Trained and satisfied."" Involving paediatric pneumologists or otorhinolaryngologists in clinical practice was associated with an increased probability of Class 2 membership (OR = 5.88, 95%CI [2.94-13.19]; OR = 15.95, 95% CI [10.92-23.81] respectively). Examining more than 20 children with SDB during the last month decreased the probability of Class 2 membership (OR = 0.29, 95% CI [0.14-0.61]). FCPs showed a higher probability of Class 2 membership than PHPs (OR = 4.64, 95% CI [3.31-6.55]).These findings suggest that the LCA approach can provide important information on how education and training could be tailored for different subgroups of paediatricians.

To identify genes related to economic traits or specific cellular processes in E. scrobiculatus, gene expression in multiple tissue/organ samples is commonly surveyed, and reference genes are required in this process as a control for normalization. In the present study, 18 candidate reference genes from E. scrobiculatus were identified, and the expression levels of these reference genes were estimated through quantitative real-time PCR. Differences in expression levels were analyzed with four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and delta Ct) and comprehensively with RefFinder. With the most stable levels of expression in different tissues, RPL13, RPS3 and RPL36 were determined to be suitable for use as candidate reference genes. Moreover, the expression profile of one target gene (glycoside hydrolase family 45, GH45) confirmed the reliability of the selected candidate reference genes. This study provides the first set of suitable candidate reference genes for gene expression studies in E. scrobiculatus, and the findings will facilitate subsequent transcriptomics and functional gene research on this pest."

Handwashing with soap can greatly reduce transmission but handwashing rates are often low and traditional interventions ineffective. To aid future intervention design, this study aims to understand the determinants of child handwashing and the key motivational drivers of children's behaviour within a specific humanitarian setting.In an internally displaced persons camp in Northern Iraq we conducted a series of 36 friendship-paired interviews with children aged 7-12 years, six semi-structured caregiver interviews, and three semi-structured hygiene promoter interviews. Perceived determinants of child handwashing were explored qualitatively, and motivational drivers were explored quantitatively with children in a rating exercise. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, using an inductive approach, and logistic regression analyses of motive rating data were performed to determine the predicted probabilities of motives being rated as important.Access to soap and water was perceived to be high across all participant groups. Children, caregivers and hygiene promoters all perceive the determinants of child handwashing to be associated with familial role, environmental factors pertaining to location and quality of handwashing materials and facilities, and level of exposure to hygiene promotion, and children also attribute their handwashing to social norms. We find that children in this context are motived most by play and nurture.Provision of soap and water alone is not sufficient to encourage children to practice handwashing with soap in a humanitarian context. Our findings suggest that equal consideration should be given to the quality and location of handwashing materials and facilities and social norms could be leveraged to promote and enhance child handwashing. Motive-based interventions targeting play or nurture may be a promising approach and are likely most effective when used in conjunction, along with other motivational drivers such as affiliation and love."

In this paper, we introduce a blockchain-based eBook market system that enables self-published eBook trading and direct payments from readers to authors without any trusted party; because authors publish themselves and readers purchase directly from authors, neither actor incurs any intermediate costs. However, because of this trustless environment, the validity, ownership and intellectual property of digital contents cannot be verified and protected, and the safety of purchase transactions cannot be ensured. To address these shortcomings, we propose a secure and reliable eBook transaction system that satisfies the following security requirements: (1) verification of the ownership of each eBook, (2) confidentiality of eBook contents, (3) authorization of a right to read a book, (4) authentication of a legitimate purchaser, (5) verification of the validity and integrity of eBook contents, (6) safety of direct purchase transactions, and (7) preventing eBook piracy and illegal distribution.

https://openalex.org/W3003458324,"Aberrant expression of HOXC6 and HOXC4 is commonly detected in prostate cancer. The high expression of these transcription factors is associated with aggressive prostate cancer and can predict cancer recurrence after treatment. Thus, HOXC4 and HOXC6 are clinically relevant biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these HOXC genes contribute to prostate cancer is not yet understood. To begin to address the role of HOXC4 and HOXC6 in prostate cancer, we performed RNA-seq analyses before and after siRNA-mediated knockdown of HOXC4 and/or HOXC6 and also performed ChIP-seq to identify genomic binding sites for both of these transcription factors. Our studies demonstrate that HOXC4 and HOXC6 co-localize with HOXB13, FOXA1 and AR, three transcription factors previously shown to contribute to the development of prostate cancer. We suggest that the aberrantly upregulated HOXC4 and HOXC6 proteins may compete with HOXB13 for binding sites, thus altering the prostate transcriptome. This competition model may be applicable to many different human cancers that display increased expression of a HOX transcription factor."

Accurate prevalence estimates of thinness and overweight/obesity among children and adolescents are unavailable in many low-middle-income countries due to lack of data. Here we describe the prevalences and examine correlates of objectively measured weight status among urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique.A cross-sectional study design was applied to recruit 9-11-year-old schoolchildren (n = 683) from 17 urban and rural primary schools in Mozambique. Body mass index (BMI) was computed from objectively measured height and weight and participants' weight categories were determined using the World Health Organization cut-points. Actigraph GT3X + accelerometers were worn 24 hours per day for 7 days to assess movement behaviours. Multilevel multivariable modelling was conducted to estimate odds ratios and confidence intervals.Combined prevalence of overweight/obesity (11.4%) was significantly higher among urban participants compared to rural participants (5.7%; χ2 = 7.1; p = 0.008). Conversely, thinness was more prevalent among rural (6.3%) compared to urban (4.2%) participants. Passive school commute, not meeting daily moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) guidelines, and maternal BMI >25 kg/m2 were associated with overweight/obesity while possessing one or more functional cars at home, maternal BMI >25 kg/m2 and being an older participant were associated with thinness in the present sample. The proportion of total variance in the prevalences of obesity and/or thinness occurring at the school level was 8.7% and 8.3%, respectively.Prevalences of thinness, overweight/obesity and other key variables differ between urban and rural schoolchildren in Mozambique. MVPA, active transport and mother's BMI are important modifiable correlates of weight status among Mozambican schoolchildren. Results from this study demonstrate important differences between urban and rural schoolchildren that should not be ignored when designing interventions to manage malnutrition, formulating public health strategies, and interpreting findings."

Various samples are examined under different stirring durations (20, 40, 60, 72, and 80 h). The synthesized GO samples are evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. The GO sample with 72 h stirring duration (GO72) has the highest d-spacing in the XRD results, highest atomic percentage of oxygen in EDX (49.57%), highest intensity of oxygen functional group in FTIR spectra, and highest intensity ratio in Raman analysis (ID/IG = 0.756). Results show that GO72 with continuous stirring has the highest degree of oxidation among other samples. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis shows that GO72–titanium dioxide (TiO2) exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance and higher electron lifetime compared with the TiO2-based photoanode. The GO72 sample incorporating TiO2 nanocomposites achieves 6.25% photoconversion efficiency, indicating an increase of more than twice than that of the mesoporous TiO2 sample. This condition is fully attributed to the efficient absorption rate of nanocomposites and the reduction of the recombination rate of TiO2 by GO in dye-sensitized solar cells."
https://openalex.org/W3004665771,"Tailed bacteriophages use a DNA-packaging motor to encapsulate their genome during viral particle assembly. The small terminase (TerS) component of this DNA-packaging machinery acts as a molecular matchmaker that recognizes both the viral genome and the main motor component, the large terminase (TerL). However, how TerS binds DNA and the TerL protein remains unclear. Here we identified gp83 of the thermophilic bacteriophage P74-26 as the TerS protein. We found that TerSP76-26 oligomerizes into a nonamer that binds DNA, stimulates TerL ATPase activity, and inhibits TerL nuclease activity. A cryo-EM structure of TerSP76-26 revealed that it forms a ring with a wide central pore and radially arrayed helix–turn–helix domains. The structure further showed that these helix–turn–helix domains, which are thought to bind DNA by wrapping the double helix around the ring, are rigidly held in an orientation distinct from that seen in other TerS proteins. This rigid arrangement of the putative DNA-binding domain imposed strong constraints on how TerSP76-26 can bind DNA. Finally, the TerSP76-26 structure lacked the conserved C-terminal β-barrel domain used by other TerS proteins for binding TerL. This suggests that a well-ordered C-terminal β-barrel domain is not required for TerSP76-26 to carry out its matchmaking function. Our work highlights a thermophilic system for studying the role of small terminase proteins in viral maturation and presents the structure of TerSP76-26, revealing key differences between this thermophilic phage and its mesophilic counterparts. Tailed bacteriophages use a DNA-packaging motor to encapsulate their genome during viral particle assembly. The small terminase (TerS) component of this DNA-packaging machinery acts as a molecular matchmaker that recognizes both the viral genome and the main motor component, the large terminase (TerL). However, how TerS binds DNA and the TerL protein remains unclear. Here we identified gp83 of the thermophilic bacteriophage P74-26 as the TerS protein. We found that TerSP76-26 oligomerizes into a nonamer that binds DNA, stimulates TerL ATPase activity, and inhibits TerL nuclease activity. A cryo-EM structure of TerSP76-26 revealed that it forms a ring with a wide central pore and radially arrayed helix–turn–helix domains. The structure further showed that these helix–turn–helix domains, which are thought to bind DNA by wrapping the double helix around the ring, are rigidly held in an orientation distinct from that seen in other TerS proteins. This rigid arrangement of the putative DNA-binding domain imposed strong constraints on how TerSP76-26 can bind DNA. Finally, the TerSP76-26 structure lacked the conserved C-terminal β-barrel domain used by other TerS proteins for binding TerL. This suggests that a well-ordered C-terminal β-barrel domain is not required for TerSP76-26 to carry out its matchmaking function. Our work highlights a thermophilic system for studying the role of small terminase proteins in viral maturation and presents the structure of TerSP76-26, revealing key differences between this thermophilic phage and its mesophilic counterparts. Viruses infect all domains of life, from bacteria to eukaryotes, and replicate and encapsulate their genetic material to create infectious particles. For viruses with large genomes, transporting genetic material into the capsid is an energetic challenge, and many viruses have evolved motor systems to accomplish this task. Viruses with concatemeric dsDNA genomes, such as herpesviruses, and most phages use a motor known as a “terminase motor.” Terminase motors are composed of three components: a “portal” channel, a “small terminase” DNA recognition protein, and a “large terminase” that contains both nuclease and ATPase activities (1Feiss M. Rao V.B. The Bacteriophage DNA Packaging Machine.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 726 (22297528): 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The portal, which is embedded within the capsid wall, acts as an adaptor to connect the capsid to the large terminase. The large terminase (TerL) 3The abbreviations used are: TerLlarge terminaseTerSsmall terminaseSEC-MALSsize-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scatteringFSCFourier shell correlationHTHhelix–turn–helixCTFcontrast transfer function. binds portal and pumps DNA through its pore into the capsid. For this packaging step to occur, the motor must first specifically recognize the viral genome. This DNA recognition task is performed by the small terminase (TerS) complex, which binds the phage genome at a recognition sequence known as “cos” or “pac” that ranges from 22 to ˜1800 DNA bases in length (2Wu H. Sampson L. Parr R. Casjens S. The DNA site utilized by bacteriophage P22 for initiation of DNA packaging.Mol.

After DNA recognition, TerS transfers the DNA to TerL for subsequent cleavage and packaging. Cos- and pac-containing phages are distinct in their cleavage mechanisms; cos phages only cleave at the cos site between genomes, whereas pac-containing phages solely use the pac site for packaging initiation, with the position of subsequent cleavage events dependent on a head-full sensing mechanism. It has been demonstrated that TerS has an important role in packaging initiation, as aberrant pac recognition impedes faithful genome packaging (4Schmieger H.

In some of these assemblies, such as Shigella flexneri phage Sf6 and Bacillus subtilis phage SF6, the pore is too narrow to accommodate dsDNA binding (Table S1) (11Zhao H. Finch C.J. Sequeira R.D.

In these structures, the outward-facing N-terminal domain is a helix–turn–helix motif, a common DNA-binding domain. Studies of Sf6 TerS indicate that mutation of this region of the protein abrogates DNA binding, suggesting a nucleosome-like wrapping mechanism (14Zhao H. Kamau Y.N. Christensen T.E. Tang L. Structural and functional studies of the phage Sf6 terminase small subunit reveal a DNA-spooling device facilitated by structural plasticity.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423 (22858866): 413-42610.1016/j.jmb.2012.07.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The exception to this model is the TerS structure of phage P22. In P22, the perimeter of the ring lacks the helix–turn–helix motif, and the pore is wide enough to accommodate DNA (6Roy A. Bhardwaj A. Datta P. Lander G.C. Cingolani G. Small terminase couples viral DNA binding to genome-packaging ATPase activity.Structure. 2012; 20 (22771211): 1403-141310.1016/j.str.2012.05.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This finding led to a second “threading” model in which DNA binds in the center of the ring, traversing through the pore (Table S1). Regardless of the location of the DNA binding regions, all known TerS rings retain the same mushroom-like shape with a C-terminal β-barrel. TerS interacts with TerL using this β-barrel region, which is conserved in all TerS structures known to date (6Roy A. Bhardwaj A. Datta P. Lander G.C. Cingolani G.

Additionally, the β-barrel can control TerS assembly, as removing it causes polydisperse ring formation (12Sun S. Gao S. Kondabagil K. Xiang Y. Rossmann M.G. Rao V.B.

Therefore, the C-terminal β-barrel has been hypothesized to be important for both TerS oligomerization and regulation of TerL activity. In past studies, we used the thermophilic phage model system P74-26 to probe the mechanisms behind different stages of the viral life cycle (18Hilbert B.J. Hayes J.A. Stone N.P. Xu R.-G.

Here we identify and characterize the small terminase gene of phage P74-26, hereafter referred to as TerSP74-26. TerSP74-26 binds DNA and both activates ATPase and inhibits nuclease activity of TerLP74-26. We report symmetric and asymmetric cryo-EM reconstructions of TerSP74-26 to overall resolutions of 3.8 Å and 4.8 Å, respectively. Our structures show that TerSP74-26 retains the N-terminal helix–turn–helix motif while also having a wide-enough pore for DNA binding. Compared with other TerS proteins, the helix–turn–helix domain is in a distinct conformation, with implications for the DNA binding mechanism. Finally, the C-terminal region of TerSP74-26 is unstructured, indicating that the β-barrel fold is not strictly conserved, nor is it essential for regulating TerLP74-26 activity. To investigate how thermophilic small terminase proteins recognize the viral genome, we sought to identify and characterize the TerS of the P74-26 phage. TerS proteins commonly exhibit low sequence conservation, which can make their identification challenging. However, synteny can be used to identify the gene, as the small terminase gene often directly precedes the large terminase gene. Because gene 84 encodes the large terminase (21Minakhin L. Goel M.

Although gp83 has low sequence homology to any known TerS protein (the closest relative being T4 TerS, which retains 19% identity), its length of 171 amino acids is similar to that of known TerS proteins. To further verify its identity, the putative TerS protein was recombinantly expressed and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Size-exclusion chromatography–multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) showed that gp83 assembles into a stable 9-mer complex with a measured molecular mass of 170 kDa (compared with 171 kDa calculated by sequence) and a polydispersity index of 1.000, indicating a monodisperse assembly (Fig. 1B). The oligomerization state of gp83 is consistent with that of mesophilic TerS proteins, which assemble into eight to 11 subunit oligomers (6Roy A. Bhardwaj A. Datta P. Lander G.C. Cingolani G.

Taken together, our results identify gp83 as the TerS of P74-26. We next used EM to determine the structure of TerSP74-26. Negative-stain EM showed homogenous TerS particles with even distributions of top and side views (Fig. S1A). From 2D classification, we observed that TerSP74-26 forms a ring-shaped assembly with a central pore (Fig. S1, inset). To further elucidate the structure of TerSP74-26, we prepared samples of the complex for single-particle reconstruction by cryo-EM. Unlike negative-stain samples, cryo-EM samples showed a strong preferred orientation for the top and bottom views of the ring and slight aggregation (Fig. S1B). The lack of side views severely hampered initial structure determination, and the middle portion of the ring could not be resolved (Fig. S1C). To increase particle side views, we used a combination of sample additives and tilted data collection. Of the numerous additives tested, amphipol A8-35 had the greatest effect on particle view distribution. After collecting a set of untilted images, we used a 30° tilt to obtain additional particle views (Fig. S2, A–C). Initial 3D classification of the combined datasets produced six different classes, several of which were of particular interest (Fig. 2A). Classes 1 and 2, which accounted for over 50% of all particles, showed apparent 9-fold symmetry. Asymmetric refinement of these combined classes generated a reconstruction with an overall resolution of 4.4 Å according to gold-standard 0.143 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criteria or 5.1 Å according to 0.5 FSC criteria (Fig. 2, B and C; Fig. S3B, and Table 1). The features of this reconstruction remained 9-fold symmetric. Therefore, we refined class 1, the best-resolved class containing 84,460 particles, with C9 symmetry to further improve the resolution (refinement including both class 1 and 2 resulted in a slightly poorer resolution). 3D refinement of class 1 with imposed symmetry resulted in reconstruction of the TerS ring to an overall resolution of 3.8 Å according to gold-standard 0.143 FSC criteria or 4.2 Å according to 0.5 FSC criteria (Fig. 2, D and E; Fig. S3C; and Table 1). Subsequent classification steps with and without alignment did not provide any improvement of the overall resolution.Table 1Cryo-EM reconstruction and model refinement statisticsData collectionMicroscopeFEI Titan KriosDetectorGatan K2Voltage (kV)300Magnification130,000Electron exposure (e−/Å2)50Defocus range (μm)−1.4 to −2.6Pixel size (Å)0.529Deposited structuresAsymmetric 1SymmetricAsymmetric 2PDB codeN/A6V1IN/AEMDB accession no.EMD-21013EMD-21012EMD-21014Data processingFinal number of particles152,31584,86086,969Imposed symmetryC1C9C1Map-sharpening B-factor (Å2)−198−195−250Final resolution4.43.84.8Asymmetric unit refinementMap correlation (%)N/A88.688.6RMSD (bonds)N/A0.0070.01RMSD (angles)N/A0.80.8All-atom clashscoreN/A1.824.08Ramachandran favored (%)N/A98.5297.95Ramachandran allowed (%)N/A1.482.05Ramachandran outliers (%)N/A00Rotamer outliers (%)N/A00C-β deviationsN/A00 Open table in a new tab Using the symmetric reconstruction, we built an atomic model of TerSP74-26. The model was constructed using the crystal structure of TerS from phage g20c as a starting model (PDB code 4XVN, 98.2% identity to TerSP74-26 for the full-length protein). Each TerSP74-26 monomer has an N-terminal helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif followed by an oligomerization domain consisting of two antiparallel helices (Fig. 3, A–D). These helices pack against the oligomerization domain helices of the neighboring subunit, forming a helical barrel. From the oligomerization domain barrel, the HTH domains extend outward like the spokes of a wheel (Fig. 3, B and D). The helical barrel arrangement of the oligomerization domains is highly reminiscent of the central oligomerization domains of the TerS proteins from phages SF6 and 44RR, with α-helix 5 of the oligomerization domain positioned in the crevice between α-helices 4 and 5 of the counterclockwise adjacent subunit when viewed from the C-terminal region (Fig. 3E) (12Sun S.

The central oligomerization domains appear to be well-ordered, as local resolution of the 3D reconstruction shows that the center of the pore has the highest resolution at 3.6 Å (Fig. S4, A and B). The poorest resolution, as low as 4.5 Å, is found around the perimeter of the ring in the tips of HTH domains (Fig. S4, A and B). The HTH domain of one subunit interacts with both of the subunits to the right through a series of hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the linker connecting the HTH to the ring (residues 51 to 56) is firmly packed against the adjacent subunit’s oligomerization domain (Fig. 4A). Altogether, the HTH domains and linkers bury ˜1570 Å2 of area and complete the hydrophobic core of the oligomerization domain. These interactions lock the HTH domains in place and strengthen the nonameric ring by an estimated ˜9 kcal/mol, using the PISA server estimation tool (24Krissinel E. Henrick K.

https://openalex.org/W3003583351,"Intrusive memories are a core symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A growing body of analogue studies using trauma films suggest that carrying out specific demanding tasks (e.g., playing the video game Tetris, pattern tapping) after the analogue trauma can reduce intrusive memories. To examine the mechanism behind this effect, we tested whether mere engagement with attention-grabbing and interesting visual stimuli disrupts intrusive memories, and whether this depends on working memory resources and/or the concurrent activation of trauma film memories. In a total sample of 234 healthy participants, we compared no-task control conditions to a perceptual rating task with visually arresting video clips (i.e., non-emotional, complex, moving displays), to a less arresting task with non-moving, blurred pictures (Study 1), and to more demanding imagery tasks with and without repetitive reminders of the trauma film (Study 2). Generally, we found moderate to strong evidence that none of the conditions lead to differences in intrusion frequency. Moreover, our data suggest that intrusive memories were neither related to individual differences in working memory capacity (i.e., operation span performance; Study 1), nor to the degree of engagement with a visuospatial task (i.e., one-week recognition performance; Study 2). Taken together, our findings suggest that the boundary conditions for successful interference with traumatic intrusions may be more complex and subtle than assumed. Future studies may want to test the role of prediction errors during (re-)consolidation, deliberate efforts to suppress thoughts, or the compatibility of the task demands with the individual’s skills."
https://openalex.org/W3004094413,"Background Polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes ensures effective immune responses against a wide array of pathogens. However, artificial selection, as performed in the case of domestic animals, may influence MHC diversity. Here, we investigate and compare the MHC diversity of three populations of horses, for which different breeding policies were applied, to evaluate the impact of artificial selection and the environment on MHC polymorphism. Methods Samples of DNA were taken from 100 Polish draft horses, 38 stabled Konik Polski horses and 32 semiferal Konik Polski horses. MHC alleles and haplotype diversity within and between these populations of horses was estimated from 11 MHC microsatellite loci. Results MHC diversity measured based on allelic richness, observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity and polymorphism content was similar across the MHC microsatellite loci in all three populations. The highest expected heterozygosity was detected in semiferal primitive horses (He = 0.74), while the lowest was calculated for draft horses (He = 0.65). In total, 203 haplotypes were determined (111 in Polish draft horses, 43 in semiferal Konik Polski horses and 49 in stabled Konik Polski horses), and four haplotypes were shared between the two populations of Koniks. None of these haplotypes were present in any of the previously investigated horse breeds. Intra-MHC recombination events were detected in all three populations. However, the population of semiferal Konik horses showed the highest recombination frequency among the three horse populations. In addition, three recombination events were detected. Conclusions These results showed that despite the different breeding policies, the MHC allele and haplotype diversity was similarly high in all three horse populations. Nevertheless, the proportion of new haplotypes in the offspring was the highest in semiferal Konik Polski horses, which indicates the influence of the environment on MHC diversity in horses. Thus, we speculate that the genetic makeup of the domestic horse MHC might be more strongly influenced by the environment than by artificial selection. Moreover, intra-MHC conversion, insertion, and deletion and intra-MHC recombination may be proposed as mechanisms underlying the generation of new MHC haplotypes in horses."

The objectives in this study were to investigate whether two functional polymorphisms in GC and CYP2R1, respectively, previously shown to predict vitamin D concentrations, were associated with risk of colorectal cancer; and further, to assess gene-environment interaction between the polymorphisms and intake of vitamin D through diet and supplementation in relation to risk of colorectal cancer.A nested case-cohort study of 920 colorectal cancer cases and 1743 randomly selected participants from the Danish prospective ""Diet, Cancer and Health"" study was performed. Genotypes CYP2R1/rs10741657 and GC/rs4588 were determined by PCR-based KASP™ genotyping assay. Vitamin D intake from supplements and diet was assessed from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Incidence rate ratios were estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model, and interactions between polymorphisms in GC and CYP2R1 and vitamin D intake in relation to risk of colorectal cancer were assessed.Neither of the two polymorphisms was associated with risk of colorectal cancer per se. Heterozygote carriage of CYP2R1/rs10741657 and GC/rs4588, and carriage of two risk alleles (estimated by a genetic risk score) were weakly associated with 9-12% decreased risk of colorectal cancer per 3 μg intake of vitamin D per day (IRRCYP2R1/rs10741657 = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97; IRRGC/rs4588 = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.82-1.01, IRRGRS2 = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81-0.99).The results suggest that genetic variation in vitamin D metabolising genes may influence the association between vitamin D intake, through food and supplementation, and risk of colorectal cancer.NCT03370432.

PSD-95/Dlg-1/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains constitute one of the most commonly identified protein interaction modules, with over 500 PDZ domain-containing proteins identified in the human genome alone (2Letunic I. Bork P. 20 years of the SMART protein domain annotation resource.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29040681): D493-D496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). PDZ domains characterized to date share a common core structure, consisting of a 6-stranded antiparallel β sandwich structure (β1–β6) flanked by an α helix on each side (α1, α2). PDZ domains fulfil their scaffolding function through the recognition of short linear PDZ-binding motifs that are commonly found at the extreme C termini of receptors and ion channels. It is generally agreed that PDZ-binding motifs are comprised of four residues, referred to by convention as P0, P-1, P-2, and P-3 from the C-terminal residue inward. Early studies characterizing PDZ domain-motif interactions led to the classification of PDZ domains based on their preferences for particular PDZ-binding motifs, indicating motif selection is primarily dictated by the motif residues at P0 and P-2. Peptide library screening studies identified PDZ domains that displayed distinct preferences for the type I motif X-(S/T)-X-Φ (where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any amino acid), the type II motif X-Φ-X-Φ (3Songyang Z.

The development of drugs that target certain PDZ domains but not others, however, remains challenging and requires further characterization of the molecular determinants of specific PDZ domain-motif interactions. The experiments described here employ a variety of approaches to further characterize the molecular determinants of the interaction between the second PDZ domain of NHERF1 and the CFTR. These results indicate that the PDZ-binding motif of CFTR appears to be an optimal PDZ-binding motif for interaction with PDZ2 of NHERF1, and that residue selection at the −1 and −3 motif positions appears to influence the affinity and specificity of the interaction. These findings have been corroborated in cellulo through the development of a novel PPI screening assay based on the iBox-PAK4cat crystallization system. This study demonstrates that iBox-PAK4cat crystals represent a potentially useful tool for the study of PDZ domain-motif interactions in a cellular context and may be a useful tool in future screening studies. To understand fully the determinants of the NHERF1 PDZ2-CFTR interaction we sought to determine the co-crystal structure. To facilitate co-crystallization, a chimeric construct was generated in which the NHERF1 PDZ2 domain (NHERF1 residues 150–270) was fused to a C-terminal DTRL tetrapeptide motif corresponding to the last four residues of CFTR (CFTR residues 1477–1480), mirroring an approach commonly used for crystallization of PDZ domain-motif complexes (28Karthikeyan S.

In agreement with previous reports (17Bhattacharya S. Ju J.H. Orlova N. Khajeh J.A. Cowburn D. Bu Z. Ligand-induced dynamic changes in extended PDZ domains from NHERF1.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 (23583913): 2509-252810.1016/j.jmb.2013.04.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the structure revealed that NHERF1 PDZ2 contains additional structured extensions beyond the core PDZ-fold. These extended regions form an α- (α3) and a 310 (α4) helix, which pack against the β1, β4, and β6 strands through the formation of a closed hydrophobic cluster (Fig. 1B). Although this hydrophobic cluster is formed from residues distal to the binding site, the extended NHERF1 PDZ2 domain has been shown to have an almost 18-fold higher binding affinity for the CFTR C terminus than the canonical domain (17Bhattacharya S. Ju J.H. Orlova N. Khajeh J.A. Cowburn D. Bu Z. Ligand-induced dynamic changes in extended PDZ domains from NHERF1.J. Mol.

Comparison of the structure of the extended NHERF1 PDZ2 with the canonical domain (NHERF1 residues 148–239) in the apo form (PDB 2OZF) reveals high structural similarity, with a RMSD of 0.74 Å for the 85 eq Cα atoms (Fig. S1). This indicates that the extended region does not induce significant structural changes in the core PDZ domain, but rather conveys its effects through allosteric interactions that mediate the stability of the binding site. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions indicate that similar structured extensions outside of the core PDZ-fold are common to several members of the NHERF family (Fig. 3B, Fig. S2), although thus far only those of NHERF1 have been characterized.Figure 3Comparison of human CFTR-binding PDZ domains.

The DTRL peptide at the CFTR C terminus represents a typical type I PDZ-binding motif, and as such, the structure presented here shares many common features with a typical type I PDZ domain-motif interaction. The T-2 residue of the PDZ-binding motif can be observed to form a hydrogen bond with a conserved histidine residue at position 212 of NHERF1 PDZ2 (Fig. 2A), consistent with a shared mechanism of recognition found in type I interactions. The L0 carboxyl group and leucine side chain appear to be key determinants of binding through interactions with the conserved 163GYGF167 carboxylate-binding motif and hydrophobic binding pocket, respectively (Fig. 2). In particular, the binding pocket appears to be stereochemically adapted to accommodate the leucine side chain (Fig. 2B). Other residues of the PDZ-binding motif can be observed to take part in numerous interactions with the NHERF1 PDZ2 domain. Specifically, the D-3 side chain forms a salt bridge with Arg180 and a hydrogen bond with His169, and R-1 forms a salt bridge with Asp183 and a hydrogen bond with Asn167 (Fig. 2A). Several studies have indicated that the CFTR C terminus binds to NHERF1 PDZ2 with lower affinity than PDZ1 (10Cushing P.R. Fellows A. Villone D. Boisguérin P. Madden D.R.

Indeed, whereas NHERF1 PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains share 54.4% sequence identity, they have been shown to display distinct differences with regards to ligand binding selectivity and affinity. The PDZ domains of NHERF1 are highly structurally similar (Fig. 3A). However, natural sequence variation of a number of key residues within the binding pocket can be observed, including the substitution of Glu-43 within PDZ1 with an aspartate residue at the equivalent position (Asp183) within PDZ2 (Fig. 3B). Studies have suggested that the lower binding affinity of PDZ2 can be attributed to the shorter side chain of Asp183 that cannot form a salt bridge with the R-1 residue of the CFTR PDZ-binding motif (17Bhattacharya S. Ju J.H. Orlova N. Khajeh J.A. Cowburn D. Bu Z. Ligand-induced dynamic changes in extended PDZ domains from NHERF1.J. Mol.

The crystal structure presented here contradicts this hypothesis, because the salt bridge between Asp183 and R-1 is present (Figs. 2A and 3A). The majority of known CFTR-binding PDZ domains contain a negatively charged residue at this position within the binding pocket, including those outside of the NHERF family such as Shank1 (Fig. 3B), implying that it is charge rather than side chain length that is important. Furthermore, a positively charged residue at P-1 of the PDZ-binding motif is conserved cross-species for CFTR (Fig. S3). As such, these results indicate that the formation of an ionic interaction between these two residues may be a common mechanism for recognition and selectivity between CFTR and its respective CFTR-binding PDZ domains. The in cellulo crystal structure of iBox-PAK4cat revealed a hexagonal lattice with channels ˜80 Å in diameter that run the length of the crystal (1Baskaran Y. Ang K.C. Anekal P.V. Chan W.L. Grimes J.M. Manser E. Robinson R.C. An in cellulo-derived structure of PAK4 in complex with its inhibitor Inka1.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26607847): 868110.1038/ncomms9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that it may be possible to introduce NHERF1 PDZ2 into the crystal lattice to facilitate its in cellulo crystallization. A NHERF1 PDZ2 containing iBox-PAK4cat fusion construct (iBox-PDZ2-PAK4cat) readily formed diffraction-quality crystals (Fig. S4, Table S1). A partial electron density map was revealed for the PDZ2 domain, although it was of insufficient quality to trace the full polypeptide chain (Fig. S5), indicating that additional construct optimization is required to stabilize guest proteins in a single orientation within the crystal lattice. GFP-containing fluorescent crystals have also been produced through co-transfection of PAK4cat with various GFP-Inka1 constructs (1Baskaran Y. Ang K.C. Anekal P.V. Chan W.L. Grimes J.M. Manser E. Robinson R.C. An in cellulo-derived structure of PAK4 in complex with its inhibitor Inka1.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26607847): 868110.1038/ncomms9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In an extension of these approaches, we postulated that, through monitoring of GFP fluorescence levels, iBox-PAK4cat crystals could also be utilized as high-density in vivo sensors for the detection of protein-protein interactions. In particular, we sought to utilize the iBox-PAK4cat system as a tool to enable detection of PDZ domain-motif interactions. This approach is summarized in Fig. 4A. Two crystal-forming constructs were tested, one containing a C-terminal tetrapeptide corresponding to the CFTR PDZ-binding motif (iBox-PAK4cat-DTRL), and a negative control containing a non PDZ-binding C-terminal motif (iBox-PAK4cat-AAAA).

However, the roles of the vestibular system in energy and glucose metabolism remain unknown. We herein examined the roles of the vestibular system in obesity and impaired glucose metabolism using mice with vestibular lesions (VL) fed a high-sucrose/high-fat diet (HSHFD). VL was induced by surgery or arsenic. VL significantly suppressed body fat enhanced by HSHFD in mice. Glucose intolerance was improved by VL in mice fed HSHFD. VL blunted the levels of adipogenic factors and pro-inflammatory adipokines elevated by HSHFD in the epididymal white adipose tissue of mice. A β-blocker antagonized body fat and glucose intolerance enhanced by HSHFD in mice. The results of an RNA sequencing analysis showed that HSHFD induced alterations in genes, such as insulin-like growth factor-2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, in the vestibular nuclei of mice through the vestibular system. In conclusion, we herein demonstrated that the dysregulation of the vestibular system influences an obese state and impaired glucose metabolism induced by HSHFD in mice. The vestibular system may contribute to the regulation of set points under excess energy conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3004661665,"Casting light on how the interaction between protection and density dependence affects fish population dynamics is critical for understanding the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). We developed a framework based on nonparametric statistics, model selection and multi-model inference to contrast alternative hypotheses about the effect of density dependence on demographic dynamics under protected and unprotected conditions. We trialed it using a 12-year long time series of white seabream (Diplodus sargus sargus) population density within the no-take zone of Torre Guaceto MPA (Italy) and at two nearby unprotected locations. Then, we showed how the demographic models obtained can be used to assess the consequences of protection on population viability. Population dynamics were significantly influenced by fish density within the MPA and at one of the unprotected locations, where demography is possibly driven by directional recruitment subsidy from the MPA. The comparison of population growth rates within and outside the MPA suggests that in unprotected conditions the fishery may remove a fraction between 40 and 70% of the population each year. The population viability analysis pointed out that, while the probability that the population becomes depleted (i.e. undergoes a local, temporary quasi-extinction) is high in unprotected locations, it is negligible within the no-take zone of the MPA."

Multiplication is implemented using a multiplier, and recently, QDI asynchronous array multipliers were presented in the literature utilizing delay-insensitive double-rail data encoding and four-phase return-to-zero (RTZ) handshaking and four-phase return-to-one (RTO) handshaking. In this context, this article makes two contributions: (i) the design of a new asynchronous partial product generator, and (ii) the design of a new asynchronous half adder. We analyze the usefulness of the proposed partial product generator and the proposed half adder to efficiently realize QDI array multipliers. When the new partial product generator and half adder are used along with our indicating full adder, significant reductions are achieved in the design metrics compared to the optimum QDI array multiplier reported in the literature. The cycle time is reduced by 17%, the area is reduced by 16.1%, the power is reduced by 15.3%, and the product of power and cycle time is reduced by 29.6% with respect to RTZ handshaking. On the other hand, the cycle time is reduced by 13%, the area is reduced by 16.1%, the power is reduced by 15.2%, and the product of power and cycle time is reduced by 26.1% with respect to RTO handshaking. Further, the RTO handshaking is found to be preferable to RTZ handshaking to achieve slightly improved optimizations in the design metrics. The QDI array multipliers were realized using a 32/28nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process technology."

However, this testing allows scope for errors in the pre-analytical phase, which depends on the operator handling and transferring specimens correctly. The extent and nature of these pre-analytical errors in clinical settings has not been widely reported. Methods We carried out a convergent parallel mixed-methods service evaluation to investigate pre-analytical errors leading to a machine error reports in a large acute hospital trust in the UK. The quantitative component comprised a retrospective analysis of all recorded error codes from Abbott Point of Care i-STAT 1, i-STAT Alinity and Abbott Rapid Diagnostics Afinion devices to summarise the error frequencies and reasons for error, focusing on those attributable to the operator. The qualitative component included a prospective ethnographic study and a secondary analysis of an existing ethnographic dataset, based in hospital-based ambulatory care and community ambulatory care respectively. Results The i-STAT had the highest usage (113,266 tests, January 2016-December 2018). As a percentage of all tests attempted, its device-recorded overall error rate was 6.8% (95% confidence interval 6.6% to 6.9%), and in the period when reliable data could be obtained, the operator-attributable error rate was 2.3% (2.2% to 2.4%). Staff identified that the most difficult step was the filling of cartridges, but that this could be improved through practice, with a perception that cartridge wastage through errors was rare. Conclusions In the observed settings, the rate of errors attributable to operators of the primary point of care device was less than 1 in 40. In some cases, errors may lead to a small increase in resource use or time required so adequate staff training is necessary to prevent adverse impact on patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3005139248,"This paper examines the financial stability of banks that issued securitizations in the European market from 2000 to 2017. We use novel event study methodology and find that securitization has a positive impact on European banks' systematic risk during the 2000 to 2007 period and that subsequent securitizations have not any impact on systematic risk. The increase in systematic risk is due to an increase in systemic risk and in banks' idiosyncratic risk. By dividing the sample into those countries on the periphery and those at the core of Europe, it is found that securitization only has an impact on the systematic risk during the pre-crisis period, and only when looking at the peripheral countries does this lead to an increase in systemic risk. For individual countries, there is an observable effect for Spain and the UK prior to the crisis. On controlling for the type of collateral, it is found that this effect occurs when dealing with mortgage-based securitizations."

Migrants are at heightened risk of HIV/STIs and yet the vulnerability to poor sexual health of their left-behind partners, in relation to their household wealth, remain understudied. This investigation examines differences in sexual health from 2010 to 2015 among Armenian mothers, with a specific focus on their left-behind migration status and household wealth.Using the population-based Demographic and Health Surveys from Armenia, multilevel logistic models were used to examine the various relationships between sexual health, left-behind status, and household wealth. The multivariate analysis results showed that self-reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms (AOR = 1.45; p<0.01) and intimate partner violence (IPV) (AOR = 1.45; p<0.01) increased from 2010 to 2015; furthermore, negotiation power over sex (AOR = 0.77; p<0.01) declined among Armenian mothers. Left-behind mothers (LBMs) were more likely to report STI symptoms than their non-LBM counterparts (AOR = 1.61; p<0.01). In addition, significant differences in sexual health between LBMs and non-LBMs with different levels of household wealth were observed. The poorest wealth quintiles were associated with a higher likelihood of self-reported STI symptoms (AOR = 1.74; p<0.05) and IPV (AOR = 1.78; p<0.01), as well as a lower likelihood of utilizing HIV testing (AOR = 0.48; p<0.01) and negotiating power over sex (AOR = 0.47; p<0.01).This study strives to fill gaps in the literature related to the relationship between left-behind status, household wealth, and sexual health among Armenian mothers in a context of economic expansion. Among these mothers, poor sexual health outcomes increased from 2010 to 2015. Both low household wealth and a left-behind status were associated with adverse sexual health outcomes. These findings suggest future campaigns aimed at improving the sexual health of Armenian mothers need to be migration-status appropriate and socioeconomic-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W3005368934,"Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is one of the genes implicated in the devastating neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the precise mechanisms of SOD1 mutant (SOD1mut)-induced motoneuron toxicity are still unclear, defects in SOD1 proteostasis are known to have a critical role in ALS pathogenesis. We previously reported that the SOD1mut adopts a conformation that exposes a Derlin-1–binding region (DBR) and that DBR-exposed SOD1 interacts with Derlin-1, leading to motoneuron death. We also found that an environmental change, i.e. zinc depletion, induces a conformational change in WT SOD1 (SOD1WT) to the DBR-exposed conformation, suggesting the presence of an equilibrium state between the DBR-masked and DBR-exposed states even with SOD1WT. Here, we conducted a high-throughput screening based on time-resolved FRET to further investigate the SOD1WT conformational change, and we used a genome-wide siRNA screen to search for regulators of SOD1 proteostasis. This screen yielded 30 candidate genes that maintained an absence of the DBR-exposed SOD1WT conformation. Among these genes was one encoding DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 4 (DCAF4), a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin–protein ligase complex. Of note, we found that DCAF4 mediates the ubiquitination of an ALS-associated protein and autophagy receptor, optineurin (OPTN), and facilitates autophagic degradation of DBR-exposed SOD1. In summary, our screen identifies DCAF4 as being required for proper proteostasis of DBR-exposed SOD1, which may have potential relevance for the development of therapies for managing ALS."
