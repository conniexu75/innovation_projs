https://openalex.org/W2069919532,"The concurrent development of high-throughput genotyping platforms and next generation sequencing (NGS) has increased the number and density of genetic markers, the efficiency of constructing detailed linkage maps, and our ability to overlay recombination and physical maps of the genome. We developed an array for tomato with 8,784 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) mainly discovered based on NGS-derived transcriptome sequences. Of the SNPs, 7,720 (88%) passed manufacturing quality control and could be scored in tomato germplasm. The array was used to generate high-density linkage maps for three interspecific F2 populations: EXPEN 2000 (Solanum lycopersicum LA0925 x S. pennellii LA0716, 79 individuals), EXPEN 2012 (S. lycopersicum Moneymaker x S. pennellii LA0716, 160 individuals), and EXPIM 2012 (S. lycopersicum Moneymaker x S. pimpinellifolium LA0121, 183 individuals). The EXPEN 2000-SNP and EXPEN 2012 maps consisted of 3,503 and 3,687 markers representing 1,076 and 1,229 unique map positions (genetic bins), respectively. The EXPEN 2000-SNP map had an average marker bin interval of 1.6 cM, while the EXPEN 2012 map had an average bin interval of 0.9 cM. The EXPIM 2012 map was constructed with 4,491 markers (1,358 bins) and an average bin interval of 0.8 cM. All three linkage maps revealed an uneven distribution of markers across the genome. The dense EXPEN 2012 and EXPIM 2012 maps showed high levels of colinearity across all 12 chromosomes, and also revealed evidence of small inversions between LA0716 and LA0121. Physical positions of 7,666 SNPs were identified relative to the tomato genome sequence. The genetic and physical positions were mostly consistent. Exceptions were observed for chromosomes 3, 10 and 12. Comparing genetic positions relative to physical positions revealed that genomic regions with high recombination rates were consistent with the known distribution of euchromatin across the 12 chromosomes, while very low recombination rates were observed in the heterochromatic regions."

The fact that nanoparticles can be deposited in the alveolar region of the lungs is of interest for pulmonary drug delivery strategies and is of equal importance for toxicological considerations. Therefore, a detailed understanding of nanoparticle interaction with the structures of this largest and most sensitive part of the lungs is important for both nanomedicine and nanotoxicology. Astonishingly, there is still little known about the bio-nano interactions that occur after nanoparticle deposition in the alveoli. In this study, we compared the effects of surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) on the clearance of magnetite nanoparticles (mNP) with either more hydrophilic (starch) or hydrophobic (phosphatidylcholine) surface modification by an alveolar macrophage (AM) cell line (MH-S) using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Both proteins enhanced the AM uptake of mNP compared with pristine nanoparticles; for the hydrophilic ST-mNP, this effect was strongest with SP-D, whereas for the hydrophobic PL-mNP it was most pronounced with SP-A. Using gel electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering methods, we were able to demonstrate that the observed cellular effects were related to protein adsorption and to protein-mediated interference with the colloidal stability. Next, we investigated the influence of various surfactant lipids on nanoparticle uptake by AM because lipids are the major surfactant component. Synthetic surfactant lipid and isolated native surfactant preparations significantly modulated the effects exerted by SP-A and SP-D, respectively, resulting in comparable levels of macrophage interaction for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nanoparticles. Our findings suggest that because of the interplay of both surfactant lipids and proteins, the AM clearance of nanoparticles is essentially the same, regardless of different intrinsic surface properties."
https://openalex.org/W2072686461,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a gastrointestinal hormone that potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during a meal. Since GIP has also been shown to exert β-cell prosurvival and adipocyte lipogenic effects in rodents, both GIP receptor agonists and antagonists have been considered as potential therapeutics in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that chronically elevating GIP levels in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model would increase adipose tissue expansion and exert beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis. In contrast, although GIP Tg mice demonstrated enhanced β-cell function, resulting in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, they exhibited reduced diet-induced obesity. Adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and hepatic steatosis were both greatly reduced, and a number of genes involved in lipid metabolism/inflammatory signaling pathways were found to be down-regulated. Reduced adiposity in GIP Tg mice was associated with decreased energy intake, involving overexpression of hypothalamic GIP. Together, these studies suggest that, in the context of over-nutrition, transgenic GIP overexpression has the potential to improve hepatic and adipocyte function as well as glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1963722896,"Social interactions require knowledge of the environment and status of others, which can be acquired indirectly by observing the behavior of others. When being observed, animals can also alter their signals based on who is watching. Here we observed how male cichlid fish (Astatotilapia burtoni) behave when being watched in two different contexts. In the first, we show that aggressive and courtship behaviors displayed by subordinate males depends critically on whether dominant males can see them, and in the second, we manipulated who was watching aggressive interactions and showed that dominant males will change their behavior depending on audience composition. In both cases, when a more dominant individual is out of view and the audience consists of more subordinate individuals, those males signal key social information to females by displaying courtship and dominant behaviors. In contrast, when a dominant male is present, males cease both aggression and courtship. These data suggest that males are keenly aware of their social environment and modulate their aggressive and courtship behaviors strategically for reproductive and social advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2021939681,"Statins are widely prescribed for reducing LDL-cholesterol (C) and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but there is considerable variation in therapeutic response. We used a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to evaluate global effects of simvastatin on intermediary metabolism. Analyses were conducted in 148 participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics study who were profiled pre and six weeks post treatment with 40 mg/day simvastatin: 100 randomly selected from the full range of the LDL-C response distribution and 24 each from the top and bottom 10% of this distribution (“good” and “poor” responders, respectively). The metabolic signature of drug exposure in the full range of responders included essential amino acids, lauric acid (p<0.0055, q<0.055), and alpha-tocopherol (p<0.0003, q<0.017). Using the HumanCyc database and pathway enrichment analysis, we observed that the metabolites of drug exposure were enriched for the pathway class amino acid degradation (p<0.0032). Metabolites whose change correlated with LDL-C lowering response to simvastatin in the full range responders included cystine, urea cycle intermediates, and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, citrulline and lysine. These dibasic amino acids share plasma membrane transporters with arginine, the rate-limiting substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a critical mediator of cardiovascular health. Baseline metabolic profiles of the good and poor responders were analyzed by orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis so as to determine the metabolites that best separated the two response groups and could be predictive of LDL-C response. Among these were xanthine, 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, succinic acid, stearic acid, and fructose. Together, the findings from this study indicate that clusters of metabolites involved in multiple pathways not directly connected with cholesterol metabolism may play a role in modulating the response to simvastatin treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2148350562,"Critical transitions between alternative stable states have been shown to occur across an array of complex systems. While our ability to identify abrupt regime shifts in natural ecosystems has improved, detection of potential early-warning signals previous to such shifts is still very limited. Using real monitoring data of a key ecosystem component, we here apply multiple early-warning indicators in order to assess their ability to forewarn a major ecosystem regime shift in the Central Baltic Sea. We show that some indicators and methods can result in clear early-warning signals, while other methods may have limited utility in ecosystem-based management as they show no or weak potential for early-warning. We therefore propose a multiple method approach for early detection of ecosystem regime shifts in monitoring data that may be useful in informing timely management actions in the face of ecosystem change."
https://openalex.org/W2150623910,"Urinary exosomes represent a precious source of potential biomarkers for disease biology. Currently, the methods for vesicle isolation are severely restricted by the tendency of vesicle entrapment, e.g. by the abundant Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) polymers. Treatment by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) releases entrapped vesicles, thus increasing the final yield. However, this harsh treatment can cause remodelling of all those proteins which feature extra-vesicular domains stabilized by internal disulfide bridges and have detrimental effects on their biological activity. In order to optimize exosomal yield, we explore two vesicle treatment protocols - dithiothreitol (DTT) and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic (CHAPS) - applied to the differential centrifugation protocol for exosomal vesicle isolation. The results show that CHAPS treatment does not affect vesicle morphology or exosomal marker distribution, thus eliminating most of THP interference. Moreover, the recovery and preservation of catalytic activity of two trans-membrane proteases, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and nephrilysin, was examined and found to be clearly superior after CHAPS treatment compared to DTT. Finally, proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that 76.2% of proteins recovered by CHAPS are common to those seen for DTT treatment, which illustrates underlining similarities between the two approaches. In conclusion, we provide a major improvement to currently-utilized urinary vesicle isolation strategies to allow recovery of urinary vesicles without the deleterious interference of abundant urinary proteins, while preserving typical protein folding and, consequently, the precious biological activity of urinary proteins which serve as valuable biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W1999433154,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are oxygen-sensitive transcription factors. HIF-1α plays a prominent role in hypoxic gene induction. HIF-2α target genes are more restricted but include erythropoietin (Epo), one of the most highly hypoxia-inducible genes in mammals. We previously reported that HIF-2α is acetylated during hypoxia but is rapidly deacetylated by the stress-responsive deacetylase Sirtuin 1. We now demonstrate that the lysine acetyltransferases cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are required for efficient Epo induction during hypoxia. However, despite close structural similarity, the roles of CBP and p300 differ in HIF signaling. CBP acetylates HIF-2α, is a major coactivator for HIF-2-mediated Epo induction, and is required for Sirt1 augmentation of HIF-2 signaling during hypoxia in Hep3B cells. In comparison, p300 is a major contributor for HIF-1 signaling as indicated by induction of Pgk1. Whereas CBP can bind with HIF-2α independent of the HIF-2α C-terminal activation domain via enzyme/substrate interactions, p300 only complexes with HIF-2α through the C-terminal activation domain. Maximal CBP/HIF-2 signaling requires intact CBP acetyltransferase activity in both Hep3B cells as well as in mice. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are oxygen-sensitive transcription factors.

The N terminus of HIF-1α and HIF-2α contains the basic helix-loop-helix as well as Per/ARNT/Sim domain regions involved in DNA binding and dimerization, respectively, whereas the C terminus contains an N-terminal activation domain (NTAD) with an embedded oxygen-dependent degradation domain, a C-terminal activation domain (CTAD), and a highly divergent sequence in between known as the unique region.

The CTAD recruits p300 or CBP if an asparagine residue in the CTAD is not modified by a second oxygen-dependent hydroxylase, the asparaginyl hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) (15Mahon P.C.

Peet D.J. Turn me on. Regulating HIF transcriptional activity.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Changes in HIF-α protein stability are a prominent, but not exclusive, mechanism for HIF regulation (1Semenza G.L. Regulation of oxygen homeostasis by hypoxia-inducible factor 1.Physiology. 2009; 24: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the stress-responsive deacetylase Sirt1 selectively augments HIF-2 signaling by deacetylating HIF-2α at specific lysine residues (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α signaling by the stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 1.Science. 2009; 324: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We therefore postulate that a unique lysine acetyltransferase acetylates HIF-2α during hypoxia. Here, we evaluate the role of the p300/CBP and PCAF/GCN5 acetyltransferases in HIF-dependent regulation of Epo gene expression. We conclude that although CBP and p300 both regulate Epo gene expression during hypoxia, CBP and p300 exhibit unique roles in HIF-dependent transactivation with CBP, and not p300, acetylating HIF-2α during hypoxia and thereby acting in conjunction with Sirt1 to augment HIF-2 signaling. Full-length human wild-type (WT) p300 cDNA (R. Evans, Salk Institute) and full-length mouse WT CBP cDNA (T.-P. Yao, Duke University) were used to generate siRNA-resistant WT or HAT (K1399Y) mutant p300 and WT or HAT (K1540A and F1541A) mutant CBP by mutagenesis. WT and deacetylase inactive Sirt1 with an amino VSV-G epitope tag were previously described (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A.

Oxygen-independent (PP and PPN) HIF-α proteins contain substitutions for the two NTAD proline residues (PP) modified by the oxygen-dependent proline hydroxylases without (PP) or with (PPN) a substitution for the CTAD arginine residue modified by the oxygen-dependent asparagine hydroxylase; K3, HIF-2α containing three lysine residues acetylated during hypoxia (K385, K685, and K741) and deacetylated by Sirt1; R3, HIF-2α with three arginine substitutions (K385R, K685R, and K741R) for the lysine residues that are acetylated during hypoxia were constructed as described previously (3Dioum E.M.

The HIF-α ΔC-terminal activation domain (ΔCTAD) constructs were truncated at the junction between the unique region and the CTAD; all HIF-α constructs contain a C-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope tag. HIF-α constructs used in coimmunoprecipitations and pulldowns also have an S protein (SP) tag at the N terminus. Sirt1 and HIF expression vectors were based on pIRES-hrGFP-2a (pIRES), which also served as the control (empty) expression vector, except for SP-tagged HIF constructs, which were generated in pSPN (3Dioum E.M.

For knockdown/rescue experiments, we performed sequential transfection of siRNA followed by transfection of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine LTX with PLUS reagent (catalog no. 15338-100, Invitrogen) or by infection with lentivirus that coexpresses a cDNA followed by shRNA against the gene of interest. The rescue expression cassettes harbor a cDNA with silent mutations that confer resistance to siRNA or shRNA directed against the endogenous protein of interest. Cells were incubated an additional 48 h following plasmid transfection prior to harvest. We used nuclear extract-PER®, nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (catalog no. 78833, Pierce), and Cytobuster protein extraction reagent (catalog no. 71009, Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ), with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no.

Hep3B cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with expression vectors encoding SP:WT or PPN HIF-2α:HA containing three intact lysine residues in the HIF-2 C terminus that are acetylated (K3) or arginine substitutions (R3). To assess acetylation during hypoxia, cells were transfected, treated with 5 μm sirtinol (catalog no. 510 8474, Chembridge Corporation, San Diego) plus 10 mm nicotinamide (catalog no. N0636, Sigma) 18 h after transfection, and then incubated for an additional 6 h until harvest. Ectopic HIF-2α:HA was purified by SP pulldown using SP-agarose and then was first immunoblotted using antibodies recognizing acetylated lysine and second using antibodies recognizing HA (3Dioum E.M.

Hep3B cells were cultured in complete medium supplemented with 5 μm sirtinol plus 10 mm nicotinamide (NAM) and maintained for 6 h under either normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were fractionated, and the nuclear protein was extracted using a nuclear extract kit (catalog no. 78833, ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (catalog no.

Aliquots were immunoblotted for HIF-2α or acetyl lysine as described (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A.

For ectopic HIF-2α studies, Hep3B cells were transfected and harvested 48 h later for total RNA. For sirtinol treatment, sirtinol (5 μm) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) was added to the media for the last 6 h prior to harvest. To prepare acetylated HIF-2α substrate, HEK293 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding SP:WT HIF-2α:HA or SP:PPN HIF-2α:HA with control or CBP expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000. Media were replaced with complete media 6 h after transfection, and cells were allowed to recover for an additional 12 h. Next, transfected cells were treated with sirtinol (5 μm) plus NAM (10 mm) and exposed another 6 h to either normoxia for cells expressing the CBP expression plasmid or to hypoxia for cells expressing the control expression plasmid. Ectopic HIF-2α was purified using SP-agarose chromatography. For Sirt1 protein, wild-type or deacetylase mutant VSV-G:SIRT1 expression plasmid was transfected in HEK293 cells and purified 24 h later using anti-VSV-G antibody agarose (catalog no. A1970, Sigma). Before the deacetylation reaction, the SP-agarose bound HIF-2α:HA and the VSV-G-bead bound SIRT1 were each spun down, equilibrated with deacetylation reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm NAD), and resuspended in deacetylase reaction buffer. The in vitro deacetylation reaction proceeded for 0 or 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was separated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibody recognizing acetylated-lysine or HA epitope. Lentiviruses were generated by cotransfection with packaging plasmids pSPAX2 and pMD2G. The day before transduction, Hep3B cells were trypsinized, and 2 × 105 cells per well were plated in 1 ml of complete culture medium in a 12-well plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. On the day of transduction, complete media with Polybrene (catalog no. 107689, Sigma) was prepared at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Media were removed from the wells and replaced with 0.5 ml of the Polybrene/media mixture. Lentiviral particles were added to the Hep3B cells (multiplicity of infection = 20), and the plate was gently swirled to mix and then incubated overnight. After 12 h, the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of complete medium (without Polybrene). For RNA and protein preparations, cells were harvested an additional 48 h following transduction, with hypoxia exposure during the final 8 h when indicated. The expression of endogenous Epo, Pgk1, and cyclophilin B from three independent experiments for Hep3B experiments, or from individual mouse liver samples, was determined by reverse transcription of total RNA followed by real time quantitative PCR assays performed in triplicate, as described previously (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α signaling by the stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 1.Science. 2009; 324: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), using human or mouse Epo, Pgk1, or cyclophilin primers. We used the following human quantitative PCR primer pairs: EPO (forward) 5′-GAGGCCGAGAATATCACGACGGG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-TGCCCGACCTCCATCCTCTTCCAG-3′; PGK1 (forward) 5′-TTAAAGGGAAGCGGGTCGTTA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-TCCATTGTCCAAGCAGAATTTGA-3′; cyclophilin (forward) 5′-ATGTGGTTTTCGGCAAAGTTCTA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGCTTGTCCCGGCTGTCT-3′. We used the following mouse quantitative PCR primer pairs: Epo (forward) 5′-GAGGCAGAAAATGTCACGATG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CTTCCACCTCCATTCTTTTCC-3′; Pgk1 (forward) 5′-CTCCGCTTTCATGTAGAGGAAG-3′ and (forward) 5′-GACATCTCCTAGTTTGGACAGTG-3′; cyclophilin (forward) 5′-ATGTGGTTTTCGGCAAAGTTCTA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGCTTGTCCCGGCTGTCT-3′. All experiments were approved by the institutional IACUC. We injected 7–9-week-old (24–28 g) CD1 female mice (Charles River Laboratories; Wilmington, MA) intravenously with the indicated amount of virus brought to a final volume of 250 μl with normal saline. For CBP knockdown/rescue, we injected 3 × 1011 particles of PPN HIF-2α:HA or control (empty) adenovirus that also express control or mouse CBP shRNA (PPN HIF-2α:HA/shRNA adenovirus), plus 3 × 1011 particles of either control adenovirus or adenovirus expressing Myc-tagged shRNA-resistant (resist) wild-type (WT) or acetyltransferase activity mutant (HAT) mouse CBP. The PPN HIF-2α:HA/shRNA adenovirus expresses PPN HIF-2α:HA followed by an internal ribosome entry site with a downstream DsRed cassette containing multiple shRNA at the 3′ end of the DsRed cDNA (17Sun D. Melegari M. Sridhar S. Rogler C.E. Zhu L. Multi-miRNA hairpin method that improves gene knockdown efficiency and provides linked multi-gene knockdown.BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The resist CBP cDNA maintains amino acid identity but is designed to disrupt binding of the shRNA that targets endogenous mouse CBP. After adenoviral injections, mice were housed for 1 week and fed ad libitum during this period. All findings were rounded to two significant digits. A value of p < 0.10 or lower was considered statistically significant. SPSS V18 (IBM Inc., Chicago) was used to analyze the data using Dunnett or Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to provide coverage for type I statistical error. Post hoc analyses were performed based on specific data. Where all comparison groups were the same (i.e. no control), the Bonferroni correction was used. When one group was a control and all others groups compared only with control, the Dunnett correction was used to minimize the effect of multiple comparisons on the p value. We first asked if endogenous p300/CBP or PCAF/GCN5 participates in acetylation of endogenous HIF-2α during hypoxia in Hep3B cells using siRNA knockdown to decrease each candidate acetyltransferase. Knockdown of p300/CBP or PCAF/GCN5 family members singly or in combination revealed that only CBP participated in acetylation of endogenous HIF-2α during hypoxia in Hep3B cells (Fig. 1, A–C). To define the role of the candidate acetyltransferases in hypoxia signaling, we next determined how siRNA knockdown of candidate acetyltransferases affects Epo and Pgk1 induction after hypoxia exposure (Fig. 1D). Knockdown of p300 as well as CBP, but not of PCAF or GCN5, resulted in significant impairment in hypoxia-induced Epo gene expression. For the HIF-1 selective target gene Pgk1, knockdown of p300, but not CBP, affected Pgk1 induction in response to hypoxia whereas PCAF or GCN5 knockdown had no effect. Efficient knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). CBP, but not p300, participates in acetylation of HIF-2α during hypoxia in Hep3B cells. However, CBP and p300 both contribute to hypoxia-mediated induction of Epo. We asked if CBP and p300 act selectively through specific HIF factors to induce target genes during hypoxia. We first defined the contribution of HIF-1α or HIF-2α to regulation of Epo or Pgk1 (Fig. 2A) gene expression during hypoxia using siRNA to efficiently knock down HIF-1α or HIF-2α (Fig. 2B). As reported previously, Epo was predominantly regulated by HIF-2α, whereas Pgk1 was exclusively regulated by HIF-1α. We next combined knockdown of HIF-1α or HIF-2α with knockdown of CBP or p300 to determine the relative role of CBP and p300 in HIF-dependent induction of Epo and Pgk1 gene expression (Fig. 2C). Hypoxia-induced Epo gene expression was not significantly reduced by HIF-1α knockdown, either alone or in conjunction with p300, but it was significantly diminished with combined HIF-1α and CBP knockdown. HIF-2α knockdown substantially blunted Epo gene induction and the addition of p300 knockdown further reduced Epo gene expression, whereas the addition of CBP knockdown had no additional effect. For Pgk1, HIF-1α knockdown severely reduced expression to basal levels, whereas HIF-2α knockdown had no effect; knockdown of p300 alone significantly reduced Pgk1 induction, but knockdown of CBP, either alone or combined with HIF-2α knockdown, had no measurable effect upon Pgk1 induction despite efficient knockdown of CBP (Fig. 2D). We asked if the acetyltransferase activity of p300 or CBP was required for induction of Epo and Pgk1 gene expression during hypoxia (Fig. 3A). Knockdown of p300 blunted Epo induction, and this reduction could be rescued with an siRNA-resistant cDNA encoding either wild-type (WT) p300 or a mutant lacking acetyltransferase activity (HAT). In comparison, CBP knockdown also resulted in a blunting of Epo induction during hypoxia, and this inhibition could be rescued with a cDNA encoding WT CBP but not by a cDNA encoding a CBP HAT mutant. Rescue of the HIF-1 target gene Pgk1 was effective with either WT or HAT p300, whereas CBP knockdown had no effect, consistent with p300/HIF-1-selective regulation. Knockdown of p300 as well as CBP was efficient, whereas ectopic p300 or CBP expression levels were only slightly greater than endogenous protein levels (Fig. 3B). Acetylation of HIF-2α requires CBP, whereas deacetylation of HIF-2α requires Sirt1 during hypoxia. To confirm that Sirt1 inactivation results in acetylation of HIF-2α due to CBP, we examined isolated as well as combined Sirt1 and CBP knockdown (Fig. 4A). CBP knockdown performed in isolation or combined with Sirt1 knockdown eliminated acetylation. HIF-2α was acetylated following hypoxia exposure or CBP overexpression, and the acetylated HIF-2α was efficiently deacetylated by WT, but not by deacetylase, Sirt1 in an in vitro reaction (Fig. 4B). To define the relationship of CBP and p300 to Sirt1/HIF-2 signaling as measured by Epo and Pgk1 induction during hypoxia, we performed knockdown studies of CBP or p300 alone or in combination with Sirt1 knockdown (Fig. 4C). As we reported previously (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α signaling by the stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 1.Science. 2009; 324: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), Sirt1 knockdown alone blunted Epo induction following hypoxia exposure; Epo expression was further reduced after Sirt1 knockdown in combination with p300, but not CBP, knockdown. For the HIF-1 selective target gene Pgk1, only p300 knockdown affected induction and was not further affected when combined with Sirt1 knockdown. Knockdown of p300, CBP, or Sirt1 was efficient in all cases (Fig. 4D). We next sought to define the role of HIF-2α acetylation in HIF-2 signaling. We first asked if the lysine residues in the HIF-2α C terminus required for acetylation of ectopic HIF-2α during hypoxia are also required for acetylation of ectopic HIF-2α by overexpressed CBP (Fig. 4E). Similar to what we previously reported with endogenous HIF-2α (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α signaling by the stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 1.Science. 2009; 324: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), ectopic wild-type (WT) HIF-2α that contains intact lysine residues (K3) was not appreciably acetylated during normoxia, but acetylation was evident following hypoxia exposure. Furthermore, ectopic CBP also acetylated WT K3 HIF-2α. In comparison, a mutant form of WT HIF-2α containing arginine substitutions for the acetylated lysines (R3) was not acetylated during hypoxia exposure or by overexpressed CBP. We next asked if the acetylated HIF-2α lysine residues are required for Sirt1 augmentation of Epo gene expression (Fig. 4F). Knockdown of HIF-2α severely impaired Epo expression following hypoxia exposure. Cells rescued with an siRNA-resistant cDNA encoding WT K3 HIF-2α efficiently induced Epo gene expression during hypoxia, but this induction by WT R3 HIF-2α was substantially reduced despite comparable levels of WT K3 HIF-2α and WT R3 HIF-2α expression (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, reduced Sirt1 or CBP levels impaired HIF-2 signaling if the HIF-2α acetylated lysines remained intact, as only WT K3, but not R3, HIF-2α was affected by Sirt1 or CBP knockdown. We next sought to define the role of HIF-2α acetylation in hypoxia-independent HIF-2 signaling (Fig. 5A). Similar to what we previously reported (3Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2094603776,"Our understanding of motor neuron biology in humans is derived mainly from investigation of human postmortem tissue and more indirectly from live animal models such as rodents. Thus generation of motor neurons from human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells is an important new approach to model motor neuron function. To be useful models of human motor neuron function, cells generated in vitro should develop mature properties that are the hallmarks of motor neurons in vivo such as elaborated neuronal processes and mature electrophysiological characteristics. Here we have investigated changes in morphological and electrophysiological properties associated with maturation of neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells expressing GFP driven by a motor neuron specific reporter (Hb9::GFP) in culture. We observed maturation in cellular morphology seen as more complex neurite outgrowth and increased soma area over time. Electrophysiological changes included decreasing input resistance and increasing action potential firing frequency over 13 days in vitro. Furthermore, these human embryonic stem cell derived motor neurons acquired two physiological characteristics that are thought to underpin motor neuron integrated function in motor circuits; spike frequency adaptation and rebound action potential firing. These findings show that human embryonic stem cell derived motor neurons develop functional characteristics typical of spinal motor neurons in vivo and suggest that they are a relevant and useful platform for studying motor neuron development and function and for modeling motor neuron diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2019938767,"Myofibroblast differentiation, characterized by α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, is a key process in organ fibrosis, and is induced by TGF-β. Here we examined whether an anti-fibrotic agent, N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysylproline (Ac-SDKP), can regulate induction of TGF-β signaling and myofibroblast differentiation as a potential key component of its anti-fibrotic mechanism in vivo and in vitro.Rat pulmonary fibroblasts were cultured in vitro and divided to 4 groups 1) control; 2) TGF-β1; 3) TGF-β1+ LY364947; 4) TGF-β1+Ac-SDKP. For in vivo studies, six groups of animals were utilized 1) control 4w; 2) silicotic 4w; 3) control 8w; 4) silicotic 8w; 5) Ac-SDKP post-treatment; 6)Ac-SDKP pre-treatment. SiO(2) powders were douched in the trachea of rat to make the silicotic model. Myofibroblast differentiation was measured by examining expression of α-SMA, as well as expression of serum response factor (SRF), a key regulator of myofibroblast differentiation. The expressions of collagen, TGF-β1 and RAS signaling were also assessed. The results revealed that TGF-β1 strongly induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in vitro, and that pre-treatment with Ac-SDKP markedly attenuated myofibroblast activation, as well as induction of TGF-β1 and its receptor. Similar results were observed in vivo in the pathologically relevant rat model of silicosis. Ac-SDKP treatment in vivo strongly attenuated 1) silicosis-induced increased expressions of TGF-β1 and RAS signaling, 2) myofibroblast differentiation as indicated by a robust decrease of SRF and α-SMA-positive myofibroblast localization in siliconic nodules in the lung, 3) collagen deposition.The results of the present study suggest a novel mechanism of action for Ac-SDKP's beneficial effect in silicosis, which involves attenuation of TGF-β1 and its receptors, SRF and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)) expression, collagen deposition and myofibroblast differentiation. The results further suggest that therapies targeting myofibroblast differentiation may have therapeutic efficacy in treatment of silicosis of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1992987381,"The heterodimeric Rag GTPases consisting of RagA (or RagB) and RagC (or RagD) are the key regulator activating the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in response to the level of amino acids. The heterodimer between GTP-loaded RagA/B and GDP-loaded RagC/D is the most active form that binds Raptor and leads to the activation of TORC1. Here, we present the crystal structure of Gtr1p(GTP)-Gtr2p(GDP), the active yeast Rag GTPase heterodimer. The structure reveals that GTP-to-GDP conversion on Gtr2p results in a large conformational transition of this subunit, including a large scale rearrangement of a long segment whose corresponding region in RagA is involved in binding to Raptor. In addition, the two GTPase domains of the heterodimer are brought to contact with each other, but without causing any conformational change of the Gtr1p subunit. These features explain how the nucleotide-bound statuses of the two GTPases subunits switch the Raptor binding affinity on and off."
https://openalex.org/W1984649994,"The internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane region of the FLT3 receptor has been associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). How this elevated level of ROS contributes to the leukemic phenotype, however, remains poorly understood. In this work we show that ROS in the FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell line MV4-11 is reduced by treatment with PKC412, an inhibitor of FLT3, DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor, and VAS2870, a Nox specific inhibitor, suggesting that ROS production is both FLT3 and NADPH oxidase dependent. The majority of these ROS co-localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as determined with the H2O2-specific aryl-boronate dye Peroxyorange 1, which also corresponds to co-localization of p22phox. Moreover, knocking down p22phox dramatically reduces H2O2 after 24 hours in the ER, without affecting mitochondrial ROS. Significantly, the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 reduces H2O2 in FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13) through reduction of p22phox over 24 hours. Reduced p22phox is achieved by proteasomal degradation and is prevented upon GSK3-β inhibition. Knockdown of p22phox resulted in reduced STAT5 signalling and reduced Pim-1 levels in the cells after 24 hours. Thus, we have shown that FLT3 driven H2O2 production in AML cells is mediated by p22phox and is critical for STAT5 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1995315224,"Background Most physiological studies interested in alcohol-dependence examined ethanol as a pharmacological agent rather than a nutrient. We conducted two studies, which assessed the metabolic and endocrine factors involved in the regulation of alcohol and nutrient intake in alcohol-dependent (AD) subjects. We also examined the potential role of a disruption in energy balance in alcohol-dependence. Methods and Results In Study-1, quantitative dietetic interviews of eating and drinking habits were conducted with 97 AD subjects. The population was split around a median alcohol intake value of 12.5 kcal/kg/day. The results showed that the “low alcohol” drinking AD subjects had high Body Mass Index (BMI) and Fat Mass (FM) and alcohol intake was compensated for by a decrease in non-alcoholic intakes. “High alcohol” drinking AD subjects, on the other hand, had low BMI and FM and the total caloric intakes were largely above norms. In Study-2, 24 AD inpatients were submitted to dietetic interviews, calorimetry and blood samplings for the measurement of biomarkers of the regulation of metabolism and satiety, on day 2, 5 and 16 of abstinence. These patients were compared with 20 controls matched for age and gender. We observed in AD patients an increase in cortisol, leptin and PYY plasma levels and a decrease in ghrelin, which might explain the observed decrease in non-alcoholic intakes. However, alcoholic and non-alcoholic intakes correlated positively with basal metabolism and negatively with leptin and leptin/BMI. Conclusion For individuals consuming below12.5 kcal/kg/day of alcohol, alcohol intake is compensated for by a decrease in non-alcoholic nutrient intakes, probably due to changes in metabolic and satiety factors. For individuals consuming above 12.5 kcal/kg/day of alcohol, alcohol accelerates metabolism and decreases fat mass and leptin levels, and the total caloric intake largely exceeds norms. A dual model for regulation of energy intake in AD subjects is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1973432969,"Living muscle tissues and cells have been attracting attention as potential actuator candidates. In particular, insect dorsal vessel tissue (DVT) seems to be well suited for a bio-actuator since it is capable of contracting autonomously and the tissue itself and its cells are more environmentally robust under culturing conditions compared with mammalian tissues and cells. Here we demonstrate an autonomously moving polypod microrobot (PMR) powered by DVT excised from an inchworm. We fabricated a prototype of the PMR by assembling a whole DVT onto an inverted two-row micropillar array. The prototype moved autonomously at a velocity of 3.5×10−2 µm/s, and the contracting force of the whole DVT was calculated as 20 µN. Based on the results obtained by the prototype, we then designed and fabricated an actual PMR. We were able to increase the velocity significantly for the actual PMR which could move autonomously at a velocity of 3.5 µm/s. These results indicate that insect DVT has sufficient potential as the driving force for a bio-microrobot that can be utilized in microspaces."
https://openalex.org/W2046337039,"Detection of singlet oxygen emission, λmax = 1270 nm, following laser excitation and steady-state methods were employed to measure the total reaction rate constant, kT, and the reactive reaction rate constant, kr, for the reaction between singlet oxygen and several flavonoids. Values of kT determined in deuterated water, ranging from 2.4×107 M−1s−1 to 13.4×107 M−1s−1, for rutin and morin, respectively, and the values measured for kr, ranging from 2.8×105 M−1s−1 to 65.7×105 M−1s−1 for kaempferol and morin, respectively, being epicatechin and catechin chemically unreactive. These results indicate that all the studied flavonoids are good quenchers of singlet oxygen and could be valuable antioxidants in systems under oxidative stress, in particular if a flavonoid-rich diet was previously consumed. Analysis of the dependence of rate constant values with molecular structure in terms of global descriptors and condensed Fukui functions, resulting from electronic structure calculations, supports the formation of a charge transfer exciplex in all studied reactions. The fraction of exciplex giving reaction products evolves through a hydroperoxide and/or an endoperoxide intermediate produced by singlet oxygen attack on the double bond of the ring C of the flavonoid."
https://openalex.org/W2093842513,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is widely accepted as a cellular mechanism underlying memory processes. It is well established that LTP persistence is strongly dependent on activation of constitutive and inducible transcription factors, but there is limited information regarding the downstream gene networks and controlling elements that coalesce to stabilise LTP. To identify these gene networks, we used Affymetrix RAT230.2 microarrays to detect genes regulated 5 h and 24 h (n = 5) after LTP induction at perforant path synapses in the dentate gyrus of awake adult rats. The functional relationships of the differentially expressed genes were examined using DAVID and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and compared with our previous data derived 20 min post-LTP induction in vivo. This analysis showed that LTP-related genes are predominantly upregulated at 5 h but that there is pronounced downregulation of gene expression at 24 h after LTP induction. Analysis of the structure of the networks and canonical pathways predicted a regulation of calcium dynamics via G-protein coupled receptors, dendritogenesis and neurogenesis at the 5 h time-point. By 24 h neurotrophin-NFKB driven pathways of neuronal growth were identified. The temporal shift in gene expression appears to be mediated by regulation of protein synthesis, ubiquitination and time-dependent regulation of specific microRNA and histone deacetylase expression. Together this programme of genomic responses, marked by both homeostatic and growth pathways, is likely to be critical for the consolidation of LTP in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1982439661,"Gustatory stimuli can support both immediate reflexive behaviour, such as choice and feeding, and can drive internal reinforcement in associative learning. For larval Drosophila, we here provide a first systematic behavioural analysis of these functions with respect to quinine as a study case of a substance which humans report as ""tasting bitter"". We describe the dose-effect functions for these different kinds of behaviour and find that a half-maximal effect of quinine to suppress feeding needs substantially higher quinine concentrations (2.0 mM) than is the case for internal reinforcement (0.6 mM). Interestingly, in previous studies (Niewalda et al. 2008, Schipanski et al 2008) we had found the reverse for sodium chloride and fructose/sucrose, such that dose-effect functions for those tastants were shifted towards lower concentrations for feeding as compared to reinforcement, arguing that the differences in dose-effect function between these behaviours do not reflect artefacts of the types of assay used. The current results regarding quinine thus provide a starting point to investigate how the gustatory system is organized on the cellular and/or molecular level to result in different behavioural tuning curves towards a bitter tastant."
https://openalex.org/W2040654356,"Declines of large sharks and subsequent release of elasmobranch mesopredators (smaller sharks and rays) may pose problems for marine fisheries management as some mesopredators consume exploitable shellfish species. The spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) is the most abundant inshore elasmobranch in subtropical Bermuda, but its predatory role remains unexamined despite suspected abundance increases and its hypothesized specialization for mollusks. We utilized a combination of acoustic telemetry, benthic invertebrate sampling, gut content analysis and manipulative experiments to assess the impact of spotted eagle rays on Bermudian shellfish resources. Residency and distribution of adult spotted eagle rays was monitored over two consecutive summers in Harrington Sound (HS), an enclosed inshore lagoon that has historically supported multiple recreational and commercial shellfish species. Telemetered rays exhibited variable fidelity (depending on sex) to HS, though generally selected regions that supported relatively high densities of potential mollusk prey. Gut content analysis from rays collected in HS revealed a diet of mainly bivalves and a few gastropods, with calico clam (Macrocallista maculata) representing the most important prey item. Manipulative field and mesocosm experiments with calico clams suggested that rays selected prey patches based on density, though there was no evidence of rays depleting clam patches to extirpation. Overall, spotted eagle rays had modest impacts on local shellfish populations at current population levels, suggesting a reduced role in transmitting cascading effects from apex predator loss. However, due to the strong degree of coupling between rays and multiple protected mollusks in HS, ecosystem-based management that accounts for ray predation should be adopted."
https://openalex.org/W2022051519,"Transmission of prions to a new host is frequently accompanied by strain adaptation, a phenomenon that involves reduction of the incubation period, a change in neuropathological features and, sometimes, tissue tropism. Here we show that a strain of synthetic origin (SSLOW), although serially transmitted within the same species, displayed the key attributes of the strain adaptation process. At least four serial passages were required to stabilize the strain-specific SSLOW phenotype. The biological titration of SSLOW revealed a correlation between clinical signs and accumulation of PrP(Sc) in brains of animals inoculated with high doses (10(-1)-10(-5) diluted brain material), but dissociation between the two processes at low dose inocula (10(-6)-10(-8) diluted brain material). At low doses, several asymptomatic animals harbored large amounts of PrP(Sc) comparable with those seen in the brains of terminally ill animals, whereas one clinically ill animal had very little, if any, PrP(Sc). In summary, the current study illustrates that the phenomenon of prion strain adaptation is more common than generally thought and could be observed upon serial transmission without changing the host species. When PrP(Sc) is seeded by recombinant PrP structures different from that of authentic PrP(Sc), PrP(Sc) properties continued to evolve for as long as four serial passages."
https://openalex.org/W2083252086,"Prostate cancer is a very common cancer among males. Traditional treatments for prostate cancer have limited efficacy; therefore, new therapeutic strategies and/or new adjuvant drugs must be explored. Red yeast rice (RYR) is a traditional food spice made in Asia by fermenting white rice with Monascus purpureus Went yeast. Accumulating evidence indicates that RYR has antitumor activity. In this study, PC-3 cells (human prostate cancer cells) were used to investigate the anti-cancer effects of ionizing radiation (IR) combined with monascuspiloin (MP, a yellow pigment isolated from Monascus pilosus M93-fermented rice) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects in vitro and in vivo. We found that IR combined with MP showed increased therapeutic efficacy when compared with either treatment alone in PC-3 cells. In addition, the combined treatment enhanced DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined treatment induced primarily autophagy in PC-3 cells, and the cell death that was induced by the combined treatment was chiefly the result of inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. In an in vivo study, the combination treatment showed greater anti-tumor growth effects. These novel findings suggest that the combined treatment could be a potential therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer."

Methods Sensitivity and specificity of QFT and TST for diagnosing active TB as well as indeterminate QFT rates and IFN-γ levels were assessed in 211 TB suspect children in a Tanzanian district hospital and contrasted in 90 adults with confirmed pulmonary TB. Results Sensitivity of QFT and TST in children with confirmed TB was 19% (5/27) and 6% (2/31) respectively. In adults sensitivity of QFT and TST was 84% (73/87) and 85% (63/74). The QFT indeterminate rate in children and adults was 27% and 3%. Median levels of IFN-γ were lower in children than adults, particularly children <2 years and HIV infected. An indeterminate result was associated with age <2 years but not malnutrition or HIV status. Overall childhood mortality was 19% and associated with an indeterminate QFT result at baseline. Conclusion QFT and TST showed poor performance and a surprisingly low sensitivity in children. In contrast the performance in Tanzanian adults was good and comparable to performance in high-income countries. Indeterminate results in children were associated with young age and increased mortality. Neither test can be recommended for diagnosing active TB in children with immature or impaired immunity in a high-burden setting."
https://openalex.org/W2057758167,"Background Loss of gray matter has been previously found in early-onset schizophrenic patients. However, there are no consistent findings between studies due to different methods used to measure grey matter volume/density and influences of confounding factors. Methods The volume of gray matter (GM) was measured in 29 first episode early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 34 well-matched healthy controls by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The correlations between the GM volume and PANSS scores, age of psychosis onset, duration of psychosis, and chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalent value were investigated. Results Relative to healthy subjects, the patients with first episode EOS showed significantly lower GM volume in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus. The loss of GM volume negatively correlated with PANSS-positive symptoms (p = 0.002), but not with PANSS-negative symptoms, PANSS-general psychopathology, and PANSS-total score. No significant correlation was found between GM volume and age of psychosis onset, duration of psychosis, and CPZ equivalent value. Conclusion Patients with first episode EOS have evidence of reduced GM in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus. Structural abnormalities in the left middle and superior temporal gyrus may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2065324814,"CD163, a scavenger receptor that is expressed at high levels in the monocyte-macrophage system, is a critical factor for the efficient extracellular hemoglobin (Hb) clearance during hemolysis. Because of the enormous detrimental effect of liberated Hb on our body by its ability to induce pro-inflammatory signals and tissue damage, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with CD163 expression during the acute phase response is a central issue. We report here that α(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), an acute phase protein, the serum concentration of which is elevated under various inflammatory conditions, including hemolysis, up-regulates CD163 expression in both macrophage-like differentiated THP-1 (dTHP-1) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the subsequent induction of Hb uptake was also observed in AGP-treated dTHP-1 cells. Among representative acute phase proteins such as AGP, α(1)-antitrypsin, C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin, only AGP increased CD163 expression, suggesting that AGP plays a specific role in the regulation of CD163. Consistently, the physiological concentrations of AGP induced CD163, and the subsequent induction of Hb uptake as well as the reduction of oxidative stress in plasma were observed in phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic model mice, confirming the in vivo role of AGP. Finally, AGP signaling through the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and CD14, the common innate immune receptor complex that normally recognizes bacterial components, was identified as a crucial stimulus that induces the autocrine regulatory loops of IL-6 and/or IL-10 via NF-κB, p38, and JNK pathways, which leads to an enhancement in CD163 expression. These findings provide possible insights into how AGP exerts anti-inflammatory properties against hemolysis-induced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1989104144,"Background Modifications of adjuvants that induce cell-mediated over antibody-mediated immunity is desired for development of vaccines. Nanocapsules have been found to be viable adjuvants and are amenable to engineering for desired immune responses. We previously showed that natural nanocapsules called vaults can be genetically engineered to elicit Th1 immunity and protection from a mucosal bacterial infection. The purpose of our study was to characterize immunity produced in response to OVA within vault nanoparticles and compare it to another nanocarrier. Methodology and Principal Findings We characterized immunity resulting from immunization with the model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA) encased in vault nanocapsules and liposomes. We measured OVA responsive CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cell responses, cytokine production and antibody titers in vitro and in vivo. We found that immunization with OVA contain in vaults induced a greater number of anti-OVA CD8+ memory T cells and production of IFNγ plus CD4+ memory T cells. Also, modification of the vault body could change the immune response compared to OVA encased in liposomes. Conclusions/Significance These experiments show that vault nanocapsules induced strong anti-OVA CD8+ and CD4+ T cell memory responses and modest antibody production, which markedly differed from the immune response induced by liposomes. We also found that the vault nanocapsule could be modified to change antibody isotypes in vivo. Thus it is possible to create a vault nanocapsule vaccine that can result in the unique combination of immunogen-responsive CD8+ and CD4+ T cell immunity coupled with an IgG1 response for future development of vault nanocapsule-based vaccines against antigens for human pathogens and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2045572699,"The natural cytotoxicity receptors are a unique set of activating proteins expressed mainly on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. The human natural cytotoxicity receptor family comprises the three type I membrane proteins NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46. Especially NKp30 is critical for the cytotoxicity of NK cells against different targets including tumor, virus-infected, and immature dendritic cells. Although the crystal structure of NKp30 was recently solved (Li, Y., Wang, Q., and Mariuzza, R. A. (2011) J. Exp. Med. 208, 703-714; Joyce, M. G., Tran, P., Zhuravleva, M. A., Jaw, J., Colonna, M., and Sun, P. D. (2011) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 108, 6223-6228), a key question, how NKp30 recognizes several non-related ligands, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the parameters that impact ligand recognition of NKp30. Based on various NKp30-hIgG1-Fc fusion proteins, which were optimized for minimal background binding to cellular Fcγ receptors, we identified the flexible stalk region of NKp30 as an important but so far neglected module for ligand recognition and related signaling of the corresponding full-length receptor proteins. Moreover, we found that the ectodomain of NKp30 is N-linked glycosylated at three different sites. Mutational analyses revealed differential binding affinities and signaling capacities of mono-, di-, or triglycosylated NKp30, suggesting that the degree of glycosylation could provide a switch to modulate the ligand binding properties of NKp30 and NK cell cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2009049520,"Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important surface glycoprotein and plays a vital role in viral replication and drug development. The NA is found in influenza A and B viruses, with nine subtypes classified in influenza A. The complete knowledge of influenza NA evolutionary history and phylodynamics, although critical for the prevention and control of influenza epidemics and pandemics, remains lacking.Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of influenza NA sequences using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods demonstrated that the divergence of influenza viruses into types A and B occurred earlier than the divergence of influenza A NA subtypes. Twenty-three lineages were identified within influenza A, two lineages were classified within influenza B, and most lineages were specific to host, subtype or geographical location. Interestingly, evolutionary rates vary not only among lineages but also among branches within lineages. The estimated tMRCAs of influenza lineages suggest that the viruses of different lineages emerge several months or even years before their initial detection. The d(N)/d(S) ratios ranged from 0.062 to 0.313 for influenza A lineages, and 0.257 to 0.259 for influenza B lineages. Structural analyses revealed that all positively selected sites are at the surface of the NA protein, with a number of sites found to be important for host antibody and drug binding.The divergence into influenza type A and B from a putative ancestral NA was followed by the divergence of type A into nine NA subtypes, of which 23 lineages subsequently diverged. This study provides a better understanding of influenza NA lineages and their evolutionary dynamics, which may facilitate early detection of newly emerging influenza viruses and thus improve influenza surveillance."

To better understand how bats might respond to climate change, we aimed to obtain the first data on how use of torpor, a crucial survival strategy of small bats, is affected by temperature in the tropics. Over two mild winters, tropical free-ranging bats (Nyctophilus bifax, 10 g, n = 13) used torpor on 95% of study days and were torpid for 33.5±18.8% of 113 days measured. Torpor duration was temperature-dependent and an increase in ambient temperature by the predicted 2°C for the 21st century would decrease the time in torpor to 21.8%. However, comparisons among Nyctophilus populations show that regional phenotypic plasticity attenuates temperature effects on torpor patterns. Our data suggest that heterothermy is important for energy budgeting of bats even under warm conditions and that flexible torpor use will enhance bats’ chance of survival during climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1968336948,"Purpose Current physical activity recommendations assume that different activities can be exchanged to produce the same weight-control benefits so long as total energy expended remains the same (exchangeability premise). To this end, they recommend calculating energy expenditure as the product of the time spent performing each activity and the activity's metabolic equivalents (MET), which may be summed to achieve target levels. The validity of the exchangeability premise was assessed using data from the National Runners' Health Study. Methods Physical activity dose was compared to body mass index (BMI) and body circumferences in 33,374 runners who reported usual distance run and pace, and usual times spent running and other exercises per week. MET hours per day (METhr/d) from running was computed from: a) time and intensity, and b) reported distance run (1.02 MET•hours per km). Results When computed from time and intensity, the declines (slope±SE) per METhr/d were significantly greater (P<10−15) for running than non-running exercise for BMI (slopes±SE, male: −0.12±0.00 vs. 0.00±0.00; female: −0.12±0.00 vs. −0.01±0.01 kg/m2 per METhr/d) and waist circumference (male: −0.28±0.01 vs. −0.07±0.01; female: −0. 31±0.01 vs. −0.05±0.01 cm per METhr/d). Reported METhr/d of running was 38% to 43% greater when calculated from time and intensity than distance. Moreover, the declines per METhr/d run were significantly greater when estimated from reported distance for BMI (males: −0.29±0.01; females: −0.27±0.01 kg/m2 per METhr/d) and waist circumference (males: −0.67±0.02; females: −0.69±0.02 cm per METhr/d) than when computed from time and intensity (cited above). Conclusion The exchangeability premise was not supported for running vs. non-running exercise. Moreover, distance-based running prescriptions may provide better weight control than time-based prescriptions for running or other activities. Additional longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials are required to verify these results prospectively."
https://openalex.org/W1621305026,"The interaction between the transactivation domain of p53 (p53TAD) and the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and MDMX plays an essential role for cell function. Mutations in these proteins have been implicated in many forms of cancer. The intrinsically disordered p53TAD contains two subdomains, TAD1 and TAD2. Using NMR spectroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that TAD2 directly interacts with MDM2, adopting transient structures that bind to the same hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 as TAD1. Our data show that binding of TAD1 and TAD2 to MDM2 is competitive, which is further supported by the observation that the interaction of TAD2 with MDM2 can be blocked by the small molecule inhibitor nutlin-3. Our data further indicate that TAD2 interacts with MDMX in a fashion very similar to MDM2. Because TAD2 is known to have transcriptional activity, the interaction of TAD2 with MDM2/MDMX may play a direct role in the inhibition of p53 transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1997958675,"Filamins are important actin cross-linking proteins implicated in scaffolding, membrane stabilization and signal transduction, through interaction with ion channels, receptors and signaling proteins. Here we report the physical and functional interaction between filamins and polycystin-2, a TRP-type cation channel mutated in 10-15% patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that the C-termini of filamin isoforms A, B and C directly bind to both the intracellular N- and C-termini of polycystin-2. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that endogenous polycystin-2 and filamins are in the same complexes in renal epithelial cells and human melanoma A7 cells. We then examined the effect of filamin on polycystin-2 channel function by electrophysiology studies with a lipid bilayer reconstitution system and found that filamin-A substantially inhibits polycystin-2 channel activity. Our study indicates that filamins are important regulators of polycystin-2 channel function, and further links actin cytoskeletal dynamics to the regulation of this channel protein."
https://openalex.org/W1982615075,"Plant sucrose transporters (SUTs) are H+-coupled uptake transporters. Type I and II (SUTs) are phylogenetically related but have different substrate specificities. Type I SUTs transport sucrose, maltose, and a wide range of natural and synthetic α- and β-glucosides. Type II SUTs are more selective for sucrose and maltose. Here, we investigated the structural basis for this difference in substrate specificity. We used a novel gene shuffling method called synthetic template shuffling to introduce 62 differentially conserved amino acid residues from type I SUTs into OsSUT1, a type II SUT from rice. The OsSUT1 variants were tested for their ability to transport the fluorescent coumarin β-glucoside esculin when expressed in yeast. Fluorescent yeast cells were selected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Substitution of five amino acids present in type I SUTs in OsSUT1 was found to be sufficient to confer esculin uptake activity. The changes clustered in two areas of the OsSUT1 protein: in the first loop and the top of TMS2 (T80L and A86K) and in TMS5 (S220A, S221A, and T224Y). The substrate specificity of this OsSUT1 variant was almost identical to that of type I SUTs.

https://openalex.org/W2029139171,"Gentisate (2,5-dihydroxybenzoate) is a key ring-cleavage substrate involved in various aromatic compounds degradation. Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032 is capable of growing on gentisate and genK was proposed to encode a transporter involved in this utilization by its disruption in the restriction-deficient mutant RES167. Its biochemical characterization by uptake assay using [(14)C]-labeled gentisate has not been previously reported.In this study, biochemical characterization of GenK by uptake assays with [(14)C]-labeled substrates demonstrated that it specifically transported gentisate into the cells with V(max) and K(m) of 3.06 ± 0.16 nmol/min/mg of dry weight and 10.71 ± 0.11 µM respectively, and no activity was detected for either benzoate or 3-hydoxybenzoate. When GenK was absent in strain RES167 ΔgenK, it retained 85% of its original transport activity at pH 6.5 compared to that of strain RES167. However, it lost 79% and 88% activity at pH 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. A number of competing substrates, including 3-hydroxybenzoate, benzoate, protocatechuate and catechol, significantly inhibited gentisate uptake by more than 40%. Through site-directed mutagenesis, eight amino acid residues of GenK, Asp-54, Asp-57 and Arg-386 in the hydrophobic transmembrane regions and Arg-103, Trp-309, Asp-312, Arg-313 and Ile-317 in the hydrophilic cytoplasmic loops were shown to be important for gentisate transport. When conserved residues Asp-54 and Asp-57 respectively were changed to glutamate, both mutants retained approximately 50% activity and were able to partially complement the ability of strain RES167 ΔgenK to grow on gentisate.Our results demonstrate that GenK is an active gentisate transporter in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13032. The GenK-mediated gentisate transport was also shown to be a limiting step for the gentisate utilization by this strain. This enhances our understanding of gentisate transport in the microbial degradation of aromatic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2141856668,"Migratory birds are of particular interest for population genetics because of the high connectivity between habitats and populations. A high degree of connectivity requires using many genetic markers to achieve the required statistical power, and a genome wide SNP set can fit this purpose. Here we present the development of a genome wide SNP set for the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis, a model species for the study of bird migration. We used the genome of a different waterfowl species, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, as a reference to align Barnacle Goose second generation sequence reads from an RRL library and detected 2188 SNPs genome wide. Furthermore, we used chimeric flanking sequences, merged from both Mallard and Barnacle Goose DNA sequence information, to create primers for validation by genotyping. Validation with a 384 SNP genotyping set resulted in 374 (97%) successfully typed SNPs in the assay, of which 358 (96%) were polymorphic. Additionally, we validated our SNPs on relatively old (30 years) museum samples, which resulted in a success rate of at least 80%. This shows that museum samples could be used in standard SNP genotyping assays. Our study also shows that the genome of a related species can be used as reference to detect genome wide SNPs in birds, because genomes of birds are highly conserved. This is illustrated by the use of chimeric flanking sequences, which showed that the incorporation of flanking nucleotides from Mallard into Barnacle Goose sequences lead to equal genotyping performance when compared to flanking sequences solely composed of Barnacle Goose sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2065572625,"A subset of medulloblastomas, the most common brain tumor in children, is hypothesized to originate from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) in which the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway is over-activated. MXD3, a basic helix-look-helix zipper transcription factor of the MAD family, has been reported to be upregulated during postnatal cerebellar development and to promote GNP proliferation and MYCN expression. Mxd3 is upregulated in mouse models of medulloblastoma as well as in human medulloblastomas. Therefore, we hypothesize that MXD3 plays a role in the cellular events that lead to medulloblastoma biogenesis. In agreement with its proliferative role in GNPs, MXD3 knock-down in DAOY cells resulted in decreased proliferation. Sustained overexpression of MXD3 resulted in decreased cell numbers due to increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Structure-function analysis revealed that the Sin3 interacting domain, the basic domain, and binding to E-boxes are essential for this activity. Microarray-based expression analysis indicated up-regulation of 84 genes and down-regulation of 47 genes. Potential direct MXD3 target genes were identified by ChIP-chip. Our results suggest that MXD3 is necessary for DAOY medulloblastoma cell proliferation. However, increased level and/or duration of MXD3 expression ultimately reduces cell numbers via increased cell death and cell cycle arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2079764850,"Rnd proteins are Rho family GTP-binding proteins with cellular functions that antagonize RhoA signaling. We recently described a new Rnd3 effector Syx, also named PLEKHG5, that interacts with Rnds via a Raf1-like “Ras-binding domain.” Syx is a multidomain RhoGEF that participates in early zebrafish development. Here we demonstrated that Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3 stability is acutely dependent on interaction with their effectors such as Syx or p190 RhoGAP. Although Rnd3 turnover is blocked by treatment of cells with MG132, we provide evidence that such turnover is mediated indirectly by effects on the Rnd3 effectors, rather than on Rnd3 itself, which is not significantly ubiquitinated. The minimal regions of Syx and p190 RhoGAP that bind Rnd3 are not sequence-related but have similar effects. We have identified features that allow for Rnd3 turnover including a conserved Lys-45 close to the switch I region and the C-terminal membrane-binding domain of Rnd3, which cannot be substituted by the equivalent Cdc42 CAAX sequence. By contrast, an effector binding-defective mutant of Rnd3 when overexpressed undergoes turnover at normal rates. Interestingly the activity of the RhoA-regulated kinase ROCK stimulates Rnd3 turnover. This study suggests that Rnd proteins are regulated through feedback mechanisms in cells where the level of effectors and RhoA activity influence the stability of Rnd proteins.

Despite its known importance in different cellular processes, the role of PAR-1 in neuronal morphogenesis is less well understood. In particular, its role in the morphogenesis of dendritic spines, which are sites of excitatory synaptic inputs, has been unclear. Here, we show that PAR-1 is required for normal spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons. We further show that PAR-1 functions through phosphorylating the synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 in this process. Phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue in the KXGS motif in PSD-95 regulates spine morphogenesis, and a phosphomimetic mutant of this site can rescue the defects of kinase-dead PAR-1. Together, our findings uncover a role of PAR-1 in spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons through phosphorylating PSD-95."

The role of infection with plasmodia on these hematological parameters in PLWHA is not well known. In this study we compared selected hematological parameters between malaria positive and negative PLWHA. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of PLWHA attending the Douala Laquintinie hospital. After obtaining consent, demographic and clinical data were obtained via a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples collected for hematological assays were run using an automated full blood counter. Malaria parasitaemia was determined by blood smear microscopy. Results A total of 238 adult PLWHA were enrolled, 48.3% of who were on antiretroviral therapy and 24.8% of whom had malaria parasitaemia. The respective mean (±SD) of hemoglobin level, RBC count, WBC count, platelet count, lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cell counts in malaria co-infected patients versus non-infected patients were: 10.8(±1.9) g/dl versus 11.4(±2.0)g/dl; 3,745,254(±793,353) cells/µl versus 3,888,966(±648,195) cells/µl; 4,403(±1,534) cells/µl versus 4,920(±1,922) cells/µl; 216,051(±93,884) cells/µl versus 226,792(±98,664) cells/µl; 1,846(±711) cells/µl versus 2,052(±845) cells/µl and 245(±195) cells/µl versus 301(±211) cells/µl. All these means were not statistically significantly different from each other. Conclusion There was no significant difference in studied hematological parameters between malaria positive and negative PLWHA. These data suggest little or no impact of malaria infection. Hematological anomalies in PLWHA in this area need not be necessarily attributed to malaria. These need to be further investigated to identify and treat other potential causes."

Clinical laboratory process variability was examined using whole blood controls across a 24 month period: Intra-batch variability was assessed using sample replicates; inter-batch variability examined as a function of laboratory personnel, equipment, and reagent lots. Methods/Results To assess intra-batch variability, five batches of 132 whole blood controls were processed; inter-batch variability was estimated using 895 whole blood control samples. ANOVA was used to examine inter-batch variability at 4 process steps: RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cDNA addition to assay plates, and qRT-PCR. Operator, machine, and reagent lots were assessed as variables for all stages if possible, for a total of 11 variables. Intra- and inter-batch variations were estimated to be 0.092 and 0.059 Cp units respectively (SD); total laboratory variation was estimated to be 0.11 Cp units (SD). In a regression model including all 11 laboratory variables, assay plate lot and cDNA kit lot contributed the most to variability (p = 0.045; 0.009 respectively). Overall, reagent lots for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and qRT-PCR contributed the most to inter-batch variance (52.3%), followed by operators and machines (18.9% and 9.2% respectively), leaving 19.6% of the variance unexplained. Conclusion Intra-batch variability inherent to the PCR process contributed the most to the overall variability in the study while reagent lot showed the largest contribution to inter-batch variability."
https://openalex.org/W1554908768,"Full understanding of the biological significance of negative feedback processes requires interrogation at multiple scales as follows: in single cells, cell populations, and live animals in vivo. The transcriptionally coupled IκBα/NF-κB negative feedback loop, a pivotal regulatory node of innate immunity and inflammation, represents a model system for multiscalar reporters. Using a κB(5)→IκBα-FLuc bioluminescent reporter, we rigorously evaluated the dynamics of ΙκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB transcriptional activity in response to diverse modes of TNFα stimulation. Modulating TNFα concentration or pulse duration yielded complex, reproducible, and differential ΙκBα dynamics in both cell populations and live single cells. Tremendous heterogeneity in the transcriptional amplitudes of individual responding cells was observed, which was greater than the heterogeneity in the transcriptional kinetics of responsive cells. Furthermore, administration of various TNFα doses in vivo generated ΙκBα dynamic profiles in the liver resembling those observed in single cells and populations of cells stimulated with TNFα pulses. This suggested that dose modulation of circulating TNFα was perceived by hepatocytes in vivo as pulses of increasing duration. Thus, a robust bioluminescent reporter strategy enabled rigorous quantitation of NF-κB/ΙκBα dynamics in both live single cells and cell populations and furthermore, revealed reproducible behaviors that informed interpretation of in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W2088834051,"Certain concepts concerning EPO/EPOR action modes have been challenged by in vivo studies: Bcl-x levels are elevated in maturing erythroblasts, but not in their progenitors; truncated EPOR alleles that lack a major p85/PI3K recruitment site nonetheless promote polycythemia; and Erk1 disruption unexpectedly bolsters erythropoiesis. To discover novel EPO/EPOR action routes, global transcriptome analyses presently are applied to interrogate EPO/EPOR effects on primary bone marrow-derived CFUe-like progenitors. Overall, 160 EPO/EPOR target transcripts were significantly modulated 2-to 21.8-fold. A unique set of EPO-regulated survival factors included Lyl1, Gas5, Pim3, Pim1, Bim, Trib3 and Serpina 3g. EPO/EPOR-modulated cell cycle mediators included Cdc25a, Btg3, Cyclin-d2, p27-kip1, Cyclin-g2 and CyclinB1-IP-1. EPO regulation of signal transduction factors was also interestingly complex. For example, not only Socs3 plus Socs2 but also Spred2, Spred1 and Eaf1 were EPO-induced as negative-feedback components. Socs2, plus five additional targets, further proved to comprise new EPOR/Jak2/Stat5 response genes (which are important for erythropoiesis during anemia). Among receptors, an atypical TNF-receptor Tnfr-sf13c was up-modulated >5-fold by EPO. Functionally, Tnfr-sf13c ligation proved to both promote proerythroblast survival, and substantially enhance erythroblast formation. The EPOR therefore engages a sophisticated set of transcriptome response circuits, with Tnfr-sf13c deployed as one novel positive regulator of proerythroblast formation."
https://openalex.org/W1974469106,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) Shp2 has been implicated in many immunoreceptor signaling pathways, but its role in immunoreceptor FcεRI signaling, which leads to the activation of mast cells and blood basophils, is still largely undefined. Using Shp2 knockdown RBL-2H3 (RBL) mast cells, we here reported that Shp2 is required for the activation of RBL cells induced by FcεRI. FcεRΙ-evoked degranulation, calcium mobilization, and synthesis of cytokine transcripts (IL-1β, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1)) were reduced in Shp2 knockdown RBL cells. Signaling regulatory mechanism investigation using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assay reveals that the down-regulation of Shp2 expression in RBL cells leads to decreased activities of Fyn, PLCγ, JNK, p38MAPK, and Ras/Erk1/2 after FcεRΙ aggregation. Further studies suggest that Paxillin phosphoryaltion was also impaired, but PAG phosphorylation was normal after FcεRΙ stimulation as a consequence of the inhibition of Shp2 expression in RBL cells. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that Shp2 is essential for the activation of RBL cells in response to FcεRΙ aggregation. Shp2 regulates this process through Fyn and Ras with no involvement of PAG. In addition, we identify Paxillin as an indirect substrate of Shp2 in FcεRΙ-initiated signaling of RBL cells."

Tumour genotyping for integrins (ITGA and ITGV) was also performed according to our previous findings. Genotyping for VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR-1,2,3 and ITGA and ITGV was carried out on pT4a radically resected gastric tumours recurring with either peritoneal-only carcinosis or hematogenous metastases. 101 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 57 with peritoneal carcinomatosis only and 44 with hematogenous spread only. At multivariate analysis, intestinal histology and the AC genotype of rs699947 (VEGFA) showed to independently correlate with hematogenous metastases (p = 0.0008 and 0.008 respectively), whereas diffuse histology and the AA genotype of rs2269772 (ITGA) independently correlated with peritoneal-only diffusion (p = <0.0001 and 0.03 respectively). Our results seem to indicate that combining information from genotyping of rs699947 (VEGFA, AC), rs2269772 (ITGA, AA) and tumour histology could allow clinicians to individuate gastric cancer at high risk for recurrence either with peritoneal or hematogenous metastases. The selection tool deriving from this analysis may allow an optimal use of the available treatment strategies in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2095145041,"Cat-1/Git-1 is a multifunctional protein that acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Arf GTPases, as well as serves as a scaffold for a number of different signaling proteins. Cat-1 is best known for its role in regulating cell shape and promoting cell migration. However, whether Cat-1 might also contribute to cellular transformation is currently unknown. Here we show that ∼95% of cervical tumor samples examined overexpress Cat-1, suggesting that the up-regulation of Cat-1 expression is a frequent occurrence in this type of cancer. We demonstrate further that knocking down Cat-1 from NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing an activated form of Cdc42 (Cdc42 F28L), or from the human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell line, inhibits the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar, an in vitro measure of tumorgenicity. The requirement for Cat-1 when assaying the anchorage-independent growth of transformed fibroblasts and HeLa cells is dependent on its ability to bind paxillin, while being negatively impacted by its Arf-GAP activity. Moreover, the co-expression of Cat-1 and an activated form of Arf6 in fibroblasts was sufficient to induce their transformation. These findings highlight novel roles for Cat-1 and its interactions with the Arf GTPases and paxillin in oncogenic transformation.

These proteins were discovered more than a decade ago through three independent lines of investigation. In one such study performed by our laboratory (1Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M.

This occurred as part of a larger effort aimed at identifying proteins that could regulate the activity of the p21-activated kinases (Paks), which serve as effectors of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac (1Bagrodia S.

Cool-associated tyrosine phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptor kinase interactor paxillin kinase linker ADP-ribosylation factor cloned-out-of-library-1 p21-activated kinase Pak-interacting exchange factor GTPase-activating protein. In a second line of investigation, Git-1 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for members of a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, collectively referred to as G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, that phosphorylate activated G-protein-coupled receptors (6Premont R.T.

This interaction was suggested to contribute to the desensitization and Arf-mediated internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors, through the ability of Git-1 to inactivate Arf GTPases by virtue of its Arf-GAP activity (6Premont R.T.

PKL was identified in yet another screen as a binding partner for paxillin, a scaffold protein that plays an important role in regulating the formation of focal adhesions (9Turner C.E. Brown M.C.

These dynamic cellular structures are composed of various proteins, including integrins, that physically attach cells to their extracellular matrix, as well as mediate signaling events that are triggered by cellular interactions with the extracellular environment. With the goal of better understanding the proteins that interact with paxillin to regulate focal complex dynamics, PKL was identified as a paxillin-binding partner via pulldown assays where the LD4 motif of paxillin was used as bait. It was subsequently shown that PKL was responsible for mediating an interaction that occurred between paxillin and Pak, an important step in focal complex regulation (4Brown M.C. West K.A.

Since the Cat/Git/PKL proteins (from here on collectively referred to as Cat) are able to interact with a variety of signaling proteins, they have the potential to influence several different cellular functions. Indeed, Cat-1 has recently been implicated in stimulating neuronal synaptic activity (11Saneyoshi T. Wayman G. Fortin D. Davare M. Hoshi N. Nozaki N. Natsume T. Soderling T.R.

The involvement of Cat in cell migration has stemmed largely from findings demonstrating that its overexpression in fibroblasts leads to the loss of focal complexes (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Coupling of Pak-interacting exchange factor Pix to Git1 promotes focal complex disassembly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory has shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cool-1, regulates the interaction between Cat-1 and paxillin (20Feng Q. Baird D. Yoo S. Antonyak M. Cerione R.A. Phosphorylation of the Cool-1/β-Pix protein serves as a regulatory signal for the migration and invasive activity of Src-transformed cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18806-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This, in turn, drives focal complex assembly and disassembly in Src-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts, thus leading to the enhanced migration and invasive activity exhibited by these cells. Cat was also shown to regulate the spreading of cells by helping recruit Pak or ERK to sites of adhesion via its interaction with paxillin (10West K.A. Zhang H. Brown M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. Riedy M.C. Horwitz A.F. Turner C.E. The LD4 motif of paxillin regulates cell spreading and motility through an interaction with paxillin kinase linker (PKL).J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Cool-1, and MEK (21Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27705-27712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, through its ability to function as a GAP and inactivate the small GTPase Arf6, Cat influences lipid trafficking, an outcome that also has important consequences in cell spreading (23Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. p95-APP1 links membrane transport to Rac-mediated reorganization of actin.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although Cat-1 has been implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes and outcomes, an interesting question concerns whether it might contribute to cancer progression and the aberrant growth exhibited by transformed cells. Here we show that this is indeed the case. We first demonstrate that knocking down Cat-1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing an oncogenic form of Cdc42, Cdc42 F28L, blocks their ability to exhibit anchorage-independent growth. We then show that Cat-1 is overexpressed in a majority of human cervical carcinoma tumors and that knocking down Cat-1 in a cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa) blocks the transformed phenotypes exhibited by these cells. We demonstrate further that the ability of Cat-1 to function as an Arf-GAP, as well as to interact with paxillin, has important consequences for cellular transformation. Moreover, the ectopic co-expression of Cat-1, with an activated form of Arf6, is sufficient to induce cellular transformation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Collectively, our findings point to an interesting and previously unappreciated role for Cat-1 in transformation and cancer progression. The Cat-1, Arf1, and Arf6 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The V5 antibody was from Invitrogen, the HA antibody was obtained from Covance, whereas the actin antibody was from Sigma. The human Cat-1 cDNA and the human Arf1 and Arf6 cDNAs were cloned into the lentiviral vector pCDH-CMV-MOS-EF1-Puro (System BioSciences, Mountain View, CA). The QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate point mutants of Cat-1 that are defective in binding Cool-1 (D294K/E295R) (24Loo T.H. Ng Y.W. Lim L. Manser E.

The various Cat-1, Arf1, and Arf6 constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The mature lentiviruses shed into the culturing media from the transfectants were collected and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (System BioSciences). HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Parental NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a dominant active form of Cdc42 (Cdc42 F28L) or Ras (Ras G12V) were grown in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. The siRNAs were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine 2000, whereas the wild-type and mutant constructs of Cat-1, Arf1, and Arf6 were introduced into cells via lentiviral infection. HeLa cells and NIH3T3 cells stably expressing V5-tagged pCDH vector alone or various forms of V5-Cat-1, Arf1, and Arf6 were selected for and maintained by supplementing the appropriate growth medium with 0.175 μg/ml puromycin for HeLa cells and 2 μg/ml puromycin for NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42 F28L. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 1 mm aprotinin). The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies diluted in 20 mm Tris, 135 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by exposure to ECL reagent. HeLa cells, parental NIH3T3 cells, or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Cdc42 F28L or Ras G12V transfected with various siRNAs or expression plasmids as indicated, were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/ml in medium containing 0.3% agarose onto underlays composed of growth medium containing 0.6% agarose in 6-well dishes. The cultures were fed once a week, and after 14 days, the colonies were counted. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the N-terminal portion of Golgi-associated, γ adaptin ear-containing, Arf-binding protein 3 prebound to a glutathione resin was purchased from Pierce. The activity assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human cervical carcinoma tissue array composed of normal cervical tissue and cervical tumor samples (U. S. Biomax, Inc., Rockville, MD) was deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using different concentrations of alcohol. The antigens were retrieved by heating the tissues in a sodium citrate buffer. After cooling, the tissues were blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, an avidin/biotin blocking solution (Vector Laboratories), and finally with horse serum (Vector Laboratories). The slides were then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the Cat-1 antibody overnight. The primary antibody was then detected with the ABC staining kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's manual. The resulting Cat-1 staining was analyzed with ImageJ. To determine whether Cat-1 might contribute to oncogenic transformation, we examined whether it was required for the anchorage-independent growth exhibited by NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing an oncogenic form of Cdc42, Cdc42 F28L (29Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. A novel Cdc42Hs mutant induces cellular transformation.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We began with Cdc42-transformed cells, because we had earlier shown that Cool-1, a known Cat-1-binding partner, was essential for their transformation (31Wu W.J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Activated Cdc42 sequesters c-Cbl and prevents EGF receptor degradation.Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 32Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings (29Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. A novel Cdc42Hs mutant induces cellular transformation.Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Tu S.S. Wu W.J. Yang W. Nolbant P. Hahn K. Cerione R.A. Antiapoptotic Cdc42 mutants are potent activators of cellular transformation.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12350-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the Cdc42 F28L mutant were capable of forming colonies in soft agar (Fig. 1A, control siRNA). However, when Cat-1 expression was reduced in cells by at least 70% upon the introduction of either of two different Cat-1-specific siRNAs, there was a corresponding reduction in the number of colonies that was formed (Fig. 1, A and B). We have tried similar knockdown experiments in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing an oncogenic form of Ras (Ras G12V), although in these cases it has been difficult to achieve an equivalent reduction in Cat-1 expression. Nevertheless, we have found that under the conditions where we obtained a 40–60% knockdown of Cat-1 expression, there was little effect on the ability of these cells to form colonies (Fig. 1, C and D). This may suggest that Cat-1 is less important for the transforming actions of oncogenic Ras. We next examined Cat-1 expression levels in a variety of different human cancer cell lines. Cat-1 is more highly expressed in different cancer cell lines, as well as in NIH3T3 cells transformed by the Cdc42 F28L mutant, or by oncogenic v-Src, compared with its expression in either normal NIH3T3 cells or the human fibroblast cell line Detroit 551 (Fig. 2). Because HeLa cells express relatively high levels of Cat-1, we then asked whether it was overexpressed in cervical cancers. A human tissue array consisting of 20 normal cervical tissues, together with 80 cases of primary cervical carcinomas, was subjected to immunohistochemical analysis. Fig. 3A shows that Cat-1 can be detected in the normal cervical tissues but at relatively low levels. However, the Cat-1 levels detected in nearly all of the cervical tumors were increased compared with their normal tissue counterparts. In fact, >95% of the tumors were found to significantly overexpress Cat-1 (Fig. 3B). It is also worth noting that a correlation exists between tumor grade and the highest levels of Cat-1 expression (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Cat-1 expression is frequently enhanced in human cervical cancers. A, human cervical carcinoma tissue array consisting of 80 tumor samples and 20 normal tissues was subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using a Cat-1 antibody. B, the staining obtained with the Cat-1 antibody for each sample in the array was quantified using ImageJ and then plotted based on its relative expression of Cat-1. Each light colored square represents normal cervical tissue sample, whereas each dark diamond represents an individual cervical cancer case. C, the relative Cat-1 expression levels in the normal tissue and tumor samples were plotted based on tumor grade (from grade 1 to grade 3, as well as tumor samples whose grade was not available (N.D.)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked whether the increased levels of Cat-1 observed in the cervical tumors were important for their oncogenic phenotypes by taking advantage of our finding that the human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, expresses relatively high levels of Cat-1 (Fig. 2). Either control siRNA or two different Cat-1-specific siRNAs were introduced into HeLa cells, and then the abilities of the cells to grow under anchorage-independent conditions were compared. Fig. 4A shows that the Cat-1 siRNAs were effective at knocking-down Cat-1 in these cells, reducing its expression by ∼90%. The ability of the HeLa cells depleted of Cat-1 to form colonies in soft agar was significantly impaired compared with the control siRNA-treated cells, with at least 3-fold fewer colonies being formed by cells transfected with either of the Cat-1 siRNAs (Fig. 4B). To rule out off-target effects of the Cat-1 siRNAs, a rescue experiment was performed where we attempted to restore the ability of HeLa cells transfected with a Cat-1 siRNA to exhibit anchorage-independent growth by reintroducing a V5-tagged, siRNA-insensitive form of Cat-1 via lentivirus infection. Fig. 5A shows that following the introduction of this Cat-1 construct into HeLa cells depleted of endogenous Cat-1 (using Cat-1 siRNA 1), the expression of the V5-tagged Cat-1 was comparable with the endogenous levels of Cat-1 detected in the control HeLa cells (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 3). As anticipated, restoring Cat-1 expression in these cells completely rescued the growth-inhibitory effects caused by the siRNA-targeted knock-downs (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Reintroducing Cat-1 in Cat-knockdown HeLa cells restores their transforming ability. HeLa cells stably expressing either the vector alone or an siRNA-insensitive form of wild-type Cat-1 were generated. Two sets of the vector alone-expressing cells were transfected with either control siRNA or Cat-1 siRNA and serve as the positive and negative controls in these experiments. The HeLa cells expressing the siRNA-insensitive Cat-1 WT were also transfected with the Cat-1 siRNA. A, one set of cells was lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Cat-1 and actin antibodies. B, the second set of cells was subjected to soft-agar analysis, and the resulting colonies that formed were counted. The experiments were performed three times, and the results from each experiment were averaged together and graphed. The histograms show mean ± S.D. Student's t tests between indicated populations are *, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Fig"

Thus, the search for key molecules involved in the mosquito survival represents today a promising vector control strategy. High Mobility Group Box (HMGB) proteins are essential nuclear factors that maintain the high-order structure of chromatin, keeping eukaryotic cells viable. Outside the nucleus, secreted HMGB proteins could alert the innate immune system to foreign antigens and trigger the initiation of host defenses. In this work, we cloned and functionally characterized the HMGB1 protein from Aedes aegypti (AaHMGB1). The AaHMGB1 protein typically consists of two HMG-box DNA binding domains and an acidic C-terminus. Interestingly, AaHMGB1 contains a unique alanine/glutamine-rich (AQ-rich) C-terminal region that seems to be exclusive of dipteran HMGB proteins. AaHMGB1 is localized to the cell nucleus, mainly associated with heterochromatin. Circular dichroism analyses of AaHMGB1 or the C-terminal truncated proteins revealed α-helical structures. We showed that AaHMGB1 can effectively bind and change the topology of DNA, and that the AQ-rich and the C-terminal acidic regions can modulate its ability to promote DNA supercoiling, as well as its preference to bind supercoiled DNA. AaHMGB1 is phosphorylated by PKA and PKC, but not by CK2. Importantly, phosphorylation of AaHMGB1 by PKA or PKC completely abolishes its DNA bending activity. Thus, our study shows that a functional HMGB1 protein occurs in Aedes aegypt and we provide the first description of a HMGB1 protein containing an AQ-rich regulatory C-terminus."

EETs exert anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effect of EETs on humoral immunity is poorly understood. The present study is to investigate the potential role of EETs on B cell function and mechanisms. We examined the role of EETs on antibody production of splenic B cells from C57BL/6 and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice by means of ELISA. Of the 4 EET regioisomers, 8,9-EET decreased basal and activation-induced B cell antibody secretion. As well, 8,9-EET significantly inhibited B-cell proliferation and survival, plasma cell differentiation and class-switch recombination. Western blot analysis revealed that lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB could be attenuated by 8,9-EET. Furthermore, germinal center formation was impaired by 8,9-EET in mice in vivo. 8,9-EET may inhibit B-cell function in vitro and in vivo, which suggests a new therapeutic strategy for diseases with excess B cell activation."

HLA-B27 are the most studied HLA-class I molecules due to their association with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Chimeric proteins driven by TAT of HIV have been exploited by us to deliver viral epitopes, whose cross-presentation by the HLA-B27 molecules was proteasome and TAP-independent and not restricted to Antigen-Presenting Cells (APC). Here, using these chimeric proteins as epitope suppliers, we compared with each other and with the HLA-A2 molecules, the two HLA-B*2705 and B*2709 alleles differing at residue 116 (D116H) and differentially associated with AS. We found that the antigen presentation by the two HLA-B27 molecules was proteasome-, TAP-, and APC-independent whereas the presentation by the HLA-A2 molecules required proteasome, TAP and professional APC. Assuming that such difference could be due to the unpaired, highly reactive Cys-67 distinguishing the HLA-B27 molecules, C67S mutants in HLA-B*2705 and B*2709 and V67C mutant in HLA-A*0201 were also analyzed. The results showed that this mutation did not influence the HLA-A2-restricted antigen presentation while it drastically affected the HLA-B27-restricted presentation with, however, remarkable differences between B*2705 and B*2709. The data, together with the occurrence on the cell surface of unfolded molecules in the case of C67S-B*2705 mutant but not in that of C67S-B*2709 mutant, indicates that Cys-67 has a more critical role in stabilizing the B*2705 rather than the B*2709 complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2091016761,"Elucidation of the mechanisms of stem cell differentiation is of great scientific interest. Increasing evidence suggests that stem cell differentiation involves changes at multiple levels of biological regulation, which together orchestrate the complex differentiation process; many related studies have been performed to investigate the various levels of regulation. The resulting valuable data, however, remain scattered. Most of the current stem cell-relevant databases focus on a single level of regulation (mRNA expression) from limited stem cell types; thus, a unifying resource would be of great value to compile the multiple levels of research data available. Here we present a database for this purpose, SyStemCell, deposited with multi-level experimental data from stem cell research. The database currently covers seven levels of stem cell differentiation-associated regulatory mechanisms, including DNA CpG 5-hydroxymethylcytosine/methylation, histone modification, transcript products, microRNA-based regulation, protein products, phosphorylation proteins and transcription factor regulation, all of which have been curated from 285 peer-reviewed publications selected from PubMed. The database contains 43,434 genes, recorded as 942,221 gene entries, for four organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Macaca mulatta) and various stem cell sources (e.g., embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells). Data in SyStemCell can be queried by Entrez gene ID, symbol, alias, or browsed by specific stem cell type at each level of genetic regulation. An online analysis tool is integrated to assist researchers to mine potential relationships among different regulations, and the potential usage of the database is demonstrated by three case studies. SyStemCell is the first database to bridge multi-level experimental information of stem cell studies, which can become an important reference resource for stem cell researchers. The database is available at http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/SyStemCell/."
https://openalex.org/W2047608335,"CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) do not only influence self-antigen specific immune responses, but also dampen the protective effect induced by a number of vaccines. The impact of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs on vaccines against schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that is a major public health concern, however, has not been examined. In this study, a DNA vaccine encoding a 26 kDa glutathione S-transferase of Schistosoma japonicum (pVAX1-Sj26GST) was constructed and its potential effects were evaluated by depleting CD25(+) cells prior to pVAX1-Sj26GST immunization. This work shows that removal of CD25(+) cells prior to immunization with the pVAX1-Sj26GST schistosomiasis DNA vaccine significantly increases the proliferation of splenocytes and IgG levels. However, CD25(+) cell-depleted mice immunized with pVAX1-Sj26GST show no improved protection against S. japonicum. Furthermore, depletion of CD25(+) cells causes an increase in both pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFN-γ, GM-CSF and IL-4) and an anti-inflammatory cytokine (e.g. IL-10), with CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells being one of the major sources of both IFN-γ and IL-10. These findings indicate that partial CD25(+) cell depletion fails to enhance the effectiveness of the schistosome vaccine, possibly due to IL-10 production by CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells, or other cell types, after CD25(+) cell depletion during vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2084443000,"Background Cytometry of asynchronous proliferating cell populations produces data with an extractable time-based feature embedded in the frequency of clustered, correlated events. Here, we present a specific case of general methodology for calculating dynamic expression profiles of epitopes that oscillate during the cell cycle and conversion of these values to the same scale. Methods Samples of K562 cells from one population were labeled by direct and indirect antibody methods for cyclins A2 and B1 and phospho-S10-histone H3. The same indirect antibody was used for both cyclins. Directly stained samples were counter-stained with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and indirectly stained samples with propidium to label DNA. The S phase cyclin expressions from indirect assays were used to scale the expression of the cyclins of the multi-variate direct assay. Boolean gating and two dimensional, sequential regions set on bivariate displays of the directly conjugated sample data were used to untangle and isolate unique, unambiguous expression values of the cyclins along the four-dimensional data path through the cell cycle. The median values of cyclins A2 and B1 from each region were correlated with the frequency of events within each region. Results The sequential runs of data were plotted as continuous multi-line linear equations of the form y = [(yi+1−yi)/(xi+1−xi)]x + yi−[(yi+1−yi)/(xi+1−xi)]xi (line between points (xi,yi) and (xi+1, yi+1)) to capture the dynamic expression profile of the two cyclins. Conclusions This specific approach demonstrates the general methodology and provides a rule set from which the cell cycle expression of any other epitopes could be measured and calculated. These expression profiles are the “state variable” outputs, useful for calibrating mathematical cell cycle models."
https://openalex.org/W2078210753,"One difficulty in conducting biologically meaningful dynamic analysis at the systems biology level is that in vivo system regulation is complex. Meanwhile, many kinetic rates are unknown, making global system analysis intractable in practice. In this article, we demonstrate a computational pipeline to help solve this problem, using the exocytotic process as an example. Exocytosis is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells that allows communication in cells through vesicles that contain a wide range of intracellular molecules. During this process a set of proteins called SNAREs acts as an engine in this vesicle-membrane fusion, by forming four-helical bundle complex between (membrane) target-specific and vesicle-specific SNAREs. As expected, the regulatory network for exocytosis is very complex. Based on the current understanding of the protein-protein interaction network related to exocytosis, we mathematically formulated the whole system, by the ordinary differential equations (ODE). We then applied a mathematical approach (called inverse problem) to estimating the kinetic parameters in the fundamental subsystem (without regulation) from limited in vitro experimental data, which fit well with the reports by the conventional assay. These estimates allowed us to conduct an efficient stability analysis under a specified parameter space for the exocytotic process with or without regulation. Finally, we discuss the potential of this approach to explain experimental observations and to make testable hypotheses for further experimentation."
