https://openalex.org/W2983576677,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect humans and multiple other animal species, causing highly prevalent and severe diseases. 3C-like proteases (3CLpros) from CoVs (also called main proteases) are essential for viral replication and are also involved in polyprotein cleavage and immune regulation, making them attractive and effective targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Herein, the 3CLpro from the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, an enteropathogenic CoV, was used as a model to identify novel crucial residues for enzyme activity. First, we established a rapid, sensitive, and efficient luciferase-based biosensor to monitor the activity of PDEV 3CLproin vivo. Using this luciferase biosensor, along with confirming the well-known catalytic residues (His41 and Cys144), we identified 4 novel proteolytically inactivated mutants of PDEV 3CLpro, which was also confirmed in mammalian cells by biochemical experiments. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the hydrogen bonding interactions occurring within and outside of the protease's active site and the dynamic fluctuations of the substrate, especially the van der Waals contacts, were drastically altered, a situation related to the loss of 3CLpro activity. These data suggest that changing the intermolecular dynamics in protein-substrate complexes eliminates the mechanism underlying the protease activity. The discovery of novel crucial residues for enzyme activity in the binding pocket could potentially provide more druggable sites for the design of protease inhibitors. In addition, our in-depth study of the dynamic substrate's envelope model using MD simulations is an approach that could augment the discovery of new inhibitors against 3CLpro in CoVs and other viral 3C proteases.-Zhou, J., Fang, L., Yang, Z., Xu, S., Lv, M., Sun, Z., Chen, J., Wang, D., Gao, J., Xiao, S.

https://openalex.org/W2985317947,"Metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) is a conserved metal-binding transcription factor in eukaryotes that binds to conserved DNA sequence motifs, termed metal response elements. MTF1 responds to both metal excess and deprivation, protects cells from oxidative and hypoxic stresses, and is required for embryonic development in vertebrates. To examine the role for MTF1 in cell differentiation, we use multiple experimental strategies [including gene knockdown (KD) mediated by small hairpin RNA and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), immunofluorescence, chromatin immunopreciptation sequencing, subcellular fractionation, and atomic absorbance spectroscopy] and report a previously unappreciated role for MTF1 and copper (Cu) in cell differentiation. Upon initiation of myogenesis from primary myoblasts, both MTF1 expression and nuclear localization increased. Mtf1 KD impaired differentiation, whereas addition of nontoxic concentrations of Cu+-enhanced MTF1 expression and promoted myogenesis. Furthermore, we observed that Cu+ binds stoichiometrically to a C terminus tetra-cysteine of MTF1. MTF1 bound to chromatin at the promoter regions of myogenic genes, and Cu addition stimulated this binding. Of note, MTF1 formed a complex with myogenic differentiation (MYOD)1, the master transcriptional regulator of the myogenic lineage, at myogenic promoters. These findings uncover unexpected mechanisms by which Cu and MTF1 regulate gene expression during myoblast differentiation.-Tavera-Montañez, C., Hainer, S. J., Cangussu, D., Gordon, S. J.

https://openalex.org/W2986725246,"Regulated secretion is a conserved process occurring across diverse cells and tissues. Current models suggest that the conserved cargo receptor Tango1 mediates the packaging of collagen into large coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles that move from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. However, how Tango1 regulates the formation of COPII carriers and influences the secretion of other cargo remains unknown. Here, through high-resolution imaging of Tango1, COPII, Golgi, and secretory cargo (mucins) in Drosophila larval salivary glands, we found that Tango1 forms ring-like structures that mediate the formation of COPII rings rather than vesicles. These COPII rings act as docking sites for the cis-Golgi. Moreover, we observed nascent secretory mucins emerging from the Golgi side of these Tango1–COPII–Golgi complexes, suggesting that these structures represent functional docking sites/fusion points between the ER exit sites and the Golgi. Loss of Tango1 disrupted the formation of COPII rings, the association of COPII with the cis-Golgi, mucin O-glycosylation, and secretory granule biosynthesis. Additionally, we identified a Tango1 self-association domain that is essential for formation of this structure. Our results provide evidence that Tango1 organizes an interaction site where secretory cargo is efficiently transferred from the ER to Golgi and then to secretory vesicles. These findings may explain how the loss of Tango1 can influence Golgi/ER morphology and affect the secretion of diverse proteins across many tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2975703775,"Plasmodium falciparum is the most lethal of human‐infective malaria parasites. A hallmark of P. falciparum malaria is extensive remodeling of host erythrocytes by the parasite, which facilitates the development of virulence properties such as host cell adhesion to the endothelial lining of the microvasculature. Host remodeling is mediated by a large complement of parasite proteins exported to the erythrocyte; among them is a single heat shock protein (Hsp)70‐class protein chaperone, P. falciparum Hsp70‐x (PfHsp70‐x). PfHsp70‐x was previously shown to assist the development of virulent cytoadherence characteristics. Here, we show that PfHsp70‐x also supports parasite growth under elevated temperature conditions that simulate febrile episodes, especially at the beginning of the parasite life cycle when most of host cell remodeling takes place. Biochemical and biophysical analyses of PfHsp70‐x, including crystallographic structures of its catalytic domain and the J‐domain of its stimulatory Hsp40 cochaperone, suggest that PfHsp70‐x is highly similar to human Hsp70 chaperones endogenous to the erythrocyte. Nevertheless, our results indicate that selective inhibition of PfHsp70‐x function using small molecules may be possible and highlight specific sites of its catalytic domain as potentially of high interest. We discuss the likely roles of PfHsp70‐x and human chaperones in P. falciparum biology and how specific inhibitors may assist us in disentangling their relative contributions.—Day, J., Passecker, A., Beck, H.‐P., Vakonakis, I.

https://openalex.org/W2987801251,"Background Nonadherence to immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation is associated with poor graft outcomes. We aimed to evaluate whether the use of the Adhere4U mobile medication manager application could improve adherence among renal transplant recipients ≥1 year posttransplantation. Adhere4U can provide medication reminders, monitor medication use, and provide information on immunosuppressants. Methods We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to compare the rate of nonadherence to index immunosuppressant (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) in a group using the Adhere4U app (mobile group) and in another group receiving conventional care (control group). The primary outcome was the nonadherence rate, which was evaluated using an electronic medication event monitoring system during the 6-month intervention period. Our secondary outcome included self-reported adherence using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS) and the visual analog scale (VAS) based on a 4-week recall on days 28, 90, and 180. Longitudinal data of repeated measures of self-rated adherence were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to compare the between-group difference in adherence change over time. Results Between November 2013 and May 2015, 138 renal transplant recipients were randomly allocated to the control (n = 67) or the mobile group (n = 71). The overall nonadherence rate over the 6-month study period by electronic monitoring was 63.6%, with no between-group difference [mobile group, 65.0% (n = 39/60); control group, 62.1% (n = 36/58); odds ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval 0.53–2.40; p = 0.89]. Self-rated nonadherence assessed using the BAASIS and VAS at baseline was 53.7% and 51.5%, respectively. Although the self-rated nonadherence by BAASIS of the mobile group was lower than the control group throughout the study period, there was no between-group difference in the change of nonadherence over time (χ2 = 2.82, df = 3, p = 0.42 by logistic GEE). There also was no significant between-group difference in the nonadherence by VAS (χ2 = 1.71, df = 3, p = 0.63 by logistic GEE) over time. The main limitation of this study was the low rate of patient engagement with the app among the mobile group. The rate of app use was 47.6% (31/65) at 28 days, 33.9% (19/56) at 90 days, and 11.5% (6/52) at 180 days. Conclusions The Adhere4U application did not improve adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. Our evidence is limited by the high rate of attrition. Further studies on strategies to facilitate patient engagement with mobile interventions are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2987988540,"The loss of retinal ganglion cells observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be attributable to a neurodegeneration of the neuro-retinal structure. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been considered a prodromal stage of AD. We evaluated retinal thicknesses in patients with aMCI and AD compared to healthy controls using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) to investigate whether changes in retinal thickness are correlated with the clinical severity of dementia.Patients with aMCI (n = 14), mild to moderate AD (n = 7), severe AD (n = 9), and age-matched controls (n = 17) underwent neuro-ophthalmologic examinations. Global deterioration scale (GDS), clinical dementia rating (CDR), and mini-mental status examination (MMSE) were used to evaluate the clinical overall severity of dementia. The thicknesses of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), total macula, and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) were measured using Cirrus HD-OCT.The severe AD group had overall significantly thinner GC-IPL, total macula, and peripapillary RNFL compared to the controls (p<0.05). In the mild to moderate AD group, the total macula, average RNFL, and superior RNFL thickness were each significantly reduced compared to controls (p<0.05). The aMCI group had reduced total macula, average RNFL, and inferior RNFL thickness, but there were no significant differences compared to the controls. The GDS and CDR scores had a negative correlation with the thickness of the GC-IPL and the total macula. The MMSE scores had a positive correlation with both the total macular and average RNFL thickness, when adjusted for age (p<0.05).This study confirmed that retinal thickness is decreased in AD patients. There is a correlation between reduced retinal thickness and the clinical severity of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2985084274,"The forces that allow body movement can be divided into active (generated by sarcomeric contractile proteins) and passive (sustained by intra-sarcomeric proteins, fibre cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM)). These are needed to transmit the active forces to the tendon and the skeleton. However, the relative contribution of the intra- and extra- sarcomeric components in transmitting the passive forces is still under debate. There is limited data in the literature about human muscle and so it is difficult to make predictions using multiscale models, imposing a purely phenomenological description for passive forces. In this paper, we apply a method for the experimental characterization of the passive properties of fibres and ECM to human biopsy and propose their clear separation in a Finite Element Model. Experimental data were collected on human single muscle fibres and bundles, taken from vastus lateralis muscle of elderly subjects. Both were progressively elongated to obtain two stress-strain curves which were fitted to exponential equations. The mechanical properties of the extracellular passive components in a bundle of fibres were deduced by the subtraction of the passive tension observed in single fibres from the passive tension observed in the bundle itself. Our results showed that modulus and tensile load bearing capability of ECM are higher than those of fibres and defined their quantitative characterization that can be used in macroscopic models to study their role in the transmission of forces in physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2984515065,"The evolution of antibiotic resistance is influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of resistance mutations, and the pleiotropic effects of such mutations. Here, we isolate and characterize chromosomal quinolone resistance mutations in E. coli, in order to gain a systematic understanding of the rate and consequences of resistance to this important class of drugs. We isolated over fifty spontaneous resistance mutants on nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. This set of mutants includes known resistance mutations in gyrA, gyrB, and marR, as well as two novel gyrB mutations. We find that, for most mutations, resistance tends to be higher to nalidixic acid than relative to the other two drugs. Resistance mutations had deleterious impacts on one or more growth parameters, suggesting that quinolone resistance mutations are generally costly. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of specific gyrA alleles amongst clinical isolates are driven by high levels of resistance, at no more cost than other resistance alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2987303865,"Background A large number of indicators are currently used to monitor the state of maternal and newborn health, including those capturing dimensions of health system and input, care access and availability, care quality and safety, coverage and outcomes, and impact. Validity of these indicators is a key issue in the process of assessing indicator performance and suitability. This paper aims to understand the meaning of indicator validity in the field of maternal and newborn health, and to identify key recommendations for future research. Methods This qualitative study used purposive sampling to identify key informants until thematic saturation was achieved. We interviewed 32 respondents from a variety of backgrounds using semi-structured interviews covering five themes: the meaning of indicator validity, methodological approaches to assessing validity, acceptable levels of indicator validity, gaps in validation research, and recommendations for addressing these gaps. Interview transcripts were analysed data using thematic content approach. Results Three conceptually different definitions of indicator validity were described by respondents. They considered indicator validity to encompass meaning and potential to spur action, going beyond diagnostic validity. Indicator validation was seen as an ongoing process of building and synthesising a wide range of evidence rather than a one-size-fits-all cut-off in diagnostic validity tests. Gaps identified included assessing validity of indicators of quality of care and indicators based on facility-level data, as well as expanding studies to a broader range of global settings. The key recommendation was to develop a coordinated approach to summarising and evaluating research on indicator validity, including capacity building in appraising and communicating the available evidence for country-specific needs. Conclusion The findings will inform future recommendations around indicator testing and validation."
https://openalex.org/W2984055465,"Altering gene expression regulation by promoter engineering is a very effective way to fine-tune heterologous pathways in eukaryotic hosts. Typically, pathway building approaches in yeast still use a limited set of long, native promoters. With the today’s introduction of longer and more complex pathways, an expansion of this synthetic biology toolbox is necessary. In this study we elucidated the core promoter structure of the well-characterized yeast TEF1 promoter and determined the minimal length needed for sufficient protein expression. Furthermore, this minimal core promoter sequence was used for the creation of a promoter library covering different expression strengths. This resulted in a group of short, 69 bp promoters with an 8.0-fold expression range. One exemplar had a two and four times higher expression compared to the native CYC1 and ADH1 promoter, respectively. Additionally, as it was described that the protein expression range could be broadened by upstream activating sequences (UASs), we integrated earlier described single and multiple short, synthetic UASs in front of the strongest yeast core promoter. This approach resulted to further variation in protein expression and an overall promoter library spanning a 20-fold activity range and covering a length from 69 bp to maximally 129 bp. Furthermore, the robustness of this library was assessed on three alternative carbon sources besides glucose. As such, the suitability of short yeast core promoters for metabolic engineering applications on different media, either in an individual context or combined with UAS elements, was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2989086681,"The aim of this study is to investigate the vascular outcome after intravitreal mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration in rats without or with damage to the neurovascular unit [transgenic (TGR) rats]. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) and TGR rats received an intravitreal injection of 2 × 104 rat bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) or human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) at postnatal d 30. After 4 wk, vasculature, neuronal function, and gene expression in the retinas were evaluated using retinal morphometry, electroretinography, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative PCR. Intravitreal administration of rat BMSCs and human ASCs in both SD and TGR eyes induced cataract, loss of pericytes, and increased formation of acellular capillaries. BMSCs remained in the vitreous cavity and did not migrate into the retinas. Intravitreal administration of BMSCs impacted retinal neuronal function in neither SD nor TGR rats. Retinal glial activation, elevation of IL-1β, C3, arginase 1, and heat shock protein 90 were detected in BMSC-injected SD rats. Intravitreal administration of MSCs induces cataract, retinal vasoregression, activation of retinal glial cells, and inflammatory response in rat eyes.-Huang, H., Kolibabka, M., Eshwaran, R., Chatterjee, A., Schlotterer, A., Willer, H., Bieback, K., Hammes, H.-P., Feng, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2987166782,"Functional difficulty assessment has been proven as a key factor in the health evaluation of adults. Previous studies have shown a reduction in health and functional difficulties with increasing age. This analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of poor self-rated health on functional difficulty among older adults in Ghana.This analysis was based on the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health in Ghana for older adults 50 years and above. Fifteen standard functioning difficulty tools were extracted and used for the analysis. Three predictive models with the Coarsened Exact Matching method involving Negative Binomial, Logistics and Ordered logistic regression were performed using Stata 14.Overall, the prevalence of poor Self-rated health was 34.9% and that of functional difficulties among older adults in Ghana was 69.4%. Female sex, increasing age, being separated, having no religious affiliation, not currently working and being underweight were associated with and significantly influence poor Self-rated health [AOR(95%CI)p-value = 1.41(1.08-1.83)0.011, 3.85(2.62-5.64)0.000, 1.45(1.08-1.94)0.013, 2.62(1.68-4.07)0.000, 2.4(1.85-3.12)0.000 and 1.39(1.06-1.81)0.017 respectively]. In addition, poor Self-rated health and geographical location (rural vs. urban)significantly influence functioning difficulties among older adults in Ghana as predicted by the three models [Negative Binomial: PR(95%CI) = 1.62(1.43-1.82), Binary logistic: AOR(95%CI) = 3.67(2.79-4.81) and ordered logistic: AOR(95%CI) = 2.53(1.14-2.03)].Poor SRH is more pronounced among older adult females in Ghana. Some determinants of poor SRH include; age, geographical location (urban vs. rural), marital status, religion, and employment status. This provides pointers to important socio-demographic determinants with implications on the social function of older adults in line with the theme of the national aging policy of 2010, 'ageing with security and dignity' and ultimately in the national quest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W2988187112,"The purpose of this study was to determine and compare thigh muscle volumes (MVs), and sprint mechanical properties and performance between male and female national-level sprinters. We also studied possible relationships between thigh MVs and sprint performance. Nine male and eight female national-level sprinters participated in the study. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the thighs were obtained to determine MVs of quadriceps, hamstrings and adductors. Sprint performance was measured as the time to cover 40 and 80 m. Instantaneous sprint velocity was measured by radar to obtain theoretical maximum force (F0), theoretical maximum velocity (V0) and maximum power (Pmax). When MVs were normalized by height-mass, males showed larger hamstrings (13.5%, ES = 1.26, P < 0.05) compared with females, while quadriceps and adductors showed no statistically significant differences. Males were extremely faster than females in 40 m (14%, ES = 6.68, P < 0.001) and in 80 m (15%, ES = 5.01, P < 0.001. Males also showed increased sprint mechanical properties, with larger F0 (19%, ES = 1.98, P < 0.01), much larger Pmax (46%, ES = 3.76, P < 0.001), and extremely larger V0 (23%, ES = 6.97, P < 0.001). With the pooled data, hamstring and adductor MVs correlated strongly (r = -0.685, P < 0.01) and moderately (r = -0.530, P < 0.05), respectively, with sprint performance; while quadriceps showed no association. The sex-stratified analysis showed weaker associations compared with pooled data, most likely due to small sample size. In conclusion, males were faster than females and showed larger MVs, especially in hamstrings. Moreover, regarding the thigh muscles, hamstrings MV seems the most related with sprint performance as previously proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2985271239,"Background This study investigates khat consumption habits and its linkage to the economy of a household and works culture in its ‘homeland,’ Harar. Khat consumption habit includes practices that are performed before, during, and after consuming khat. In Harar, it has permeated the local economy, social, political and spiritual lives. To evaluate how khat consumption habit is related to the economy of a household, this study compares the living standard and characteristics of khat consumers and non-consumers. Methods Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used. Cluster sampling and lottery methods were used to identify respondents. Data were gathered through individual interviews and non-participant observation. Results The results of the study indicate that khat consumption habit affects the economy of the consumer household by negatively influencing their income usage and time management. Consumer households have significant, additional burdens on their income and time. The average monthly expenditure of a household on khat ceremonies is 1,800 ETB (30% of their income) and consumers spend an average of 112.5 hours monthly on khat related activities only. The habit of khat consumption also negatively associated with the work culture of consumers, as they leave for lunch break early and come back to work late. Conclusion Khat consumption habit does have a linkage to the bad economic situation of consumer households. It places a significant financial and time burdens on individuals, and as a result society. The work and saving culture of khat consumers are negatively affected. Khat consumption forces many into a cycle of borrowing and indebtedness. Concerned bodies should not underestimate the impacts of khat consumption on individuals and society."
https://openalex.org/W2988420050,"In estuaries, salinity is believed to limit the colonization of brackish water habitats by freshwater species. Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus, recognized as a freshwater species, is an invasive species in tidal rivers of the Chesapeake Bay. Salinity tolerance of this species, though likely to determine its potential range expansion and dispersal in estuarine habitats, is not well-known. To address this issue, we subjected blue catfish to a short-term salinity tolerance experiment and found that this species tolerates salinities higher than most freshwater fishes and that larger blue catfish tolerate elevated salinities for longer periods compared with smaller individuals. Our results are supported by spatially extensive, long-term fisheries surveys in the Chesapeake Bay region, which revealed a gradual (1975–2017) down-estuary range expansion of blue catfish from tidal freshwater areas to habitats exceeding 10 psu [practical salinity units] and that large blue catfish (> 200 mm fork length) occur in salinities greater than 10 psu in Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Habitat suitability predictions based on our laboratory results indicate that blue catfish can use brackish habitats to colonize new river systems, particularly during wet months when salinity decreases throughout the tidal rivers of the Chesapeake Bay."

Family with sequence similarity 19, member A1-5 (FAM19A1-A5; also known as TAFA1-5) is a group of conserved chemokine-like proteins enriched in the CNS of mice and humans. Their functions are only beginning to emerge. Here, we show that the expression of Fam19a1-a5 in different mouse brain regions are induced or suppressed by unfed and refed states. The striking nutritional regulation of Fam19a family members in the brain suggests a potential central role in regulating metabolism. Using a knockout (KO) mouse model, we show that loss of FAM19A1 results in sexually dimorphic phenotypes. In male mice, FAM19A1 deficiency alters food intake patterns during the light and dark cycle. Fam19a1 KO mice are hyperactive, and locomotor hyperactivity is more pronounced in female KO mice. Behavior tests indicate that Fam19a1 KO female mice have reduced anxiety and sensitivity to pain. Spatial learning and exploration, however, is preserved in Fam19a1 KO mice. Altered behaviors are associated with elevated norepinephrine and dopamine turnover in the striatum. Our results establish an in vivo function of FAM19A1 and highlight central roles for this family of neurokines in modulating animal physiology and behavior.-Lei, X., Liu, L., Terrillion, C.

https://openalex.org/W2984164384,"Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, are common in colon and liver cancers, the most frequent mutation affecting Ser-45 in β-catenin. Peptides derived from WT β-catenin have previously been shown to be presented on the cell surface as part of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, suggesting an opportunity for targeting this common driver gene mutation with antibody-based therapies. Here, crystal structures of both the WT and S45F mutant peptide bound to HLA-A*03:01 at 2.20 and 2.45 Å resolutions, respectively, confirmed the accessibility of the phenylalanine residue for antibody recognition. Phage display was then used to identify single-chain variable fragment clones that selectively bind the S45F mutant peptide presented in HLA-A*03:01 and have minimal WT or other off-target binding. Following the initial characterization of five clones, we selected a single clone, E10, for further investigation. We developed a computational model of the binding of E10 to the mutant peptide–bound HLA-A3, incorporating data from affinity maturation as initial validation. In the future, our model may be used to design clones with maintained specificity and higher affinity. Such derivatives could be adapted into either cell-based (CAR-T) or protein-based (bispecific T-cell engagers) therapies to target cancer cells harboring the S45F mutation in CTNNB1."
https://openalex.org/W2983204873,"Cognitive deficit is a prevalent and underestimated complication of diabetes, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Aberrant activity of cyclin‐dependent kinase (Cdk)5 is implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. The present study examined the role of Cdk5 in the progression of diabetes‐related cognitive deficits. We showed that the Cdk5 protein expression and kinase activity were significantly increased in diabetic mice at 16 wk. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to 30 mM glucose, Cdk5 protein and kinase activity were also elevated in a time‐dependent manner. Moreover, the high glucose exposure led to an aberrant Cdk5 activation due to its activator p25 that was cleaved from p35 by calpain. Both in diabetic mice and in cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to high glucose, inhibition of Cdk5 activity with roscovitine (Ros) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased the protein levels of cleaved caspase‐3 and the ratio of Bax and Bcl‐2. The apoptotic rate detected by TUNEL in vivo or Annexin V and propidium iodide staining for flow cytometry in vitro also had obvious reduction. In addition, high glucose exposure resulted in the increase of phosphorylated (phospho)‐MAPK kinase (MKK)6, phospho‐p38, and c‐Jun, which were rescued by Ros or Cdk5 shRNA. It is more important that the cognitive deficits of diabetic mice were also effectively alleviated by Ros. These results indicate that aberrant Cdk5 activity triggered hippocampal neuron apoptosis by activating MKK6/p38 MAPK cascade in hyperglycemia.

https://openalex.org/W2983713728,"Bacillus subtilis PdaC (BsPdaC) is a membrane-bound, multidomain peptidoglycan N-deacetylase acting on N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues and conferring lysozyme resistance to modified cell wall peptidoglycans. BsPdaC contains a C-terminal family 4 carbohydrate esterase (CE4) catalytic domain, but unlike other MurNAc deacetylases, BsPdaC also has GlcNAc deacetylase activity on chitooligosaccharides (COSs), characteristic of chitin deacetylases. To uncover the molecular basis of this dual activity, here we determined the X-ray structure of the BsPdaC CE4 domain at 1.54 Å resolution and analyzed its mode of action on COS substrates. We found that the minimal substrate is GlcNAc3 and that activity increases with the degree of glycan polymerization. COS deacetylation kinetics revealed that BsPdaC operates by a multiple-chain mechanism starting at the internal GlcNAc units and leading to deacetylation of all but the reducing-end GlcNAc residues. Interestingly, BsPdaC shares higher sequence similarity with the peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase SpPgdaA than with other MurNAc deacetylases. Therefore, we used ligand-docking simulations to analyze the dual GlcNAc- and MurNAc-binding specificities of BsPdaC and compared them with those of SpPgdA and BsPdaA, representing peptidoglycan deacetylases highly specific for GlcNAc or MurNAc residues, respectively. BsPdaC retains the conserved Asp-His-His metal-binding triad characteristic of CE4 enzymes acting on GlcNAc residues, differing from MurNAc deacetylases that lack the metal-coordinating Asp residue. BsPdaC contains short loops similar to those in SpPgdA, resulting in an open binding cleft that can accommodate polymeric substrates. We propose that PdaC is the first member of a new subclass of peptidoglycan MurNAc deacetylases.

Interestingly, BsPdaC shares higher sequence similarity with the peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase SpPgdaA than with other MurNAc deacetylases. Therefore, we used ligand-docking simulations to analyze the dual GlcNAc- and MurNAc-binding specificities of BsPdaC and compared them with those of SpPgdA and BsPdaA, representing peptidoglycan deacetylases highly specific for GlcNAc or MurNAc residues, respectively. BsPdaC retains the conserved Asp-His-His metal-binding triad characteristic of CE4 enzymes acting on GlcNAc residues, differing from MurNAc deacetylases that lack the metal-coordinating Asp residue. BsPdaC contains short loops similar to those in SpPgdA, resulting in an open binding cleft that can accommodate polymeric substrates. We propose that PdaC is the first member of a new subclass of peptidoglycan MurNAc deacetylases."

The rod PDE6 holoenzyme consists of two catalytic subunits (Pαβ) whose activity is suppressed in the dark by binding of two inhibitory γ-subunits (Pγ). Upon photoactivation of rhodopsin, the heterotrimeric G protein (transducin) is activated, resulting in binding of the activated transducin α-subunit (Gtα) to PDE6, displacement of Pγ from the PDE6 active site, and enzyme activation. Although the biochemistry of this pathway is understood, a lack of detailed structural information about the PDE6 activation mechanism hampers efforts to develop therapeutic interventions for managing PDE6-associated retinal diseases. To address this gap, here we used a cross-linking MS-based approach to create a model of the entire interaction surface of Pγ with the regulatory and catalytic domains of Pαβ in its nonactivated state. Following reconstitution of PDE6 and activated Gtα with liposomes and identification of cross-links between Gtα and PDE6 subunits, we determined that the PDE6–Gtα protein complex consists of two Gtα-binding sites per holoenzyme. Each Gtα interacts with the catalytic domains of both catalytic subunits and induces major changes in the interaction sites of the Pγ subunit with the catalytic subunits. These results provide the first structural model for the activated state of the transducin–PDE6 complex during visual excitation, enhancing our understanding of the molecular etiology of inherited retinal diseases.

PDE6 is exquisitely regulated by a cascade of reactions beginning with photoactivation of the visual pigment, opsin, and subsequent activation of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin, in the signal-transducing outer segment of the photoreceptor cell. The activated transducin α-subunit (Gtα) then binds to the membrane-associated PDE6 and accelerates its hydrolytic activity to transiently lower cGMP levels in the photoreceptor outer segment. This results in the closure of cGMP-gated ion channels and hyperpolarization of the membrane, leading to synaptic transmission to other retinal neurons (1.Arshavsky V.Y. Burns M.E. Photoreceptor signaling: supporting vision across a wide range of light intensities.J. Biol.

PDE6 belongs to the 11-member phosphodiesterase enzyme superfamily that shares a highly conserved catalytic domain responsible for the hydrolysis of the intracellular messengers cAMP and cGMP (2.Bender A.T.

In addition to the C-terminal catalytic domain, the catalytic subunits of PDE6 consist of two N-terminal regulatory GAF (regulatory domain found in certain PDEs, bacterial adenylyl cyclases, and the bacterial transcription factor FhlaA) domains (GAFa and GAFb) that are also present in four other PDE families (4.Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Properties and functions of GAF domains in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases and other proteins.Mol.

However, PDE6 differs from the other 10 PDE families in several important respects: (a) unlike the other 10 homodimeric PDE families (as well as cone PDE6), rod PDE6 is composed of two different catalytic subunits, α and β, that form a heterodimer (Pαβ); (b) PDE6 catalysis is uniquely regulated by an intrinsically disordered, 9.7-kDa inhibitory γ-subunit (Pγ) that interacts with both the regulatory and catalytic domains of each catalytic subunit to form the nonactivated rod PDE6 holoenzyme (stoichiometry αβγγ); (c) rod and cone PDE6 are the only PDEs whose activation directly results from binding of a G protein, specifically the activated Gtα subunit; and (d) upon activation, PDE6 catalysis occurs at the diffusion-controlled limit, more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the catalytic turnover rate of other PDE families (reviewed in Ref. 5.Cote R.H. Photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6): a G-protein-activated PDE regulating visual excitation in rod and cone photoreceptor cells.in: Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases in Health and Disease. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2006: 165-193Crossref Google Scholar). Numerous biochemical approaches have been undertaken to understand the molecular mechanism by which Gtα binds to the nonactivated PDE6 holoenzyme and relieves the inhibitory constraint of Pγ on PDE6 catalysis. It has been conclusively demonstrated that in the nonactivated state of the PDE6 holoenzyme, the C-terminal portion of Pγ binds to the catalytic domain and blocks access of substrate to the enzyme active site (6.Granovsky A.E.

(b) Whereas the GAFa domains showed relatively small differences in secondary structure when compared with the cryo-EM structure (Fig. S2C), the GAFb domains of the PDE6 solution structure exhibited greater dissimilarity (Fig. S2D). Our cross-linking restraints identified conformational differences in several loop structures of GAFb, including the β1/β2 loop that contains a novel α2/α3 helix (Fig. S2D). This loop is in close proximity to the catalytic domain and as previously suggested may play a role in intersubunit allosteric communication (23.Gulati S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Stahlberg H.

(c) the catalytic domains of our structural model also exhibited significant differences compared with the cryo-EM structure, particularly in the flexible H-loop and M-loop regions near the enzyme active site and in the α16 helix (Fig. S2F).

The fact that the C termini of the PDE6 catalytic subunits are prenylated (25.Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H.Y. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K.

Together, these observations emphasize the importance of relying on this lower-resolution, chemical cross-linking/MS approach to define both flexible structural elements (e.g. loops) and protein conformations unique to the membrane-associated state that are often challenging to obtain from high-resolution, unbiased structural methods such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. To map the entire interaction surface of Pγ with the PDE6 catalytic dimer, we performed cross-linking experiments with a variety of chemical cross-linkers, as well as using several site-directed mutants of Pγ that were reconstituted with Pαβ. The 21 new intermolecular cross-links between Pγ and the α- or β-subunits (Table 1) along with previously reported cross-links (20.Zeng-Elmore X. Gao X.Z. Pellarin R. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Zhang X.J.

Fig. 1B shows that the overall topology of the each Pγ subunit is similar, originating at the noncatalytic cGMP binding pocket in the GAFa domain of one catalytic subunit and terminating at the enzyme active site of the same catalytic subunit. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of Pγ—consisting of an α-helix and a C-terminal “cap”—is similar overall to the crystal structure of a Pγ fragment complexed with a PDE5/6 chimera (7.Barren B. Gakhar L. Muradov H. Boyd K.K. Ramaswamy S. Artemyev N.O. Structural basis of phosphodiesterase 6 inhibition by the C-terminal region of the γ-subunit.EMBO J. 2009; 28 (19798052): 3613-362210.1038/emboj.2009.284Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the N-and C-terminal regions of Pγ assume a predominantly linearly extended conformation, the midregion of Pγ exists in a random coil conformation. Analysis of the interaction surface of Pγ with the catalytic subunits (Fig. 1, C and D) reveals marked differences in the number and types of interactions of each Pγ with the two catalytic subunits. One Pγ subunit (designated Pγ(Pα)) follows the trajectory of the α-subunit (Fig. 1C), with approximately one-half of its 87 residues forming an interaction surface in the GAFa, GAFb, and catalytic domains, ending at the active site of the α-subunit. Nine Pγ(Pα) residues interact with the β-subunit in its GAFa and GABb domains, with four of the nine being in close proximity to both catalytic subunits. The second Pγ subunit (designated Pγ(Pβ)) has an even greater interaction surface with the catalytic dimer (Fig. 1D), with 89% of its residues interacting with Pαβ. Pγ(Pβ) interactions with Pαβ include 62 residues of the β-subunit and 30 residues of the α-subunit, with 15 of these residues being in close proximity to both catalytic subunits. The large number of Pγ(Pβ) interactions with the α-subunit is most evident in the GAFb domain where the Pγ(Pβ) subunit comes into contact with the α-subunit GAFb domain (leftward projection in Fig. 1D), as well as multiple interactions of Pγ(Pβ) with the central α-helical “backbone” of both catalytic subunits. This complex network of interactions of both Pγ subunits with both catalytic subunits localized predominantly in the GAFb domains of the catalytic dimer may represent the structural basis for allosteric communication between the α- and β-subunits during transducin activation of PDE6 (see “Discussion”). We first carried out cross-linking experiments with activated Gtα attached to liposomes to determine the solution structure of membrane-associated Gtα. Experiments were carried out with Gtα–GDP–AlF4− for which a crystal structure is available (PDB code 1TAD). For the N-terminal α-helix (αN), which is missing from this crystal structure (and proposed to have conformational flexibility) (26.Zhang Z. Melia T.J. He F. Yuan C. McGough A. Schmid M.F.

In this study, we investigated the role of neural precursor cell‐expressed, developmentally down‐regulated protein 4 (NEDD4) in regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )‐induced cell proliferation and apoptosis in human bone marrow‐derived stem cells (hBMSCs). Cell proliferation was increased in low doses of H 2 O 2 (10 ‐4 to 10 ‐2 μM), whereas sublethal concentrations of H 2 O 2 (&gt;200 μM) induced apoptosis. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified that recruitment of NF‐κB onto the promoter region of NEDD4 mediated H 2 O 2 ‐induced NEDD4 expression. The increase of NEDD4 expression by H 2 O 2 induced translocation of yes‐associated protein (YAP) into the nucleus by decreasing the stability of large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS). Thus, the phosphorylation of serine 127 residue of YAP by LATS upstream kinase is decreased and thereby increased the transcriptional activity of YAP. The mRNA expression levels of catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase, which are well‐known targets of YAP, were increased by H 2 O 2 treatment but down‐regulated by NEDD4 silencing using a specific small interfering RNA targeting NEDD4 (siNEDD4). H 2 O 2 ‐induced scavenging capacity of reactive oxygen species was also decreased by siNEDD4 in hBMSCs. Finally, hBMSC differentiation into osteoblast was decreased by siNEDD4 but reverted by reintroduction of the S127A mutant construction of YAP. Taken together, these results indicate that NEDD4 regulates H 2 O 2 ‐induced alteration of cell status through regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway.—Jeon, S.‐A., Kim, D.W., Cho, J.‐Y.

The objectives of this study were to: isolate and express an expansin-like protein (BsEXLX1), to verify its disruptive activity (expansion) on cotton fibers by immunodetection (Experiment 1), and to determine the effect of dose, pH and temperature for BsEXLX1 and cellulase to synergistically hydrolyze filter paper (FP) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) under laboratory (Experiment 2) and simulated ruminal (Experiment 3) conditions. In addition, we determined the ability of BsEXLX1 to synergistically increase hydrolysis of corn and bermudagrass silages by an exogenous fibrolytic enzyme (EFE) (Experiment 4) and how different doses of BsEXLX1 and EFE affect the gas production (GP), in vitro digestibility and fermentation of a diet for dairy cows (Experiment 5). In Experiment 1, immunofluorescence-based examination of cotton microfiber treated without or with recombinant expansin-like protein expressed from Bacillus subtilis (BsEXLX1) increased the surface area by > 100% compared to the untreated control. In Experiment 2, adding BsEXLX1 (100 μg/g FP) to cellulase (0.0148 FPU) increased release of reducing sugars compared to cellulase alone by more than 40% (P < 0.01) at optimal pH (4.0) and temperature (50°C) after 24 h. In Experiment 3 and 4, adding BsEXLX1 to cellulase or EFE, synergistically increased release of reducing sugars from FP, corn and bermudagrass silages under simulated ruminal conditions (pH 6.0, 39°C). In Experiment 5, increasing the concentration of BsEXLX1 linearly increased (P < 0.01) GP from fermentation of a diet for dairy cows by up to 17.8%. Synergistic effects between BsEXLX1 and EFE increased in vitro NDF digestibility of the diet by 23.3% compared to the control. In vitro digestibility of hemicellulose and butyrate concentration were linearly increased by BsEXLX1 compared to the control. This study demonstrated that BsEXLX1 can improve the efficacy of cellulase and EFE at hydrolyzing pure substrates and dairy cow feeds, respectively."

Plasma and liver eicosanoid levels were also measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Expression changes in Cyp2c and Cyp2j isoforms were both isoform and tissue specific. Total liver Cyp2c and Cyp2j mRNA content was reduced by 80% 24 h after LPS but recovered to baseline levels by 96 h. Total Cyp2c and Cyp2j mRNA in kidney (‐19%) and duodenum (‐64%) were reduced 24 h after LPS but recovered above baseline by 72 h. Total Cyp2c and Cyp2j mRNA content in brain was elevated at all time points after LPS dosing. Plasma eicosanoids transiently increased 3‐6 h after administration of LPS. In liver, esterified oxylipin levels decreased during acute inflammation and before recovering.

https://openalex.org/W2986061975,"Continuous cell culture-based influenza vaccine production could significantly reduce footprint and manufacturing costs compared to current batch processing. However, yields of influenza virus in continuous mode can be affected by oscillations in virus titers caused by periodic accumulation of defective interfering particles. The generation of such particles has also been observed previously in cascades of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and is known as the “von Magnus effect”. To improve virus yields and to avoid these oscillations, we have developed a novel continuous tubular bioreactor system for influenza A virus production. It was built using a 500 mL CSTR for cell growth linked to a 105 m long tubular plug-flow bioreactor (PFBR). Virus propagation took place only in the PFBR with a nominal residence time of 20 h and a production capacity of 0.2 mL/min. The bioreactor was first tested with suspension MDCK cells at different multiplicities of infection (MOI), and then with suspension avian AGE1.CR.pIX cells at a fixed nominal MOI of 0.02. Maximum hemagglutinin (HA) titers of 2.4 and 1.6 log10(HA units/100 μL) for suspension MDCK cells and AGE1.CR.pIX cells, respectively, were obtained. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that 100% infected cells with batch-like HA titers can be obtained at a MOI of at least 0.1. Stable HA and TCID50 titers over 18 days of production were confirmed using the AGE1.CR.pIX cell line, and PCR analysis demonstrated stable production of full-length genome. The contamination level of segments with deletions (potentially defective interfering particles), already present in the virus seed, was low and did not increase. Control experiments using batch and semi-continuous cultures confirmed these findings. A comparison showed that influenza virus production can be achieved with the tubular bioreactor system in about half the time with a space-time-yield up to two times higher than for typical batch cultures. In summary, a novel continuous tubular bioreactor system for cell culture-based influenza virus production was developed. One main advantage, an essentially single-passage amplification of viruses, should enable efficient production of vaccines as well as vectors for gene and cancer therapy."

A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical functioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifically interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and oxygen depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba’s lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and oxygen regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake’s sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5°C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them."
https://openalex.org/W2987762938,"Ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is a major facilitator superfamily transporter that is essential for proper maintenance of human iron homeostasis at the systemic and cellular level. FPN1 dysfunction leads to the progressive accumulation of iron in reticuloendothelial cells, causing hemochromatosis type 4A (or ferroportin disease), an autosomal dominant disorder that displays large phenotypic heterogeneity. Although crystal structures have unveiled the outward‐ and inward‐facing conformations of the bacterial homolog Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus Fpn (or Bd2019) and calcium has recently been identified as an essential cofactor, our molecular understanding of the iron transport mechanism remains incomplete. Here, we used a combination of molecular modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and Ala site‐directed mutagenesis, followed by complementary in vitro functional analyses, to explore the structural architecture of the human FPN1 intracellular gate. We reveal an interdomain network that involves 5 key amino acids and is likely very important for stability of the iron exporter facing the extracellular milieu. We also identify inter‐ and intradomain interactions that rely on the 2 Asp84 and Asn174 critical residues and do not exist in the bacterial homolog. These interactions are thought to play an important role in the modulation of conformational changes during the transport cycle. We interpret these results in the context of hemochromatosis type 4A, reinforcing the idea that different categories of loss‐of‐function mutations exist. Our findings provide an unprecedented view of the human FPN1 outward‐facing structure and the particular function of the so‐called “gating residues” in the mechanism of iron export.—Guellec, J., Elbahnsi, A., Le Tertre, M., Uguen, K., Gourlaouen, I., Férec, C., Ka, C., Callebaut, I., Le Gac, G.

https://openalex.org/W2983589746,"Background Little research has targeted multiple-level barriers and facilitators in school-based parental support programmes. This qualitative study aims to describe barriers and facilitators, at organisational and personal levels, that teachers and parents in disadvantaged settings in Sweden perceived as influencing the implementation of the Healthy School Start II (HSS II) intervention. Methods Data collection, analysis and interpretation were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 14 parents and ten teachers within the HSS II trial. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis in a deductive step using the three CFIR domains–inner and outer setting, and personal characteristics–followed by an inductive analysis. Results The theme ‘being on the same page–getting burdened teachers and parents to work on common ground’ was found. Among teachers, barriers and facilitators were related to the structure of the schoolwork and curriculum, involvement from other staff and school management, the practical school workday, perception of high family needs but low parental interest, insufficient resources in the families, and teacher’s personal knowledge, interests, and opinions about health and food. For parents, barriers and facilitators were related to the perceived family needs and resources, parents’ health knowledge, consensus about healthy behaviours and ability to cooperate, and school involvement in health issues and the intervention. Conclusion Interventions should facilitate parents’ and teachers’ work on common ground, with activities suitable for a stressful and burdensome workday and everyday life. This could be achieved by integrating evidence-based practices within school routines, and including activities that are practicable despite parents’ stressful lives, and that increase parental consensus about promoting health. Strategies to increase involvement of parents in families with high needs are necessary. Also, this study suggests an expansion of the CFIR to capture the interface between different micro-level organisations, and account for several delivering/receiving organisations."
https://openalex.org/W2984032317,"Cell membrane potential and inorganic ion distributions are currently viewed from a kinetic electric paradigm, which ignores thermodynamics. The resting membrane potential is viewed as a diffusion potential. The 9 major inorganic ions found in blood plasma (Ca 2+ , Na + , Mg 2+ , K + , H + , Cl – , HCO 3 – , H 2 PO 4 – , and HPO 4 2– ) are distributed unequally across the plasma membrane. This unequal distribution requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis through the action of the Na + ‐K + ATPase. The cell resting membrane potential in each of 3 different tissues with widely different resting membrane potentials has been shown to be equal to the Nernst equilibrium potential of the most permeant inorganic ion. The energy of the measured distribution of the 9 major inorganic ions between extra‐ and intracellular phases was essentially equal to the independently measured energy of ATP hydrolysis, showing that the distribution of these 9 major ions was in near‐equilibrium with the Δ G ‘ of ATP. Therefore, thermodynamics does appear to play an essential role in the determination of the cell resting membrane potential and the inorganic ion distribution across the plasma membrane.—Veech, R.

Although porcine DCs are generated by this classical method, the exact characteristics of the BMDC population have not yet been defined. In this study, we discriminated GM-CSF-grown BMDCs from gnotobiotic miniature pigs according to several criteria including morphology, phenotype, gene expression pattern and function. We showed that porcine BMDCs were heterogeneous cells that differentially expressed MHCII. MHCIIhigh cells displayed more representative of DC-like morphology and phenotype, including costimulatory molecules, as well as they showed a superior T cell priming capacity as compared to MHCIIlow cell. Our data showed that the difference in MHCIIhigh and MHCIIlow cell populations involved distinct maturation states rather than the presence of different cell types.

More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following a disturbance, such as a mass bleaching event. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico’s coral reefs, modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators—such as coral diversity, macroalgae percent cover, and herbivorous fish biomass—and assessed which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly spatially intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites’ resilience scores with projected ocean warming to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or community-level managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a “desktop” assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field survey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances."

Materials and methods We included 246 patients with osteoporosis who underwent thoracolumbar radiographs and brain MRI at our hospital. Clinical data on age, sex, bone mineral density, height, weight, osteoporosis medication, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol drinking, and smoking were collected. Intracranial cavity, brain parenchyma, and lateral ventricles volumes were measured using brain MRI with a semiautomated tool. Results We founded an independent correlation between age and volume percentages of the brain parenchyma and lateral ventricles. We observed a statistically significant decrease in volume percentage of the brain parenchyma and an increase in volume percentage of the lateral ventricles with increasing age. In addition, we confirmed that patients with OVCF showed a significantly lower volume percentage of brain parenchyma than patients without OVCF. Conclusion We observed a significant association between OVCF and volume percentage of brain parenchyma. Degeneration of the brain may lead to a high incidence of falls, and OVCF may occur more frequently in patients with osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2988522133,"In contrast to earlier studies which have used modelling to perform cost-effectiveness analysis, this study links data from a randomised controlled trial with register data from nationwide registries to reveal new evidence on costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of organised mass prostate-cancer screening based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted with individual-level data on health-care costs from comprehensive registers and register data on real-world effectiveness from the two arms of the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC), following 80,149 men from 1996 through 2015. The study examines cost-effectiveness in terms of overall mortality and, in addition, in terms of diagnosed men’s mortality from prostate cancer and mortality with but not from prostate cancer. Neither arm of the FinRSPC was clearly more cost-effective in analysis in terms of overall mortality. Organised screening in the FinRSPC could be considered cost-effective in terms of deaths from prostate cancer: averting just over one death per 1000 men screened. However, even with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of below 20,000€ per death avoided, this result should not be considered in isolation. This is because mass screening in this trial also resulted in increases in death with, but not from, prostate cancer: with over five additional deaths per 1000 men screened. Analysis of real-world data from the FinRSPC reveals new evidence of the comparative effectiveness of PSA-based screening after 20 years of follow-up, suggesting the possibility of higher mortality, as well as higher healthcare costs, for screening-arm men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer but who do not die from it. These findings should be corroborated or contradicted by similar analyses using data from other trials, in order to reveal if more diagnosed men have also died in the screening arms of other trials of mass screening for prostate cancer."

The outcome of interest was the number of publications in indexed journals. We estimated the gender gap in scientific production using the Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition method.From the 2216 physicians surveyed, 252 reported published at least one article in an indexed journal. From physicians with scientific production, 37.7% were women. The analysis of OB decomposition showed a gap of 2.11 indexed publications, disfavoring female physicians (p<0.01). Likewise, the explained component was 1.36 publications, representing 64.5% of the total gap (p<0.05).There is a gender gap in the number of publications in indexed journals among Peruvian physicians.

Forty-one patients who underwent anatomical segmentectomy for early lung cancer between January 2014 and July 2017 were included for analysis. Several baseline and surgical variables were evaluated. In particular, the emphysema index (EI, %) and lobe-specific emphysema index (LEI, %) were assessed by using three-dimensional volumetric CT scan. PAL was observed in 13 patients (31.7%). There were statistically significant differences in DLCO (97.3% ± 18.3% vs. 111.7% ± 15.9%, p = 0.014), EI (4.61% ± 4.66% vs. 1.17% ± 1.76%, p = 0.023), and LEI (5.81% ± 5.78% vs. 0.76% ± 1.17%, p = 0.009) between patients with and without PAL.

We analyzed this homemade repellent and confirmed by behavioral measurements and odorant receptor responses that eugenol is the active ingredient in this formulation. Prepared as advertised, this homemade repellent is ineffective, whereas 5x more concentrated extracts from the brand most enriched in eugenol showed moderate repellency activity against Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. DEET showed higher performance when compared to the 5x concentrated formulation and is available in the same market at a lower price than the cost of the ingredients to prepare the homemade formulation."
https://openalex.org/W2989219606,"Given the importance and complexity of crop evapotranspiration estimation under drought stress, an experiment tailored for maize under drought stress was completed using six sets of large-scale weighing lysimeters at the Xinmaqiao Comprehensive Experimental Irrigation and Drainage Station, Anhui Province, China. Our aim was to analyze maize evapotranspiration under different drought conditions. Based on estimates of maize evapotranspiration under no drought stress using the dual crop coefficient approach, we optimized and calibrated basic crop coefficients Kcbini, Kcbmid, Kcbend, and the maximum crop coefficient Kcmax using a genetic algorithm. Measurements of solar radiation at the experimental station were used to derive the empirical parameters a and b from the Angstrom formula through the genetic algorithm, and then evapotranspiration was calculated for the reference crop (ET0). We then estimated the maize evapotranspiration under drought using the dual crop coefficient approach. The results indicated that a slight water deficit during the earlier stage of vegetative growth may stimulate the maize homeostatic mechanism and increase tolerance to drought stress in later growth periods. Maize evapotranspiration significantly decreased if drought stress continued into the elongation stage, and the same degree of drought stress had a greater influence on the middle and later stages of vegetative and reproductive growth. The calibrated results for Kcbini, Kcbmid, Kcbend, and Kcmax were 0.155, 1.218, 0.420 and 1.497 respectively. We calculated the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) of maize evapotranspiration under no drought stress over the full growing season using a dual crop coefficient approach, and the results were 1.33 mm/day, 0.99 mm/day, and 1.30%, respectively, or 18.40%, 17.50%, and 91.11% lower than results using the recommended coefficients. The RMSE, MAE, and MRE results for maize under drought stress during two full growth periods were 1.18 mm/day, 0.98 mm/day, and 13.92%, respectively. These results were higher than maize without drought stress, but better than the estimated results based on FAO-56 recommended values. Therefore, maize evapotranspiration estimation under drought stress using the dual crop coefficient approach and genetic algorithm was reasonable and reliable. This study provides a theoretical basis for developing suitable regional irrigation programs and decreasing losses due to agricultural drought."
https://openalex.org/W2983075126,"Using panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) models, this paper studies the effects of financial and fiscal policies on poverty reduction across 382 poverty-stricken counties in China. The findings are that both fiscal and financial policies have a positive influence on poverty reduction, and their relationships are nonlinear. For either a high or low degree of poverty, fiscal policies are effective for poverty reduction, while financial policies have a greater impact on poverty reduction when there is a medium degree of poverty. Therefore, in deciding which policies should be prioritized for reducing poverty, the level of poverty should be taken into account. To be more specific, when a portfolio of poverty-reduction policies is implemented, fiscal policies should be prioritized at the beginning, when the incidence of poverty is high. Then, financial support should come to the forefront as the poverty level drops, and fiscal support should be stepped up when the poverty level continues to drop."
https://openalex.org/W2983712200,"Previous research has consistently shown that for sounds varying in intensity over time, the beginning of the sound is of higher importance for the perception of loudness than later parts (primacy effect). However, in all previous studies, the target sounds were presented in quiet, and at a fixed average sound level. In the present study, temporal loudness weights for a time-varying narrowband noise were investigated in the presence of a continuous bandpass-filtered background noise and the average sound levels of the target stimuli were varied across a range of 60 dB. Pronounced primacy effects were observed in all conditions and there were no significant differences between the temporal weights observed in the conditions in quiet and in background noise. Within the conditions in background noise, there was a significant effect of the sound level on the pattern of weights, which was mainly caused by a slight trend for increased weights at the end of the sounds (""recency effect"") in the condition with lower average level. No such effect was observed for the in-quiet conditions. Taken together, the observed primacy effect is largely independent of masking as well as of sound level. Compatible with this conclusion, the observed primacy effects in quiet and in background noise can be well described by an exponential decay function using parameters based on previous studies. Simulations using a model for the partial loudness of time-varying sounds in background noise showed that the model does not predict the observed temporal loudness weights."

In three reaction time studies (N = 68; N = 97; N = 60) we investigated whether, in line with AO, stance-argument pairs congruent in valence are easier to process and to verify than incongruent pairs. Second, we tested whether, in line with predictions from the Markedness Principle (MP), positive congruent pairs are easier to process than negative congruent pairs. In line with AO, participants made faster and more accurate judgments of congruent pairs than of incongruent pairs. This effect was observed when controlling for word length and word frequency, and occurred irrespective of the distance between the evaluative word in the stance and argument. No unambiguous effect of Markedness was found."
https://openalex.org/W2986118134,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are important molecular switches that facilitate transmission of a variety of signals from the outside to the inside of cells. G proteins are highly conserved, enabling study of their regulatory mechanisms in model organisms such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gpa2 is a yeast Gα protein that functions in the nutrient signaling pathway. Using Phos-tag, a highly specific phosphate binding tag for separating phosphorylated proteins, we found that Gpa2 undergoes phosphorylation and that its level of phosphorylation is markedly increased upon nitrogen starvation. We also observed that phosphorylation of Gpa2 depends on glycogen synthase kinase (GSK). Disrupting GSK activity diminishes Gpa2 phosphorylation levels in vivo, and the purified GSK isoforms Mck1 and Ygk3 are capable of phosphorylating Gpa2 in vitro. Functionally, phosphorylation enhanced plasma membrane localization of Gpa2 and promoted nitrogen starvation–induced activation of protein kinase A. Together, the findings of our study reveal a mechanism by which GSK- and nutrient-dependent phosphorylation regulates subcellular localization of Gpa2 and its ability to activate downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2986148164,"Chronic islet inflammation is associated with development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intermediate‐conductance calcium‐activated K+ (K Ca 3.1) channel plays an important role in inflammatory diseases. However, the role and regulation of K Ca 3.1 in pancreatic β cells in progression of T2DM remain unclarified. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the specific K Ca 3.1 channel blocker 1‐[(2‐chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]‐1H‐pyrazole (TRAM‐34) on diabetic phenotype in the db/db model. In diabetic mice, blockade of K Ca 3.1 significantly improved glucose tolerance, enhanced secretion of postprandial insulin level, and reduced loss of β‐cell mass through attenuating the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, in cultured pancreatic β cells, exposure to high levels of glucose or palmitic acid significantly increased expression and current density of the K Ca 3.1 channel as well as secretion of proinflammatory chemokines, and the effects were similarly reversed by preincubation with TRAM‐34 or a NF‐κB inhibitor pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate. Additionally, expression of K Ca 3.1 in pancreas islet cells was up‐regulated by activation of NF‐κBwithIL‐1β stimulation. In summary, up‐regulated K Ca 3.1 due to activation of NF‐κB pathway leads to pancreatic inflammation via expression and secretion of chemokines and cytokines by pancreatic β cells, thereby facilitating progression of T2DM.—Pang, Z.‐D., Wang, Y., Wang, X.‐J., She, G., Ma, X.‐Z., Song, Z., Zhao, L.‐M., Wang, H.‐F., Lai, B.‐C., Gou, W., Du, X.‐J., Deng, X.‐L.

https://openalex.org/W2986369505,"Aim The aim of this study was to assess the association between depression symptom severity and household income, consumption, asset-based wealth, debt and use of distress financing strategies, to understand how depression symptom severity and household economic welfare are related. Methods A household survey was administered to the households of primary health clinic-attenders who were screened for depression symptoms using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in the chronic care units of four primary health clinics in the North West province of South Africa. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess whether a range of household economic measures were significant predictors of depression symptom severity; and whether depression symptom severity significantly predicted changes to household economic welfare, across a number of different economic measures using both multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. Results On univariate analysis, certain characteristics were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores, namely: households in which the household head was younger, female, and unmarried; households in which the indexed patient was younger, and did not receive an education beyond primary school; increasing household size, receipt of a social grant, households living in housing constructed of metal sheet walls and households making use of a public tap as their primary water source. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that higher log-transformed food expenditure, lower log-transformed capacity to pay, the presence of household debt and both reducing the size or frequency of meals and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress over the past three years were associated with significantly worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that larger household sizes (p<0.05), receipt of social grants (p<0.05), higher food expenditure (p<0.01), and drawing up retail shop accounts in response to financial distress (p<0.05) were independently predictive of worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores. Inversely, increasing age of the household head (p<0.05), having piped water directly into the household (as opposed to making use of a public water sources) (p<0.01), and increasing capacity to pay (p<0.01) were independently predictive of better (lower) PHQ-9 scores. Similarly, multivariable analysis demonstrated that worse (higher) PHQ-9 scores were independently predictive of lower household capacity to pay (p<0.10) and higher food expenditure (p<0.01). Conclusions This study is the first of its kind in South Africa, identifying household economic factors associated with increased depression symptom severity on a continuum; and demonstrating that financial risk protection efforts are needed across this continuum. The study demonstrates that the relationship between poverty and mental health extends beyond the individual to affect household economic functioning. These findings must be included in policy considerations to achieve effective protection for vulnerable households facing the interaction of depression and adverse economic circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2988288782,"Interorgan communication mediated by secreted proteins plays a pivotal role in metabolic homeostasis, yet the function of many circulating secretory proteins remains unknown. Here, we describe the function of protease‐associated domain‐containing 1 (PRADC1), an enigmatic secretory protein widely expressed in humans and mice. In metabolically active tissues (liver, muscle, fat, heart, and kidney), we showed that Pradc1 expression is significantly suppressed by refeeding and reduced in kidney and brown fat in the context of obesity. PRADC1 is dispensable for whole‐body metabolism when mice are fed a low‐fat diet. However, in obesity induced by high‐fat feeding, PRADC1‐deficient female mice have reduced weight gain and adiposity despite similar caloric intake. Decreased fat mass is attributed, in part, to increased metabolic rate, physical activity, and energy expenditure in these animals. Reduced adiposity in PRADC1‐deficient mice, however, does not improve systemic glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, liver steatosis, or adipose inflammation. Thus, in PRADC1‐deficient animals, decreased fat mass and enhanced physical activity are insufficient to confer a healthy metabolic phenotype in the context of an obesogenic diet. Our results shed light on the physiologic function of PRADC1 and the complex regulation of metabolic health.—Rodriguez, S., Stewart, A. N., Lei, X., Cao, X., Little, H. C., Fong, V., Sarver, D.

https://openalex.org/W2982915908,"Scholars of social influence can benefit from attending to symbolic boundaries. A common and influential way to understand symbolic boundaries is as widely shared understandings of what types of behaviors, tastes, and opinions are appropriate for different kinds of people. Scholars following this understanding have mostly focused on how people judge others and how symbolic boundaries align with and thus reproduce social differences. Although this work has been impressive, I argue that it might miss important ways in which symbolic boundaries become effective in everyday social life. I therefore develop an understanding of how symbolic boundaries affect people’s ideas and decisions about themselves and their own behavior. Based on this, I argue that focusing on boundary violations—that is, what happens if people express opinions or enact behavior that contravenes what is considered (in)appropriate for people like them—might offer an important way to understand how symbolic boundaries initiate and shape cultural and social change. Using data from Add Health, I demonstrate the utility of this line of argument and show that boundary violations play an important role in channeling social influence. Conservative/Evangelical Protestants and to a lesser degree Catholics, but not Mainline Protestants are highly influenced by the drinking of co-religionists. I consider the implications for cultural sociology."

Ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloid plant, radiation therapy, and post-bone-marrow-transplant reactions are the commonest causes. In Ethiopia, a venous-occlusive disease outbreak was identified in 2002 in Tahtay Koraro district, Tigray. Suspected due to ingestion of the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid plant Ageratum conyzoids, found throughout the district. We aimed to describe the surveillance data of venous-occlusive disease from September 2006 to August 2016 in Tahtay koraro district, Ethiopia, 2017.We defined a possible Hepatic venous-occlusive disease case as any patient with abdominal pain for at least 2 weeks, abdominal distention, and hepato-splenomegaly during September 2006-August 2016. We reviewed previous district line lists, weekly reports, and clinical records to identify and describe cases. Agricultural interventions were obtained from the agricultural offices of the district.We identified 179 possible cases with 83 deaths with a case-fatality rate of 46.3%. Among cases, 110 (61.5%) were males and 113 (63%) were >15 years. In total, 164 (91.6%) cases were from one village (Kelakil). The pick number of cases of VOD in this village was during 2008/09 which was 1076. The highest incidence (86/100,000) occurred in 2008. During the study period, 2,746 years of potential life were lost due to Hepatic venous-occlusive disease. Mechanical removal of the Ageratum started in 2011.Hepatic venous-occlusive disease was an ongoing problem in Tahtay Koraro; However, the problem has largely been alleviated by displacing people from the affected area and removing the causative weed. More research is needed to understand why Kelakil village was more affected despite the widespread presence of the weed. Chemical and mechanical removal of the Ageratum could strengthen intervention activities."
https://openalex.org/W2988214416,"Liver transplantation is the only curative strategy for final stage liver diseases. Despite the great advances achieved during the last 20 years, the recipient immune response after transplantation is not entirely controlled. This results in high rates of acute cell rejection and, approximately, 10% of early mortality. Therapeutic treatment could be improved by efficiently transfecting genes that encode natural immunosuppressant proteins, employing safe procedures that could be transferred to clinical setting. In this sense, interleukin 10 plays a central role in immune tolerance response by acting at different levels.hIL10 gene was hydrofected by retrograde hydrodynamic injection in pig liver with complete vascular exclusion mediated by an 'in vivo' surgical procedure. Levels of IL10 DNA, RNA and protein were determined within liver tissue 1 and 10 days after the injection and, more frequently, also the interleukin-10 protein in peripheral blood.The procedure was safe for the animals and neither hemodynamic parameters nor liver function determinations showed relevant alterations. The hIL10 hydrofection in watertight liver mediated efficient gene transfer and this was transcribed and translated to protein, achieving up to 110 pg/ml of IL10 in peripheral blood. This value is close to that considered able to reduce the activity of TNFα by half (IL10 IC50 for TNFα = 124 pg/ml).Results of this work suggest that IL10 liver hydrofection with vascular exclusion in vivo is a safe and transferable procedure that mediates plasma protein levels with potential clinical interest in immune modulation after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2985930900,"Background Recognizing the need for improving maternal and newborn care, the Punjab public health department (Pakistan) launched emergency obstetric neonatal care (EmONC) services under WHO guideline. Unfortunately, the program implementation is facing some serious problems. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to implementation of EmONC in district Bahawalnagar (Pakistan). Methods This study used sequential exploratory design. Specifically, a qualitative study was conducted to identify barriers to EmONC. Subsequently, the relative importance of these barriers was determined in a quantitative study. Participants were health service providers involved in 24-hours basic EmONC services in the basic health units of district Bahawalnagar (Pakistan). Qualitative data were gathered by interviewing the participants using key informant guide. Quantitative data were collected in a rank order survey of the same participants. The methodological quality was assessed using mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2011. Results The results indicate that lack of teamwork, conflict management, communication, and improper power distribution are important interpersonal barriers. The significant organizational-level barriers include job insecurity, lack of organizational culture, human resource deployment issues, and lack of role clarity. Lack of target management, lack of resource availability, house job requirement, and dual practice issues were identified as major system-level barriers. Conclusion Barriers to EmONC implementation must be addressed for improving maternal and neonatal care in district Bahawalnagar."
https://openalex.org/W2987896012,"Sequence tagged microsatellite site (STMS) are useful PCR based DNA markers. Wide genome coverage, high polymorphic index and co-dominant nature make STMS a preferred choice for marker assisted selection (MAS), genetic diversity analysis, linkage mapping, seed genetic purity analysis etc. Routine STMS analysis involving low-throughput, laborious and time-consuming polyacrylamide/agarose gels often limit their full utility in crop breeding experiments that involve large populations. Therefore, convenient, gel-less marker detection methods are highly desirable for STMS markers. The present study demonstrated the utility of SYBR Green dye based melt-profiling as a simple and convenient gel-less approach for detection of STMS markers (referred to as GLADS) in bread wheat and rice. The method involves use of SYBR Green dye during PCR amplification (or post-PCR) of STMS markers followed by generation of a melt-profile using controlled temperature ramp rate. The STMS amplicons yielded characteristic melt-profiles with differences in melting temperature (Tm) and profile shape. These characteristic features enabled melt-profile based detection and differentiation of STMS markers/alleles in a gel-less manner. The melt-profile approach allowed assessment of the specificity of the PCR assay unlike the end-point signal detection assays. The method also allowed multiplexing of two STMS markers with non-overlapping melt-profiles. In principle, the approach can be effectively used in any crop for STMS marker analysis. This SYBR Green melt-profiling based GLADS approach offers a convenient, low-cost (20-51%) and time-saving alternative for STMS marker detection that can reduce dependence on gel-based detection, and exposure to toxic chemicals."
