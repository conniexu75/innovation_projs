https://openalex.org/W2123352686,"Optogenetics allows rapid, temporally specific control of neuronal activity by targeted expression and activation of light-sensitive proteins. Implementation typically requires remote light sources and fiber-optic delivery schemes that impose considerable physical constraints on natural behaviors. In this report we bypass these limitations using technologies that combine thin, mechanically soft neural interfaces with fully implantable, stretchable wireless radio power and control systems. The resulting devices achieve optogenetic modulation of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. This is demonstrated with two form factors; stretchable film appliqués that interface directly with peripheral nerves, and flexible filaments that insert into the narrow confines of the spinal epidural space. These soft, thin devices are minimally invasive, and histological tests suggest they can be used in chronic studies. We demonstrate the power of this technology by modulating peripheral and spinal pain circuitry, providing evidence for the potential widespread use of these devices in research and future clinical applications of optogenetics outside the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2230199130,"Genome editing with targeted nucleases and DNA donor templates homologous to the break site has proven challenging in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and particularly in the most primitive, long-term repopulating cell population. Here we report that combining electroporation of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) mRNA with donor template delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 6 vectors directs efficient genome editing in HSPCs, achieving site-specific insertion of a GFP cassette at the CCR5 and AAVS1 loci in mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ HSPCs at mean frequencies of 17% and 26%, respectively, and in fetal liver HSPCs at 19% and 43%, respectively. Notably, this approach modified the CD34+CD133+CD90+ cell population, a minor component of CD34+ cells that contains long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Genome-edited HSPCs also engrafted in immune-deficient mice long-term, confirming that HSCs are targeted by this approach. Our results provide a strategy for more robust application of genome-editing technologies in HSPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2125957493,"At least 120 non-olfactory G-protein-coupled receptors in the human genome are 'orphans' for which endogenous ligands are unknown, and many have no selective ligands, hindering the determination of their biological functions and clinical relevance. Among these is GPR68, a proton receptor that lacks small molecule modulators for probing its biology. Using yeast-based screens against GPR68, here we identify the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam as a non-selective GPR68 positive allosteric modulator. More than 3,000 GPR68 homology models were refined to recognize lorazepam in a putative allosteric site. Docking 3.1 million molecules predicted new GPR68 modulators, many of which were confirmed in functional assays. One potent GPR68 modulator, ogerin, suppressed recall in fear conditioning in wild-type but not in GPR68-knockout mice. The same approach led to the discovery of allosteric agonists and negative allosteric modulators for GPR65. Combining physical and structure-based screening may be broadly useful for ligand discovery for understudied and orphan GPCRs."

https://openalex.org/W2147260787,"Regeneration of adult tissues depends on somatic stem cells that remain quiescent yet are primed to enter a differentiation program. The molecular pathways that prevent activation of these cells are not well understood. Using mouse skeletal muscle stem cells as a model, we show that a general repression of translation, mediated by the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α at serine 51 (P-eIF2α), is required to maintain the quiescent state. Skeletal muscle stem cells unable to phosphorylate eIF2α exit quiescence, activate the myogenic program, and differentiate, but do not self-renew. P-eIF2α ensures in part the robust translational silencing of accumulating mRNAs that is needed to prevent the activation of muscle stem cells. Additionally, P-eIF2α-dependent translation of mRNAs regulated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) contributes to the molecular signature of stemness. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF2α dephosphorylation enhances skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal and regenerative capacity."

https://openalex.org/W2190061239,"Serotonergic (5HT) neurons modulate diverse behaviors and physiology and are implicated in distinct clinical disorders. Corresponding diversity in 5HT neuronal phenotypes is becoming apparent and is likely rooted in molecular differences, yet a comprehensive approach characterizing molecular variation across the 5HT system is lacking, as is concomitant linkage to cellular phenotypes. Here we combine intersectional fate mapping, neuron sorting, and genome-wide RNA-seq to deconstruct the mouse 5HT system at multiple levels of granularity—from anatomy, to genetic sublineages, to single neurons. Our unbiased analyses reveal principles underlying system organization, 5HT neuron subtypes, constellations of differentially expressed genes distinguishing subtypes, and predictions of subtype-specific functions. Using electrophysiology, subtype-specific neuron silencing, and conditional gene knockout, we show that these molecularly defined 5HT neuron subtypes are functionally distinct. Collectively, this resource classifies molecular diversity across the 5HT system and discovers sertonergic subtypes, markers, organizing principles, and subtype-specific functions with potential disease relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2174130773,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) represents a principle quality control mechanism to clear misfolded proteins in the ER; however, its physiological significance and the nature of endogenous ERAD substrates remain largely unexplored. Here we discover that IRE1α, the sensor of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a bona fide substrate of the Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD complex. ERAD-mediated IRE1α degradation occurs under basal conditions in a BiP-dependent manner, requires both the intramembrane hydrophilic residues of IRE1α and the lectin protein OS9, and is attenuated by ER stress. ERAD deficiency causes IRE1α protein stabilization, accumulation and mild activation both in vitro and in vivo. Although enterocyte-specific Sel1L-knockout mice (Sel1L(ΔIEC)) are viable and seem normal, they are highly susceptible to experimental colitis and inflammation-associated dysbiosis, in an IRE1α-dependent but CHOP-independent manner. Hence, Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD serves a distinct, essential function in restraint of IRE1α signalling in vivo by managing its protein turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2263259748,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new players in gene regulation and are associated with the development of cancers. To investigate the important role and mechanism of lncRNAs in the progression of gastric cancer, we screened lncRNAs in gastric cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues, and assessed the effects on gastric cancer. Here, we report that BC032469, a novel lncRNA, expressed highly in gastric cancer tissues, and the upregulation was clinically associated with larger tumor size, poor differentiation and shorter survival of gastric cancer patients. Downregulation of BC032469 resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, BC032469 could directly bind to miR-1207-5p and effectively functioned as a sponge for miR-1207-5p to modulate the derepression of hTERT. Thus, BC032469 may function as a ceRNA to impair miR-1207-5p-dependent hTERT downregulation, suggesting that it may be clinically valuable as a poor prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2170615237,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in a variety of diseases, including many tumors. However, the functional roles of these transcripts and mechanisms responsible for their deregulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not thoroughly understood. In this study, we discovered that lncRNA MIR31HG is markedly upregulated in PDAC. Knockdown of MIR31HG significantly suppressed PDAC cell growth, induced apoptosis and G1/S arrest, and inhibited invasion, whereas enhanced expression of MIR31HG had the opposite effects. Online database analysis tools showed that miR-193b could target MIR31HG and we found an inverse correlation between MIR31HG and miR-193b in PDAC specimens. Inhibition of miR-193b expression significantly upregulated the MIR31HG level, while overexpression of miR-193b suppressed MIR31HG's expression and function, suggesting that MIR31HG is negatively regulated by miR-193b. Moreover, using luciferase reporter and RIP assays, we provide evidence that miR-193b directly targeted MIR31HG by binding to two microRNA binding sites in the MIR31HG sequence. On the other hand, MIR31HG may act as an endogenous 'sponge' by competing for miR-193b binding to regulate the miRNA targets. Collectively, these results demonstrate that MIR31HG functions as an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression, and miR-193b targets not only protein-coding genes but also the lncRNA, MIR31HG."
https://openalex.org/W2193977748,"Drosophila Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has served as a paradigm to study morphogen-dependent growth control. However, the role of a Dpp gradient in tissue growth remains highly controversial. Two fundamentally different models have been proposed: the 'temporal rule' model suggests that all cells of the wing imaginal disc divide upon a 50% increase in Dpp signalling, whereas the 'growth equalization model' suggests that Dpp is only essential for proliferation control of the central cells. Here, to discriminate between these two models, we generated and used morphotrap, a membrane-tethered anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) nanobody, which enables immobilization of enhanced (e)GFP::Dpp on the cell surface, thereby abolishing Dpp gradient formation. We find that in the absence of Dpp spreading, wing disc patterning is lost; however, lateral cells still divide at normal rates. These data are consistent with the growth equalization model, but do not fit a global temporal rule model in the wing imaginal disc."
https://openalex.org/W1948118029,"Capturing the full potential of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neurons in disease modeling and regenerative medicine requires analysis in complex functional systems. Here we establish optogenetic control in human PSC-derived spinal motorneurons and show that co-culture of these cells with human myoblast-derived skeletal muscle builds a functional all-human neuromuscular junction that can be triggered to twitch upon light stimulation. To model neuromuscular disease we incubated these co-cultures with IgG from myasthenia gravis patients and active complement. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that selectively targets neuromuscular junctions. We saw a reversible reduction in the amplitude of muscle contractions, representing a surrogate marker for the characteristic loss of muscle strength seen in this disease. The ability to recapitulate key aspects of disease pathology and its symptomatic treatment suggests that this neuromuscular junction assay has significant potential for modeling of neuromuscular disease and regeneration."

Physiol. 1959; 148: 574-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). But the precision of this selectivity is diverse: some neurons are highly selective for orientation, while others are more broadly tuned (Rose and Blakemore, 1974Rose D. Blakemore C.

Many studies have examined the origins of orientation selectivity, and many theories have been proposed to explain its functional role, but the origin and function of its diversity has received relatively little attention. Orientation selectivity arises from the organization of excitatory LGN input (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N.

Ferster D. Membrane potential and firing rate in cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 470-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To dissociate the contributions of these different mechanisms, we measured responses to mixture stimuli that vary in the distribution of their orientation content. We fit these responses with a linear–nonlinear-linear–nonlinear (LN-LN) cascade model, which has its roots in the work of Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N.

The initial linear filtering stage creates basic orientation tuning, which is then modified by subsequent nonlinearities that capture the effects of untuned suppression and spike threshold. The model provides a good account of the diverse orientation selectivity of V1 and V2 cells. Diversity arises from neuron-to-neuron variability in all three model components, but the primary source is the initial filtering stage. Functionally, this diversity permits the efficient encoding of different kinds of stimulus information. Narrowly tuned neurons transmit more information about uniquely oriented stimuli, while broadly tuned neurons transmit more information about orientation mixtures. This specialization may be an adaptation to the diverse orientation content found in the natural environment. Specifically, we show that a population of neurons with mixed orientation selectivity provides better discrimination capabilities for a set of natural images than homogeneous populations of any particular selectivity. These results suggest that tuning diversity originates from variations in the organization of excitatory inputs and improves the ability of the cortex to encode the visual information in nature. The diversity of orientation selectivity in visual cortex can be appreciated by considering the responses of V1 cells to sinusoidal gratings drifting in different directions, as shown for three example neurons in Figure 1A. For each example, the mean response varied with drift direction. Some neurons responded exclusively to a narrow range of stimulus orientations, but others were less selective. The tuning may be conveniently summarized with an orientation selectivity index (OSI)OSI=|∑j=1JRjei2θj|∑j=1J|Rj|,where θj is the orientation and Rj is the response magnitude (with baseline subtracted) for the jth stimulus (Leventhal et al., 1995Leventhal A.G. Thompson K.G. Liu D. Zhou Y. Ault S.J. Concomitant sensitivity to orientation, direction, and color of cells in layers 2, 3, and 4 of monkey striate cortex.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1808-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This index varies between 0 and 1 and does not depend on direction selectivity. Orientation selectivity is broadly distributed over the range from 0 to 1 for both simple and complex cells (Figures 1B and 1C), with a slightly larger median in V2 than in V1 (p = 0.047, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). To examine the computations underlying this diversity of orientation selectivity, we used an LN-LN cascade model (Figure 1D). In the model, the stimulus is processed in two channels, each consisting of a linear filter—one orientation selective and one untuned—followed by rectification. The oriented filters were spatial derivatives of a 2D Gaussian (Figure 1F; see also Figure S4). The channel responses are subtracted, subjected to divisive normalization, and transformed with an instantaneous response nonlinearity whose output drives the firing rate of an inhomogeneous Poisson process. In this model, tuning for orientation arises from the combined action of three different model components. To illustrate this, we simulated tuning curves under changes of each of these components (Figure 1E). First, changes in the orientation selectivity of the linear filter can cause corresponding changes in the overall model orientation tuning (Figure 1E, left). The linear filters in our model are derivatives of a Gaussian and are parameterized by the aspect ratio of the Gaussian and the derivative order (Figure 1F). Both parameters have an effect on the orientation selectivity (Figure 1G). The latter parameter also governs spatial frequency selectivity—the more cycles of modulation within the receptive field, the narrower the spatial frequency selectivity (Figure 1H) (Tolhurst and Thompson, 1981Tolhurst D.J. Thompson I.D. On the variety of spatial frequency selectivities shown by neurons in area 17 of the cat.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 213: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Second, the nonlinear function that is applied to the untuned component can either increase or decrease overall orientation tuning specificity relative to that of the linear filter (Figure 1E, middle) without changing receptive field structure. Specifically, overall tuning width depends on the baseline value of the untuned component, which (depending on its sign) either facilitates or suppresses responses to non-optimal stimuli. Untuned suppression can sharpen orientation tuning (Xing et al., 2005Xing D. Shapley R.M. Hawken M.J. Ringach D.L. Effect of stimulus size on the dynamics of orientation selectivity in Macaque V1.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 94: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) while untuned facilitation can broaden it. Third, changes in the final response (transduction) nonlinearity have a direct effect on the model orientation tuning (Figure 1E, right), again without changing the receptive field structure. For our model, which uses a power law nonlinearity, exponents larger than one yield an accelerating nonlinearity that sharpens model orientation tuning, whereas smaller exponents broaden it. Since intracellular recordings indicate that spike threshold exclusively sharpens tuning (Carandini and Ferster, 2000Carandini M. Ferster D. Membrane potential and firing rate in cat primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 470-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Priebe et al., 2004Priebe N.J. Mechler F. Carandini M. Ferster D. The contribution of spike threshold to the dichotomy of cortical simple and complex cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we constrain our model fits to use exponents greater than one. Finally, it is worth noting that divisive normalization in our model does not alter stimulus selectivity but simply rescales responses, since we assume a normalization signal that is untuned for orientation (Heeger, 1992Heeger D.J. Normalization of cell responses in cat striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). How can the contributions of these mechanisms to orientation selectivity be isolated? The initial filter is linear and must obey the principle of superposition: the response to a sum of stimuli is equal to the sum of responses to the individual stimuli. The other two model components are nonlinear and will cause deviations from superposition. Responses to linear mixtures of oriented stimuli therefore offer a way to separate the effects of linear and nonlinear mechanisms. To distinguish the effects of the nonlinear model components, we consider their operation in detail. Inhibition and nonlinear transduction both refine selectivity by vetoing weak filter responses. But a crucial difference is that the vetoing power of inhibitory mechanisms scales with stimulus contrast, while a threshold imposes a contrast-independent veto. Responses to mixture stimuli that vary in contrast therefore offer a way to disentangle the specific contributions of excitation, inhibition, and transduction to orientation selectivity. For a subset of our cells, we measured responses to mixtures of incoherently drifting sinusoidal gratings whose orientations were spaced at 20° intervals and whose orientation-dependent contrasts followed a circular Gaussian profile centered on a particular orientation (spread 0°–55°, Figure 2A). We presented each stimulus at 16 center orientations and at high and low total contrast (100% and 33%, respectively). To fully identify the linear filter (Figure 1F), we also characterized spatial frequency selectivity by measuring responses to a collection of high-contrast single gratings of different spatial frequency presented at the preferred orientation. For each cell, we fit the LN-LN model to the full set of responses to the orientation mixtures and single component gratings, adjusting model parameters to maximize the likelihood under a modulated Poisson spiking model (Goris et al., 2014Goris R.L.T. Movshon J.A. Simoncelli E.P. Partitioning neuronal variability.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). We verified that this set of measurements yields data that are sufficiently rich to unambiguously identify the different model components (see Figure S5). The mixture stimuli revealed differences between cells that were not evident from grating responses alone. Consider the actual and predicted responses for two example V1 cells (Figure 2B). These neurons had nearly identical tuning when stimulated with single gratings (OSI = 0.94 for neuron 1 and 0.95 for neuron 2). But their responses to mixture stimuli differed markedly. Neuron 1 responded selectively to all high-contrast mixture stimuli, though its response magnitude fell with stimulus spread. In contrast, neuron 2 responded only to stimuli with spread of 20° or less (Figure 2B). Moreover, reducing the contrast of a single grating to 33% rescaled the responses of neuron 1 but silenced neuron 2 (Figure 2B). The fitted model (solid colored lines) accurately captures the behaviors of both neurons and explains why they differ (Figures 2C and 2D): neuron 1’s model has a more selective filter than neuron 2’s (filter OSI: 0.86 versus 0.47), but weaker inhibition (gain untuned channel: 0.05 versus –0.48) and a slightly milder response nonlinearity (power law exponent: 3.8 versus 4.6). These differences in mechanism are also reflected in the spatial frequency tuning, which was narrow for neuron 1 but broad for neuron 2 (Figure 2E). Neuron 1’s model fit is rather extreme in the selectivity of its filter; neuron 2’s fit is rather extreme in the strength of untuned suppression. Additional example neurons and model fits are shown in Figure S1. The fitted model predicts tuning curves for the different mixture stimuli that are in excellent agreement with the measured responses in V1 (r = 0.93, median correlation between the predicted and measured mean spike counts for hold-out data in a 10-fold cross-validation analysis; see Experimental Procedures) and V2 (r = 0.88). Although small, this difference is significant (p = 0.0013, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), indicating that the model better captures V1 responses than V2 responses. To assess the model’s goodness of fit more explicitly, we compared the log-probability of the data with a simulated reference distribution (see Experimental Procedures). This test indicates the degree to which the model-predicted spike count distributions capture the observed responses on a trial-by-trial basis. For 73 of 80 neurons, the model fit cannot be rejected at a significance level of 5%. We elected not to remove the remaining cells from the data-set, although doing so does not affect any of the following results. The full model explains 86% (V1) and 55% (V2) of the diversity of orientation selectivity across the population (Figure 3A). Our measure of explained diversity is analogous to explained variance in a regression model, but it captures both the overall correlation between observed and predicted values of OSI and the systematic errors in the prediction (see Experimental Procedures). We wondered how much each recovered model component contributed to the tuning diversity of the population. We examined the relationship between each of the three components—the selectivity of the filter, the gain of the untuned component, and the steepness of transduction—and the observed orientation selectivity. Recall Figure 1E, in which we illustrated three families of tuning curves created by changing different mechanisms. In Figure 3B, we plot three parametric families showing the effects of these manipulations. The upper curves each pass through points corresponding to the OSI values of the tuning curves in Figure 1E. The other curves in each panel of Figure 3B show the effects of changing the values of the unvaried mechanisms (over the range of values fit to the data), revealing the complex interdependence of the effects of these parameters on the OSI. Now compare these patterns with the relationships between the three model components and the observed OSI (Figure 3C). In V1 (upper panels), filter selectivity and orientation selectivity are well correlated (r = 0.59, p < 0.001, Spearman correlation). But the other two model components also correlate with OSI: r = –0.55 (p < 0.001) for the untuned component, and r = 0.46 (p < 0.001) for the response exponent. Results from V2 (lower panels) largely recapitulate those from V1: variation in the filter stage has the strongest association with tuning diversity (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), followed by the untuned component (r = –0.45, p < 0.01), and the response nonlinearity (r = 0.32, p = 0.051). Though the three components have similar correlations with OSI in V1 and V2, their actions are not all identical. In V1, the untuned component excites most neurons and therefore reduces orientation selectivity (0.067 ± 0.033, mean gain of untuned component ± SEM); in V2, it mostly inhibits responses (–0.10 ± 0.044) and consequently sharpens tuning. This difference remains significant when controlling for the different distributions of orientation selectivity in these samples of V1 and V2 neurons (ANCOVA, F1,76 = 6.5, p = 0.013). To compare the explanatory power of each component, we fit restricted versions of the model in which only one parameter was allowed to vary, while the two other parameters were held fixed at the median of values estimated across all neurons under the full model (filter aspect ratio = 2.1, filter derivative order = 0.75, gain untuned component = 0, response exponent = 2.15). Consider the goodness of fit of the different models (Figure 4A). The full model (ordinate) predicts the measured tuning curves for the different mixture stimuli better than any of the restricted models (top row). This means that tuning diversity in V1 and V2 originate from multiple sources. Among the restricted models, the one in which the filter width is allowed to vary (abscissa) has the highest predictive accuracy (left column). This model is also the one that best explains the measured diversity in orientation selectivity (Figure 4B), which suggests that variability in the filtering stage is the main source of tuning diversity. The restricted model in which the untuned component is allowed to vary comes close in performance to the best restricted model in V1 (81.6% versus 87% explained diversity) but not in V2 (33.7% versus 55.5%). This likely results from the different actions of the untuned component in the two areas (Figure 3C). We conclude that the tuning diversity in visual cortex is due to multiple factors, of which the most important is variability in the filtering stage. In the LN-LN model, selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency both emerge from a linear filter (Figures 1F–1H), and both are modified by the untuned component and the response nonlinearity. Cortical neurons differ in the sharpness of their spatial frequency tuning (Figure 2E) (De Valois et al., 1982De Valois R.L. Albrecht D.G. Thorell L.G. Spatial frequency selectivity of cells in macaque visual cortex.Vision Res. 1982; 22: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, Xing et al., 2004Xing D. Ringach D.L. Shapley R. Hawken M.J. Correlation of local and global orientation and spatial frequency tuning in macaque V1.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our experiments primarily probed orientation tuning, but we also measured spatial frequency tuning, and we wondered whether our model could also account for its diversity. For single gratings, the spatial frequency tuning of the unrestricted model was strongly correlated with the measured tuning in V1 (r = 0.95, median correlation between the predicted and measured mean spike counts) and V2 (r = 0.92, Figure 5A). The spatial frequency bandwidth at half height computed from the unrestricted model therefore reasonably approximates the observed bandwidth in V1 (Figure 5B, 61.5% of diversity explained). The model gives a poorer account of V2 diversity (30% explained), in part due to noisy data (the level of explainable diversity in V2 is low, as indicated by the reduced bound in Figure 5C). By analogy with the procedure we described earlier for orientation, we also asked how well restricted versions of the model account for spatial frequency tuning diversity. In V1 and V2, the restricted models all explain a similar fraction of the measured diversity (Figure 5C). In V1, restricted models explain less diversity than the full model (Figure 5C), suggesting that differences in spatial frequency tuning arise from multiple sources. With the caveat that we only made measurements with single gratings and not spatial frequency mixtures, we conclude that spatial frequency tuning diversity in visual cortex arises from the same factors that create diversity in the orientation domain. As others have previously reported, selectivity for both orientation and spatial frequency are also related to other elements of receptive field structure, such as preferred spatial frequency, size, and phase sensitivity (“simple” versus “complex” cells) (De Valois et al., 1982De Valois R.L. Albrecht D.G. Thorell L.G. Spatial frequency selectivity of cells in macaque visual cortex.Vision Res. 1982; 22: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, Xing et al., 2004Xing D. Ringach D.L. Shapley R. Hawken M.J. Correlation of local and global orientation and spatial frequency tuning in macaque V1.J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In our sample, the strongest of these effects—and the only one to achieve statistical significance—was the relationship between orientation selectivity and preferred spatial frequency. Interestingly, the variation in orientation selectivity with preferred spatial frequency seems to result from two distinct mechanisms, one captured in the model by its linear filter and one captured by the transduction nonlinearity (Figure S2). Neurons with different degrees of selectivity may be adapted to signal information from particular types of image content. Consider the responses of a broadly tuned example neuron to stimuli with different orientation dispersion (Figure 6A). This cell responded less selectively but more robustly to orientation mixtures than the narrowly tuned example cells shown in Figure 2B. This suggests that there exists a trade-off between selectivity and robustness that might enable less selective neurons to transmit more information about orientation mixtures. To quantify how much orientation information individual neurons transmit, we estimated Fisher information from the observed responses (Figure 6A; see Experimental Procedures). This statistic expresses the accuracy with which stimulus orientations are represented and provides a lower bound on discrimination thresholds of an observer whose decisions are based solely on this neuron (Seriès et al., 2009Seriès P. Stocker A.A. Simoncelli E.P. Is the homunculus “aware” of sensory adaptation?.Neural Comput. 2009; 21: 3271-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We computed how much information each neuron carries, taking into account the number of neurons needed to cover the entire orientation domain (see Experimental Procedures). We refer to this statistic as Fisher information per neuron (FI/N). The relationship between FI/N and orientation selectivity is shown in Figure 6B for five values of orientation dispersion. For simple gratings (left, red), as one might expect, FI/N increases with selectivity, so that more selective neurons convey more information about orientation (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). For broadly dispersed stimuli (right, purple), however, the relationship is reversed—the less selective neurons carry more information about orientation (r = –0.30, p = 0.006). The reasons are twofold. First, the response of highly selective neurons falls when the orientation distribution is broad (Figure 2B). Less selective neurons, on the other hand, remain responsive and more or less equally selective for all values of orientation dispersion (Figure 6A). Second, narrow populations require more cells to cover the orientation domain than broad populations. For broadly dispersed stimuli, the Fisher information for narrow and broad populations is similar, but the FI/N decreases with orientation selectivity. We conclude that narrowly tuned neurons transmit more information about the orientation of simple oriented stimuli, while broadly tuned neurons transmit more information about orientation mixtures. What perceptual role might tuning diversity serve? Consider the distribution of image energy across the Fourier spectrum in small image patches sampled from artificial and natural stimuli (Figures 7A and 7B ). For a sine wave grating, all energy is concentrated around a single orientation; for a random noise sample, the energy is typically distributed across many orientations (Figure 7B). In the natural environment, local image energy is sometimes concentrated at a single orientation (e.g., at the edge of an object) but is often more broadly distributed (e.g., at a corner or an isolated bright or dark spot). To characterize this with a single number, we computed an orientation concentration index (OCI) using the same formula we used to measure orientation selectivity for cortical neurons. Across a large number of local patches drawn from natural images, orientation concentration is approximately uniformly distributed and strikingly similar to th"

However, the regulatory mechanisms of MYCN expression in NB still remain largely unknown. In this study, through mining public microarray databases and analyzing the cis-regulatory elements and chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets, we identified CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) as a crucial transcription factor facilitating the MYCN expression in NB. RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay, RNA pull down and in vitro binding assay indicated the physical interaction between CTCF and MYCN opposite strand (MYCNOS), a natural noncoding RNA surrounding the MYNC promoter. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that MYCNOS facilitated the recruitment of CTCF to its binding sites within the MYCN promoter to induce chromatin remodeling, resulting in enhanced MYCN levels and altered downstream gene expression, in cultured NB cell lines. CTCF cooperated with MYCNOS to suppress the differentiation and promote the growth, invasion and metastasis of NB cells in vitro and in vivo. In clinical NB tissues and cell lines, CTCF and MYCNOS were upregulated and positively correlated with MYCN expression. CTCF was an independent prognostic factor for unfavorable outcome of NB, and patients with high MYCNOS expression had lower survival probability. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CTCF cooperates with noncoding RNA MYCNOS to exhibit oncogenic activity that affects the aggressiveness and progression of NB through transcriptional upregulation of MYCN."

Key features that distinguish iridoid synthase from its close homolog progesterone 5β-reductase are highlighted.

Here we demonstrate that efficient class D β-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing a wide array of β-lactam substrates are widely disseminated in various species of environmental Gram-positive organisms.

One way that people may come to recognize that their local climate is changing is through information provided by local TV weather forecasters. Using random digit dialing, 2,000 adult local TV news viewers in Virginia were surveyed to determine whether routine exposure to local TV weather forecasts influences their perceptions of extreme weather in Virginia, and their perceptions about climate change more generally. Results indicate that paying attention to TV weather forecasts is associated with beliefs that extreme weather is becoming more frequent in Virginia, which in turn is associated with stronger beliefs and concerns about climate change. These associations were strongest for individuals who trust their local TV weathercaster as a source of information about climate change, and for those who identify as politically conservative or moderate. The findings add support to the literature suggesting that TV weathercasters can play an important role in educating the public about climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2145191832,"The Rb-E2F axis is an important pathway involved in cell-cycle control that is deregulated in a number of cancers. E2f transcription factors have distinct roles in the control of cell proliferation, cell survival and differentiation in a variety of tissues. We have previously shown that E2fs are important downstream targets of a CSF-1 signaling cascade involved in myeloid development. In cancer, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are recruited to the tumor stroma in response to cytokines secreted by tumor cells, and are believed to facilitate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Using the MMTV-Polyoma Middle T antigen (PyMT) mouse model of human ductal carcinoma, we show that the specific ablation of E2f3 in TAMs, but not in tumor epithelial cells, attenuates lung metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. Histological analysis and gene expression profiling suggest that E2f3 does not impact the proliferation or survival of TAMs, but rather controls a novel gene expression signature associated with cytoskeleton rearrangements, cell migration and adhesion. This E2f3 TAM gene expression signature was sufficient to predict cancer recurrence and overall survival of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients. Interestingly, we find that E2f3b but not E2f3a levels are elevated in TAMs from PyMT mammary glands relative to controls, suggesting a differential role for these isoforms in metastasis. In summary, these findings identify E2f3 as a key transcription factor in TAMs, which influences the tumor microenvironment and tumor cell metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2233631376,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event that is involved in the invasion and dissemination of cancer cells. Although typically considered as having tumour-suppressive properties, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling is altered during cancer and has been associated with the invasion of cancer cells and metastasis. In this study, we report a previously unknown role for the cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukaemia (cPML) tumour suppressor in TGF-β signalling-induced regulation of prostate cancer-associated EMT and invasion. We demonstrate that cPML promotes a mesenchymal phenotype and increases the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of TGF-β canonical signalling pathway through the induction of Sma and Mad related family 2 and 3 (SMAD2 and SMAD3) phosphorylation. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic localization of promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) is mediated by its nuclear export in a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-dependent manner. This was clinically tested in prostate cancer tissue and shown that cytoplasmic PML and CRM1 co-expression correlates with reduced disease-specific survival. In summary, we provide evidence of dysfunctional TGF-β signalling occurring at an early stage in prostate cancer. We show that this disease pathway is mediated by cPML and CRM1 and results in a more aggressive cancer cell phenotype. We propose that the targeting of this pathway could be therapeutically exploited for clinical benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2152504326,"Objectives Previous non–simultaneous PET/MR studies have shown heterogeneous results about the correlation between standardized uptake values (SUVs) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs). The aim of this study was to investigate correlations in patients with primary and recurrent tumors using a simultaneous PET/MRI system which could lead to a better understanding of tumor biology and might play a role in early response assessment. Methods We included 31 patients with histologically confirmed primary (n = 14) or recurrent cervical cancer (n = 17) who underwent simultaneous whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/MRI comprising DWI. Image analysis was performed by a radiologist and a nuclear physician who identified tumor margins and quantified ADC and SUV. Pearson correlations were calculated to investigate the association between ADC and SUV. Results 92 lesions were detected. We found a significant inverse correlation between SUVmax and ADCmin (r = -0.532, p = 0.05) in primary tumors as well as in primary metastases (r = -0.362, p = 0.05) and between SUVmean and ADCmin (r = -0.403, p = 0.03). In recurrent local tumors we found correlations for SUVmax and ADCmin (r = -0.747, p = 0.002) and SUVmean and ADCmin (r = -0.773, p = 0.001). Associations for recurrent metastases were not significant (p>0.05). Conclusions Our study demonstrates the feasibility of fast and reliable measurement of SUV and ADC with simultaneous PET/MRI. In patients with cervical cancer we found significant inverse correlations for SUV and ADC which could play a major role for further tumor characterization and therapy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2191633397,"Ras GTPases are activated by RasGEFs and inactivated by RasGAPs, which stimulate the hydrolysis of RasGTP to inactive RasGDP. GTPase-impairing somatic mutations in RAS genes, such as KRASG12D, are among the most common oncogenic events in metastatic cancer. A different type of cancer Ras signal, driven by overexpression of the RasGEF RasGRP1 (Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 1), was recently implicated in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and murine models, in which RasGRP1 T-ALLs expand in response to treatment with interleukins (ILs) 2, 7 and 9. Here, we demonstrate that IL-2/7/9 stimulation activates Erk and Akt pathways downstream of Ras in RasGRP1 T-ALL but not in normal thymocytes. In normal lymphocytes, RasGRP1 is recruited to the membrane by diacylglycerol (DAG) in a phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ)-dependent manner. Surprisingly, we find that leukemic RasGRP1-triggered Ras-Akt signals do not depend on acute activation of PLCγ to generate DAG but rely on baseline DAG levels instead. In agreement, using three distinct assays that measure different aspects of the RasGTP/GDP cycle, we established that overexpression of RasGRP1 in T-ALLs results in a constitutively high GTP-loading rate of Ras, which is constantly counterbalanced by hydrolysis of RasGTP. KRASG12D T-ALLs do not show constitutive GTP loading of Ras. Thus, we reveal an entirely novel type of leukemogenic Ras signals that is based on a RasGRP1-driven increased in flux through the RasGTP/GDP cycle, which is mechanistically very different from KRASG12D signals. Our studies highlight the dynamic balance between RasGEF and RasGAP in these T-ALLs and put forth a new model in which IL-2/7/9 decrease RasGAP activity."
https://openalex.org/W2168544451,"Background Jellyfish contain diverse toxins and other bioactive components. However, large-scale identification of novel toxins and bioactive components from jellyfish has been hampered by the low efficiency of traditional isolation and purification methods. Results We performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of the tentacle tissue of the jellyfish Cyanea capillata. A total of 51,304,108 reads were obtained and assembled into 50,536 unigenes. Of these, 21,357 unigenes had homologues in public databases, but the remaining unigenes had no significant matches due to the limited sequence information available and species-specific novel sequences. Functional annotation of the unigenes also revealed general gene expression profile characteristics in the tentacle of C. capillata. A primary goal of this study was to identify putative toxin transcripts. As expected, we screened many transcripts encoding proteins similar to several well-known toxin families including phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases and serine protease inhibitors. In addition, some transcripts also resembled molecules with potential toxic activities, including cnidarian CfTX-like toxins with hemolytic activity, plancitoxin-1, venom toxin-like peptide-6, histamine-releasing factor, neprilysin, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, vascular endothelial growth factor A, angiotensin-converting enzyme-like and endothelin-converting enzyme 1-like proteins. Most of these molecules have not been previously reported in jellyfish. Interestingly, we also characterized a number of transcripts with similarities to proteins relevant to several degenerative diseases, including Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. This is the first description of degenerative disease-associated genes in jellyfish. Conclusion We obtained a well-categorized and annotated transcriptome of C. capillata tentacle that will be an important and valuable resource for further understanding of jellyfish at the molecular level and information on the underlying molecular mechanisms of jellyfish stinging. The findings of this study may also be used in comparative studies of gene expression profiling among different jellyfish species."
https://openalex.org/W2155987300,"Calcium, as the most widely accepted messenger, plays an important role in plant stress responses through calcium-dependent signaling pathways. The calmodulin-like family genes (CMLs) encode Ca2+ sensors and function in signaling transduction in response to environmental stimuli. However, until now, the function of plant CML proteins, especially soybean CMLs, is largely unknown. Here, we isolated a Glycine soja CML protein GsCML27, with four conserved EF-hands domains, and identified it as a calcium-binding protein through far-UV CD spectroscopy. We further found that expression of GsCML27 was induced by bicarbonate, salt and osmotic stresses. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GsCML27 in Arabidopsis enhanced plant tolerance to bicarbonate stress, but decreased the salt and osmotic tolerance during the seed germination and early growth stages. Furthermore, we found that ectopic expression of GsCML27 decreases salt tolerance through modifying both the cellular ionic (Na+, K+) content and the osmotic stress regulation. GsCML27 ectopic expression also decreased the expression levels of osmotic stress-responsive genes. Moreover, we also showed that GsCML27 localized in the whole cell, including cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nucleus in Arabidopsis protoplasts and onion epidermal cells, and displayed high expression in roots and embryos. Together, these data present evidence that GsCML27 as a Ca2+-binding EF-hand protein plays a role in plant responses to bicarbonate, salt and osmotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2190768709,"Targeted therapies are effective in subsets of lung cancers with EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations. Large-scale genomics have recently expanded the lung cancer landscape with FGFR1 amplification found in 10-20% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, the response rates have been low for biomarker-directed fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor therapy in SCC, which contrasts to the relatively high rates of response seen in EGFR mutant and ALK-translocated lung cancers treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and ALK inhibitors, respectively. In order to better understand the low response rates of FGFR1-amplified lung cancers to FGFR inhibitors, relationships between gene copy number, mRNA expression and protein expression of FGFR1 were assessed in cell lines, tumor specimens and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The importance of these factors for the sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors was determined by analyzing drug screen data and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. We report that there was a discrepancy between FGFR1 amplification level and FGFR1 protein expression in a number of these cell lines, and the cancers with unexpectedly low FGFR1 expression were uniformly resistant to the different FGFR inhibitors. Further interrogation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in these discordant cell lines revealed co-activation of HER2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) caused by gene amplification or ligand overexpression maintained phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MEK/ERK signaling even in the presence of FGFR inhibitor. Accordingly, co-inhibition of FGFR1 and HER2 or PDGFRα led to enhanced drug responses. In contrast, FGFR1-amplified high FGFR1 protein-expressing lung cancers are sensitive to FGFR inhibitor monotherapy by downregulating ERK signaling. Addition of a PI3K inhibitor to these high FGFR1 protein-expressing cancers further sensitized them to FGFR inhibitor. These data reveal that biomarker-directed trials for FGFR1-amplified SCC require assessment of FGFR1 protein expression and uncover novel therapeutic strategies for FGFR1-amplified SCC with low FGFR1 protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2284248752,"Fallopian tubal epithelium is a candidate for the origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Transferrin-containing follicular fluid and/or retrograde menstrual blood are possible risk factors for carcinogenesis. Accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-DSBs) in the fallopian tubal epithelium is considered to play an important role in the development of cancer. However, the mechanisms by which DNA-DSBs accumulate have not yet been fully elucidated. The hydroxyl radical, which is produced in a Fenton reaction catalyzed by an iron ion, serves as a potent DNA-DSB-inducing molecule, raising the potential of an iron ion transporter of transferrin in the formation of DNA-DSBs. We studied the potential involvement of transferrin in DNA damage and the development of ovarian cancer. Treatment with transferrin facilitated the formation of histone 2AX phosphorylated at Serine 139 (γH2AX), which is known as a DNA-DSB marker, in human fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells and A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), but not transferrin receptor 2, suppressed the transferrin uptake and consequent formation of γH2AX. As hydroxyl radicals in reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in DNA-DSBs, the formation of ROS was determined. Treatment with TfR1-specific small interference RNAs significantly diminished transferrin-induced formation of ROS. Moreover, TfR1-dependent uptake of transferrin was revealed to augment the formation of DNA-DSBs in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which served as a substrate for the Fenton reaction. An ex vivo study with murine fallopian tubes further demonstrated that transferrin treatment introduced DNA-DSBs in the fallopian tubal epithelium. Collectively, these data suggested that the transferrin-TfR1 axis accounts for the induction of DNA-DSBs that potentially lead to DNA damage/genome instability. These findings also suggested that exposure to transferrin initiates and promotes the development of ovarian cancer by aiding the accumulation of DNA-DSBs in the fallopian tubal epithelium."

Our study aimed to understand date palm sap consumption habits of rural residents and factors associated with consumption. In November-December 2012 the field team interviewed adult respondents from randomly selected villages from Rajbari and Kushtia Districts in Bangladesh. We calculated the proportion of people who consumed raw sap and had heard about a disease from raw sap consumption. We assessed the factors associated with raw sap consumption by calculating prevalence ratios (PR) adjusted for village level clustering effects. Among the 1,777 respondents interviewed, half (50%) reported drinking raw sap during the previous sap collection season and 37% consumed raw sap at least once per month. Few respondents (5%) heard about NiV. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported hearing about a disease transmitted through raw sap consumption, inclusive of a 10% who related it with milder illness like diarrhea, vomiting or indigestion rather than NiV. Respondents who harvested date palm trees in their household were more likely to drink sap than those who did not own date palm trees (79% vs. 65% PR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3, p<0.001). When sap was available, respondents who heard about a disease from raw sap consumption were just as likely to drink it as those who did not hear about a disease (69% vs. 67%, PR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1, p = 0.512). Respondents' knowledge of NiV was low. They might not have properly understood the risk of NiV, and were likely to drink sap when it was available. Implementing strategies to increase awareness about the risks of NiV and protect sap from bats might reduce the risk of NiV transmission."

Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis, it is unclear whether Snail is involved in HCV core-induced dysregulation of E-cadherin. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which HCV core induces E-cadherin repression and the role of Snail in HCV core-mediated invasiveness and metastasis. We found that HCV infection, especially HCV core expression, effectively induced the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatoma cells by repressing E-cadherin. HCV core interacted with Snail and enhanced its binding to the E-box in the promoter region of E-cadherin, leading to decreased E-cadherin promoter activity. We found that HCV core, Snail, and the histone deacetylases HDAC1/HDAC2 formed a co-repressor complex at the E-cadherin promoter. Moreover, HCV core was shown to stabilize Snail through activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway. Silencing Snail expression restored E-cadherin expression and inhibited HCV core-promoted tumor growth and distant lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrated that HCV core induced EMT by interacting with the transcriptional repressor complex Snail/HDACs at the E-cadherin promoter, which led to E-cadherin repression and increased invasiveness of hepatoma cells. These findings increase understanding of factors regulating metastasis in hepatoma and may ultimately lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2231749743,"Our previous studies have suggested that the α1 Na/K-ATPase interacts with Src to form a receptor complex. In vitro binding assays indicate an interaction between second cytosolic domain (CD2) of Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit and Src SH2 domain. Since SH2 domain targets Src to specific signaling complexes, we expressed CD2 as a cytosolic protein and studied whether it could act as a Src SH2 ligand in LLC-PK1 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated a direct binding of CD2 to Src, consistent with the in vitro binding data. Functionally, CD2 expression increased basal Src activity, suggesting a Src SH2 ligand-like property of CD2. Consistently, we found that CD2 expression attenuated several signaling pathways where Src plays an important role. For instance, although it increased surface expression of Na/K-ATPase, it decreased ouabain-induced activation of Src and ERK by blocking the formation of Na/K-ATPase/Src complex. Moreover, it also attenuated cell attachment-induced activation of Src/FAK. Consequently, CD2 delayed cell spreading, and inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, these effects appear to be Src-specific because CD2 expression had no effect on EGF-induced activation of EGF receptor and ERK. Hence, the new findings indicate the importance of Na/K-ATPase/Src interaction in ouabain-induced signal transduction, and support the proposition that the CD2 peptide may be utilized as a Src SH2 ligand capable of blocking Src-dependent signaling pathways via a different mechanism from a general Src kinase inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W2222991139,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent form of cancer with a poor prognosis and with limited possibilities of medical intervention. It has been shown that over 100 putative driver genes are associated with multiple recurrently altered pathways in HCC, suggesting that multiple pathways will need to be inhibited for any therapeutic method. mRNA processing is regulated by a complex RNA-protein network that is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis. THOC5, a member of mRNA export complex, has a role in less than 1% of mRNA processing, and is required for cell growth and differentiation, but not for cell survival in normal fibroblasts, hepatocytes and macrophages. In this report, we show that 50% depletion of THOC5 in human HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 induced apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis using THOC5-depleted cells revealed that 396 genes, such as transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 4 (TMBIM4), transmembrane emp24-like trafficking protein 10 (Tmed10) and D-tyrosyl-tRNA deacylase 2 (Dtd2) genes were downregulated in both cell lines. The depletion of one of these THOC5 target genes in Huh7 or HepG2 did not significantly induce cell death, suggesting that these may be fine tuners for HCC cell survival. However, the depletion of a combination of these genes synergistically increased the number of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling)-positive HCC. It must be noted that the depletion of these genes did not induce cell death in the hepatocyte cell line, THLE-2 cells. THOC5 expression was enhanced in 78% of cytological differentiation grading G2 and G3 tumor in primary HCC. Furthermore, the expression of a putative glycoprotein, Tmed10, is correlated to THOC5 expression level in primary HCCs, suggesting that this protein may be a novel biomarker for HCC. These data imply that the suppression of the multiple THOC5 target genes may represent a novel strategy for HCC therapy."

In logographic Chinese characters, neither segmental nor tonal information is explicitly represented, whereas in Pinyin, an alphabetic transcription of the character, both are explicitly represented. Two primed naming experiments were conducted in which the targets were always written characters. When logographic characters served as the primes (Experiment 1), syllable segmental and tonal information appeared to be represented and encoded as an integral unit which in turn facilitated target character naming. When Pinyin served as the primes (Experiment 2), the explicit phonetic representation facilitated encoding of both segmental and suprasegmental information, but with later access to suprasegmental information. In addition, Chinese speakers were faster to name characters than Pinyin in a simple naming task (Experiment 3), suggesting that Pinyin may be read via a phonological assembly route, whereas characters may be read via a lexical route. Taken together, our findings point to the need to consider the contributions of both segmental and suprasegmental information and the time course in the well-established models for reading aloud, as well as the cognitive mechanisms underlying the reading aloud of logographic characters versus alphabetic Pinyin script."
https://openalex.org/W2146469143,"Hyperglycemia following solid organ transplant is common among patients without pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM). Post-transplant hyperglycemia can occur once or multiple times, which if continued, causes new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT).To study if the first and recurrent incidence of hyperglycemia are affected differently by immunosuppressive regimens, demographic and medical-related risk factors, and inpatient hyperglycemic conditions (i.e., an emphasis on the time course of post-transplant complications).We conducted a retrospective analysis of 407 patients who underwent kidney transplantation at Mayo Clinic Arizona. Among these, there were 292 patients with no signs of DM prior to transplant. For this category of patients, we evaluated the impact of (1) immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus, and steroid), (2) demographic and medical-related risk factors, and (3) inpatient hyperglycemic conditions on the first and recurrent incidence of hyperglycemia in one year post-transplant. We employed two versions of Cox regression analyses: (1) a time-dependent model to analyze the recurrent cases of hyperglycemia and (2) a time-independent model to analyze the first incidence of hyperglycemia.Age (P = 0.018), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.010), and the average trough level of tacrolimus (P<0.0001) are significant risk factors associated with the first incidence of hyperglycemia, while age (P<0.0001), non-White race (P = 0.002), BMI (P = 0.002), HDL cholesterol (P = 0.003), uric acid (P = 0.012), and using steroid (P = 0.007) are the significant risk factors for the recurrent cases of hyperglycemia.This study draws attention to the importance of analyzing the risk factors associated with a disease (specially a chronic one) with respect to both its first and recurrent incidence, as well as carefully differentiating these two perspectives: a fact that is currently overlooked in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2149078481,"For different functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, the acquisition of T2*-weighted scans at a high spatial resolution may be advantageous in terms of time-course signal-to-noise ratio and of BOLD sensitivity when the regions are prone to susceptibility artifacts. In this study, we explore this solution by examining how spatial resolution influences activations elicited when appetizing food pictures are viewed. Twenty subjects were imaged at 3 T with two different voxel volumes, 3.4 μl and 27 μl. Despite the diminution of brain coverage, we found that high-resolution acquisition led to a better detection of activations. Though known to suffer to different degrees from susceptibility artifacts, the activations detected by high spatial resolution were notably consistent with those reported in published activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses, corresponding to taste-responsive regions. Furthermore, these regions were found activated bilaterally, in contrast with previous findings. Both the reduction of partial volume effect, which improves BOLD contrast, and the mitigation of susceptibility artifact, which boosts the signal to noise ratio in certain regions, explained the better detection noted with high resolution. The present study provides further evidences that high spatial resolution is a valuable solution for human BOLD fMRI, especially for studying food-related stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2166766843,"Tumor microenvironment play role in angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. Etoposide, a known topoisomerase II inhibitor induces DNA damage resulting in cell cycle arrest. We developed a novel Etoposide analogue, Quinazolino-4β-amidopodophyllotoxin (C-10) that show better efficacy in regulating cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We evaluated its role on expression of microRNAs-15, 16, 17 and 221 and its targets Bcl-2, STAT3 and VEGF that dictate cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Docking studies clearly demonstrated the binding of Etoposide and C-10 to STAT3. We conclude that combination of Etoposide or C-10 with miR-15, 16, 17 and 221 as a new approach to induce apoptosis and control angiogenesis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2127279278,"Surfers often wear wetsuits while paddling in the ocean. This neoprene covering may be beneficial to upper extremity movement by helping to improve proprioceptive acuity, or it may be detrimental by providing increased resistance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of wearing a wetsuit on muscle activation, upper extremity motion, heart rate, and oxygen consumption during simulated surfboard paddling in the laboratory. Twelve male, recreational surfers performed two paddling trials at a constant workload on a swim bench ergometer both with and without a wetsuit. Kinematic data and EMG were acquired from the right arm via motion capture, and oxygen consumption and heart rate were recorded with a metabolic cart and heart rate monitor. Wearing a wetsuit had no significant effect on oxygen consumption or heart rate. A significant increase in EMG activation was observed for the middle deltoid but not for any of the other shoulder muscle evaluated. Finally, approximate entropy and estimates of the maximum Lyapunov exponent increased significantly for vertical trajectory of the right wrist (i.e. stroke height) when a wetsuit was worn. These results suggest that a 2mm wetsuit has little effect on the energy cost of paddling at lower workloads but does affect arm motion. These changes may be the result of enhanced proprioceptive acuity due to mechanical compression from the wetsuit."
https://openalex.org/W2155435428,"Background As community case management of childhood illness expands in low-income countries, there is a need to assess the quality of care provided by community health workers. This study had the following objectives: 1) examine methods of recruitment of sick children for assessment of quality of care, 2) assess the validity of register review (RR) and direct observation only (DO) compared to direct observation with re-examination (DO+RE), and 3) assess the effect of observation on community health worker performance. Methods We conducted a survey to assess the quality of care provided by Ethiopian Health Extension Workers (HEWs). The sample of children was obtained through spontaneous consultation, HEW mobilization, or recruitment by the survey team. We assessed patient characteristics by recruitment method. Estimates of indicators of quality of care obtained using RR and DO were compared to gold standard estimates obtained through DO+RE. Sensitivity, specificity, and the area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the validity of RR and DO. To assess the Hawthorne effect, we compared estimates from RR for children who were observed by the survey team to estimates from RR for children who were not observed by the survey team. Results Participants included 137 HEWs and 257 sick children in 103 health posts, plus 544 children from patient registers. Children mobilized by HEWs had the highest proportion of severe illness (27%). Indicators of quality of care from RR and DO had high sensitivity for most indicators, but specificity was low. The AUC for different indicators from RR ranged from 0.47 to 0.76, with only one indicator above 0.75. The AUC of indicators from DO ranged from 0.54 to 1.0, with three indicators above 0.75. The differences between estimates of correct care for observed versus not observed children were small. Conclusions Mobilization by HEWs and recruitment by the survey teams were feasible, but potentially biased, methods of obtaining sick children. Register review and DO underestimated performance errors. Our data suggest that being observed had only a small positive effect on the performance of HEWs."
https://openalex.org/W2241287118,"Merlin has broad tumor-suppressor functions as its mutations have been identified in multiple benign tumors and malignant cancers. In all schwannomas, the majority of meningiomas and 1/3 of ependymomas Merlin loss is causative. In neurofibromatosis type 2, a dominantly inherited tumor disease because of the loss of Merlin, patients suffer from multiple nervous system tumors and die on average around age 40. Chemotherapy is not effective and tumor localization and multiplicity make surgery and radiosurgery challenging and morbidity is often considerable. Thus, a new therapeutic approach is needed for these tumors. Using a primary human in vitro model for Merlin-deficient tumors, we report that the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) scaffold, kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), has a vital role in promoting schwannomas development. We show that KSR1 overexpression is involved in many pathological phenotypes caused by Merlin loss, namely multipolar morphology, enhanced cell–matrix adhesion, focal adhesion and, most importantly, increased proliferation and survival. Our data demonstrate that KSR1 has a wider role than MEK1/2 in the development of schwannomas because adhesion is more dependent on KSR1 than MEK1/2. Immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that KSR1 is a novel binding partner of Merlin, which suppresses KSR1’s function by inhibiting the binding between KSR1 and c-Raf. Our proteomic analysis also demonstrates that KSR1 interacts with several Merlin downstream effectors, including E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1. Further functional studies suggests that KSR1 and DCAF1 may co-operate to regulate schwannomas formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that KSR1 serves as a potential therapeutic target for Merlin-deficient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2164360173,"Recombination rate is a complex trait, with genetic and environmental factors shaping observed patterns of variation. Although recent studies have begun to unravel the genetic basis of recombination rate differences between organisms, less attention has focused on the environmental determinants of crossover rates. Here, we test the effect of one ubiquitous environmental pressure–bacterial infection–on global recombination frequency in mammals. We applied MLH1 mapping to assay global crossover rates in male mice infected with the pathogenic bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme Disease, and uninfected control animals. Despite ample statistical power to identify biologically relevant differences between infected and uninfected animals, we find no evidence for a global recombination rate response to bacterial infection. Moreover, broad-scale patterns of crossover distribution, including the number of achiasmate bivalents, are not affected by infection status. Although pathogen exposure can plastically increase recombination in some species, our findings suggest that recombination rates in house mice may be resilient to at least some forms of infection stress. This negative result motivates future experiments with alternative house mouse pathogens to evaluate the generality of this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2415322518,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Although the rapid recurrence of glioblastomas after treatment is a major clinical challenge, the relationships between tumor growth and intracerebral spread remain poorly understood. We have identified the cofilin phosphatase chronophin (gene name: pyridoxal phosphatase, PDXP) as a glial tumor modifier. Monoallelic PDXP loss was frequent in four independent human astrocytic tumor cohorts and increased with tumor grade. We found that aberrant PDXP promoter methylation can be a mechanism leading to further chronophin downregulation in glioblastomas, which correlated with shorter glioblastoma patient survival. Moreover, we observed an inverse association between chronophin protein expression and cofilin phosphorylation levels in glioma tissue samples. Chronophin-deficient glioblastoma cells showed elevated cofilin phosphorylation, an increase in polymerized actin, a higher directionality of cell migration, and elevated in vitro invasiveness. Tumor growth of chronophin-depleted glioblastoma cells xenografted into the immunodeficient mouse brain was strongly impaired. Our study suggests a mechanism whereby the genetic and epigenetic alterations of PDXP resulting in altered chronophin expression may regulate the interplay between glioma cell proliferation and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2110782764,"Breast cancer has various molecular subtypes and displays high heterogeneity. Aberrant DNA methylation is involved in tumor origin, development and progression. Moreover, distinct DNA methylation patterns are associated with specific breast cancer subtypes. We explored DNA methylation patterns in association with gene expression to assess their impact on the prognosis of breast cancer based on Infinium 450K arrays (training set) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The DNA methylation patterns of 12 featured genes that had a high correlation with gene expression were identified through univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and used to define the methylation risk score (MRS). An improved ability to distinguish the power of the DNA methylation pattern from the 12 featured genes (p = 0.00103) was observed compared with the average methylation levels (p = 0.956) or gene expression (p = 0.909). Furthermore, MRS provided a good prognostic value for breast cancers even when the patients had the same receptor status. We found that ER-, PR- or Her2- samples with high-MRS had the worst 5-year survival rate and overall survival time. An independent test set including 28 patients with death as an outcome was used to test the validity of the MRS of the 12 featured genes; this analysis obtained a prognostic value equivalent to the training set. The predict power was validated through two independent datasets from the GEO database. The DNA methylation pattern is a powerful predictor of breast cancer survival, and can predict outcomes of the same breast cancer molecular subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2163585549,"Genetic variation contributes to individual differences in obesity, but defining the exact relationships between naturally occurring genotypes and their effects on fatness remains elusive. As a step toward positional cloning of previously identified body composition quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from F2 crosses of mice from the C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J inbred strains, we sought to recapture them on a homogenous genetic background of consomic (chromosome substitution) strains. Male and female mice from reciprocal consomic strains originating from the C57BL/6ByJ and 129P3/J strains were bred and measured for body weight, length, and adiposity. Chromosomes 2, 7, and 9 were selected for substitution because previous F2 intercross studies revealed body composition QTLs on these chromosomes. We considered a QTL confirmed if one or both sexes of one or both reciprocal consomic strains differed significantly from the host strain in the expected direction after correction for multiple testing. Using these criteria, we confirmed two of two QTLs for body weight (Bwq5-6), three of three QTLs for body length (Bdln3-5), and three of three QTLs for adiposity (Adip20, Adip26 and Adip27). Overall, this study shows that despite the biological complexity of body size and composition, most QTLs for these traits are preserved when transferred to consomic strains; in addition, studying reciprocal consomic strains of both sexes is useful in assessing the robustness of a particular QTL."
https://openalex.org/W2304160376,"The ability of long term non progressors to maintain very low levels of HIV/SIV and a healthy state, involves various host genetic and immunological factors. CD8+ non-cytolytic antiviral response (CNAR) most likely plays an important role in this regard. In order to gain a deeper insight into this unique phenomenon, the ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress viral replication in vitro was investigated in 16 uninfected, longitudinally in 23 SIV-infected long-term non-progressing (LTNPs), and 10 SIV-infected rhesus macaques with progressing disease. An acute infection assay utilizing CD4+ cells from MHC-mismatched monkeys to avoid cytolytic responses was employed. The study has identified CNAR as a long-term stable activity that inversely correlated with plasma viral load. The activity was also detected in CD8+ cells of uninfected macaques, which indicates that CNAR is not necessarily a virus specific response but increases after SIV-infection. Physical contact between CD4+ and CD8+ cells was mainly involved in mediating viral inhibition. Loss of this activity appeared to be due to a loss of CNAR-expressing CD8+ cells as well as a reduction of CNAR-responsive CD4+ cells. In contrast, in vitro viral replication did not differ in CD4+ cells from un-infected macaques, CNAR(+) and CNAR(-) LTNPs. A role for transitional memory cells in supporting CNAR in the macaque model of AIDS was questionable. CNAR appears to represent an important part of the immune response displayed by CD8+ T cells which might be underestimated up to now."
https://openalex.org/W2101267614,"To explore the relationship between TβRII [type II TGFβ (transforming growth factor β) receptor] expression and clinicopathological characteristics, and to evaluate the prognostic significance of TβRII expression in breast cancer.Clinicopathological data and prognostic information of 108 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer who were surgically treated at China Medical University between January 2007 and September 2008 were reviewed and the association between the clinicopathological characteristics and TβRII expression was analyzed by chi-square test and multivariate analysis. The expression of TβRII was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Of the 108 patients, 60 cases were TβRII positive and 48 cases were negative. There was no significant association between TβRII expression of the patients older than 40 years and that of the younger than 40 years (56.0% vs 50.0%; P = 0.742). The TβRII expression rate was significantly increased in patients with lymph node metastasis compared to those without lymph node metastasis (67.40% vs 46.8%; P = 0.033). Statistically significant relationships were found between increasing tumor clinical stage and high TβRII expression (P = 0.011). TβRII expression was not associated with the expression of ER(estrogen receptor), PR, (progesterone receptor), Her-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) (P = 0.925,P = 0.861, and P = 0.840, respectively). Patients with high TβRII expression showed poorer 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with low expression (66.7% vs 45.6%; P = 0.028) by univariate analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated that TβRII was associated with poor DFS (P = 0.011). Subgroup analysis revealed that TβRII expression was associated with shorter DFS in patients with lymph node metastasis, ER-positive, PR-positive or Her-2-negative tumors (P = 0.006, P = 0.016, P = 0.022, and P = 0.033, respectively). Cox regression analysis revealed that high TβRII expression was related to poor 5-year DFS, and it was an independent factor for predicting the poor outcome for breast cancer patients (P = 0.016).High levels of TβRII expression were associated with lymph node metastasis, increasing tumor clinical stage, and poorer 5-year DFS in patients with breast cancer. TβRII may be a potential prognostic marker for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2138087351,"CDK5RAP2 is one of the primary microcephaly genes that are associated with reduced brain size and mental retardation. We have previously shown that human CDK5RAP2 exists as a full-length form (hCDK5RAP2) or an alternatively spliced variant form (hCDK5RAP2-V1) that is lacking exon 32. The equivalent of hCDK5RAP2-V1 has been reported in rat and mouse but the presence of full-length equivalent hCDK5RAP2 in rat and mouse has not been examined. Here, we demonstrate that rat expresses both a full length and an alternatively spliced variant form of CDK5RAP2 that are equivalent to our previously reported hCDK5RAP2 and hCDK5RAP2-V1, repectively. However, mouse expresses only one form of CDK5RAP2 that is equivalent to the human and rat alternatively spliced variant forms. Knowledge of this expression of different forms of CDK5RAP2 in human, rat and mouse is essential in selecting the appropriate model for studies of CDK5RAP2 and primary microcephaly but our findings further indicate the evolutionary divergence of mouse from the human and rat species."
