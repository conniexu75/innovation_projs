https://openalex.org/W3044927477,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic of the severe pneumonia-like disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1. The development of a vaccine is likely to take at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline for approval of a new antiviral therapeutic agent can exceed 10 years. Thus, repurposing of known drugs could substantially accelerate the deployment of new therapies for COVID-19. Here we profiled a library of drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules to identify candidate therapeutic drugs for COVID-19. We report the identification of 100 molecules that inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, including 21 drugs that exhibit dose-response relationships. Of these, thirteen were found to harbour effective concentrations commensurate with probable achievable therapeutic doses in patients, including the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor apilimod2-4 and the cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825 and ONO 5334. Notably, MDL-28170, ONO 5334 and apilimod were found to antagonize viral replication in human pneumocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and apilimod also demonstrated antiviral efficacy in a primary human lung explant model. Since most of the molecules identified in this study have already advanced into the clinic, their known pharmacological and human safety profiles will enable accelerated preclinical and clinical evaluation of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19."

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deconvolves cell types from gene expression, but no technology links cell identity to TF binding sites (TFBS) in those cell types. We present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and use them in single-cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously measuring gene expression and mapping TFBS in single cells. The genomic locations of SRTs are recovered from mRNA, and SRTs deposited by exogenous, TF-transposase fusions can be used to map TFBS. We then present scCC, which map SRTs from scRNA-seq libraries, simultaneously identifying cell types and TFBS in those same cells. We benchmark multiple TFs with this technique. Next, we use scCC to discover BRD4-mediated cell-state transitions in K562 cells. Finally, we map BRD4 binding sites in the mouse cortex at single-cell resolution, establishing a new method for studying TF biology <i>in situ</i>."

However, the relationship and interaction between stromal and epithelial cells is still poorly understood. Herein, we revealed that breast cancer cells have a stronger ability to activate fibroblasts and transform them into myofibroblasts (CAF-like) than normal breast epithelial cells, and this stronger ability occurs through paracrine signaling. In turn, myofibroblasts promote the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and stemness of breast cancer cells. Detailed regulatory mechanisms showed that, compared with normal cells, Survivin is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and secreted extracellularly in the form of exosomes, which are then internalized by fibroblasts. Breast cancer cell–derived survivin up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts and then converts them into myofibroblasts, conversely inducing breast cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results indicate that survivin acts as an activator of the tumor microenvironment and that SOD1 up-regulation in fibroblasts can promote breast cancer progression. These results suggest that targeting survivin and SOD1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.

Breast cancer is a serious threat to the health and lives of women worldwide because its global incidence and mortality rate are 11.6 and 6.6%, respectively, according to 2018 cancer statistics (1Bray F. Ferlay J. Soerjomataram I. Siegel R.L. Torre L.A. Jemal A. Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.CA Cancer J.

Although many strategies have been developed for breast cancer treatment, patients still suffer from a low 5-year survival rate, which is caused mainly by recurrence and metastasis. Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the initiation, treatment, mobility, and relapse of breast cancer (2Quail D.F. Joyce J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19 (24202395): 1423-143710.1038/nm.3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). The TME is a complex and dynamically changing group of cells created during tumor progression that is composed mainly of stromal cell components, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, adipocytes, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, and extracellular matrix (3Hanahan D. Coussens L.M. Accessories to the crime: functions of cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21 (22439926): 309-32210.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar, 4Meads M.B.

Previous reports indicate that it is derived from paracrine signaling, mediated mainly by extracellular cytokines and exosomes, which contribute to the communication between various components of the TME and maintain the malignant states of breast cancer cells (5Scheel C.

Specifically, the paracrine signaling of stromal cells is important in cancer progression because it regulates cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness and chemoresistance, which result in the synergistic effect of cancer cells and their microenvironment (8Mao Y. Keller E.T. Garfield D.H. Shen K. Wang J.

According to the special anatomical structure of the human mammary gland, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant components in the breast tumor microenvironment and are pivotal to the proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and drug resistance of breast cancer cells (9Ali S. Coombes R.C. Endocrine-responsive breast cancer and strategies for combating resistance.Nat. Rev.

CAFs, prepared directly from invasive human mammary carcinomas, contain substantial numbers of myofibroblasts that acquire stronger capacities for growth, migration, and extracellular matrix modification and can secrete more tumor-promoting cytokines, such as MMP-2, TGF-β, SDF-1, and IL-6 (12Fang T. Lv H. Lv G. Li T. Wang C. Han Q. Yu L. Su B. Guo L. Huang S. Cao D. Tang L. Tang S. Wu M.

Commun. 2018; 9 (29335551): 19110.1038/s41467-017-02583-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that some gene mutations in fibroblasts regulate their transformation into CAFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. For example, p62 in fibroblasts promotes tumorigenesis by regulating its own metabolism (13Valencia T. Kim J.Y. Abu-Baker S. Moscat-Pardos J. Ahn C.S. Reina-Campos M. Duran A. Castilla E.A. Metallo C.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J.

TIMP gene family deficiencies are sufficient for fibroblast activation (14Shimoda M. Principe S. Jackson H.W. Luga V. Fang H. Molyneux S.D. Shao Y.W. Aiken A. Waterhouse P.D. Karamboulas C. Hess F.M. Ohtsuka T. Okada Y. Ailles L. Ludwig A. et al.Loss of the Timp gene family is sufficient for the acquisition of the CAF-like cell state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16 (25150980): 889-90110.1038/ncb3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, we also revealed that the aberrant low expression of p85α in fibroblasts facilitates breast cancer cell metastasis by paracrine WNT10B (15Chen Y. Zeng C. Zhan Y. Wang H. Jiang X. Li W. Aberrant low expression of p85α in stromal fibroblasts promotes breast cancer cell metastasis through exosome-mediated paracrine Wnt10b.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (28394344): 4692-470510.1038/onc.2017.100Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Genetic mutations or abnormal expression of specific genes are still considered to be the fundamental causes that alter multiple cellular regulatory pathways and drive breast cancer initiation and progression, although the underlying molecular model of these cancer boosters remains elusive; up to 25% of breast cancer cases are due to one of the few identified rare but highly penetrant genes. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, also known as BIRC5, or baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5, which is highly expressed in breast cancer cells. It is widely considered a potential marker of cancer and a target for developing anticancer drugs (16Altieri D.C. Survivin, cancer networks and pathway-directed drug discovery.Nat. Rev.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that survivin promotes the progression of cancer by participating in cell division, angiogenesis, and drug resistance (19Altieri D.C.

However, the effects and functional roles of extracellular survivin in the breast tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the exosome-mediated paracrine signaling of survivin in breast cancer cells promotes fibroblast activation into myofibroblasts by up-regulating SOD1, and this feedback promotes the proliferation, metastasis, and stemness of breast cancer. Specifically, compared with normal breast epithelial cells, breast cancer cells express more survivin, which can be released extracellularly through exosomes. The activation of fibroblasts is mediated by SOD1 up-regulation after the internalization of breast cancer–derived exosomal survivin. Furthermore, activated fibroblasts promote the proliferation, migration, EMT, and stemness of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study demonstrate the considerable role of breast cancer–derived survivin in activating fibroblasts and reveal combined survivin and SOD1 targeting as a new strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. High ACTA2 and vimentin expression is the most distinguishable feature of myofibroblasts (22Serini G. Gabbiani G. Mechanisms of myofibroblast activity and phenotypic modulation.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250 (10413583): 273-28310.1006/excr.1999.4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Based on an analysis of microarrays from the Oncomine and GEO databases, we found that ACTA2 and vimentin expression was significantly increased in breast tumor stroma compared with normal breast stroma (Fig. 1A). Specifically, ACTA2 and vimentin expression levels were higher in breast tumor fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts, which suggests that a large number of fibroblasts are converted into myofibroblasts in breast cancer tissue (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether breast cancer cells affect fibroblasts during this transition, we treated human normal fibroblast HFF-1 cells with conditioned medium (CM) collected from the normal breast cell line HBL-100 and the breast cancer cell lines BT-549 and MDA-MB-231. Compared with that from normal breast cells, CM from malignant transformed breast cancer cells significantly increased the ACTA2 and vimentin levels (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A), which indicated that breast cancer cells have the potential to promote fibroblast conversion into myofibroblasts. Other characteristics of myofibroblasts included enhanced capabilities of contractility, proliferation, and motility. To further confirm our observation, collagen gel contraction assays indicated that CM from the breast cancer cell lines BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 exhibited an increased ability to induce HFF-1 fibroblast gel contraction (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we found that CM from BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly promoted HFF-1 colony formation and proliferation (Fig. 1, E and F) as well as enhanced cell migration (Fig. 1G and Fig. S1B). In addition, the results showed that HFF-1 cells produced and secreted higher levels of cytokines after treatment with CM from BT-549 or MDA-MB-231 cells than after treatment with CM from HBL-100 cells (Fig. 1H), which means that HFF-1 fibroblasts are greatly activated by treatment with CM of breast cancer. To confirm the results in the cell line, we isolated breast fibroblasts from eight breast cancer patients, including one hyperplasia, two TNM stage I, four TNM stage II, and one TNM stage III, and performed a series of in vitro experiments. Interestingly, breast fibroblasts from the TNM stage II and III patients exhibited more properties of myofibroblasts than those from the hyperplasia and TNM stage I patients (Fig. 1 (I and J) and Fig. S1 (C–E)). Collectively, these data indicate that breast cancer cells promote stromal fibroblast activation and transformation into myofibroblasts. Because the most critical action of myofibroblasts is promoting cancer development, to investigate the role of activated fibroblasts in breast cancer progression, we treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells with CM from breast cancer–educated HFF-1 cells (Fig. S2A). As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), HFF-1 cells educated by cancer cells increased the proliferation and colony formation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells compared with those educated by normal breast HBL-100 cells. Similarly, HFF-1 cells educated by cancer cells exhibited stronger induction of cancer cell migration than those educated by normal cells (Fig. 2 (C and D) and Fig. S2B). EMT, which enables stationary epithelial cells to gain enhanced motility and invasiveness, is known to play an important role in breast cancer progression and drug resistance. As shown in Fig. 2E and Fig. S2C, the mesenchymal markers vimentin and Snail were up-regulated, and the epithelial marker E-cadherin was down-regulated when MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were treated with breast cancer–educated HFF-1 CM compared with HBL-100–educated HFF-1 CM. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis of CD44high/CD24low indicated that compared with HBL-100–educated HFF-1 cells, BT-549– or MDA-MB-231–educated HFF-1 cells also promoted the stemness of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 2F). Further spheroid formation cell assays also confirmed this result (Fig. 2G). Therefore, we concluded that compared with normal breast cells, breast cancer cells contribute to promoting fibroblast activation and in turn facilitate their own progression. Exosome secretion has been recently implicated as an important method of cell communication in the TME (23El Andaloussi S. Mäger I. Breakefield X.O. Wood M.J.A. Extracellular vesicles: biology and emerging therapeutic opportunities.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12 (23584393): 347-35710.1038/nrd3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 24Becker A.

To investigate this hypothesis, we separated the exosomes from the CM of normal breast cells or breast cancer cells and used them to treat HFF-1 cells. EM observations indicated that there were more exosome-like structures located close to the cell membrane in HBL-100 cells than in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3A). Exosomes isolated from CM by the classical isolation method of ultracentrifugation exhibited typical cup-shaped structures and corresponding particle sizes (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, the detection of the exosome marker TSG101, CD9, and the Golgi membrane protein GM130 further verified that we successfully isolated exosomes without cellular contamination (Fig. 3D). Quantitative analysis results showed that the total levels of secreted exosomes were significantly higher in HBL-100 cells than in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3E), which is consistent with previous observations (Fig. 3A). To identify exosome internalization by HFF-1 cells, we labeled exosomes with the lipophilic dye DiD and incubated them with HFF-1 cells for 24 h. The fluorescence microscopy results showed the presence of DiD spots in living recipient fibroblasts, which indicated that the exosomes collected from various breast epithelial cells were transferred into living fibroblasts via active transport (Fig. 3F). Next, to evaluate whether the exosomes derived from breast cancer cells can convert fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, we treated HFF-1 cells with different isolated exosomes. As shown in Fig. 3G and Fig. S2D, the levels of ACTA2 and vimentin in HFF-1 cells were remarkably increased by BT-549– or MDA-MB-231–secreted exosomes. Furthermore, the contraction and migration abilities of HFF-1 cells were markedly enhanced after treatment with BT-549– or MDA-MB-231–derived exosomes compared with HBL-100–derived exosomes (Fig. 3 (H–J) and Fig. S2E). These results demonstrate that exosomes from breast cancer contribute to fibroblast activation. To further confirm the effect of breast cancer cell–derived exosomes in the activation of fibroblasts, the exosome secretion of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 was inhibited by treatment with GW4869 or knockdown of RAB27A (Fig. 4 (A and B) and Fig. S2F). Then conditioned medium was collected to treat HFF-1 cells. As anticipated, the decrease of exosomes in conditioned medium eliminated the up-regulation of ACTA2 and vimentin expression (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2G). Moreover, the collagen contraction ability of HFF-1 was attenuated with the reduction of exosomes (Fig. 4D). In addition, scratch and transwell assays were performed to prove that exosome-reduced conditioned medium loses the ability to promote migration of fibroblasts compared with the control group (Fig. 4 (E and F) and Fig. S3A). Altogether, the above results demonstrate that breast cancer–derived exosomes convert fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. A recent discovery revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a critical regulator of myofibroblast function (13Valencia T. Kim J.Y. Abu-Baker S. Moscat-Pardos J. Ahn C.S. Reina-Campos M. Duran A. Castilla E.A. Metallo C.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Metabolic reprogramming of stromal fibroblasts through p62-mTORC1 signaling promotes inflammation and tumorigenesis.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26 (25002027): 121-13510.1016/j.ccr.2014.05.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the intracellular ROS levels of HFF-1 cells after treatment with breast cancer cell–derived exosomes to assess the role of ROS in breast fibroblast activation. As shown in Fig. 5A, exosomes from BT-549 or MDA-MB-231 cells decreased intracellular ROS levels in HFF-1 cells more than exosomes from HBL-100 cells. Moreover, after intracellular ROS were eliminated by NAC, ACTA2 and vimentin expression and migration ability in HFF-1 cells were increased significantly (Fig. 5B and Fig. S3 (B and C)). Furthermore, we examined the expression of several genes that participate in classic oxidative stress after treating HFF-1 cells with the indicated exosomes. The mRNA and protein levels of SOD1 were increased significantly upon breast cancer–derived exosome treatment (Fig. 5 (C and D) and Fig. S3D). In addition, breast fibroblasts from TNM stage II and III patients expressed more SOD1 (Fig. S3E), and analysis of microarrays from GEO databases indicated that SOD1 expression was significantly increased in CAFs compared with their breast counterpart fibroblasts (Fig. S3F). To further explore the role of SOD1 in fibroblast activation, we knocked down SOD1 in HFF-1 cells (Fig. S3G), and SOD1 knockdown did not change the uptake of exosomes (Fig. S3H). Compared with control conditions, SOD1 knockdown prevented the activation of HFF-1 cells by breast cancer exosomes (Fig. 5 (E and F) and Fig. S4 (A and B)). However, SOD1 overexpression increased ACTA2 and vimentin protein expression and enhanced contraction and migration abilities in HFF-1 cells (Fig. 5 (G and H) and Fig. S4 (C–E)), which indicates that SOD1 activated fibroblasts to become myofibroblasts. We next examined the role of SOD1 in HFF-1 cells in regulating the progression of breast cancer cells. The numbers of MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells were significantly increased by treatment with CM from SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells compared with treatment with CM from control HFF-1 cells (Fig. 5I). Moreover, scratch and transwell migration assays indicated that the migration ability of MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells was remarkedly improved by SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells (Fig. 5J and Fig. S4F). In addition, SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells promoted the EMT and stemness of breast cancer cells (Fig. 5 (K–M) and Fig. S5A). These results collectively suggest that breast cancer cells convert fibroblasts to myofibroblasts by increasing the SOD1 expression level in fibroblasts. Next, we sought to determine how SOD1 in fibroblasts was up-regulated by exosomes from breast cancer cells. After analyzing the gene expression profiles of breast tumor epithelium from GSE83591 using bioinformatics tools, we identified 48 significantly up-regulated genes in breast tumor epithelium compared with normal breast epithelium (Fig. S5B) and constructed a PPI network to screen the hubs of these 48 genes. After ordering these genes by PPI degree, the core gene survivin, which was reported to be released from cancer cells via exosomes and involved in ROS regulation (25Khan S. Jutzy J.M. Aspe J.R. McGregor D.W. Neidigh J.W. Wall N.R. Survivin is released from cancer cells via exosomes.Apoptosis. 2011; 16 (20717727): 1-1210.1007/s10495-010-0534-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Chu J. Wu S. Xing D. Survivin mediates self-protection through ROS/cdc25c/CDK1 signaling pathway during tumor cell apoptosis induced by high fluence low-power laser irradiation.Cancer Lett. 2010; 297 (20579806): 207-21910.1016/j.canlet.2010.05.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was screened out (Fig. 6A). In addition, RNA-Seq data from TCGA indicated that there is a linear correlation between the mRNA levels of survivin and SOD1 in human breast cancer tissue, which is composed of tumor epithelial cells and stroma (Fig. 6B). Further Western blotting results and GEO database analysis also showed that breast cancer cells expressed higher survivin levels than normal breast cells and fibroblasts (Fig. 6C and Fig. S5 (C and D)). Interestingly, exosomes of BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 also contain more survivin than that of HBL-100 cells (Fig. 6D and Fig. S5E). Moreover, breast cancer cell–derived survivin can be transported into fibroblasts through exosomes (Fig. 6E). To determine the function of breast cancer–derived survivin in fibroblast activation, we knocked down survivin expression with shRNA in BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S5F). Survivin knockdown did not change the quantity of exosomes secreted by BT-549 or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S5G). As shown in Fig. 6F and Fig. S5H, upon survivin knockdown, CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells lost the ability to increase the expression levels of SOD1, ACTA2, and vimentin in HFF-1 cells. Similar results were obtained in gel contraction and migration experiments (Fig. 6 (G–I) and Fig. S5I). These results suggest that survivin in breast cancer cells up-regulates SOD1 expression in fibroblasts, thereby mediating fibroblast activation. First, to confirm the role of exosome and survivin on fibroblasts in vivo, we injected BT-549 Ctrl, BT-549 shRAB27A, and BT-549 shSurvivin cells subcutaneously into in the fourth right mammary fat pad of BALB/c-NU female mice and then isolated fibroblasts from this mammary to identify characteristics of myofibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B) and Fig. S6 (A–C), after reducing the secretion of exosomes and the expression of survivin, BT-549 cells lose the ability to convert mouse breast fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These results also demonstrated that the expression level of SOD1 in mouse mammary fibroblasts is regulated by survivin in the exosomes of breast cancer cells. To follow up on our findings that SOD1 levels in fibroblasts were increased by breast cancer cells, we investigated SOD1 expression in the stroma of different breast cancer patient samples by immunohistochemical analysis and scored the staining intensity. As shown in Fig. 7 (C and D), strong SOD1 staining was more frequently present in TNM stage II, III, and IV than in TNM stage I. We next aimed to further verify that SOD1 overexpression is important for myofibroblast function in vivo, which includes promoting tumor growth. We mixed SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells or control cells with a poorly aggressive, noninvasive breast cancer cell line, MCF7 cells, and injected them subcutaneously into female BALB/c-NU mice. HFF-1 cells and SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells alone failed to form tumors in mice (data not shown). Consistent with the in vitro experiments, SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells increased the volume and weight of the tumors (Fig. 7 (E and F) and Fig. S6D). To examine the roles of SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells in breast cancer metastasis, luciferase-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells either alone or together with SOD1-overexpressing HFF-1 cells or control HFF-1 cells were injected intravenously into female BALB/c-NU mice through their tail vein, and their body weight was measured every 2 days (Fig. S6E). As shown in Fig. 7 (G–I) and Fig. S6F, SOD1 up-regulation in HFF-1 cells increased the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to metastasize. Together, these results suggest that survivin in breast cancer–derived exosomes activates fibroblasts by up-regulating SOD1, whose feedback promotes cancer proliferation and metastasis in vivo (Fig. 8). The communication between stroma and cancer cells plays a critical role in driving tumor progression (27Beacham D.A. Cukierman E. Stromagenesis: the changing face of fibroblastic microenvironments during tumor progression.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15 (15970443): 329-34110.1016/j.semcancer.2005.05.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but how normal fibroblasts are activated to become myofibroblasts remains unclear. Here, our study explains the origin of myofibroblasts in the breast tumor microenvironment. First, we analyzed the effects of normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer epithelial cells on fibroblast activation and found that breast cancer cell–educated fibroblasts possess the characteristics of myofibroblasts and can significantly promote the proliferation, metastasis and stemness of breast cancer cells. The bilateral interaction between breast cancer cells and fibroblasts further illustrates the mechanism of high metastasis rates and strong drug resistance in breast cancer. Intracellular ROS are a group of oxygen derivatives resulting from the distinct oxidation status of O2, which is widely recognized as crucial for cell fate (28Costa A. Scholer-Dahirel A. Mechta-Grigoriou F. The role of reactive oxygen species and metabolism on cancer cells and their microenvironment.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2014; 25 (24406211): 23-3210.1016/j.semcancer.2013.12.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition to directly acting on cancer cells, ROS can also affect breast cancer progression by altering the metabolism of stromal cells. For instance, a high level of ROS induces the loss of Cav-1 in stromal cells and is sufficient to generate a pseudohypoxic state that further promotes"
https://openalex.org/W3045180563,"Continuous neuronal survival is vital for mammals because mammalian brains have limited regeneration capability. After neurogenesis, suppression of apoptosis is needed to ensure a neuron’s long-term survival. Here we describe a robust genetic program that intrinsically attenuates apoptosis competence in neurons. Developmental downregulation of the splicing regulator PTBP1 in immature neurons allows neural-specific splicing of the evolutionarily conserved Bak1 microexon 5. Exon 5 inclusion triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and unproductive translation of Bak1 transcripts (N-Bak mRNA), leading to suppression of pro-apoptotic BAK1 proteins and allowing neurons to reduce apoptosis. Germline heterozygous ablation of exon 5 increases BAK1 proteins exclusively in the brain, inflates neuronal apoptosis, and leads to early postnatal mortality. Therefore, neural-specific exon 5 splicing and depletion of BAK1 proteins uniquely repress neuronal apoptosis. Although apoptosis is important for development, attenuation of apoptosis competence through neural-specific splicing of the Bak1 microexon is essential for neuronal and animal survival."
https://openalex.org/W3045396803,"Meiosis initiation is a crucial step for the production of haploid gametes, which occurs from anterior to posterior in fetal ovaries. The asynchrony of the transition from mitosis to meiosis results in heterogeneity in the female germ cell populations, which limits the studies of meiosis initiation and progression at a higher resolution level. To dissect the process of meiosis initiation, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of 19 363 single germ cells collected from E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 mouse fetal ovaries. Clustering analysis identified seven groups and defined dozens of corresponding transcription factors, providing a global view of cellular differentiation from primordial germ cells toward meiocytes. Furthermore, we explored the dynamics of gene expression within the developmental trajectory with special focus on the critical state of meiosis. We found that meiosis initiation occurs as early as E12.5 and the cluster of oogonia_4 is the critical state between mitosis and meiosis. Our data provide key insights into the transcriptome features of peri-meiotic female germ cells, which offers new information not only on meiosis initiation and progression but also on screening pathogenic mutations in meiosis-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3045896100,"The sudden emergence of COVID-19 has brought significant challenges to the care of Veterans. An improved ability to predict a patient’s clinical course would facilitate optimal care decisions, resource allocation, family counseling, and strategies for safely easing distancing restrictions. The Care Assessment Need (CAN) score is an existing risk assessment tool within the Veterans Health Administration (VA), and produces a score from 0 to 99, with a higher score correlating to a greater risk. The model was originally designed for the nonacute outpatient setting and is automatically calculated from structured data variables in the electronic health record. This multisite retrospective study of 6591 Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020 was designed to assess the utility of repurposing the CAN score as objective and automated risk assessment tool to promptly enhance clinical decision making for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. We performed bivariate analyses on the dichotomized CAN 1-year mortality score (high vs. low risk) and each patient outcome using Chi-square tests of independence. Logistic regression models using the continuous CAN score were fit to assess its predictive power for outcomes of interest. Results demonstrated that a CAN score greater than 50 was significantly associated with the following outcomes after positive COVID-19 test: hospital admission (OR 4.6), prolonged hospital stay (OR 4.5), ICU admission (3.1), prolonged ICU stay (OR 2.9), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.6), and mortality (OR 7.2). Repurposing the CAN score offers an efficient way to risk-stratify COVID-19 Veterans. As a result of the compelling statistical results, and automation, this tool is well positioned for broad use across the VA to enhance clinical decision-making."

In this study, we reported that miR-375-3p overexpression inhibited proliferation and migration and promoted apoptosis in BC cells. Frizzled-8 (FZD8) gene is identified as the direct miR-375-3p targeting gene. miR-375-3p blocks the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and downstream molecules Cyclin D1 and c-Myc by inhibiting the expression of FZD8 directly, it could increase caspase 1 and caspase 3 expression and promote T24 cell apoptosis as well. miR-375-3p also showed a significant inhibitory effect in vivo in bladder tumor-bearing nude mice, as demonstrated by the reduced tumor volume and Ki67 proliferation index in tumor tissue. Collectively, miR-375-3p is a suppressor of BC that inhibits proliferation and metastasis, and promotes apoptosis in BC cells as well as suppresses tumor growth in a T24 xenograft mouse model, which could be used as a potential therapeutic approach for BC in future."

The control of precise transcriptional programs establishing cortical cell fates includes epigenetic mechanisms (Amberg et al., 2019Amberg N. Laukoter S. Hippenmeyer S. Epigenetic cues modulating the generation of cell-type diversity in the cerebral cortex.J. Neurochem. 2019; 149: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For instance, DNA methylation represents a critical epigenetic mark modifying DNA-protein interactions and thus controlling transcriptional states and cellular identity (Albert et al., 2017Albert M.

Although many DNA methylation regulatory mechanisms involve large-scale and global chromatin modulation, some cues act at highly specific locations. In particular, differential DNA methylation at imprinting control regions serves as a fundamental mechanism of genomic imprinting. Imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon and results in monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific gene expression (Barlow and Bartolomei, 2014Barlow D.P. Bartolomei M.S.

Genomic imprinting: the emergence of an epigenetic paradigm.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, certain genes are only expressed from the paternally inherited allele and others are only expressed from the maternally inherited allele. The most characteristic feature of imprinted genes is reflected in their cardinal gene-dosage sensitivity. Whether and how allelic expression, and therefore imprinted gene dosage, is regulated at the single-cell level and whether imprinting contributes mechanistically to the generation of transcriptional and/or phenotypic cell-type diversity are unknown. Although the overall number of imprinted genes is relatively small (<1%) (Tucci et al., 2019Tucci V. Isles A.R. Kelsey G. Ferguson-Smith A.C.

The preferential expression of the maternal or the paternal allele of certain genes suggests widespread implications for the development and function of the brain. Indeed, genetic deletion of individual imprinted genes results in various neuronal and behavioral deficits (Perez et al., 2016Perez J.D. Rubinstein N.D. Dulac C.

However, many phenotypes with loss of imprinted gene function have been analyzed at the whole-animal and/or global tissue level.

The investigation of genomic imprinting at the organismal level has vastly benefited from the analysis of mice carrying uniparental chromosome disomy (UPD, somatic cells containing either two copies of the maternal or paternal chromosome) (Cattanach and Kirk, 1985Cattanach B.M.

Because one parental allele is duplicated and the other is not present in cells carrying UPD, imprinted genes are in principle either 2-fold overexpressed or not expressed. Several imprinting phenotypes in mice, as well as certain human disorders, are due to UPD and resulting imbalances of imprinted gene expression (Peters, 2014Peters J.

However, the lack of experimental approaches allowing the interrogation and phenotypic analysis upon deregulated imprinted gene expression at the single-cell level has thus far precluded the investigation of cell-type specificity. Here, we first used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map and quantitatively assess allelic expression strength in genetically defined major forebrain cell types at single-cell resolution. We then exploited the potential of UPD and established a quantitative assay to probe genomic imprinting at unprecedented single-cell resolution in the developing cortex using MADM (mosaic analysis with double markers) technology (Hippenmeyer et al., 2010Hippenmeyer S.

By capitalizing upon the MADM assay, we determined the prevalence and phenotypic cell-type specificity of imprinted gene dosage in the developing cerebral cortex at the single-cell level.

These efforts proved extremely useful to identify tissue-specific imprinted gene expression but lacked the cellular resolution to determine cell-type-specific allelic expression. To this end, we set out to first analyze the allelomes of genetically defined cell types compared with whole tissue. We focused on cortical projection neurons, interneurons, and olfactory bulb (OB) granule cells and crossed Emx1- and Nkx2.1-Cre drivers to fluorescent Z/EG and Ai14 reporter lines, respectively, all in the C57BL/6J (B6) genetic background. These B6-Cre/reporter mice were then crossed to CAST/EiJ (CAST) mice with the father in B6 and the mother in CAST (initial cross), or vice versa (reverse cross). We used 2 biological replicates for both crosses (Table S1A; Figure 1A). Next, labeled cells from F1 of the preceding crosses were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by RNA-seq and allelic expression analysis using Allelome.PRO (Andergassen et al., 2015Andergassen D. Dotter C.P. Kulinski T.M. Guenzl P.M. Bammer P.C. Barlow D.P. Pauler F.M. Hudson Q.J. Allelome.PRO, a pipeline to define allele-specific genomic features from high-throughput sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: e146PubMed Google Scholar) to determine genome-wide allelic gene expression (Figure 1B). For global imprinted gene identification, we used a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 1% and an allelic expression ratio cutoff of 0.7, indicating a 70/30 ratio of expressed/silent allele (Andergassen et al., 2017Andergassen D.

To refine this definition, we separated genes showing canonical (allelic ratio cutoff of 0.95) and biased (allelic ratio cutoff between 0.95 and 0.7) imprinted expression (Figure 1A). We confirmed cell-type identity in our samples using principal-component analysis (Figure S1A) and marker gene expression (Figure S1B). To identify cell-type-specific differences in imprinted gene expression, we focused our analysis on 25 genes with imprinted expression in embryonic and adult whole mouse brain (Andergassen et al., 2017Andergassen D. Dotter C.P. Wenzel D. Sigl V. Bammer P.C. Muckenhuber M. Mayer D. Kulinski T.M. Theussl H.C.

Most (20/25, or 80%) showed uniform canonical allelic expression (i.e., no switching of parental allele-specific expression) in all informative cell types, as well as in whole tissue (Figure 1D). We next plotted the allelic maternal expression/paternal expression (mat/pat) ratios for several representative maternally (Rian and Meg3) and paternally (Sgce and Snrpn) expressed imprinted genes (Figure 1E). Only 5/25 genes appeared to show biased imprinted expression (Ago2, Cdkn1c, Grb10, Impact, and Inpp5f). Of these 5 genes, Grb10 is known to switch promoter usage and thus imprinted expression developmentally and cell type specifically (Plasschaert and Bartolomei, 2015Plasschaert R.N. Bartolomei M.S.

Next, we investigated Ago2, Impact, and Inpp5f and found marked cell-type-specific variation in the allelic mat/pat ratios, contrasting with canonical imprinted expression (Figure 1E). In summary, most (80%) expressed imprinted genes exhibit canonical imprinting in all major, genetically defined, cortical cell types, with a smaller fraction (20%) showing expression bias. Biased imprinted gene expression can arise either from uniformly skewed expression in all cells within a population or from a major population showing exclusive imprinted expression from one parental allele and a minority population switching parental alleles and showing exclusive expression of the opposite parental allele (Chess, 2016Chess A.

To discriminate between these possibilities we isolated single cells from the cortical Emx1+ lineage of F1 progeny from B6 and CAST parents, as described earlier, at two developmental time points, postnatal day (P) 0 and P42 using FACS (initial and reverse cross) (Figures 1F and S1C). Next, we performed scRNA-seq using SMARTer technology. Upon quality control, we identified 404 cells from both crosses (223 B6xCAST and 181 CASTxB6; the maternal strain is written on the left). We classified all informative cells into 5 classes using hierarchical clustering of gene expression (Figure 1G; Table S1B; STAR Methods). Clustering did not result in major bias with respect to the direction of B6xCAST cross in any class (Figure S1C). We separated neurons into two groups, with neuron I (NI, nascent projection neurons) and neuron II (NII, mature projection neurons) originating mainly from P0 and P42, respectively (Figure S1C). Astrocyte intermediate progenitor cells (aIPCs) were mainly observed at P0, whereas mature astrocytes (astros) and oligodendrocytes (oligos) were mostly identified at P42 (Figure S1C). Using a modified version of Allelome.PRO, we calculated allelic mat/pat ratios of the 25 known imprinted genes as described earlier and two control (i.e., biallelically expressed) genes (Ncam1 and Fgfr2) (STAR Methods). Our analysis revealed that the parental bias of all investigated imprinted genes was present at the single-cell level (Table S2). Importantly, biased paternal expression of Inpp5f and Impact at the single-cell level was detected in all major cell types (Figure 1H), similar to our observation at the bulk level (Figure 1E). In contrast, almost exclusive expression from the maternal or the paternal allele was detected in each informative cell for selected genes with canonical imprinted expression (maternal, Meg3 and Rian; paternal, Snrpn) (Figure 1H). Highly expressed genes that are not subject to genomic imprinting, e.g., Fgfr2 and Ncam1, were found to be expressed either from both parental alleles (i.e., biallelic, green bar in Figure 1H) or from one of the parental alleles in equal amounts of single cells (red/blue bars in Figure 1H), consistent with the observation and concept of transcriptional bursts (Larsson et al., 2019Larsson A.J.M. Johnsson P. Hagemann-Jensen M. Hartmanis L. Faridani O.R. Reinius B. Segerstolpe Å. Rivera C.M. Ren B. Sandberg R. Genomic encoding of transcriptional burst kinetics.Nature. 2019; 565: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In summary, we found uniform canonical imprinted gene expression across distinct cell types, which is in contrast to the idea of cell-type-specific variation of biased expression. Both canonical expression and biased expression of the respective analyzed imprinted genes were observed in all different cortical cell types with no detectable allele switching. In the above analysis, we noticed that although relative ratios of allelic expression were rather uniform across cell types, absolute imprinted gene expression levels were not. Extreme examples included Rasgrf1 and Magel2, which were not informative in allelic expression analysis because of low expression in several (i.e., 2–4) cell types (Figure 1C, white boxes). These findings prompted us to comparatively investigate the expression levels of all 25 well-characterized imprinted genes listed earlier in all distinct cortical cell types. We first re-analyzed the bulk RNA-seq data of the preceding B6xCAST crosses (Figure 2A). We plotted the relative expression levels in a heatmap to reveal similarities and differences in expression profiles across specific cortical cell types (Figure 2B). This analysis indicated marked differences in the expression of most analyzed imprinted genes across distinct cell types. We next plotted the normalized read counts of Impact, which shows similar expression levels in all cortical cell types. In contrast, the normalized read counts of Meg3 and Grb10 revealed substantial differences of expression in distinct cortical cell types (Figure 2C). To corroborate these findings, we calculated a cell-type specificity index based on differential gene expression (bulk) (see STAR Methods). This analysis identified progressively increasing but significant cell-type-specific imprinted expression levels for 84% of the investigated 25 imprinted genes (Figure 2D). Next, we analyzed cell-type-specific expression of imprinted genes at the single-cell level and re-analyzed the data from scRNA-seq of the B6xCAST crosses (Figure 2E). Normalized expression of 20 informative imprinted genes, visualized in a heatmap, indicated that even in individual cells, imprinted gene expression varies strongly across distinct cortical cell types (Figure 2F). Furthermore, normalized expression values for three genes—Impact, similar expression, and Meg3 and Grb10, cell-type-specific expression—supported the preceding observation (Figure 2G). Based on the highest fraction of cumulative expression, we calculated a specificity index for single cells (single cell) (see STAR Methods). Strikingly, 13/20 genes showed significant differential expression among the 5 cortical cell types (Figure 2H, indicated with asterisks next to the gene name, Monocle2, adjusted p value (padj) < 0.05). Altogether, we found that imprinted genes with uniform canonical or biased allelic expression exhibit significant variation in absolute expression levels across cortical cell types. The preceding findings show that imprinted gene expression strength varies significantly across distinct cortical cell types. How relevant is the absolute expression of imprinted genes in a particular cell type? To address this question, it is imperative to modulate the expressed dose of imprinted genes in a cell-type-specific"

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CHDs in the population of dogs recruited in a single referral center (RC); compare the epidemiological features of CHDs in screened breeds (Boxers) versus non-screened (French and English Bulldogs, German Shepherds); investigate the association of breeds with the prevalence of CHDs; determine the popularity and volatility of breeds over a 20-year period; analysed the trends of the most popular breeds in the overall population of new-born dogs registered in the Italian Kennel Club (IKC) from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2017. The RC’s cardiological database was analysed, and 1,779 clinical records were included in a retrospective observation study. Descriptive statistics and frequencies regarding the most representative breeds and CHDs were generated. A logistic regression model was used to analyse the trends of the most common CHDs found in single and in cluster of breeds. The relationship between breed popularity and presence of CHDs was studied. The most common CHDs were Pulmonic Stenosis, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, Subaortic Stenosis, Ventricular Septal Defect, Aortic Stenosis, Tricuspid Dysplasia, Atrial Septal Defect, Double Chamber Right Ventricle, Mitral Dysplasia, and others less frequent. The most represented pure breeds were Boxer, German Shepherd, French Bulldog, English Bulldog, Maltese, Newfoundland, Rottweiler, Golden Retriever, Chihuahua, and others in lower percentage. Chihuahuas, American Staffordshire Terriers, Border Collies, French Bulldogs, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel were the most appreciated all of which showed a high value of volatility. This study found evidence for the value of the screening program implemented in Boxers; fashions and trends influence dog owners’ choices more than the worries of health problems in a breed. Effective breeding programs are needed in order to control the diffusion of CHDs without impoverishing the genetic pool."
https://openalex.org/W3046206109,"Animal movement drives important ecological processes such as migration and the spread of infectious disease. Current approaches to modeling animal tracking data focus on parametric models used to understand environmental effects on movement behavior and to fill in missing tracking data. Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms are powerful and flexible predictive modeling tools but have rarely been applied to animal movement data. In this study we present a general framework for predicting animal movement that is a combination of two steps: first predicting movement behavioral states and second predicting the animal’s velocity. We specify this framework at the individual level as well as for collective movement. We use Random Forests, Neural and Recurrent Neural Networks to compare performance predicting one step ahead as well as long range simulations. We compare results against a custom constructed Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) model. We apply this approach to high resolution ant movement data. We found that the individual level Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods outperformed the SDE model for one step ahead prediction. The SDE model did comparatively better at simulating long range movement behaviour. Of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning models the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) individual level model did best at long range simulations. We also applied the Random Forest and LSTM individual level models to model gull migratory movement to demonstrate the generalizability of this framework. Machine Learning and deep learning models are easier to specify compared to traditional parametric movement models which can have restrictive assumptions. However, machine learning and deep learning models are less interpretable than parametric movement models. The type of model used should be determined by the goal of the study, if the goal is prediction, our study provides evidence that machine learning and deep learning models could be useful tools."
https://openalex.org/W3044351036,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a major driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and a key therapeutic target for AR inhibitors (ie, Enzalutamide). However, Enzalutamide only inhibits androgen-dependent AR signaling, enabling intrinsic AR activation via androgen-independent pathways, leading to aggressive castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We investigated the ability of novel anti-cancer agents, Dp44mT and DpC, to overcome androgen resistance. The effect of Dp44mT and DpC on androgen-dependent and independent AR signaling was assessed in androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cells using 2D- and 3D-tissue culture. The clinically trialed DpC was then examined in vivo and compared to Enzalutamide. These agents uniquely promote AR proteasomal degradation and inhibit AR transcription in PCa cells via the upregulation of c-Jun, potently reducing the AR target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These agents also inhibited the activation of key molecules in both androgen-dependent and independent AR signaling (ie, EGFR, MAPK, PI3K), which promote CRPC. The clinically trialed DpC also significantly inhibited PCa tumor growth, AR, and PSA expression in vivo, being more potent than Enzalutamide. DpC is a promising candidate for a unique, structurally distinct generation of AR inhibitors that simultaneously target both androgen-dependent and independent arms of AR signaling. No other therapies exhibit such comprehensive and potent AR suppression, which is critical for overcoming the development of androgen resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3045771009,"Objective The aim of the present study was to investigate whether anti-vaccination attitudes and behavior, and positive attitudes to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), are driven by trait reactance and a distrust in medical doctors. Methods The sample consisted of 770 Finnish parents who filled out an online survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine if trait reactance plays a role in vaccination decisions, vaccine attitudes, and in the use of CAM, and whether that relationship is mediated by trust in medical doctors. Results Parents with higher trait reactance had lower trust in doctors, more negative attitudes to vaccines, a higher likelihood of not accepting vaccines for their children and themselves, and a higher likelihood to use CAM treatments that are not included in evidence-based medicine. Our analyses also revealed associations between vaccination behavior and CAM use and vaccine attitudes and CAM use, but there was no support for the previous notion that these associations would be explained by trait reactance and trust in doctors. Conclusions Taken together, higher trait reactance seems to be relevant for attitudes and behaviors that go against conventional medicine, because trait reactance is connected to a distrust in medical doctors. Our findings also suggest that high trait reactance and low trust in doctors function differently for different people: For some individuals they might be associated with anti-vaccination attitudes and behavior, while for others they might be related to CAM use. We speculate that this is because people differ in what is important to them, leading them to react against different aspects of conventional medicine."

This paper describes and analyzes the self-reported experiences of women with Medicaid versus commercial insurance relating to autonomy, control and respectful treatment in maternity care. Methods The sampling frame for the Listening to Mothers in California survey was drawn from 2016 California birth certificate files. The 30-minute survey had a 55% response rate. A secondary multivariable analysis of results from the survey included 2,318 women with commercial private insurance (1,087) or public (Medi-Cal) (1,231) coverage. Results were weighted and were representative of all births in 2016 in California. The multivariable analysis of variables related to maternal agency included engagement in decision making regarding interventions such as vaginal birth after cesarean and episiotomy, feeling pressured to have interventions and sense of fair treatment. We examined their relationship to insurance status adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, nativity and attitude toward birth as well as type of prenatal provider, type of birth attendant and pregnancy complications. Results Women with Medi-Cal had a demographic profile distinct from those with commercial insurance. In multivariable analysis, women with Medi-Cal reported less control over their maternity care experience than women with commercial insurance, including less choice of prenatal provider (AOR 1.61 95%C.I. 1.20, 2.17), or a vaginal birth after cesarean (AOR 2.93 95%C.I. 1.49, 5.73). Mothers on Medi-Cal were also less likely to be consulted before experiencing an episiotomy (AOR 0.30 95%C.I. 0.09, 0.94). They were more likely to report feeling pressure to have a primary cesarean (AOR 2.54 95%C.I. 1.55, 4.16) and less likely to be encouraged by staff to make their own decisions (AOR 0.63 95%C.I. 0.47, 0.85). Conclusions Childbearing women with public insurance in California clearly and consistently reported less opportunity to choose their care than women with private insurance. These inequities are a call to action for increased accountability and quality improvement relating to care of the many childbearing women with Medicaid coverage."

As expected, magnetic resonance imaging is a major component of the project. Full brain images are obtained at every 6-month visit. A range of cognitive tests studying executive function and memory are employed less frequently. Two blood draws (baseline, 6 months) provide samples to measure concentrations of approximately 145 plasma biomarkers. In addition, other diagnostic measurements are performed including PET imaging, cerebral spinal fluid measurements of amyloid-beta and tau peptides, as well as genetic tests, demographics, and vital signs. ADNI data is available upon review of an application. There have been numerous reports of how various processes evolve during AD progression, including alterations in metabolic and neuroendocrine activity, cell survival, and cognitive behavior. Lacking an analytic model at the onset, we leveraged recent advances in machine learning, which allow us to deal with large, non-linear systems with many variables. Of particular note was examining how well binary predictions of future disease states could be learned from simple, non-invasive measurements like those dependent on blood samples. Such measurements make relatively little demands on the time and effort of medical staff or patient. We report findings with recall/precision/area under the receiver operator curve after application of CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, Our results show (i) Random Forests and Gradient Boosting work very well with such data, (ii) Prediction quality when applied to relatively easily obtained measurements (Cognitive scores, Genetic Risk and plasma biomarkers) achieve results that are competitive with magnetic resonance techniques.

https://openalex.org/W3044207361,"Ferrochelatase (FECH) is the terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis. We previously showed that FECH is required for endothelial cell growth in vitro and choroidal neovascularization in vivo. But FECH has not been explored in retinal neovascularization, which underlies diseases like proliferative diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Here, we investigated the inhibition of FECH using genetic and chemical approaches in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. In OIR mice, FECH expression is upregulated and co-localized with neovascular tufts. Partial loss-of-function Fechm1Pas mutant mice showed reduced retinal neovascularization and endothelial cell proliferation in OIR. An intravitreal injection of the FECH inhibitor N-methyl protoporphyrin had similar effects. Griseofulvin is an anti-fungal drug that inhibits FECH as an off-target effect. Strikingly, intravitreal griseofulvin decreased both pathological tuft formation and areas of vasoobliteration compared to vehicle, suggesting potential as a FECH-targeting therapy. Ocular toxicity studies revealed that intravitreal injection of griseofulvin in adult mice does not disrupt retinal vasculature, function, or morphology. In sum, mutation and chemical inhibition of Fech reduces retinal neovascularization and promotes physiological angiogenesis, suggesting a dual effect on vascular repair upon FECH inhibition, without ocular toxicity. These findings suggest that FECH inhibitors could be repurposed to treat retinal neovascularization."

Here, we describe an unexpected role for the radial fiber scaffold in directing corticospinal and other axons at the junction between the striatum and globus pallidus. The maintenance of this scaffold, and consequently axon pathfinding, is dependent on the expression of an atypical RHO-GTPase, RND3/RHOE, together with its binding partner ARHGAP35/P190A, a RHO GTPase-activating protein, in the radial glia-like neural stem cells within the ventricular zone of the medial ganglionic eminence. This role is independent of RND3 and ARHGAP35 expression in corticospinal neurons, where they regulate dendritic spine formation, axon elongation, and pontine midline crossing in a FEZF2-dependent manner. The prevalence of neural stem cell scaffolds and their expression of RND3 and ARHGAP35 suggests that these observations might be broadly relevant for axon guidance and neural circuit formation."

They have emerged since the mid-1990s to become one of the most prevalent Salmonella serotypes causing human disease world-wide. Multiple genetic events associated with different genetic elements can result in the monophasic phenotype. Several jurisdictions have reported the emergence of a Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- clone with SGI-4 and a genetic element (MREL) encoding a mercury resistance operon and antibiotic resistance loci that disrupts the second phase antigen region near the iroB locus in the Salmonella genome. We have sequenced 810 human and animal Canadian Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- isolates and determined that isolates with SGI-4 and the mercury resistance element (MREL; also known as RR1&RR2) constitute several global clades containing various proportions of Canadian, US, and European isolates. Detailed analysis of the data provides a clearer picture of how these heavy metal elements interact with bacteria within the Salmonella population to produce the monophasic phenotype. Insertion of the MREL near iroB is associated with several deletions and rearrangements of the adjacent flaAB hin region, which may be useful for defining human case clusters that could represent outbreaks. Plasmids carrying genes encoding silver, copper, mercury, and antimicrobial resistance appear to be derived from IS26 mediated acquisition of these genes from genomes carrying SGI-4 and the MREL. Animal isolates with the mercury and As/Cu/Ag resistance elements are strongly associated with porcine sources in Canada as has been shown previously for other jurisdictions. The data acquired in these investigations, as well as from the extensive literature on the subject, may aid source attribution in outbreaks of the organism and interventions to decrease the prevalence of this clone and reduce its impact on human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3044591870,"Although collagens are the most abundant proteins implicated in various disease pathways, essential mechanisms required for their proper folding and assembly are poorly understood. Heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), an ER-resident chaperone, was mainly reported to fulfill key functions in folding and secretion of fibrillar collagens by stabilizing pro-collagen triple-helices. In this study, we demonstrate unique functions of HSP47 for different collagen subfamilies. Our results show that HSP47 binds to the N-terminal region of procollagen I and is essential for its secretion. However, HSP47 ablation does not majorly impact collagen VI secretion, but its lateral assembly. Moreover, specific ablation of Hsp47 in murine keratinocytes revealed a new role for the transmembrane collagen XVII triple-helix formation. Incompletely folded collagen XVII C-termini protruding from isolated HSP47 null keratinocyte membrane vesicles could be fully restored upon the application of recombinant HSP47. Thus, our study expands the current view regarding the client repertoire and function of HSP47, as well as emphasizes its importance for transmembrane collagen folding."
https://openalex.org/W3044674419,"Functional brain network (FBN), estimated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has become a potentially useful way of diagnosing neurological disorders in their early stages by comparing the connectivity patterns between different brain regions across subjects. However, this depends, to a great extent, on the quality of the estimated FBNs, indicating that FBN estimation is a key step for the subsequent task of disorder identification. In the past decades, researchers have developed many methods to estimate FBNs, including Pearson’s correlation and (regularized) partial correlation, etc. Despite their widespread applications in current studies, most of the existing methods estimate FBNs only based on the dependency between the measured blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals, which ignores spatial relationship of signals associated with different brain regions. Due to the space and material parsimony principle of our brain, we believe that the spatial distance between brain regions has an important influence on FBN topology. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that spatially neighboring brain regions tend to have stronger connections and/or share similar connections with others; based on this assumption, we propose two novel methods to estimate FBNs by incorporating the information of brain region distance into the estimation model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we use the estimated FBNs to identify subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal controls (NCs). Experimental results show that the proposed methods are better than the baseline methods in the sense of MCI identification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3045592089,"Background The elderly in rural areas comprise over half of the older population in China, and their health problems are a matter of great concern for the Chinese government and society. Among the many factors affecting health, social capital has generated much interest in academic research. Exploring the relationship between social capital and individual health among the elderly in rural China provides ways to improve the health of Chinese people, which has a positive impact on policy. Methods We selected 3719 respondents from the 2016 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Structural and cognitive social capital were obtained via exponentiation of variables (mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) and by giving them equal weight. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimators were used to analyze the association between social capital and individual health. We explored the mechanism linking structural and cognitive social capital with individual health through a mediation effect analysis. Results After correcting for endogeneity bias, structural social capital had a positive correlation with individual health among the elderly, with a coefficient of 0.062 (95% CI: 0.020-0.104). Cognitive social capital also had a positive correlation with individual health, with a coefficient of 0.097 (95% CI: 0.060-0.135). Physical exercise and positive attitude were two significant mediating variables of the relationship between social capital and individual health in the study group, with mediating effects of 0.018 and 0.054, respectively. Conclusions Cognitive social capital played a stronger role than structural social capital in promoting individual health among the elderly. Physical exercise and positive attitude mediated the relationship between social capital and individual health. Policymakers should not only build basic medical and health care systems but also consistently cultivate and strengthen structural and cognitive social capital among the elderly in rural China."
https://openalex.org/W3045783191,"Background Many studies have identified an inequitable distribution of exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) by race. We investigated the association of PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality considering both the decedents’ race and neighborhood racial composition as potential modifiers. Methods We obtained geocoded cardiovascular mortality records of all black and white decedents from urban block-groups in Massachusetts between 2001 and 2011 (n = 130,863). We examined the association between PM2.5 and cardiovascular mortality, and assessed effect modification by three types of racial modifiers: decedents’ race, census block-group percent black and white, and two novel measures of racial segregation. The Racial Residential Segregation (RRS) quantifies the concentration of non-Hispanic blacks and whites in each block-group. The Index of Racial Dissimilarity measures dissimilarity in non-Hispanic black and white racial distribution between the smaller census block-group and larger tract. Results We found a 2.35%(95%CI: 0.92%;3.79%) increase in mortality for each 10μg/m3 increase in two-day average exposure to PM2.5. The effect was modified by the block-group racial composition, with higher risks in block-groups with the highest percentage of black residents (interaction p-value = 0.04), and in block-groups with the lowest RRS (i.e. higher black to white resident ratio, interaction p-value = 0.072). Racial dissimilarity did not modify the associations. Conclusion Current levels of PM2.5 are associated with increased cardiovascular deaths in Massachusetts, with different risks between areas with different racial composition and segregation. This suggests that pollution reductions in neighborhoods with the highest percentage of non-Hispanic blacks would be most beneficial in reducing cardiovascular mortality and disparities."

SARS-CoV-2 has laid bare the disparities in health care that people of color have endured for centuries (Bailey et al., 2017Bailey Z.D. Krieger N. Agénor M. Graves J. Linos N. Bassett M.T. Structural racism and health inequities in the USA: evidence and interventions.Lancet. 2017; 389: 1453-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). As stark as the health contrasts have been, the disparity in research focused on understanding biological variations in individuals of African ancestry (AA) are even greater. This is especially the case in neuroscience research. Because Africa was the birthplace of all modern humans, the phrase “African ancestry” used here refers to the majority of people living in sub-Sahara Africa today and those with lineage tracing to the region within the past 500 years. The explosion of data related to genetic and environmental factors that influence disease has profoundly changed the landscape of medical research and underwritten the promise of precision medicine, but little of this promise is based on studies of individuals of AA. In research studies of brain disorders, individuals of African descent make up, on average, less than 5% of research cohorts. In large-scale genetic studies of CNS disorders, the percentage of individuals of AA is even smaller (Gurdasani et al., 2019Gurdasani D. Barroso I. Zeggini E. Sandhu M.S. Genomics of disease risk in globally diverse populations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20: 520-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This is particularly troubling because AA Americans are 20% more likely to experience serious mental health problems than the general population and are arguably up to twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Suicide rates for AA children aged 5–11 are twice as high as comparable individuals of European ancestry even after controlling for socioeconomic factors (https://blog.samhsa.gov/2019/07/23/alarming-suicide-trends-in-african-american-children-an-urgent-issue). Genetic differences have also been linked to divergent responses to antipsychotics, lithium, and other CNS drugs in Black individuals compared with European ancestry individuals. While much of this is related to the impact of genetic variation on drug metabolism, targets in brain are also implicated. Clearly, the time for a brain research initiative focused on AA is long overdue. Genetic variation traces the timeline of human migrations and explains many of the differences in traits across populations, including susceptibility and resilience to illness and to environmental exposures. It is clinical lore that among individuals of AA, mutation of the beta globin gene responsible for sickle cell anemia likely arose as protection from malaria. Unique variants in the APOL1 gene, which are associated with increased risk of kidney disease in individuals of AA, likely were positively selected to protect against African trypanosomiasis. Variants not unique to recent differences in ancestry may still show dramatic heterogeneity of effects. So, for example, the APOe4 haplotype that is the principle risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is less penetrant in individuals of AA. Homozygotes for the risk haplotype are three times less likely to be at risk of LOAD as are individuals of European ancestry with the same haplotype, despite AD being potentially twice as common in AA people (Rajabli et al., 2018Rajabli F. Feliciano B.E. Celis K. Hamilton-Nelson K.L. Whitehead P.L. Adams L.D. Bussies P.L. Manrique C.P. Rodriguez A. Rodriguez V. et al.Ancestral origin of ApoE ε4 Alzheimer disease risk in Puerto Rican and African American populations.PLoS Genet. 2018; 14: e1007791Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Overall, individuals of AA have the most diverse genotypes and phenotypes of any population (Bentley et al., 2020Bentley A.R. Callier S.L. Rotimi C.N. Evaluating the promise of inclusion of African ancestry populations in genomics.NPJ Genom. Med. 2020; 5: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genes and the interacting environment conspire to personalize human health. When President Obama launched the personalized (“precision”) medicine initiative in January 2015, the idea was “an innovative approach that takes into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles.” Personalized medicine begins with the genetic mosaic of an individual’s ancestors. For more than 20 years, from the start of the dbSNP project to catalog single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome across ancestries, it has been apparent that allele frequencies at many variants differ substantially between individuals of AA and those of European ancestry. The human reference genome, the signature deliverable from the Human Genome Project, is the backbone of personalized medicine. It is the map universally used to assemble newly sequenced genomes, epigenomes, and transcriptomes and to calculate risk and predict treatment response based on genetic variation mapped to this genome. While derived from pieces of genomes of multiple volunteers, the current “build” of the human reference genome (GRCh38) is primarily (i.e., 70%) assembled from the genome of one individual of mixed European/African ancestry. Recent revisions of this reference have involved updating most SNPs based on European ancestry major alleles. This ancestry bias explains the startling results of a recent analysis of the DNA sequences of 910 individuals of African descent that found that approximately 10% of the pangenome constructed from these individuals (roughly 300 million DNA base pairs) was literally missing from the reference human genome (Sherman et al., 2019Sherman R.M. Forman J. Antonescu V. Puiu D. Daya M. Rafaels N. Boorgula M.P. Chavan S. Vergara C. Ortega V.E. et al.Assembly of a pan-genome from deep sequencing of 910 humans of African descent.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Large-scale population studies of common variants associated with common disease, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) revolution, have identified genetic associations with literally thousands of disease and common traits, mostly in European ancestry populations. The Psychiatric Genetics Consortium current GWAS of schizophrenia, involving 69,369 cases and 236,642 controls, includes not a single subject of AA. The latest GWAS of autism spectrum disorder, involving more than 190,000 individuals, included no one of AA. The recent state-of-the-art GWAS of Alzheimer’s disease, involving over 600,000 people, also included no individuals of AA. The largest GWAS of Parkinson’s disease, with upward of 1.9 million subjects, again, has no individuals of AA. A meta-analysis of GWASs of depression involving more than 2 million people is based exclusively on individuals of European ancestry. Of the 418 GWASs of neurological disorders in the NHGRI catalog, only 4% contain any minority groups, which include African, Native American, and Latinx ancestry. Polygene risk scores, which are based on summing risk-associated alleles at SNPs across the genomes from these GWAS datasets, predict illness risk in individuals of AA, on average, only one-fifth as strongly as predictions in people of European ancestry (Martin et al., 2019Martin A.R. Kanai M. Kamatani Y. Okada Y. Neale B.M. Daly M.J. Clinical use of current polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The inclusion of primarily European ancestry individuals in current genetic research limits understanding of how genetics influences disease (Bentley et al., 2020Bentley A.R. Callier S.L. Rotimi C.N. Evaluating the promise of inclusion of African ancestry populations in genomics.NPJ Genom. Med. 2020; 5: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and obscures a significant portion of the potential for scientific advancements for personalizing medicine because emerging therapeutics may fail to apply equally to individuals of AA. There is finally, however, momentum building to lessen these stark disparities in genetic research (Bentley et al., 2020Bentley A.R. Callier S.L. Rotimi C.N. Evaluating the promise of inclusion of African ancestry populations in genomics.NPJ Genom. Med. 2020; 5: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The effort jump started with the 1000 Genomes Project beginning in 2008, which endeavored to characterize genetic variation across diverse populations. The Personal Genome project, established in the United States in 2005 and recently expanded to include centers in Canada, Europe, and Asia, is an effort to eventually collect and make public the personal information and genome sequences of 100,000 individuals. It is unclear how many (if any) individuals of AA have volunteered so far. The NIH has launched the “All of Us” project, an ambitious program to acquire health information and sequence the genomes of 1 million individuals, with a target of 50% from minority populations. Some GWASs of individuals of AA with psychiatric disorders are finally ongoing in the United States and in Africa (Bigdeli et al., 2019Bigdeli T.B. Genovese G. Georgakopoulos P. Meyers J.L. Peterson R.E. Iyegbe C.O. Medeiros H. Valderrama J. Achtyes E.D. Kotov R. et al.Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia (COGS) InvestigatorsGenomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC) ConsortiumContributions of common genetic variants to risk of schizophrenia among individuals of African and Latino ancestry.Mol. Psychiatry. 2019; (Published online October 7, 2019)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-019-0517-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also in Africa, The Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) consortium is an effort to build partnerships of scientists across several African countries and study primarily general medical and infectious diseases. 23andME, the consumer genetics company, has made public whole-genome sequence data from 2,300 AA customers. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), an ambitious effort to identify rare coding and noncoding variants as well as structural and repeat variations in large samples, has released data from more than 125,000 exome sequences and over 71,000 whole-genome sequences. AA genome data are available for 8,100 of the exome sequences and 12,100 of the whole-genome sequences, though as these sequences are currently mapped to the existing reference genome, it is unclear whether or how many variations unique to the AA genome may have been dropped because of mapping errors. The NIH also has committed to constructing multiple reference genomes of AA, which may be available within the next few years. This, in addition to reference panels for imputation of genotypes from AA populations becoming more inclusive of genomic diversity (e.g., the NHLBI TOPMed project), though short of closing the gap, is a major step toward bringing the missing AA populations into the personalized medicine agenda. Population-based genetic associations do not directly identify potential mechanisms of disease, do not elucidate how variation in a gene matters to the development and function of the brain, and do not by themselves identify a specific causal gene. To bridge these critical gaps in CNS research, it is necessary to study genetic variation in the molecular context of a relevant biological tissue or organism. Since there are no animal models of human ancestral variation, the only high-fidelity biological tissue is the human brain. To understand the biology of unique ancestral variations and the heterogeneity of effects of common variations on gene networks and pathways requires brain tissue from diverse ancestries. Ancestry differences in gene expression, splicing, and epigenetic regulation are largely unknown, particularly in brain. The work horse resource for research about genetic regulation of gene expression is the Gene-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), a publicly available dataset of RNA-sequenced and SNP-genotyped tissues from nearly 1,000 individuals, including gross brain samples from 13 brain regions, with sample sizes per region varying from 114 to 209. Mixed ancestry tissue is found, on average, in only 7% of these various samples. In addition to the GTEx dataset being under representative of non-European ancestry tissue, concerns have been raised about RNA quality and instances of cross-sample contamination. The database representing participants from all Alzheimer’s Disease Centers, as maintained by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, lists 18 centers as having neuropathologic data from 5,283 brains, of which 321 (6.1%) are from individuals of AA. It is unclear how many of these brain samples are actually available for ongoing research. The NIH neuroBioBank, a loose aggregation of brain repositories in eight academic centers, claims to have specimens from an aggregate sum of 1,364 brains from donors of AA, of which 1,091 are said to be neurotypical, 136 to have schizophrenia, and 57 to have Alzheimer’s disease, among other less prevalent diagnoses. It is unclear what specific regions and samples remain and are available for ongoing research from these tissues, and diagnostic criteria, dissection, and tissue processing are not uniform across sites. The BrainSeq Consortium, a precompetitive collaboration between seven pharmaceutical companies and the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD, see below), has published studies on RNA sequencing and SNP genotyping in up to 495 donors from prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus across normal development and in psychiatric disorders, principally schizophrenia, with up to 213 samples from donors of AA (Jaffe et al., 2020Jaffe A.E. Hoeppner D.J. Saito T. Blanpain L. Ukaigwe J. Burke E.E. Collado-Torres L. Tao R. Tajinda K. Maynard K.R. et al.Profiling gene expression in the human dentate gyrus granule cell layer reveals insights into schizophrenia and its genetic risk.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PsychENCODE, a major NIMH initiative to characterize genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in brain in relation to psychiatric disorders, released RNA-seq data from 1,695 brains, mostly prefrontal cortex samples, 392 of which were from AA donors (Gandal et al., 2018Gandal M.J. Zhang P. Hadjimichael E. Walker R.L. Chen C. Liu S. Won H. van Bakel H. Varghese M. Wang Y. et al.PsychENCODE ConsortiumTranscriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.Science. 2018; 362: eaat8127Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The majority of the AA brain samples were from LIBD (n = 254). Interestingly, in the initial reports from these consortia, inclusion of AA brain tissue did not lead to an ancestry-specific analysis of how genetic variation across ancestry differentially influenced gene processing and expression. Rather, the samples were adjusted for global genomic ancestry in expression and in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analyses, a standard analytic approach in most studies of tissue from diverse ancestries in an effort to “pseudo-homogenize” the samples and identify biological effects that do not segregate with ancestry. To the extent that environments also differ across populations and cultures, epigenetic programming, which in turn regulates gene expression and splicing, also likely differs (Gurdasani et al., 2019Gurdasani D. Barroso I. Zeggini E. Sandhu M.S. Genomics of disease risk in globally diverse populations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20: 520-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since genetic sequence is a major driver of epigenetic programming, different populations will show variable sensitivity and resilience to environmental risk factors based on their genomes. Brain tissue is necessary to understand the biological ramifications of these possibilities. As an example, extreme stress in early childhood has been identified as a potentially increasing risk for many common disorders throughout life, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and drug abuse, as well as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Individuals of AA, particularly in urban environments, may be differentially exposed to extreme early childhood stress. A recent report based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neurons and glia sorted from prefrontal cortex of 24 mixed ancestry neurotypical individuals between the ages of infancy and 20 years showed that the rate of DNA methylation (i.e., the epigenetic plasticity of the neuronal genome) was dramatically greater during the first 5 years of life than during the following years (Price et al., 2019Price A.J. Collado-Torres L. Ivanov N.A. Xia W. Burke E.E. Shin J.H. Tao R. Ma L. Jia Y. Hyde T.M. et al.Divergent neuronal DNA methylation patterns across human cortical development reveal critical periods and a unique role of CpH methylation.Genome Biol. 2019; 20: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The biggest bias in this rate of change across age was ancestry. Clearly, there is a need for examination of how AA critically modulates the expression of disease and of environmental exposures. Low inclusion of minority groups in basic and clinical research is based on a number of factors, one of which reflects scientific opportunism. Since the AA genome has a more expanded population history, it is a more complex genome with more genetic diversity. This presents a greater statistical challenge for scientists to identify genes that are associated with common medical illnesses, in contrast to the European ancestry genome in which the statistical challenges are easier. This being said, the potential to discover novel loci and variants not common in European ancestry genomes is increasingly being realized in studies of admixed samples and those of diverse ancestries. Another reason for the missing minority groups in research is a fundamental distrust fueled by a history of medical abuses and ethical violations. The Black community is keenly aware of the unfortunate legacy of the medical establishment’s violation of its Hippocratic Oath, most egregiously, for example, the eugenics agenda in which Black women were disproportionality sterilized; the notorious Tuskegee study that withheld treatment for Black men with syphilis; the falsehoods promulgated about IQ data; and the shameful story of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman whose cancer cells are the source of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line and one of the most important cell lines in medical research. Mrs. Lacks was the unwitting source of these cells from a tumor biopsied during treatment for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, in 1951. No consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she, her husband, or her five children compensated for their extraction or use. It is incumbent on the medical research establishment to restore trust, enhance the involvement of the minority population, and increase the confidence of minority communities in the beneficence of human research. Today, in Baltimore, a city plagued by poverty and the psychological sequelae of multiple systematic traumas, a group of community leaders has partnered with the LIBD, an independent not-for-profit research institute on the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus, to transform the neuroscience research paradigm so that individuals of AA are no longer missing from studies of genes and the brain and actively involved in conducting this critical research. The partnership is committed to ensuring that minority communities are engaged from the start, when the scientific agenda is being set, in order to provide crucial trust building and for the results of the research to be understood and accessible to the community. The African Ancestry Neuroscience Research Initiative (AANRI) is led by Rev. Dr. Alvin Hathaway, pastor of the historic Union Baptist Church of Baltimore, and includes a formal partnership with Morgan State University, a historic black college, and participation by senior faculty from the Departments of African History and Anthropology and The Alexander Williams Law Center at the University of Maryland. A scientific advisory board is headed by Yasmin Hurd, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Kafui Dzirasa, MD, PhD, of Duke University. The initiative aims to galvanize civil rights leaders, scientists, affected communities, celebrities, philanthropists, business leaders, and government officials to advance an inclusive roadmap for neuroscience research as well as the creation of a future workforce of diverse scientists. In little more than a year since its inception, the AANRI has secured local, state, and federal government support to close the gap in brain research. Last year, Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md) championed authorizing language in the HHS Senate Appropriations Bill that solicited unprecedented bipartisan backing for an appropriation of $20 million in additional funds to the NIMH and the NIMHD targeting neuroscience research for ethnic minority groups. This past March, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan authored a supplemental budget for Fiscal Year 2021 that included $1.25 million in support specifically for the AANRI. In May, Brown Capital Financial Management, a philanthropic group in Baltimore, committed $1 million and the Abell Foundation awarded a grant of $275,000 for administration. The LIBD has committed $500,000 for the first phase of the research. Thus, with startup support in excess of $3 million, the AANRI has begun the first phase of brain genomics research that will lead to the public release in real time of data over the coming 3 years. The initiative will produce the largest dataset in the world of AA brain tissue that can be used by researchers globally to make medicine more personalized (Figure 1). The critical resource necessary to achieve the goals of the AANRI is the availability of high-quality human brain tissue of individuals of AA. With brain samples from over 3,100 individuals, including donations from more than 700 African American families, and a donation rate of over 400 new brains each year, the LIBD brain repository is one of the most extensive and well-curated collections of postmortem, multi-ancestry human brain material in the world. Brains are donated to the LIBD repository by next of kin, and the cases consented are then diagnosed as neurotypical or with a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, depression, and anxiety disorders, with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, and with traumatic brain injuries, suicide, PTSD, and drug abuse. All samples have been collected and processed by the same team for more than 20 years, and all dissections are performed by the same neuroanatomist. Each case has a detailed clinical history collected via interviews with the next of kin, treating physicians, and available medical records and includes comprehensive toxicology testing. The extensive clinical database contains over 100 fields of detailed demographic, clinical, and laboratory information on every sample. Brain tissue donations are collected from the Gift of Life program in Michigan as well as from four medical examiner sites around the country: The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, Maryland; WMed-Homer Stryker School of Medicine, Kalamazoo, Western Michigan; University of North Dakota Pathology Office, Grand Forks, North Dakota; and the Medical Examiner’s Office in Santa Clara County, California. The first phase of the AANRI will involve whole-genome DNA sequencing of each brain, followed by RNA sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, and peptide sequencing of bulk homogenate tissue from multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions from 500 donors of AA, combined neurotypical samples, and several neuropsychiatric diagnoses. These initial brain samples have been selected because of the high quality of the tissue and RNA, the availability of most of the brain, and access for future investigation to consented living dural fibroblasts cultured from most cases. As additional support for AANRI is secured, a second phase of the project will proceed, focused on single-cell sequencing of subsamples from phase I, with analogous “multi-omics” on individual nuclei and cells isolated using droplet techniques as well as laser capture and spatial transcriptomics technology. Phase III will involve additional samples to fill in gaps in the prior phases around specific diagnostic groups to generate high-dimensional analyses as contrast to other LIBD and public data from similar assays in brain tissue of European ancestry. The AANRI project will generate a detailed functional genomic resource, a compendium of how genetic and epigenetic variation influence gene and protein expression and splicing in brains of individuals of AA, how specific regions and cells parse these associations, and how genetic variations show heterogeneous molecular effects across ancestries. The ancestry-dependent stratification of gene and protein expression in brain will be essential for translating genetic risk loci associated with CNS disorders into causative genes, pathogenic mechanisms, and potentially “druggable” pathways and targets that are heterogeneous across populations. But there will be many challenges. Remapping based on multiple reference sequences will require novel computational approaches. Translating expression into disease association will require larger ancestry-based genetic association datasets and more human brain samples from individuals of AA with brain disorders. Validating the mechanism of illness and new therapeutic targets requires experimental biology, which cannot be done in postmortem brain tissue, but the availability of living cells from the majority of brains in the AANRI offers a unique opportunity to do the necessary research. Community involvement at many levels will be critical to advancing this project, as will bringing other sites and scientists into the AANRI. The inclusion of individuals of AA in the mainstream of genomic and neuroscience research will not only proverbially level the playing field, it will lead to an understanding of human illness at much greater depth and breadth and will help create a precision medicine paradigm that is truly personalized. The AANRI is committed to achieving these goals while preparing the next generation of diverse scientists to lead this critical research for future generations. The AANRI would not have happened were it not for the tireless dedication and commitment of Kari Stoever, Becky Oldham, and Martin Knott. The Lieber Institute brain repository was funded by philanthropic gifts from the families of Connie and Stephen Lieber and Milton and Tamar Maltz and was created and is led by Tom Hyde and Joel Kleinman, who, it should be noted, also were responsible for establishing and maintaining for more than 20 years the NIMH Clinical Brain Disorder Branch brain repository, renamed in 2013 to the NIMH Human Brain Collection Core."
https://openalex.org/W3045958001,"Despite active research on trading systems based on reinforcement learning, the development and performance of research methods require improvements. This study proposes a new action-specialized expert ensemble method consisting of action-specialized expert models designed specifically for each reinforcement learning action: buy, hold, and sell. Models are constructed by examining and defining different reward values that correlate with each action under specific conditions, and investment behavior is reflected with each expert model. To verify the performance of this technique, profits of the proposed system are compared to those of single trading and common ensemble systems. To verify robustness and account for the extension of discrete action space, we compared and analyzed changes in profits of the three actions to our model's results. Furthermore, we checked for sensitivity with three different reward functions: profit, Sharpe ratio, and Sortino ratio. All experiments were conducted with S&P500, Hang Seng Index, and Eurostoxx50 data. The model was 39.1% and 21.6% more efficient than single and common ensemble models, respectively. Considering the extended discrete action space, the 3-action space was extended to 11- and 21-action spaces, and the cumulative returns increased by 427.2% and 856.7%, respectively. Results on reward functions indicated that our models are well trained; results of the Sharpe and Sortino ratios were better than the implementation of profit only, as in the single-model cases. The Sortino ratio was slightly better than the Sharpe ratio."
https://openalex.org/W3046020509,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) is one of the key factors in plant defense responses and suppresses virus or viroid invasion into shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Nicotiana benthamiana. To evaluate the role of Solanum lycopersicum (Sl) RDR6 upon viroid infection, SlRDR6-suppressed (SlRDR6i) 'Moneymaker' tomatoes were generated by RNA interference and inoculated with intermediate or lethal strain of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). Suppression of SlRDR6 did not change disease symptoms of both PSTVd strains in 'Moneymaker' tomatoes. Analysis of PSTVd distribution in shoot apices by in situ hybridization revealed that both PSTVd strains similarly invade the basal part but not apical part including pluripotent stem cells of SAM in SlRDR6i plants at a low rate unlike a previous report in N. benthamiana. In addition, unexpectedly, amount of PSTVd accumulation was apparently lower in SlRDR6i plants than in control tomatoes transformed with empty cassette in early infection especially in the lethal strain. Meanwhile, SlRDR6 suppression did not affect the seed transmission rates of PSTVd. These results indicate that RDR6 generally suppresses PSTVd invasion into SAM in plants, while suppression of RDR6 does not necessarily elevate amount of PSTVd accumulation. Additionally, our results suggest that host factors such as RDR1 other than RDR6 may also be involved in the protection of SAM including pluripotent stem cells from PSTVd invasion and effective RNA silencing causing the decrease of PSTVd accumulation during early infection in tomato plants."

Patients with CAD and cerebral ischemia are recommended to undergo antiplatelet therapy, but they have an increased incidence of major bleeding complications. Both assessment of the platelet activation status and response to antiplatelet therapy in each patient are highly desired. β-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) 770 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, and its extracellular region, a soluble form of APP770 (sAPP770, also called nexin-2), is proteolytically cleaved for shedding.

In this study, we used peripheral blood samples from patients with CAD and control subjects and evaluated sAPP770 as a specific biomarker for platelet activation. First, the plasma levels of sAPP770 correlated well with those of the soluble form CD40 ligand (CD40L), an established biomarker for platelet activation. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis using peripheral blood cells showed that CD40L expression is up-regulated in activated T cells, whereas APP770 expression is negligible in all blood cell types except platelets. Following stimulation with collagen or ADP, aggregating platelets immediately released sAPP770. Finally, patients with dual antiplatelet therapy showed significantly lower levels of plasma sAPP770 than those with no therapy.

Rupture of these lesions triggers the acute onset of arterial thrombosis, which could lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ischemic stroke.

Conversely, antiplatelet therapy increases the incidence of major bleeding complications (mostly in the upper gastrointestinal tract) (3Patrono C. Coller B. FitzGerald G.A. Hirsh J. Roth G.

How to set up the duration of DAPT in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients remains unclear. Although the ex vivo measurement of platelet responsiveness to various agonists can evaluate the function of platelets, such measurements show no correlation with platelet activation in vivo (1Davì G. Patrono C. Platelet activation and atherothrombosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 (18077812): 2482-249410.1056/NEJMra071014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Activated platelets lead to the release of granular components and relocalization of membrane proteins to the cell surface. Upon platelet activation, surface P-selectin is expressed on the platelet membrane (5Larsen E. Celi A. Gilbert G.E. Furie B.C. Erban J.K. Bonfanti R. Wagner D.D. Furie B. PADGEM protein: a receptor that mediates the interaction of activated platelets with neutrophils and monocytes.Cell. 1989; 59 (2478294): 305-31210.1016/0092-8674(89)90292-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and mediates platelet–endothelial interactions (2Ruggeri Z.M.

P-selectin is considered the “gold standard” marker of platelet activation. Circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates can be detected by flow cytometry analysis and are sensitive laboratory markers for platelet activation (6Furman M.I. Barnard M.R. Krueger L.A. Fox M.L.

CD40 ligand (CD40L) is cryptic in unstimulated T cells and platelets but is rapidly presented to the cell surface after their activation (7Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Strockbine L. Sato T.A.

However, no practical biomarker is available to evaluate platelet activation. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a membrane protein that generates β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, and the accumulation of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain triggers the onset of Alzheimer's disease (16Selkoe D.J. Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81 (11274343): 741-76610.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.741Crossref PubMed Scopus (5162) Google Scholar, 17De Strooper B.

The soluble form of APP770 (sAPP770) is released upon platelet activation, and plasma sAPP770 levels are significantly higher in ACS patients (23Kitazume S. Yoshihisa A. Yamaki T. Oikawa M.

In this study, by analyzing blood samples from control subjects and CAD patients, we found a significant correlation between the plasma levels of sAPP770 and sCD40L and that APP770 expression is limited to platelets in blood cells. Moreover, compared with those in control subjects and CAD patients with aspirin alone, the plasma sAPP770 levels were significantly lower in CAD patients with DAPT. Our finding raises the possibility that plasma sAPP770 can be a useful platelet activation marker. We first performed a validation study of APP770 ELISA using heparinized and citrated plasma and found that the dilution linearity, recovery rate, and coefficient validation were similar to those of EDTA plasma and serum, as reported in the manufacturer's data sheet (Fig. S1). Because sCD40L is an established laboratory marker for platelet activation, we then compared the performance of plasma sAPP770 with that of sCD40L. The plasma samples from healthy volunteers were diluted at 1:5 or 1:75 and used to determine sCD40L and sAPP770 levels using sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1A). The plasma sAPP770 level was high (27.3 ± 4.0 ng/ml), whereas the plasma sCD40L level was markedly lower (105 ± 34 pg/ml); 4 of 10 plasma samples showed undetectable sCD40L levels (zero absorbance; Fig. 1B). Because it is expected that CAD patients have higher levels of sCD40L (13Aukrust P. Müller F. Ueland T. Berget T. Aaser E. Brunsvig A. Solum N.O. Forfang K. Frøland S.S. Gullestad L.

Again, 31 of 67 samples from CAD patients and 12 of 53 samples from control subjects show undetectable sCD40L levels, and the remaining samples were then used to measure sAPP770 levels. We found a significant correlation between the sAPP770 and sCD40L levels (r = 0.4492; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C), raising the possibility of sAPP770 as a promising biomarker for platelet activation. We next asked whether human peripheral blood cell types other than platelets express APP770 or another APP isoform. To this end, we used two antibodies, anti-APP770 and anti-APP 22C11, the latter of which recognizes all APP isoforms. In CD13+ cells, which represent myeloid cells, APP770 expression was not detectable (Fig. 2A), whereas the other APP isoform was weakly expressed. We next isolated lymphocytes from peripheral blood cells and found that none of the APP isoforms were detectable in both T and B cells (Fig. 2, B and C). We also employed a biochemical approach to confirm that APP770 expression is limited to platelets. We first isolated platelet-free blood cells by repeated centrifugation. Using magnetic beads, we then isolated leukocytes positive for CD45, which is expressed at high levels on all cells of hematopoietic origin except erythrocytes and platelets. To isolate the limited populations of leukocytes, we sequentially incubated platelet-free blood cells with magnetic beads conjugated with different antibodies: anti-CD3 (for T cells), anti-CD19 (for B cells), and anti-CD14 (for monocytes). Both APP and APP770 signals were undetectable in these cell types (Fig. 2D). From platelet-rich plasma (PRP), we also isolated platelets, which showed positive staining for platelet markers such as CD42b and CD40L, and found that the isolated platelets expressed APP770. T cells show weak CD40L signal. It is known that CD40L surface expression is markedly induced in activated T cells (7Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Strockbine L. Sato T.A. Clifford K.N. Macduff B.M. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Davis-Smith T. Maliszewski C.R.

Immunol. 1996; 26 (8977315): 3137-314310.1002/eji.1830261246Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We next asked whether activated lymphocytes could induce APP770 expression. We found that T cells activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin showed strong cell surface CD40L expression, whereas activated lymphocytes did not express detectable levels of surface APP770 expression (Fig. 2E). The APP isoform with the Kunitz type II protease inhibitor domain, APP751/770, has been historically described as protease nexin-2, a membrane protein and α-granule protein in platelets (22Bush A.I. Martins R.N. Rumble B. Moir R. Fuller S. Milward E. Currie J. Ames D. Weidemann A. Fischer P. et al.The amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease is released by human platelets.J. Biol.

Nevertheless, intracellular localization of membrane-bound APP remains unclear. Next, we assessed whether surface APP770 expression is found in platelets before and after activation. Resting platelets showed high APP770 expression (Fig. 3A). After thrombin-mediated platelet activation, as judged by staining with PAC-1, which recognizes activated glycoprotein IIa/IIIb, surface APP770 expression did not increase, but the number of APP770low platelets was decreased. The results indicate that membrane relocalization following platelet activation affects the surface APP770 levels. We next stimulated platelets with the strong agonist collagen or weak agonist ADP and then measured sAPP770 release. Both agonists caused the release of sAPP770 upon platelet aggregation (Fig. 3, B and C). Notably, low levels of ADP led to a platelet aggregation curve that was biphasic (an initial wave of aggregation (primary wave), followed by a secondary wave of aggregation), and the elevation of sAPP770 was delayed. The results indicate that the secondary wave of aggregation is mainly responsible for the sAPP770 release. Because markedly high levels of sAPP770 were released from platelets, we next analyzed the α- and β-site cleavage products of APP770, sAPP770α, sAPP770β, and Aβ40/42, following platelet activation with the strong agonist thrombin. Although both sAPPα and sAPPβ were found to be released from platelets, Aβ40/42 was undetectable (Fig. 3, D and E). The higher sAPP770 level than the total value of sAPPα plus sAPPβ could be explained by the different standard samples used in the different ELISA systems (APP770, sAPP-α, and sAPP-β), which made direct comparison of the measured APP770 values difficult. To analyze the proteolytic cleavage of platelet APP following stimulation in more detail, we performed Western blotting analysis using anti–N-terminal APP antibody 22C11 and anti–C-terminal APP antibody (which detects the C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP) (26Willem M. Tahirovic S. Busche M.A. Ovsepian S.V. Chafai M. Kootar S. Hornburg D. Evans L.D. Moore S. Daria A. Hampel H. Müller V. Giudici C. Nuscher B. Wenninger-Weinzierl A. et al.η-Secretase processing of APP inhibits neuronal activity in the hippocampus.Nature. 2015; 526 (26322584): 443-44710.1038/nature14864Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After platelet activation, a 22C11-positive signal corresponding to full-length APP was markedly reduced (Fig. 3F) in response to sAPP770 production. Although we observed a major signal corresponding to CTF-α/β (as demonstrated by an approximate molecular mass of 12 kDa), other CTFs were undetectable. To determine whether blood sAPP770 is a useful biomarker for platelet activation, we first asked how different blood-collecting tubes would affect the blood sAPP770 levels. Analysis of blood samples from healthy human volunteers showed that the sAPP770 level was 10.4 ng/ml in citrated plasma, 36.0 ng/ml in heparinized plasma, and 416.0 ng/ml in serum (Fig. 4A). It is considered that proteolytic cleavage of endothelial APP770 results in the release of sAPP770 (23Kitazume S. Yoshihisa A. Yamaki T. Oikawa M. Tachida Y. Ogawa K. Imamaki R. Hagiwara Y. Kinoshita N. Takeishi Y. Furukawa K. Tomita N. Arai H. Iwata N.

The 10-fold higher serum sAPP770 levels than plasma sAPP770 are likely due to platelets becoming fully activated and degranulated in serum to release sAPP770. Similarly, we hypothesized that platelets are relatively unstable in heparinized blood samples, and partially activated platelets contribute to the increased sAPP770 levels. To confirm this hypothesis, we kept both citrated and heparinized blood samples at room temperature for up to 2 h and isolated plasma at the appropriate intervals. As expected, the sAPP770 levels were stable in citrated plasma, but gradual sAPP770 elevation was observed in heparinized plasma, with the highest value at 1 h (Fig. 4B). We next studied the fluctuation of the blood sAPP770 levels throughout the day. We found that serum sAPP770 levels did not vary throughout the day. However, citrated plasma sAPP770 levels were higher but not significant in the morning (Fig. 4C), which could be related to the previous report showing a marked circadian rhythm in the frequency of onset of ACS, with a peak from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. (27Müller J.E. Stone P.H. Turi Z.G. Rutherford J.D. Czeisler C.A. Parker C. Poole W.K. Passamani E. Roberts R. Robertson T. Circadian variation in the frequency of onset of acute myocardial infarction.N. Engl. J.

Because the sAPP770 levels in heparinized plasma are variable by the time between the sample collection and the assay, we decided to measure sAPP770 levels in citrated plasma samples in control subjects with neither CAD nor antiplatelet therapy, CAD patients with aspirin only, and CAD patients with DAPT. We found that the levels of citrated plasma sAPP770 in CAD patients with DAPT were significantly lower than those of control subjects without therapy (Fig. 5). The results suggest that blood levels of sAPP770 are decreased by the effect of antiplatelet therapy, and we concluded that plasma sAPP770 could be a promising marker for platelet activity in CAD subjects. In this study, we show that APP770 is abundantly expressed in platelets but undetectable in other peripheral blood cells. Because platelets are abundant in peripheral blood, we repeated centrifugation several times to unambiguously eliminate platelets from other blood cell types; otherwise, APP770 is detected in different blood cell types. Flow cytometry analysis of platelets showed surface APP770 expression, whereas sandwich ELISA detected substantial levels of released sAPP770, sAPP770α, and sAPP770β following platelet activation. In our previous study using anti–C-terminal APP and APP770 antibodies, membrane-bound APP accounted for less than 10% of total APP in platelets (23Kitazume S. Yoshihisa A. Yamaki T. Oikawa M.

APP has mainly two processing pathways, α-site cleavage initiated by ADAM (“a disintegrin and metalloprotease”) and BACE1-mediated β-site cleavage, which produces pathogenic Aβ by subsequent γ-site cleavage (28Haass C.

Contrary to our finding that abundant levels of sAPP770α and sAPP770β are released from platelets, Aβ40/42 was undetectable.

https://openalex.org/W3044483634,"Background Long term outcomes of children with neurodevelopmental disability are influenced by the condition itself, available health services and caretakers’ coping ability to nurture the children which may be related to their beliefs and experiences. Most children with neurodevelopmental disabilities live in resource constrained settings. To inform design of contextually appropriate interventions, this study explored health workers’ and caretakers’ experiences in caring for infants with neurodevelopmental disability in rural eastern Uganda. Methods A qualitative case study was carried out in December 2017 and involved in-depth interviews with 14 caretakers of infants with severe neurodevelopmental disability, and five health workers in Iganga/Mayuge Demographic Surveillance Site in eastern Uganda. The interviews with caretakers were conducted in Lusoga, the local language, and in English for the health workers, using a pre-determined open-ended interview guide. Data were analyzed using latent content analysis. Results Caretakers described the experience of caring for children with neurodevelopmental disability as impoverishing and ‘imprisoning’ due to high care costs, inability to return to income generating activities and nursing challenges. The latter resulted from failure in body control and several aspects of nutrition and maintaining vital functions, coupled with limited support from the community and the health system. Many caretakers expressed beliefs in supernatural causes of neurodevelopmental disability though they reported about complications during and shortly after the birth of the affected child. Care-seeking was often challenging and impeded by costs and the feeling of lack of improvement. The health care system was also found to be incapable of adequately addressing the needs of such children due to lack of commodities, and human resource limitations. Conclusion The caretakers expressed a feeling of emotional stress due to being left alone with a high nursing burden. Improvement in the health services including a holistic approach to care, improved community awareness and parental support could contribute to nursing of children with NDD."

Effective therapies are lagging behind because most drugs cannot reach their targets in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The new development of a BBB transport vehicle may bring us a step closer to solve this problem. Brain disorders are at the leading edge of global disease burden worldwide. Effective therapies are lagging behind because most drugs cannot reach their targets in the brain because of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The new development of a BBB transport vehicle may bring us a step closer to solve this problem. If curing brain diseases is equivalent to the Mars mission in biomedicine, then delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is unquestionably the Moonshot. Since the discovery of the BBB by German physician Paul Ehrlich in the late 1800s, generations of scientists and engineers tried to understand how to breach the BBB for successful delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS), but none have fully succeeded. Recently, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have joined the race proposing cutting-edge antibody-based technologies. Two new reports from Denali Therapeutics definitely showcased their success in creating a promising platform (Kariolis et al., 2020Kariolis M.S. Wells R.C. Getz J.A. Kwan W. Mahon C.S. Tong R. Kim D.J. Srivastava A. Bedard C. Henne K.R. et al.Brain delivery of therapeutic proteins using an Fc fragment blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice and monkeys.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar; Ullman et al., 2020Ullman J.C. Arguello A. Getz J.A. Bhalla A. Mahon C.S. Wang J. Giese T. Bedard C. Kim D.J. Blumenfeld J.R. et al.Brain delivery and activity of a lysosomal enzyme using a blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which perhaps could be our Falcon 9 for the next step. The BBB is the gate keeper of the CNS, uniquely separating brain internal milieu from the circulating blood. The BBB limits toxic substances, pathogens, and >99% of drugs from entering the brain, yet at the same time selectively controls transport of ions, nutrients, and essential signaling molecules through its highly specialized transport systems (Sweeney et al., 2019Sweeney M.D. Zhao Z. Montagne A. Nelson A.R. Zlokovic B.V. Blood-Brain Barrier: From Physiology to Disease and Back.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 21-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) is one of the secret passages within the BBB. RMT is a series of tightly regulated cellular events in the endothelium, starting with clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis and followed by intracellular trafficking of the endosomes containing the “cargo” and sorting of the vesicles toward directed exocytosis, rather than lysosomal-mediated degradation, a process guided by small Rab GTPases (Zhao et al., 2015Zhao Z. Sagare A.P. Ma Q. Halliday M.R. Kong P. Kisler K. Winkler E.A. Ramanathan A. Kanekiyo T. Bu G. et al.Central role for PICALM in amyloid-β blood-brain barrier transcytosis and clearance.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 978-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Many growth factors and signaling peptides, such as leptin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor, lipoproteins, and transferrin, are delivered to the brain across the BBB via RMT. Therefore, targeting the RMT systems offers a tremendous opportunity for CNS drug delivery (Sweeney et al., 2019Sweeney M.D. Zhao Z. Montagne A. Nelson A.R. Zlokovic B.V. Blood-Brain Barrier: From Physiology to Disease and Back.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 21-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor (TfR) was the first extensively utilized as an RMT system for transport of antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates across the BBB (Friden et al., 1991Friden P.M. Walus L.R. Musso G.F. Taylor M.A. Malfroy B. Starzyk R.M. Anti-transferrin receptor antibody and antibody-drug conjugates cross the blood-brain barrier.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 4771-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) (see Figure 1). A monoclonal antibody OX-26 was the first experimental vessel, which transported methotrexate conjugates across the murine BBB to reach the brain parenchyma side. Following this report, other BBB associated receptors, such as insulin receptors, have been actively tested for their potential for CNS drug delivery (Zuchero et al., 2016Zuchero Y.J.Y. Chen X. Bien-Ly N. Bumbaca D. Tong R.K. Gao X. Zhang S. Hoyte K. Luk W. Huntley M.A. et al.Discovery of Novel Blood-Brain Barrier Targets to Enhance Brain Uptake of Therapeutic Antibodies.Neuron. 2016; 89: 70-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because RMT efficiency is highly dependent on the abundance and spatial distribution of the receptors, TfR, as one of the top transmembrane proteins enriched at the BBB (Zuchero et al., 2016Zuchero Y.J.Y. Chen X. Bien-Ly N. Bumbaca D. Tong R.K. Gao X. Zhang S. Hoyte K. Luk W. Huntley M.A. et al.Discovery of Novel Blood-Brain Barrier Targets to Enhance Brain Uptake of Therapeutic Antibodies.Neuron. 2016; 89: 70-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), has become the principal target for antibody designing and optimization. The second generation of therapeutic antibodies that recognize TfR for transverse BBB delivery were based on antibody engineering. One approach used protein fusion, where the high-affinity TfR monoclonal antibody (e.g., 8D3) was fused to an anti-amyloid single chain Fv (ScFv) antibody (Zhou et al., 2011Zhou Q.-H. Fu A. Boado R.J. Hui E.K.-W. Lu J.Z. Pardridge W.M. Receptor-mediated abeta amyloid antibody targeting to Alzheimer’s disease mouse brain.Mol. Pharm. 2011; 8: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or to a recombinant protein for replacement therapy (Ullman et al., 2020Ullman J.C. Arguello A. Getz J.A. Bhalla A. Mahon C.S. Wang J. Giese T. Bedard C. Kim D.J. Blumenfeld J.R. et al.Brain delivery and activity of a lysosomal enzyme using a blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Genentech applied the bispecific antibody concept and created an antibody with two different Fab domains, one recognizing TfR and the other neutralizing amyloid processing enzyme β-secretase (BACE1) (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S. Boosting brain uptake of a therapeutic antibody by reducing its affinity for a transcytosis target.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 84ra44Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Both approaches showed improved but not optimal antibody uptake by the brain, yet despite this, amyloid pathology was significantly reduced in Alzheimer’s disease mouse lines treated with these antibodies (Yu et al., 2011Yu Y.J. Zhang Y. Kenrick M. Hoyte K. Luk W. Lu Y. Atwal J. Elliott J.M. Prabhu S. Watts R.J. Dennis M.S.

Receptor-mediated abeta amyloid antibody targeting to Alzheimer’s disease mouse brain.Mol. Pharm. 2011; 8: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The later versions improved the BBB uptake by either reducing the bispecific antibody’s affinity to TfR (Yu et al., 2014Yu Y.J. Atwal J.K. Zhang Y. Tong R.K. Wildsmith K.R. Tan C. Bien-Ly N. Hersom M. Maloney J.A. Meilandt W.J. et al.Therapeutic bispecific antibodies cross the blood-brain barrier in nonhuman primates.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 261ra154Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) or only fusing to one Fc domain that can interact with TfR (Niewoehner et al., 2014Niewoehner J. Bohrmann B. Collin L. Urich E. Sade H. Maier P. Rueger P. Stracke J.O. Lau W. Tissot A.C. et al.Increased brain penetration and potency of a therapeutic antibody using a monovalent molecular shuttle.Neuron. 2014; 81: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Now Kariolis et al., 2020Kariolis M.S. Wells R.C. Getz J.A. Kwan W. Mahon C.S. Tong R. Kim D.J. Srivastava A. Bedard C. Henne K.R. et al.Brain delivery of therapeutic proteins using an Fc fragment blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice and monkeys.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar reported a new generation of tools. Aiming to create a versatile platform capable of delivering a broad range of cargos, the Denali team engineered one of the human IgG1 Fc domains. They first selected nine amino acids in the CH3 domain of Fc that are distant to other functional binding sites of the receptor for randomization, and luckily identified four unique combinations that endowed Fc’s new ability to bind TfR. Using the YTEWSQ-EDH sequence as a foundation for affinity maturation, Kariolis et al., 2020Kariolis M.S. Wells R.C. Getz J.A. Kwan W. Mahon C.S. Tong R. Kim D.J. Srivastava A. Bedard C. Henne K.R. et al.Brain delivery of therapeutic proteins using an Fc fragment blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice and monkeys.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar finally found a transport vehicle (TV) with the key residue E387 that directly binds to human TfR. With this platform, Kariolis et al., 2020Kariolis M.S. Wells R.C. Getz J.A. Kwan W. Mahon C.S. Tong R. Kim D.J. Srivastava A. Bedard C. Henne K.R. et al.Brain delivery of therapeutic proteins using an Fc fragment blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice and monkeys.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar were able to deliver BACE1 Fabs across the BBB into the brain in both transgenic mice and cynomolgus monkeys, which downregulated BACE1 levels and production of endogenous amyloid-β peptide. Because the TfR binding site is engineered on the Fc domain, it is now possible to have bispecific Fab domains to pursue multiple drug targets at the same time, as for example both BACE1 and Tau for Alzheimer’s disease. The TfR-TV can also fuse with any therapeutic protein or peptide. Ullman et al., 2020Ullman J.C. Arguello A. Getz J.A. Bhalla A. Mahon C.S. Wang J. Giese T. Bedard C. Kim D.J. Blumenfeld J.R. et al.Brain delivery and activity of a lysosomal enzyme using a blood-brain barrier transport vehicle in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2020; 12: eaay1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar reported linking the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) to the TV and treated a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) lysosomal storage disease, also known as Hunter syndrome. Compared to classic enzyme replacement therapy, TfR-TV not only reduced peripheral symptoms but also increased brain IDS levels, successfully restored lysosome function, and prevented neurodegeneration in IDS knockout mice expressing human TfR. Although these are proof-of-concept studies, they clearly demonstrate the improved efficacy of delivering cargo to the brain via TfR-TV and endless capability in adapting diverse therapeutics with potential to target different CNS diseases. Is the TV the final answer for the BBB challenge? It is probably too early to tell. Using the TfR-TV for antibody delivery will likely require regular dosing, which will be very costly for chronic CNS conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, but can also cause potential immune responses including first infusion reactions acutely and neutralizing antibodies long-term. Additionally, BBB impairment in different CNS disorders is accompanied by focal and regional microenvironment changes in the affected sites. This includes perivascular accumulation of blood-derived macromolecules and infiltrating immune cells, vascular regression, and blood flow reduction, which could all present a challenge for successful drug delivery and CNS distribution (Sweeney et al., 2018Sweeney M.D. Sagare A.P. Zlokovic B.V. Blood-brain barrier breakdown in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2018; 14: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Additionally, RMT deficiency is expected to occur often, if not always, in the affected brain regions in neurological and/or neurodegenerative disorders associated with vascular dysfunction (Sweeney et al., 2019Sweeney M.D. Zhao Z. Montagne A. Nelson A.R. Zlokovic B.V. Blood-Brain Barrier: From Physiology to Disease and Back.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 21-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). This might include deficiency of TfR itself and/or abnormalities in the endocytic and exocytotic molecular machinery, which may potentially contribute to variations in TfR-TV’s efficacy in the population affected by brain diseases. Although the new RMT-targeting antibody platform is exciting, it might be worthwhile to take a careful look at other strategies developed to circumvent the BBB. Different routes of drug administration have been adapted in clinic already, including intracerebroventricular administration of Cerliponase for Batten’s disease and/or intrathecal administration of antisense oligos Spinraza (developed by IONIS and Biogen) for infantile spinal muscular atrophy. Other approaches, although still in preclinical development, have also shown great potential, such as encapsulation into nanoparticles or liposomes. Utilizing the carrier-mediated transport systems can also be very effective for the delivery of certain therapeutics (Zuchero et al., 2016Zuchero Y.J.Y. Chen X. Bien-Ly N. Bumbaca D. Tong R.K. Gao X. Zhang S. Hoyte K. Luk W. Huntley M.A. et al.Discovery of Novel Blood-Brain Barrier Targets to Enhance Brain Uptake of Therapeutic Antibodies.Neuron. 2016; 89: 70-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Additionally, viral vector-mediated gene delivery to the CNS, particularly via the AAV9-PHP variants (Wang et al., 2019Wang D. Tai P.W.L. Gao G. Adeno-associated virus vector as a platform for gene therapy delivery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18: 358-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), has demonstrated high efficiency in crossing the BBB in rodents. The journey to find a perfect solution may be still out there, but the TfR-TV system deserves a big round of applause!

https://openalex.org/W3045360353,"Heme is an essential cofactor for many biological processes in aerobic organisms, which can synthesize it de novo through a conserved pathway. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, as well as other trypanosomatids relevant to human health, are heme auxotrophs, meaning they must import it from their mammalian hosts or insect vectors. However, how these species import and regulate heme levels is not fully defined yet. It is known that the membrane protein TcHTE is involved in T. cruzi heme transport, although its specific role remains unclear. In the present work, we studied endogenous TcHTE in the different life cycle stages of the parasite to gain insight into its function in heme transport and homeostasis. We have confirmed that TcHTE is predominantly detected in replicative stages (epimastigote and amastigote), in which heme transport activity was previously validated. We also showed that in epimastigotes, TcHTE protein and mRNA levels decrease in response to increments in heme concentration, confirming it as a member of the heme response gene family. Finally, we demonstrated that T. cruzi epimastigotes can sense intracellular heme by an unknown mechanism and regulate heme transport to adapt to changing conditions. Based on these results, we propose a model in which T. cruzi senses intracellular heme and regulates heme transport activity by adjusting the expression of TcHTE. The elucidation and characterization of heme transport and homeostasis will contribute to a better understanding of a critical pathway for T. cruzi biology allowing the identification of novel and essential proteins.

Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite responsible for Chagas disease, the most prevalent parasitic disease in several countries of the Americas. It is a trypanosomatid, member of the class Kinetoplasteae, that also includes other parasites affecting human health such as Trypanosoma brucei (sleeping sickness) and Leishmania spp. (visceral, cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis). T. cruzi undergoes a complex life cycle, alternating between a mammal host and an insect vector and displaying at least four life cycle stages that are morphologically and metabolically different: Epimastigotes, metacyclic trypomastigotes, intracellular amastigotes, and bloodstream trypomastigotes (1Tyler K.M. Engman D.M. The life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi revisited.Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31 (11334932): 472-48110.1016/S0020-7519(01)00153-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids are aerobe organisms that present several heme proteins involved in essential metabolic pathways (2Tripodi K.E.J. Menendez Bravo S.M. Cricco J.A. Role of heme and heme-proteins in trypanosomatid essential metabolic pathways.Enzyme Res. 2011; 2011 (21603276): 87323010.4061/2011/873230Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, they lack a complete heme synthesis pathway (3Kořený L. Oborník M. Lukeš J. Make it, take it, or leave it: Heme metabolism of parasites.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 (23349629): e100308810.1371/journal.ppat.1003088Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For this reason, trypanosomatids must scavenge this molecule from the host or vector (2Tripodi K.E.J. Menendez Bravo S.M. Cricco J.A. Role of heme and heme-proteins in trypanosomatid essential metabolic pathways.Enzyme Res. 2011; 2011 (21603276): 87323010.4061/2011/873230Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Also, it is well-established that free heme is not found in any living cell because of its toxicity; therefore, a fine-tuned control of heme homeostasis is necessary to avoid its harmful effects. In the last years, some proteins of trypanosomatids displaying sequence homology to CeHRG-4 (Caenorhabditis elegans heme responsive gene 4) (4Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K.

LHR1 (leishmania heme response 1, from Leishmania amazonensis) was the first protein postulated as a heme transporter in Leishmania spp. LHR1 mRNA responds to heme availability in the environment, confirming it as a member of the heme response gene (HRG) family (5Huynh C.

Also, heme uptake mediated by LHR1 results are relevant for the virulence of L. amazonensis (6Renberg R.L. Yuan X. Samuel T.K. Miguel D.C. Hamza I. Andrews N.W. Flannery A.R.

We described previously a homologous protein in T. cruzi named TcHTE (T. cruzi heme transport enhancer) that plays a critical role in heme transport and is found mainly in the flagellar pocket of T. cruzi epimastigotes (8Merli M.L.

TbHRG (T. brucei heme responsive gene) was described in T. brucei and postulated to be involved in transport of free heme or in the salvage of heme derived from hemoglobin degradation (9Cabello-Donayre M.

The latest might be involved in free heme transport in L. major, probably overlapping some functions with LmHR1. LHR1, TcHTE, and TbHRG present similar growth performance when expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae hem1Δ, allowing these knockout cells to grow in a medium supplemented with low heme. Also, the overexpression of recombinant versions of these trypanosomatid genes in the corresponding native organisms causes an increment in the intracellular heme concentration, confirming their role in heme transport (5Huynh C.

Bioinformatic analysis of these proteins predict that they have a four transmembrane segment topology similar to CeHRG-4 (4, 5, 8, 9). However, it remains unclear how the HRG proteins work, which are their precise roles in heme transport, and how the expression of HRG genes is regulated by heme. In this work, we present the study of the endogenous TcHTE. Our data clearly show that TcHTE transcription is regulated by heme as LHR1 does (5Huynh C. Yuan X. Miguel D.C. Renberg R.L. Protchenko O.

Heme uptake by Leishmania amazonensis is mediated by the transmembrane protein LHR1.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 (22807677): e100279510.1371/journal.ppat.1002795Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). TcHTE mRNA and protein levels decrease in response to increments in heme concentration, which confirms TcHTE as a member of the HRG family. Using different fluorescent heme analogs, we proved that epimastigotes sense intracellular heme concentration and consequently modulate the amount of TcHTE. Besides, the expression of recombinant TcHTE enhances replication of intracellular amastigotes, probably by increasing heme uptake from the cytoplasm of the infected cell, where its availability could be a limiting growth factor. In summary, our results show that heme transport activity in T. cruzi is tightly modulated by the presence or absence of TcHTE. TcHTE was described previously as a critical protein for heme transport in T. cruzi, probably being part of the heme transporter and/or regulating its activity (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10 (26752206): e000435910.1371/journal.pntd.0004359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To expand our knowledge of TcHTE, we used specific polyclonal antibodies against TcHTE to detect and analyze the presence of the endogenous protein along the T. cruzi life cycle stages. The Western blotting assays revealed that TcHTE was highly expressed in amastigotes and epimastigotes (replicative stages) and almost undetectable in trypomastigotes (the infective and nonreplicative stage), as it is shown in Fig. 1A. TcHTE expression varied together with hemin concentration in the medium when epimastigotes were incubated 3 days in LIT–10% FBS with 0, 5, and 20 μm hemin. The signal corresponding to this protein was more intense at lower hemin concentrations. The lower molecular weight bands observed in this blot could be product of protein degradation during this sample preparation. Also, we analyzed the accumulation level of TcHTE mRNA by qRT-PCR assays. The amount of TcHTE mRNA was significantly higher in epimastigotes than amastigotes. Also, the amounts detected in epimastigotes and amastigotes were significantly higher compared with trypomastigotes, as it is shown in Fig. 1B. These results indicate that TcHTE was up-regulated at mRNA and protein level in the replicative stages compared with the infective stage. To explore how changes in the amount of hemin added to the culture medium modulate the amount of TcHTE present in cells, we first reviewed the growth conditions reported for epimastigotes. Previously, we have shown that T. cruzi incorporates heme and heme analogues (HAs) in the replicative stages to fulfill the requirements for this cofactor. The addition of 5-20 μm hemin to the medium did not affect epimastigotes' growth and, in stationary state, the intracellular heme concentration was approximately the same in both cases. However, higher concentrations of hemin produced a growth defect, being highly toxic at 100 μm (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10 (26752206): e000435910.1371/journal.pntd.0004359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Then, we first analyzed the effect caused by an increment in hemin concentration in the medium but below lethal concentrations (50 μm or less). Epimastigotes routinely maintained in a medium with 5 μm hemin were collected, washed, and starved for heme for 72 h (medium without hemin). After that, parasites were cultured with 0, 5, 20, or 50 μm hemin for 7 days. Then, cultures were diluted in fresh media (maintaining the same hemin concentration) and the growth was followed until day 14 (Fig. 2A). At day 7, slight differences in the total parasite number were observed between epimastigotes grown with 0, 5, and 20 μm hemin and also a moderate negative effect at 50 μm hemin. However, during the second week, the negative effect produced by the absence (no hemin added) and higher hemin concentrations (20 and 50 μm) was more severe. The addition of 5 μm hemin resulted the optimal concentration to allow parasite growth in our laboratory conditions. Also, on the third and seventh days of this experiment, samples were collected, stained with Giemsa reagent, and analyzed by optical microscopy (Fig. 2B). The epimastigotes challenged to grow with 0 or 5 μm hemin presented a conserved elongated shape, as typically described for this stage. However, those maintained with 20 or 50 μm hemin presented a rounded shape, possibly as a consequence of a potential toxic effect caused by the amount of hemin present in these media (12Schmitt T.H. Frezzatti W.A. Schreier S. Hemin-induced lipid membrane disorder and increased permeability: A molecular model for the mechanism of cell lysis.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307 (8239671): 96-10310.1006/abbi.1993.1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). TcHTE protein accumulation was analyzed by Western blotting assays after 72 h of incubation in the mentioned conditions (Fig. 2C, left panel shows incubations scheme). The protein signal was observed in samples taken from 0 and 5 μm hemin conditions, but it was undetectable in 20 or 50 μm hemin, as it is shown in Fig. 2C (right panel), in agreement with results reported in Fig. 1A. Analyzing the effect of heme on TcHTE expression in intracellular amastigotes presents a difficulty, because the addition of hemin to the medium during the whole assay (infection and replication) results in cell toxicity. Then, the accumulation of TcHTE in this stage was evaluated in samples taken from infected cells that were treated without (as control) or with 20 μm hemin for only 24 h (Fig. 2D, left panel shows the scheme of treatment). The amastigotes were purified and the presence of TcHTE was analyzed by Western blotting. The signal corresponding to TcHTE was clearly detected in the samples corresponding to amastigote control, but the addition of 20 μm hemin caused a significant reduction in the amount of TcHTE, being almost undetectable, as is shown in the right panel of Fig. 2D. In summary, TcHTE was detected in the replicative forms of T. cruzi, and it was more abundant under heme deprivation or low heme availability. To investigate how TcHTE expression responds to hemin, we analyzed the accumulation of TcHTE mRNA when epimastigotes were challenged to a medium containing lower or higher concentration of hemin. Briefly, epimastigotes preincubated with 0 or 20 μm hemin for 72 h were collected, washed, and incubated with 0, 5, and 20 μm hemin for 18 h. In both cases, changes in the amount of TcHTE mRNA relative to GAPDH (housekeeping gene) were quantified by qRT-PCR and results are presented in Fig. 3A. When epimastigotes preincubated with 20 μm hemin were changed to a medium without hemin (0 μm), the amount of TcHTE mRNA significantly increased, at least three times (Fig. 3A, right panel). On the other hand, when epimastigotes preincubated without hemin were changed to 5 or 20 μm hemin, the amount of accumulated TcHTE mRNA significantly decreased in both cases, about two and three times, respectively (Fig. 3A, left panel). These results confirmed TcHTE as a member of HRG family because mRNA accumulation was regulated by heme. (Fig. S2, phylogenetic tree of representative HRGs proteins). Additionally, changes in TcHTE protein expression were evaluated by Western blot assays. Briefly, epimastigotes routinely maintained in medium with 5 μm hemin were transferred to 30 μm hemin for 7 days. On day 8, epimastigotes were washed and transferred to fresh medium without hemin (0 μm) for 7 days (left panel of Fig. 3B shows the scheme of this assay). Samples were taken every day along the whole assay. The results, presented in Fig. 3B (right panel), show that the protein signal almost disappeared 24 h after epimastigotes were incubated with 30 μm hemin. On the other hand, when epimastigotes were transferred to a hemin-free medium, 48 h were required to restore TcHTE signal. To follow the drop of TcHTE during the first day of increasing hemin, epimastigotes maintained with 5 μm were transferred to 30 μm hemin, samples were taken every hour and treated for Western blot assays. Fig. 3C clearly shows that TcHTE signal became almost undetectable 15–17 h after hemin concentration was increased. Furthermore, we quantified intracellular heme in epimastigotes (which were previously starved for heme for 48 h) after 18 and 24 h of incubation with 0, 5, 30, and 50 μm hemin. Intracellular heme significantly increased in samples incubated with hemin (18 and 24 h) compared with the sample maintained without hemin (Fig. 3D, both panels). Also, analysis of samples taken at 18 h of incubation showed a significant difference in intracellular heme of epimastigotes incubated with 5 and 50 μm hemin (Fig. 3D, left panel). This difference disappeared after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 3D, right panel) and intracellular heme reached almost the same value of ∼3 nmol/109 parasites. We have previously shown that fluorescent HAs that have been used to evaluate heme transport activity in T. cruzi (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A.

Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop.

Based on this potentiality, we designed a strategy to evaluate if epimastigotes sense intracellular or environmental heme (or HAs) to modulate TcHTE expression. First, epimastigotes were challenged to grow under nontoxic concentration of “total metalloporphyrins” of 20 μm or lower (total metalloporphyrins is referred to hemin plus different HAs), and parasite proliferation and HAs internalization were analyzed. The growth profile of epimastigotes in a medium containing hemin (5 or 20 μm) or 5 μm hemin plus 15 μm HA (20 μm of total metalloporphyrins) is shown in Fig. 4A. Epimastigotes incubated with 5 or 20 μm hemin or with 5 μm hemin plus 15 μm SnMP (Sn(IV) mesoporphyrin IX) did not show any significant difference in the growth profile. On the other hand, parasites incubated with 5 μm hemin plus 15 μm ZnMP (Zn(II) mesoporphyrin IX) were severely affected, presumably because of ZnMP toxicity. Samples were taken at the third day of the assay and the presence of HAs inside cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy and direct fluorescent measurements as we reported previously for heme/HAs transport activity (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10 (26752206): e000435910.1371/journal.pntd.0004359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig. 4, B and C, show that epimastigotes incubated with SnMP (5 μm hemin plus 15 μm SnMP) did not exhibit any significant fluorescent signal detected by confocal microscopy or direct measurements of fluorescence, suggesting that it was not imported or it was rapidly exported. In any case, SnMP did not remain inside the cell. On the other hand, epimastigotes incubated with ZnMP (5 μm hemin plus 15 μm ZnMP) showed an intense fluorescence signal, detected by confocal microscopy and direct fluorescence measurements, confirming its incorporation by the cell. These observations are in agreement with previous results in which we have shown that ZnMP, but not SnMP, is internalized by T. cruzi (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10 (26752206): e000435910.1371/journal.pntd.0004359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The effect of these HAs on TcHTE accumulation was analyzed by Western blot assay in samples taken after 3 days of incubation with the HAs (0, 5, 20 μm hemin; 5 μm HAs; or 5 μm hemin plus 15 μm HAs) and the results are shown in Fig. 4D. The signal corresponding to TcHTE was detected in samples from 0 and 5 μm hemin, 5 μm of SnMP, 5 μm of hemin plus 15 μm of SnMP (20 μm total metalloporphyrins), and with 5 μm of ZnMP conditions. On the other hand, TcHTE was not detected in samples from either 5 μm of hemin plus 15 μm of ZnMP or 20 μm of hemin. These results indicate that only those HAs that were internalized and remained inside the parasite provoked a reduction on TcHTE protein level similar to the reduction produced by higher hemin. When we analyzed intracellular heme, we observed that the treatment with both HAs (ZnMP and SnMP) significantly reduced intracellular heme content, indicating that somehow SnMP impaired heme uptake, causing a drop in intracellular heme levels, as is shown in Fig. 4E. The replication of intracellular amastigotes was analyzed in WT and recombinant parasites overexpressing rTcHTE.His-GFP. Briefly, monolayers of Vero cells were infected with WT or rTcHTE.His-GFP overexpressing trypomastigotes. 48 h post infection, cells were fixed, stained with Giemsa reagent, and amastigotes were counted (Fig. 5A). The number of intracellular amastigotes was significantly higher in cells infected with rTcHTE.His-GFP overexpressing parasites compared with those infected with WT parasites. (29 ± 2 and 18 ± 1 amastigotes/infected-cell, respectively, p < 0.001). This result suggests that the overexpression of TcHTE increased amastigote replication rate in a low free-heme environment as the cellular cytosol. Additionally, we also analyzed the presence of rTcHTE.His-GFP in intracellular amastigotes. The images recorded for intracellular amastigotes confirmed rTcHTE.His-GFP expression and showed that its signal is highly intense and punctuated in a region over the plasma membrane that could overlap with the flagellar pocket region (Fig. 5B), as was previously shown in epimastigotes (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A. The Trypanosoma cruzi protein TcHTE is critical for heme uptake.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2016; 10 (26752206): e000435910.1371/journal.pntd.0004359Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, several amastigotes also showed a fluorescent signal distributed along the plasma membrane. Unfortunately, endogenous TcHTE could not be detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays, using anti-TcHTE antibodies. Then, the difference observed in the localization of rTcHTE.His-GFP protein in amastigotes could be an artifact of the protein overexpression because of the use of nonclonal recombinant parasites or could indicate that TcHTE presents different localization in the intracellular stage. In this work we present data that clarify the relationship between TcHTE and heme transport activity in T. cruzi. The attainment of polyclonal antibodies against TcHTE allowed the evaluation of the endogenous protein. It was clearly detected in epimastigotes and amastigotes, and almost undetectable in trypomastigotes. In accordance, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that TcHTE mRNA was significantly higher in the replicative life cycle stages of T. cruzi. TcHTE (as mRNA and protein) was more abundant in the stages in which T. cruzi is able to import heme (or HAs) (8Merli M.L. Pagura L. Hernández J. Barisón M.J. Pral E.M.F. Silber A.M. Cricco J.A.

In addition, the amount of hemin added to the medium inversely affected the amount of TcHTE mRNA detected in epimastigotes, as it was reported for LHR1 promastigotes (5Huynh C. Yuan X. Miguel D.C.

These results confirmed TcHTE as a member of the HRG family (4Rajagopal A. Rao A.U. Amigo J. Tian M. Upadhyay S.K. Hall C. Uhm S. Mathew M.K. Fleming M.D. Paw B.H. Krause M. Hamza I.

Interestingly, epimastigotes incubated in media with high hemin concentration showed a defective growth and morphology alterations.

Various types of stress are associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, but the relationship between occlusal disharmony and cardiovascular disease remain poorly understood. Therefore, in this work, we examined the effects of occlusal disharmony on cardiac homeostasis in bite-opening (BO) mice, in which a 0.7 mm space was introduced by cementing a suitable applicance onto the mandibular incisior. We first examined the effects of BO on the level of serum corticosterone, a key biomarker for stress, and on heart rate variability at 14 days after BO treatment, compared with baseline. BO treatment increased serum corticosterone levels by approximately 3.6-fold and the low frequency/high frequency ratio, an index of sympathetic nervous activity, was significantly increased by approximately 4-fold by the BO treatment. We then examined the effects of BO treatment on cardiac homeostasis in mice treated or not treated with the non-selective β-blocker propranolol for 2 weeks. Cardiac function was significantly decreased in the BO group compared to the control group, but propranolol ameliorated the dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis, myocyte apoptosis and myocyte oxidative DNA damage were significantly increased in the BO group, but propranolol blocked these changes. The BO-induced cardiac dysfunction was associated with increased phospholamban phosphorylation at threonine-17 and serine-16, as well as inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling and autophagic flux. These data suggest that occlusal disharmony might affect cardiac homeostasis via alteration of the autonomic nervous system."

Conditional and joint association analyses revealed independent GWAS signals in linkage disequilibrium with 2 missense ZIP12 polymorphisms, rs10764176 and rs72778328, with reduced zinc transport activity. ZIP12 rare coding variants predicted to be deleterious were associated with similar impacts on brain swMRI.

A deductive approach to qualitative content analysis was used to analyze data. Five domains of the Explanatory Model supplementary module of the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) were used as coding categories, operationalized as 'Parents' understanding of autism'; 'Autism prototypes'; 'Causal explanations'; 'Course of autism', and 'Help seeking and treatment expectations'.The results showed that parents' prior knowledge of autism and experience of young children's typical developmental trajectories, as well as the opinions of children's grandparents and preschool teachers, affected symptom recognition and help seeking. There were differences in parents' explanatory models before and after ASD diagnosis. Initial interpretations of the disorder included medical conditions and reaction to environmental influences, while genetic, supernatural/religious factors, and vaccinations were mentioned as definite causes after obtaining a clinical diagnosis. Parents also held multiple explanatory models, influenced by the views of family members and information obtained from media or from health care professionals. Parents' treatment decisions included use of available state-funded support services, and complementary and alternative treatments.The results demonstrate the utility of the CFI's Explanatory Model supplementary module in autism research.

However, organic amendment may differ from mineral K fertilization with respect to modifying the soil K transformation among different fractions, affecting soil K availability. We conducted a 60-day lab incubation experiment to evaluate the response of soil K dynamics and availability in various fractions with a view to simulating crop residue return and chemical K fertilization in an Anthrosol of northwest China. The tested soil was divided into two main groups, no K fertilization (K0) and K fertilization (K1), each of which was subjected to four straw addition regimes: no straw addition (Control), wheat straw addition (WS), maize straw addition (MS), and both wheat straw and maize straw addition (WS+MS). Soil K levels in the available (AK) and non-exchangeable (NEK) fractions were both significantly increased after K addition, following the order of K>WS>MS. Fertilizer K was the most efficient K source, demonstrating a 72.9% efficiency in increasing soil AK, while wheat and maize straw exhibited efficiencies of 47.1% and 39.3%, respectively. Furthermore, K fertilization and wheat and maize straw addition increased the soil AK in a cumulative manner when used in combination. The mobility factor (MF) and reduced partition index (IR) of soil K were used to quantitate the comprehensive soil K mobility and stability, respectively. Positive relationships were observed between the MF and all relatively available fractions of soil K, whereas the IR value of soil K correlated negatively with both MF and all available fractions of soil K. In conclusion, straw amendment could be inferior to mineral K fertilization in improving soil K availability when they were almost equal in the net K input. Crop straw return coupled with K fertilization can be a promising strategy for improving both soil K availability and cycling in soil-plant systems."

Factors associated with CrGN prognosis have not been thoroughly investigated. This study investigated the prognostic predictors of renal outcomes associated with CrGN, such as the histopathologic classification of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis, arteriosclerosis, and tertiary lymphoid organ (TLO) formation. Methods A total of 114 patients diagnosed with CrGN between 2010 and 2018 at two university-based hospitals has been retrospectively analyzed. Relationships between potential predictors and renal outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and linear regression analysis. Results The mean age was 61.0 ± 15.3 years, and 49.1% were male. Among them, 92 (80.7%) and 11 (9.6%) patients were positive for ANCA and for anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, respectively. During the median follow-up of 458.0 days, 55 patients (48.2%) had advanced to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that patients under the mixed and sclerotic classes had worse renal survival compared to those in the focal class (mixed: hazard ratio [HR], 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 11.82; P = 0.025; sclerotic: HR, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.44 to 16.32; P = 0.011). Severe arteriosclerosis was also associated with poor renal survival (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.77; P = 0.042). TLOs were observed in 41 patients (36.0%). Moreover, TLO formation was also a prognostic factor for ESRD (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.21; P = 0.040). In the multivariate linear regression analysis, age and sclerotic class were independent predictors for the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate during 1 year after biopsy.

The composition of cosmetic products must guarantee efficient bacterial inactivation all along with the product shelf life, which is usually assessed by challenge-tests. A challenge-test consists in inoculating specific bacteria, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, in the formula and then investigating the bacterial log reduction over time. The main limitation of this method is relative to the time-consuming protocol, where 30 days are needed to obtain results. In this study, we have proposed a rapid alternative method coupling High Content Screening—Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (HCS-CLSM), image analysis and modeling. It consists in acquiring real-time S. aureus inactivation kinetics on short-time periods (typically 4h) and in predicting the efficiency of preservatives on longer scale periods (up to 7 days). The action of two preservatives, chlorphenesin and benzyl alcohol, was evaluated against S. aureus at several concentrations in a cosmetic matrix. From these datasets, we compared two secondary models to determine the logarithm reduction time (Dc) for each preservative concentration.

Pharmacological tools specifically targeting TMEM16 CaPLSases are urgently needed to understand these novel membrane transporters and their contributions to health and disease. Tannic acid (TA) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were recently reported as promising TMEM16F CaPLSase inhibitors. However, our present study shows that TA and EGCG do not inhibit the phospholipid-scrambling or ion conduction activities of the dual-functional TMEM16F. Instead, we found that TA and EGCG mainly acted as fluorescence quenchers that rapidly suppress the fluorophores conjugated to annexin V, a phosphatidylserine-binding probe commonly used to report on TMEM16 CaPLSase activity. These data demonstrate the false positive effects of TA and EGCG on inhibiting TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling and discourage the use of these polyphenols as CaPLSase inhibitors. Appropriate controls as well as a combination of both fluorescence imaging and electrophysiological validation are necessary in future endeavors to develop TMEM16 CaPLSase inhibitors.

Recently, these polyphenolic compounds were reported to potently inhibit TMEM16F CaPLSase based on the observations that TA and EGCG could efficiently prevent fluorescently tagged phospholipids and annexin V (AnV) probes from reporting TMEM16F-mediated lipid scrambling (22Suzuki T.

To our surprise, TA and EGCG displayed minimal effects on inhibiting TMEM16F channel activity. This prompted us to re-examine the effects of these polyphenols on TMEM16F lipid scramblase activity. We found that TA and EGCG indeed quenched various fluorophores, including those that are tagged to the AnV probes. We further demonstrated that the previous inhibitory effects of TA and EGCG on TMEM16F were mainly due to the fluorescence-suppressing effects of the polyphenols on the fluorophores conjugated to the extracellular AnV probes and thus prevent AnV from reporting the scrambling activity. We therefore conclude that TA and EGCG do not function as TMEM16 CaPLSase inhibitors. These results also suggest that precautions need to be taken in developing inhibitors targeting TMEM16 CaPLSases.ResultsExtracellular fluorescently tagged AnV cannot report TMEM16F lipid-scrambling activity in the presence of TA and EGCGWe applied a previously established fluorescence imaging–based scrambling assay (10Le T.

In this assay, fluorescently tagged AnV (henceforth referred to as AnV) was included in the extracellular solution to monitor scramblase activity of HEK293 cells stably expressing murine TMEM16F. Upon its activation by ionomycin-induced Ca2+ influx, TMEM16F CaPLSase rapidly translocates PS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Because the externalized PS recruits AnV to the cell surface, the gradual accumulation of fluorescence signal from AnV on the cell membrane is indicative of TMEM16F scrambling activity (Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with previous reports (22Suzuki T. Suzuki J. Nagata S. Functional swapping between transmembrane proteins TMEM16A and TMEM16F.J. Biol.

On the other hand, robust AnV signal was observed on the cell surface in the control experiment without TA or EGCG (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, Ca2+ influx via ionomycin was not affected by the polyphenols as intracellular Ca2+ was instantly mobilized following Ca2+ ionophore stimulation regardless of the presence of TA or EGCG (Fig. 1, B–G). All of these observations imply that the polyphenols could impair TMEM16F lipid-scrambling activity. It is worth noting that 20 μm TA completely abolishes AnV surface signal, whereas 20 μm EGCG still allows weak AnV accumulation on the cell membrane, suggesting that EGCG may have a weaker inhibitory effect than TA (Fig. 1, D–G).TA and EGCG do not specifically block TMEM16F ion channel activityTMEM16F is a dual-functional moonlighting protein with both CaPLSase and ion channel activities (8Suzuki J.

Our outside-out patch clamp recording revealed that extracellular application of 20 μm TA significantly promoted BK channel activation, as seen by the left shift in the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship toward negative voltages and prolonged deactivation kinetics (Fig. S1). Taken together, our electrophysiology results demonstrate that EGCG and low concentration of TA do not inhibit TMEM16F ion channel activity. High concentration of TA could partially inhibit TMEM16F channels. Given the massive chemical structure of TA (Fig. 1A), we speculate that its inhibitory effect is likely indirect and nonspecific.Figure 2Effects of TA and EGCG on TMEM16F's channel activity.

Therefore, we suspected that the polyphenols might hinder the ability of the extracellular AnV to correctly report TMEM16F CaPLSase activity through their quenching effects on the fluorophores conjugated to AnV. To test this hypothesis, we measured the fluorescence signals of the AnV probes tagged with various fluorophores (CF488A, CF594, and CF640R) in the presence or absence of polyphenols in vitro using the spectrometry mode of a SpectraMax plate reader. In the presence of 20 μm TA or EGCG, the fluorescence signal of all AnV probes was significantly attenuated, indicating that the polyphenols indeed quench the PS probes in aqueus solution (Fig. 3, A–C). Furthermore, our in vitro experiments also corroborated that TA and EGCG could suppress the fluorescence intensities of various fluorescence probes/dyes, including the Alexa Fluor–conjugated IgGs (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647; Fig. 3, D–F), nucleic acid dyes (Hoechst and Nuclear Green DCS1; Fig. 3, G and H), and CF488A-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Fig. 3I).Figure 3Effects of TA and EGCG on fluorescence signal of different fluorophores and fluorescence probes in aqueous solution. 20 μm EGCG (blue traces) and 20 μm TA (red traces) were applied to various fluorescence probes/fluorophores, and the intensities of the emission spectra of the fluorophores were measured by the spectrometry function of a plate reader (see “Experimental procedures” for details).

First, we allowed AnV to accumulate on the surface of TMEM16F-expressing HEK293 cells after ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 4, A, C, and E, middle rows). Next, we introduced TA and EGCG to the medium after a significant amount of AnV had accumulated on the cell surface (2.5 min after ionomycin application). AnV fluorescence signal on the cell membrane was instantaneously decreased upon polyphenol applications (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). 20 μm TA completely abolished AnV signal, whereas 1 μm TA and 20 μm EGCG eliminated more than 80% of AnV signal.Figure 4TA and EGCG suppress fluorescence signal of fluorescently tagged AnV-CF594 instead of inhibiting TMEM16F-mediated phospholipid-scrambling activity.

https://openalex.org/W3045017325,"Subjective happiness is often regarded as a major life goal. Although Japan is an economically powerful country, the level of subjective well-being reported among Japanese adolescents is lower than in other countries. We aimed to investigate the lifestyle factors related to unhappiness in Japanese adolescents. We collected data through the 2017–2018 Lifestyle Survey of Adolescents, a nationally representative cross-sectional study enrolled in randomly selected junior and senior high schools throughout Japan. We assessed the prevalence of subjective unhappiness in junior and senior high school students according to school life factors and daily lifestyle habits. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations between these factors and unhappiness. A total of 64,329 students were included in the sample (mean age 15.7 years, 53.9% boys). The average prevalence of unhappiness was 10.2%. The logistic regression analyses indicated that unhappiness was strongly associated with being male and with engaging in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as not having breakfast, poor sleep quality, and some problematic Internet usage. Although the prevalence of unhappiness was significantly higher among current smokers and alcohol drinkers, these behaviors were not associated with unhappiness in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Unhappiness among Japanese adolescents appears to be strongly related to how they spend their daily life. We therefore consider it desirable for school officials to educate students on the importance of happiness and lifestyle factors conducive to happiness."
https://openalex.org/W3045028486,"The proto-oncogene ets1 is highly expressed in the pre-migratory and migratory neural crest (NC), and has been implicated in the delamination and migration of the NC cells. To identify the downstream target genes of Ets1 in this process, we did RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on wild-type and ets1 mutant X. tropicalis embryos. A list of genes with significantly differential expression was obtained by analyzing the RNA-Seq data. We validated the RNA-Seq data by quantitative PCR, and examined the expression pattern of the genes identified from this assay with whole mount in situ hybridization. A majority of the identified genes showed expression in migrating NC. Among them, the expression of microseminoprotein beta gene 3 (msmb3) was positively regulated by Ets1 in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis. Knockdown of msmb3 with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides or disruption of msmb3 by CRISPR/Cas9 both impaired the migratory streams of NC. Our study identified msmb3 as an Ets1 target gene and uncovered its function in maintaining neural crest migration pattern."
https://openalex.org/W3045722180,"As part of an interdisciplinary research project on the Late La Tène period settlement at Basel-Gasfabrik, ceramic sherds, animal bones and archaeological sediments from different archaeological structures (one large pit, two ditches and four archaeological layers) were examined in respect of 21 taphonomic features (proxies). These proxies, in turn, were linked to different processes that can leave traces on objects or sediments: primary use, mechanical stress, heat impact, water, redeposition, exposure, covering and postdepositional processes. The different proxies were compared using a statistical procedure. Our results show significant differences between the different features with regard to taphonomic alteration. For example, ceramic sherds and animal bones from archaeological layers show severe alteration due to exposure, whilst a good and uniform preservation within the pit points to its rapid filling. Furthermore, there is evidence of middens which probably served as material depots. Our results suggest that waste was not simply seen as rubbish, but was stored as a resource. Therefore, materials could take different ""paths"", each of which resulted in specific taphonomic processes (alterations). The interdisciplinary approach taken in this project has provided new insight into the complex but probably clearly defined handling of various materials at Basel-Gasfabrik, thus allowing us to visualise part of the cultural biography of things."
https://openalex.org/W3046060887,"Background In Ethiopia, MDR-TB has become a significant public health threat; therefore, the Ministry of Health introduced two treatment approaches for MDR-TB cases: treatment initiative center (TIC) and treatment follow-up center (TFC). TIC is where patients usually are diagnosed and start the treatment. At TFC, we follow MDR-TB patients until they completed the treatment. However, there is no evidence about the cost-effectiveness of the approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of MDR-TB treatment in TIC and TFC. Methods In this study, we employed a full economic evaluation from a providers' perspective. We followed a hypothetical cohort of individuals from the age of 15 for a lifetime using a Markov model with five mutually exclusive health states. We used both primary and secondary data sources for the study. Ingredient-based costing approach was used. The costs include healthcare provider costs (recurrent and capital cost) and patient-side costs (direct and indirect). We use a human capital approach to estimate the indirect cost. The cost estimates were reported in the 2017 United States Dollar (US$), and effectiveness was measured using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both costs and health benefits were discounted using a 3% discount rate. Both average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were reported calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were reported to determine the robustness of the estimates. Results The cost per HIV negative patient successfully treated for MDR-TB was $8,416 at TIC and $6,657 at TFC. The average cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted at TFC was $671 and $1,417 per DALY averted at TIC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MDR-TB treatment at TIC was $1,641 per DALYs averted. Conclusion This study indicates that the treatment of MDR-TB at both TIC and TFC are cost-effective interventions compared with the willingness to pay threshold of three-times the GDP per capita in Ethiopia."

The aim of this feasibility study was to assess whether inflammatory status of the LVs and/or changes in the miRNA profile of the LVs have potential prognostic and predictive value for overall outcome and risk of relapse. Samples of macroscopically normal human lymph LVs (n = 10) were isolated from the external iliac vessels draining the pelvic region of patients undergoing debulking surgery. This was followed by quantification of the inflammatory state (low, medium and high) and presence of cancer-infiltration of each LV using immunohistochemistry. LV miRNA expression profiling was also performed, and analysed in the context of high versus low inflammation, and cancer-infiltrated versus non-cancer-infiltrated. Results were correlated with clinical outcome data including relapse with an average follow-up time of 13.3 months. The presence of a high degree of inflammation correlated significantly with patient relapse (p = 0.033). Cancer-infiltrated LVs showed a moderate but non-significant association with relapse (p = 0.07). Differential miRNA profiles were identified in cancer-infiltrated LVs and those with high versus low inflammation. In particular, several members of the let-7 family were consistently down-regulated in highly inflamed LVs (>1.8-fold, p<0.05) compared to the less inflamed ones. Down-regulation of the let-7 family appears to be associated with inflammation, but whether inflammation contributes to or is an effect of cancer-infiltration requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3045495380,"Individuals with spinal cord injury develop cardiovascular disease more than age-matched, non-injured cohorts. However, progression of systolic and diastolic dysfunction into cardiovascular disease after spinal cord injury is not well described. We sought to investigate the relationship between systolic and diastolic function in chronic spinal cord injury to describe how biological sex, level, severity, and duration of injury correlate with structural changes in the left ventricle. Individuals with chronic spinal cord injury participated in this study (n = 70). Registered diagnostic cardiac sonographers used cardiac ultrasound to measure dimensions, mass, and systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle. We found no significant relationship to severity or duration of injury with left ventricle measurements, systolic function outcome, or diastolic function outcome. Moreover, nearly all outcomes measured were within the American Society of Echocardiography-defined healthy range. Similar to non-injured individuals, when indexed by body surface area (BSA) left ventricle mass [-14 (5) g/m2, p < .01], end diastolic volume [-6 (3) mL/m2, p < .05], and end systolic volume [-4 (1) mL/m2, p < .01] were significantly decreased in women compared with men. Likewise, diastolic function outcomes significantly worsened with age: E-wave velocity [-5 (2), p < .01], E/A ratio [-0.23 (0.08), p < .01], and e' velocity [lateral: -1.5 (0.3) cm/s, p < .001; septal: -0.9 (0.2), p < .001] decreased with age while A-wave velocity [5 (1) cm/s, p < .001] and isovolumic relaxation time [6 (3) ms, p < .05] increased with age. Women demonstrated significantly decreased cardiac size and volumes compared with men, but there was no biological relationship to dysfunction. Moreover, individuals were within the range of ASE-defined healthy values with no evidence of systolic or diastolic function and no meaningful relationship to level, severity, or duration of injury. Decreases to left ventricular dimensions and mass seen in spinal cord injury may result from adaptation rather than maladaptive myocardial remodeling, and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease may be related to modifiable risk factors."

However, prevalence among Turkish migrants in Belgium is unknown, especially in those born in Belgium with a foreign-born parent, i.e. second-generation migrants (SGM).To evaluate the prevalence of HBV infection and associated risk factors in Turkish first-generation migrants (FGM), i.e. foreign-born, and SGM.Between September 2017 and May 2019, free outreach testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), and antibodies against HBsAg was offered to Turkish migrants in Middle-Limburg, Belgium. Face-to-face questionnaire assessed HBV risk factors. HBsAg positive patients were referred and followed up. Turkish SGM were stratified into birth cohort born before and after 1987, since those born after 1987 should be covered by the universal infant vaccination program.A total of 1,081/1,113 (97.1%) Turkish did go for HBV testing. Twenty-six (2.4%) were HBsAg positive; 11/26 were unaware of their status and 10/11 were successfully referred. HBsAg prevalence was 3.0% in FGM and 1.5% in SGM, p = .070. Only one out of seven HBsAg positive SGM was born after 1987. In the multiple generalized estimating equations model, the most important risk factors for anti-HBc positivity were male gender (p = .021), older age (p < .001), FGM (p < .001), low educational level of the mother (p = .003), HBV infected mother (p = .008), HBV infected siblings (p = .002), HBV infected other family member (p = .004), gynaecological examination in Turkey or unsafe male circumcision (p = .032) and dental treatment in Turkey (p = .049).Outreach testing was well-accepted and referral to specialist care was generally successful. National HBV screening should be implemented in the Turkish FGM population and might be considered in SGM not covered by primary prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3045992510,We propose a method to simplify textual Twitter data into understandable networks of terms that can signify important events and their possible changes over time. The method allows for common characteristics of the networks across time periods and each period can comprise multiple unknown sub-networks. The networks are described by Gaussian graphical models and their parameter values are estimated through a Bayesian approach with a fused lasso-type prior on the precision matrices of the underlying mixtures of the sub-models. A flexible data allocation scheme is at the heart of an MCMC algorithm to recover mean and covariance parameters of the mixture components. Several implementations of the outlined estimation procedure are studied and compared based on simulated data. The procedure with the highest predictive power is used for mining tweets regarding the 2009 Iranian presidential election.
https://openalex.org/W3045948592,"Background Diarrhea in infancy can compromise linear growth and this relationship is likely influenced by diarrhea severity, number of episodes, and the timing of those episodes. HIV exposed, uninfected infants (HEU) have higher risk of growth faltering, infectious morbidity and mortality than HIV-unexposed infants and may be representative of children particularly vulnerable to diarrhea-associated linear growth faltering. Methodology/principal findings We utilized data from a cohort of Kenyan HEU infants followed from birth to 12 months of age. Infant length and morbidity were ascertained at monthly study visits and sick visits. Longitudinal models estimated the association between diarrhea severity and length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) in the following month, at 12 months of age, and in 6-month intervals. The 372 enrolled infants experienced an average of 2.15 episodes (range: 0-8) of diarrhea and 0.54 episodes (0-4) of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) between birth and 12 months. Surviving infants had a mean LAZ of -0.97 (standard deviation: 1.2) at 12 months. MSD was significantly associated with an average loss of 0.14 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.24, -0.05, p = 0.003) in LAZ one month after the episode. Linear growth outcomes were not predicted by cumulative episodes of diarrhea, or timing of diarrhea during infancy. Conclusions/significance Diarrhea severity influenced the relationship between diarrhea and subsequent linear growth. HEU infants with MSD may benefit from nutritional interventions following severe diarrhea to protect against linear growth faltering."
https://openalex.org/W3046004977,"Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, and choosing speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect the selection of any particular candidate, and, thereby the composition of the final cohort. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, entrofy, designed to be part of a human-in-the-loop decision making strategy aimed at making cohort selection as just, transparent, and accountable as possible. We suggest embedding entrofy in a two-step selection procedure. During a merit review, the committee selects all applicants, submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria. This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool via a new algorithm and software tool called entrofy. entrofy optimizes differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human committee. Criteria could include academic discipline, home country, experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable characteristics. The entrofy algorithm then yields the approximation of pre-defined target proportions for each category by solving the tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show how entrofy selects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study of Astro Hack Week. This two stage candidate and cohort selection process allows human judgment and debate to guide the assessment of candidates' merit in step 1. Then the human committee defines relevant diversity criteria which will be used as computational parameters in entrofy. Once the parameters are defined, the set of candidates who meet the minimum threshold for merit are passed through the entrofy cohort selection procedure in step 2 which yields a cohort of a composition as close as possible to the computational parameters defined by the committee. This process has the benefit of separating the meritorious assessment of candidates from certain elements of their diversity and from some considerations around cohort composition. It also increases the transparency and auditability of the process, which enables, but does not guarantee, fairness. Splitting merit and diversity considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected, though it does not eliminate the possibility of objectionable bias."
https://openalex.org/W3045548920,"We analysed intraclutch egg-size variation over the laying sequence in relation to clutch size, and the relation between clutch size and female body condition, in the Common Eider Somateria mollissima during an 8-year period. The aim was to assess if eiders adjusted egg size within the laying sequence depending on clutch sizes in response to body condition, as such an adjustment could have adaptive implications on reproductive success through a size advantage for the hatchlings. The analyses were performed on a population level; and then at the individual level using data from recaptured females that changed clutch size between years. Based on 1,099 clutches from 812 individual females, population clutch size averaged 4.13 eggs (range: 1-6), with 4- and 5-egg clutchesconstituting c.70% of all clutches, taking turns in being the most represented clutch size. Clutch size was positively related to female pre-laying body condition at both the population and individual levels. Egg size varied significantly within and between clutch sizes and changes were significantly related to the laying sequence. First eggs were significantly larger in 4-egg clutches and second eggs marginally smaller than in 5-egg clutches, a pattern also found among individual females changing clutch size between years. The relationship between female pre-laying body condition and clutch size, and the intraclutch egg-size pattern indicate that both clutch size and egg size are actively adapted to the pre-breeding body condition of the female. As egg size potentially optimise reproductive success through a size advantage in hatchlings, the observed pattern of intraclutch egg-size variation suggests that female eiders possesses a finely tuned conditional dependent mechanism that may optimize reproductive output in years were females are in suboptimal body condition for breeding."
