https://openalex.org/W2091525903,"DURING an investigation of the early stages of hydrolysis of various mucoids and connective-tissue proteins, it was observed that, on partial hydrolysis with acetic acid or oxalic acid at 100°, aspartic acid was in each case the first amino-acid to appear in the free condition, followed at a somewhat later stage by glutamic acid1. Since elastin has an unusually low content of the dicarboxylic amino-acids2, it was thought that, with this protein, hydrolytic cleavage at some proportion of the aspartic or glutamic acid residues might yield soluble degradation products of high molecular weight."

These are regarded as anthoxanthins, and two of them have been identified as rutin and quercitrin1. Chromatograms of fermented tea show the same pattern of anthoxanthin spots, which suggests that these substances are not oxidized enzymically by the tea-oxidase, although some of them presumably contain catechol or pyrogallol groupings in their molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2066804115,"WHEN the available experimental values of the surface tensions of liquid metals are plotted against the reciprocals of the corresponding atomic volumes, the accompanying diagram is obtained. The surface tensions are not known with high accuracy; but it is clear that surface tension is approximately inversely proportional to atomic volume, and that the relationship holds for metals of such widely different types as sodium, bismuth and iron."

Breath measurements are a useful indication of the type and amount of internal radioactive contamination. In this Laboratory, α-activity has been measured by two methods, both using apparatus supplied by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell."

https://openalex.org/W2032847745,"IT was suggested many years ago1 that both components of a binary liquid mixture of non-electrolytes are adsorbed by solids such as charcoal and silica gel, though, with notable exceptions2–4, this concept has not always been considered in recent work. What has usually been called the ‘adsorption isotherm’ is thus the resultant of the addition of two individual isotherms, which cannot be determined directly. Bartell and Sloan3 have investigated the possibility (originally suggested by Ostwald and de Izaguirre2) that the individual isotherms follow Freundlich equations. By a process of successive approximations they obtained the constants for two such equations, and showed that the ‘composite’ equation thus derivable for the conventional adsorption isotherm gave a close fit with the experimental curves for a number of systems, including benzene–ethyl alcohol–charcoal."
https://openalex.org/W2037891628,"IN the course of work on the development of Geiger–Müller counters in this laboratory, some interesting properties of a hard-glass external cathode (‘Aquadag’) counter have been observed. Argon–alcohol counters filled to a pressure of 10 cm. of mercury, having internal diameters of one inch, and using a 7-mil central tungsten wire, were found to have plateaux extending from 1,200 volts to more than 3,000 volts. The slope of these plateaux was generally found to be less than 0.4 per cent per 100 volts. It was noted that the size of the pulses obtained from these counters is reduced with enhanced rate of counting. This phenomenon results in an apparent upward shift of the threshold voltage with increased rate of counting. The slope and length of the plateau remain unaffected by incidence of strong radiation, and the shift in the threshold voltage can be nullified by using a preamplifier at the input of the scaler. The decrease in pulse size and the consequent increase of the threshold voltage are shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W2069866818,"UNSTRIATED muscle has two cycles for contraction: in one cycle the energy for contraction is derived from chemical stores; in the other cycle, the energy for contraction is derived from that stored in the structure1,2. These two cycles operate upon two different contractile mechanisms respectively3."

https://openalex.org/W1972863569,"THE de Haas – van Alphen effect (periodic field dependence of magnetic susceptibility) has been found in aluminium and antimony single crystals at 4.2° K. and lower temperatures. The effect depends in a complicated way on the direction of the magnetic field, and there are complicated modulation effects similar to those previously found in other metals1. Typical values of the period at 15,000 gauss are 400 gauss in aluminium and 270 gauss in antimony; the amplitude in both metals increases by a factor of order 4 when the temperature is reduced from 4.2° K. to 1.5° K. Aluminium is the first metal of cubic symmetry in which the effect has been found."

https://openalex.org/W2081602990,"A LARGE number of deeply coloured chelate compounds is known, the components of which show no, or only weak, absorption in the visible region. Typical examples are the nickel complex of diacetyl dioxime and the ferrous tri-α-α′-dipyridyl and tri-o-phenanthroline ions. As such complexes have been shown to be diamagnetic1, containing thus closed electronic shells on the metal atom, it is highly improbable that the colour of such compounds is due to electronic transitions within the metal atoms. The abnormal colour can thus be only attributed to the co-ordinated molecules2."

https://openalex.org/W1992363111,"Vibrio fœtus is non-pathogenic for small laboratory animals. As it can cause abortion in sheep and cattle, and is then found in the embryo, cultivation in incubated chicken eggs was attempted. The organism grows easily in the allantoic fluid of seven-to-nine-day eggs. Three days after inoculation, there is a rich growth of Vibrio fœtus in the allantoic fluid. The organism can also develop in dead embryos; but the allantoic fluid is then often so cloudy that it is difficult to detect the organism microscopically. We used two different strains, which had been cultivated on blood agar. We have not as yet had the opportunity of inoculating eggs with material from a sheep- or cow-embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1994338047,"SODIUM chlorate belongs to the tetrahedrite (T) class of the cubic system and exhibits optical activity without birefringence. The birefringence introduced by stress is of the same order as the difference in refractive indices of the two circular components. Special techniques are therefore needed for measuring the photoelastic constants, and the stressing apparatus was so designed that a petrological microscope could be used in conjunction with it."

https://openalex.org/W2038366112,"SPECTROGRAMS have been obtained of a high current-density sodium arc obtained with a low-dispersion Hilger quartz spectrograph, in the region of 4000–2000 A. The cathode was a sodium pool in a ‘Pyrex’ glass tube of about 2 cm. diameter, and the anode was a hollow nickel-plated iron rod cooled by a stream of oil. The voltage supply for the high-current arc (2–6 amp.) was obtained from a 120-volt storage battery, and the low pressure inside the tube was maintained by a ‘Cenco Hyvac’ pump."

https://openalex.org/W2061844533,"IN the course of experiments on overpotential at low current densities, during the past four years, we have frequently observed that stirring the solution affects the overpotential. Although our work is far from complete, we now have considerable evidence that, if very great precautions are taken to exclude oxygen and also any products of electrolysis arising from the anode, stirring has little or no effect on the potential of a cathode of a noble metal. For example, some time ago, using cells in which a smooth tungsten or platinum anode was separated from a gold cathode only by a sintered glass plug, stirring caused a considerable lowering of overpotential at the cathode, with polarizing currents less than about ten microamperes per sq. cm. In later work, using very great care over purity of materials and cleanliness of apparatus, and an anode of platinized platinum which could be in the same solution as the cathode, stirring did not affect the potential of cathodes of platinum or gold appreciably. The platinized anode, in the atmosphere of hydrogen, also carefully purified, reduces completely any oxygen produced at the anode, provided that the current is less than about 100 μamp./cm.2; this is confirmed by its potential remaining steady at the reversible hydrogen value. With these conditions, stirring had no effect on cathodic potential between 0.05 μamp./cm.2 and 100 μamp./cm.2."
