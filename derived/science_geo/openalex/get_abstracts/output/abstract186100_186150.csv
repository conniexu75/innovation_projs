https://openalex.org/W2144016834,"High and low spatial frequency information in visual images is processed by distinct neural channels. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans, we show dissociable roles of such visual channels for processing faces and emotional fearful expressions. Neural responses in fusiform cortex, and effects of repeating the same face identity upon fusiform activity, were greater with intact or high-spatial-frequency face stimuli than with low-frequency faces, regardless of emotional expression. In contrast, amygdala responses to fearful expressions were greater for intact or low-frequency faces than for high-frequency faces. An activation of pulvinar and superior colliculus by fearful expressions occurred specifically with low-frequency faces, suggesting that these subcortical pathways may provide coarse fear-related inputs to the amygdala."

https://openalex.org/W2040653138,"The dendritic spine is an important site of neuronal plasticity and contains extremely high levels of cytoskeletal actin. However, the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton during synaptic plasticity and its in vivo function remain unclear. Here we used an in vivo dentate gyrus LTP model to show that LTP induction is associated with actin cytoskeletal reorganization characterized by a long-lasting increase in F-actin content within dendritic spines. This increase in F-actin content is dependent on NMDA receptor activation and involves the inactivation of actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin. Inhibition of actin polymerization with latrunculin A impaired late phase of LTP without affecting the initial amplitude and early maintenance of LTP. These observations suggest that mechanisms regulating the spine actin cytoskeleton contribute to the persistence of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2029638208,"Neuronal excitability and long-term synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses are critically dependent on the level of inhibition, and accordingly, changes of inhibitory synaptic efficacy should have great impact on neuronal function and neural network processing. We describe here a form of activity-dependent long-term depression at hippocampal inhibitory synapses that is triggered postsynaptically via glutamate receptor activation but is expressed presynaptically. That is, glutamate released by repetitive activation of Schaffer collaterals activates group I metabotropic glutamate receptors at CA1 pyramidal cells, triggering a persistent reduction of GABA release that is mediated by endocannabinoids. This heterosynaptic form of plasticity is involved in changes of pyramidal cell excitability associated with long-term potentiation at excitatory synapses and could account for the effects of cannabinoids on learning and memory."

https://openalex.org/W2109251081,"Neuronal gain control is important for processing information in the brain. Shunting inhibition is not thought to control gain since it shifts input-output relationships during tonic excitation rather than changing their slope. Here we show that tonic inhibition reduces the gain and shifts the offset of cerebellar granule cell input-output relationships during frequency-dependent excitation with synaptic conductance waveforms. Shunting inhibition scales subthreshold voltage, increasing the excitation frequency required to attain a particular firing rate. This reduces gain because frequency-dependent increases in input variability, which couple mean subthreshold voltage to firing rate, boost voltage fluctuations during inhibition. Moreover, synaptic time course and the number of inputs also influence gain changes by setting excitation variability. Our results suggest that shunting inhibition can multiplicatively scale rate-coded information in neurons with high-variability synaptic inputs."

https://openalex.org/W2073376085,"The ability of written and spoken words to access the same semantic meaning provides a test case for the multimodal convergence of information from sensory to associative areas. Using anatomically constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG), the present study investigated the stages of word comprehension in real time in the auditory and visual modalities, as subjects participated in a semantic judgment task. Activity spread from the primary sensory areas along the respective ventral processing streams and converged in anterior temporal and inferior prefrontal regions, primarily on the left at around 400 ms. Comparison of response patterns during repetition priming between the two modalities suggest that they are initiated by modality-specific memory systems, but that they are eventually elaborated mainly in supramodal areas."

https://openalex.org/W2060349323,"Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a ferroxidase that converts highly toxic ferrous iron to its non-toxic ferric form. A glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of this enzyme is expressed by astrocytes in the mammalian central nervous system, whereas the secreted form is expressed by the liver and found in serum. Lack of this enzyme results in iron accumulation in the brain and neurodegeneration. Herein, we show using astrocytes purified from the central nervous system of Cp-null mice that GPI-Cp is essential for iron efflux and not involved in regulating iron influx. We also show that GPI-Cp colocalizes on the astrocyte cell surface with the divalent metal transporter IREG1 and is physically associated with IREG1. In addition, IREG1 alone is unable to efflux iron from astrocytes in the absence of GPI-Cp or secreted Cp. We also provide evidence that the divalent metal influx transporter DMT1 is expressed by astrocytes and is likely to mediate iron influx into these glial cells. The coordinated actions of GPI-Cp and IREG1 may be required for iron efflux from neural cells, and disruption of this balance could lead to iron accumulation in the central nervous system and neurodegeneration.

Mechanisms to maintain iron homeostasis at the cellular level are crucial for the viability of cells. Excess or inappropriately shielded cellular iron can lead to cell death. The effects of this toxicity are especially noticeable in the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the central nervous system (CNS), 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; Cp, ceruloplasmin; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; GPI, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol; Dcytb, duodenal cytochrome b; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR. because the mature CNS lacks regenerative capabilities. Although iron is essential for a variety of biological functions, such as oxygen transport, mitochondrial respiration, and DNA synthesis, it can generate highly toxic free radicals because it is a transition metal. In its divalent state (Fe2+), iron is highly toxic when it reacts with hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen to produce free radicals. Free radical formation can promote lipid peroxidation, DNA strand breaks, degradation of biomolecules, and eventually cause cell death (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar). Therefore, organisms have developed mechanisms to prevent increase of the iron-pool while maintaining sufficient levels for metabolic use. However, these homeostatic mechanisms can get misregulated and cause iron deficiency or iron overload. The safe conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is catalyzed predominantly by a copper-binding glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin [Cp, EC 1.16.3.1 (2Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)]. Humans with mutations of the ceruloplasmin gene (aceruloplasminemia) show iron accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain, which is noticeable by the age of 45–55 years (3Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin null mutant mice also show accumulation of iron in the liver (5Harris Z.L.

Moreover, increased levels of iron and lipid peroxidation have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients (7Miyajima H. Fujimoto M. Kohno S. Kaneko E. Gitlin J.D. Neurology. 1998; 51: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The accumulation of iron in the CNS correlates with neurodegeneration in humans and mice (3Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. Jeong S.Y. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. David S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the rat brain expresses mainly the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin, which is predominantly expressed by astrocytes (8Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Human GPI-Cp was also cloned recently (9Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DMT1 (also Nramp2/DCT1/SLC11A2) is a divalent metal transporter found in duodenal enterocytes (10Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar). Mutations in DMT1 seen in mk mice with microcytic anemia and the Belgrade (b) rat cause defects in iron transport from the lumen of the gut into enterocytes and from plasma transferrin into erythroid precursors (11Fleming M.D. Trenor III, C.C.

Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). DMT1 transports non-heme, ferrous iron (Fe2+) instead of ferric (Fe3+) iron, which is bioavailable. Therefore, the existence of a membrane reductase to convert ferric iron to ferrous iron was proposed. A mammalian ferric reductase, duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb/Cybrd1) was cloned recently from mouse duodenum (13McKie A.T. Barrow D. Latunde-Dada G.O. Rolfs A. Sager G. Mudaly E. Mudaly M. Richardson C. Barlow D. Bomford A. Peters T.J. Raja K.B. Shirali S. Hediger M.A. Farzaneh F. Simpson R.J. Science. 2001; 291: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the gut, Dcytb is mainly localized in the brush border membrane and proposed to function as a ferric reductase. An iron exporter called IREG1 (also MTP1/ferroportin1/SLC11A3) is found on the basolateral side of mouse duodenal enterocytes and several other cell types (14Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol.

Although much is known about iron absorption and efflux in enterocytes in the gut, the mechanisms controlling iron homeostasis in neural cells in the CNS is still not well understood. Here, we report on experiments done to assess how GPI-Cp, which is expressed predominantly by astrocytes in the CNS, regulates iron levels in astrocytes and to determine its interactions with two divalent metal ion transporters, DMT1 and IREG1. Iron Influx/Efflux Studies—Astrocytes were purified from the brains of neonatal wild-type (Cp +/+) and Cp-null mice (Cp -/-) obtained from littermates and cultured as described previously (17Mittal B. Doroudchi M.M. Jeong S.Y. Patel B.N. David S. Glia. 2003; 41: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Cp-null mice were generated in this laboratory as reported previously (6Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. Jeong S.Y. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. David S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured astrocytes were plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated 24-well plates 2 days before the experiment at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) twice and incubated in DMEM containing vitamins and penicillin/streptomycin for 1 h at 37 °C to remove any transferrin-bound iron. Influx Study—After 1 h, DMEM was replaced with Sato's modified chemically defined serum-free medium (18Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) without transferrin. Radiolabeled iron (59FeCl3, 1 μCi/well; PerkinElmer Life Science) mixed with non-labeled FeCl3 (total of 40 μm) and l-ascorbate (Sigma) was added to keep iron in its ferrous form (molar ratio of FeCl3 to l-ascorbate was 1:44). After different culture periods, cells were treated with PRONASE protease (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C to remove membrane-bound iron and then lysed in 1 n NaOH. Additional experiments with EDTA (500 μm) and PRONASE treatment gave results similar to those of PRONASE alone (data not shown). The amount of radioactivity bound nonspecifically to the cells was estimated by adding the media containing radiolabeled iron to culture wells and removing it within 1–2 min, washing the wells, and measuring with a γ-counter (Amersham Biosciences). This radioactivity level, which was found to be extremely low, was considered background value and was subtracted from all values at each data point. This value is considered zero at the 0-h time point. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in the media containing radiolabeled iron until the desired time points (i.e. 12, 24, and 48 h). Sister cultures were treated in the same manner without radioactive iron, and viable cell numbers were estimated by trypan blue exclusion. The amount of radioactivity that was taken up by the cells was converted into picomoles of iron using a standard graph and normalized to value per 106 cells. The standard graph was plotted using counts per minute versus serial dilution of 1 μl of 59FeCl3. Efflux Study—Cultured astrocytes in 24-well plates were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h, as was done for the influx study. Cells were then loaded with medium containing radiolabeled iron for 24 h (same condition as above). After 24 h, cells were washed twice with DMEM, and serum-free Sato's chemically defined medium without transferrin was added to the cultures. At each time point (0, 12, 24, and 48 h) cells were detached, pelleted, and lysed in 1 n NaOH. In addition, a 200-μl aliquot of culture medium from each time point was collected to measure the amount of iron released into the medium. Radioactivity in both cell pellet and culture medium was measured. All radioactivity measurements at each time point were done in quadruplicate and repeated in three separate experiments. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Two-sample Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified from rat neonatal astrocyte cultures by RiboPure kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers used were as follows: DMT1_for, 5′-ACC GGG CCA ATA AGC AGG AAG TTC-3′; DMT1_rev, 5′-GGC AAA GCG CGA CCA TTT TAG GTT-3′; IREG1_for, 5′-TGG CCT TGT TCG GAC TGG TCT G-3′; IREG1_rev, 5′-TCA GGA TTT GGG GCC AAG ATG AC-3′; Dcytb_for, 5′-CGC GGT GAC CGG CTT CGT C-3′; and Dcytb_rev, 5′-CGA GGG GCG TTT CAG GAC AAA GA-3′ (Invitrogen custom-made primer). PCR was performed under the following conditions: step 1, 2.5 min at 95 °C for one cycle; step 2, 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 61.5 °C (58 °C for IREG1 and 60.2 °C for Dcytb), and 1.5 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles; and step 3, 7 min at 72 °C for one cycle. RT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed for the equal use of RNA according to the conditions described previously (19Ousman S.S. David S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cultured neonatal rat astrocytes were washed and pelleted. Total proteins were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 1% sodium deoxycholate (BDH Chemicals), 2% SDS, 0.15 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and incubated with anti-IREG1 (1:4000; Alpha Diagnostics) or anti-DMT1 (1:4000; NRAMP24-S, which recognizes DMT1 with and without IRE; Alpha Diagnostics), or antiactin polyclonal antibodies for loading control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated IgG, (1:200,000; Jackson Immunoresearch). Antibodies were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunocytochemistry—Purified neonatal rat astrocytes were plated on PLL-coated round glass coverslips and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution and stained with anti-ceruloplasmin monoclonal antibody (1A1; 1:100) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added for 30 min. Cells were fixed in acetic acid/ethanol (5:95 (v/v)) at -20 °C for 20 min. Permeabilized cells were stained with either anti-IREG1 or anti-DMT1 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (1:200; Alpha Diagnostics) for 30 min at room temperature and visualized by fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (all secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch). Confocal microscopy was used to generate 0.8-μm sectioned images of cells. Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—Purified rat astrocytes were sonicated and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. Supernatant was centrifuged at 137,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH. 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.25% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentration in the extracts was measured (DC Protein Assay kit; Bio-Rad). Ceruloplasmin was immunoprecipitated using 200 μg of the mouse monoclonal anti-ceruloplasmin antibody (1A1) conjugated to an immunoprecipitation column (Pierce Chemical), and 300 μg of the protein extract was incubated overnight. After washing steps, the bound protein was eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitated samples were denatured and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotted to detect Cp, DMT1, and IREG1. A column without conjugated primary antibody was used to obtain the negative control. How does GPI-Cp regulate iron levels in neural cells so that in its absence, iron accumulates in cells in the CNS, as seen in aceruloplasminemia and Cp -/- mice? GPI-Cp could regulate normal iron levels in the CNS by either limiting how much iron enters the cell or facilitating iron efflux. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we assessed iron influx and efflux with 59Fe in vitro using astrocytes purified from the Cp -/- and Cp +/+ mice. Astrocytes were used because our earlier work indicated that GPI-Cp is expressed mainly in astrocytes in the rat CNS (20Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For the influx studies, astrocytes were cultured in medium containing 59Fe/ascorbate in Sato's modified serumfree medium. At various time intervals ranging from 12 to 48 h, the cells were harvested and the amount of radiolabeled iron within the cells was estimated. These studies showed that the amount of iron influx is similar in Cp -/- and Cp +/+ mice (Fig. 1). The rate of influx is 0.1 pmol/106 cells/h, which is ∼2% of the influx reported for macrophages via the transferrin receptor (21Kim S. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33035-33042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For efflux studies, astrocyte cultures were first loaded with 59Fe in medium for 24 h. The radiolabeled medium was then removed, cultures were washed, and fresh Sato's serum-free, transferrin-free medium was added. The supernatant and cells were sampled at varying intervals from 12 to 48 h. In cultures of wild-type astrocytes, almost 70% of the iron within the cell was effluxed within 48 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, iron efflux was severely impaired in astrocyte cultures from Cp -/- mice. Less than 5% of the iron was effluxed in the 48-hour period (Fig. 2B). To assess whether the secreted form of ceruloplasmin can compensate for the lack of GPI-Cp, cultures of astrocytes from Cp -/- mice were first loaded with 59Fe for 24 h, as noted above. After removing the radiolabeled medium, fresh serum-free medium containing soluble ceruloplasmin was added to the cultures. Ceruloplasmin at 1 μg/ml (i.e. the concentration found in CSF) increased iron efflux minimally by 9% (Fig. 3), whereas ceruloplasmin at 300 μg/ml (i.e. the concentration in serum) enhanced efflux to 50% by 48 h (Fig. 3). Increasing the ceruloplasmin concentration to 400 μg/ml increased efflux further to 65% (data not shown). These results indicate that the low amount of ceruloplasmin in CSF is insufficient to mediate iron efflux, and concentrations of soluble ceruloplasmin equal to or higher than serum levels are need to efflux iron to the levels achieved by GPI-Cp.Fig. 2Role of ceruloplasmin in iron efflux from astrocytes. A, iron efflux from astrocytes from Cp +/+ mice. Cells were loaded with 59Fe for 24 h, washed, and cultured in non-radioactive, serum-free, transferrin-free medium. The amount of radiolabeled iron was measured in the cell pellet and culture medium at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. About 70% of the radiolabeled iron in the cells is effluxed by 48 h (•). A corresponding increase in radiolabeled iron is detected in the culture medium (○), indicating iron efflux. Results are shown as means ± S.E. B, iron efflux from astrocytes from Cp -/-mice. Cells were loaded with 59Fe and cultured as in A. The percentage of radiolabeled iron in the cells remains unchanged through out the 48-h period (•). Radiolabeled iron is also not detected in the culture medium (○) during this period, indicating that iron does not efflux from astrocyte from Cp -/- mice. Efflux at each time point was compared for statistical significance with the corresponding cell pellet or supernatant values from Cp +/+ mice shown in A using a two-sample Student's t test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.008.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Effect of soluble Cp on iron efflux from astrocytes from Cp -/- mice. To assess whether secreted ceruloplasmin can compensate for GPI-Cp to efflux iron, astrocytes from Cp -/- mice were loaded with iron, as in Fig. 2, and cultured in serum-free, transferrin-free medium, to which was added serum ceruloplasmin at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (equivalent to CSF levels) and 300 μg/ml (equivalent to serum levels). Control Cp -/- cells (•) were cultured in the same medium without Cp. Very minimal iron efflux occurred with 1 μg/ml of ceruloplasmin (▴), whereas a 50% efflux was seen with 300 μg/ml of ceruloplasmin (▾). Results represent means ± S.E. *, p < 0.02.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because ceruloplasmin is an enzyme, it must regulate iron efflux via iron transporters. We first carried out experiments to assess whether the iron efflux transporter IREG1 and the iron influx transporter DMT1 are expressed by astrocytes. RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that DMT1 and IREG1 mRNA and protein are expressed by astrocytes (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). RT-PCR analysis also indicates that the ferrireductase Dyctb is expressed by these cells, which could make soluble ferrous iron available for influx via DMT1 over prolonged periods in vitro (13McKie A.T. Barrow D. Latunde-Dada G.O. Rolfs A. Sager G. Mudaly E. Mudaly M. Richardson C. Barlow D. Bomford A. Peters T.J. Raja K.B. Shirali S. Hediger M.A. Farzaneh F. Simpson R.J. Science. 2001; 291: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Confocal microscopy of double-immunofluorescence labeling of cultured astrocytes showed that IREG1, but not DMT1, is colocalized with GPI-Cp on the surface of astrocytes (Fig. 5). These data suggest that there might be a specific interaction of GPI-Cp with the iron exporter IREG1. To confirm these immunocytochemical results and to assess whether there is a direct physical interaction between these two molecules, GPI-Cp was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody against Cp (1A1) and Western blotted to detect DMT1 and IREG1. These results showed that IREG1 but not DMT1 is coimmunoprecipitated with GPI-Cp, indicating a direct interaction of this GPI-anchored ferroxidase with IREG1 (Fig 6A).Fig. 5GPI-Cp is associated with IREG1.

IREG1 but not DMT1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Cp antibodies. Columns without conjugated primary antibody and immunoblotted for Cp (lane 1) and IREG1 (lane 2) were used as negative controls. Lane 3 was used as a positive control. B, IREG1 expression remains unchanged in Cp +/+ and Cp -/- mouse brain. Protein extracts of brains from Cp +/+ (lane 1) and Cp -/- (lane 2) mice were Western blotted for IREG1 and actin (loading control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the evidence of interaction between GPI-Cp and IREG1, it is possible that the lack of iron efflux in cultures of astrocytes from Cp -/- mice could be caused by a down-regulation of the expression of IREG1 in Cp -/- mice. To determine whether this is the case, total protein from the brains of Cp -/- and Cp +/+ mice were Western blotted to detect IREG1. The level of expression of IREG1 protein is similar in Cp -/- and Cp +/+ mice (Fig. 6B), indicating that this transporter requires ceruloplasmin to efflux iron from astrocytes. Although there has been an increase in our understanding of iron transport and regulation of iron levels in hematopoietic tissue, macrophages, and enterocytes in the gut, there is little direct evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying iron transport across neural cell membranes in the CNS (reviewed in Ref. 22Burdo J.R. Connor J.R. Biometals. 2003; 16: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Once iron gets past the endothelial cells in the CNS, its uptake into neural cells could occur via transferrin and/or non-transferrin-mediated mechanisms. Transferrin receptors are expressed by oligodendrocytes and neurons in the CNS, whereas their expression in astrocytes has been more difficult to detect, although some recent studies suggest its presence in astrocytes (23Qian Z.M. To Y. Tang P.L. Feng Y.M. Exp. Brain. Res. 1999; 129: 473-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, transferrin levels in the CSF, which reflects the amount available to CNS tissue, is extremely low (about 1% compared with serum; 0.1–0.28 μmol/L in humans (24Bradbury M.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)), suggesting that under normal conditions, transferrin-mediated uptake may not be significant, particularly in astrocytes. This is further supported by the findings in hypotransferrinemic mice, which show a normal distribution of iron in the brain (25Dickinson T.K. Connor J.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Dickinson T.K. Connor J.R. Brain Res. 1998; 801: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These data suggest that non-transferrin-mediated mechanisms are likely to be involved in iron influx into cells in the brain. We show here that astrocytes can indeed take up iron though non-transferrin-mediated mechanisms. We also show that astrocytes express both the divalent metal transporter DMT1, which has specificity for divalent metals, including ferrous iron, and the ferric reductase Dcytb, indicating a role for these molecules in mediating iron uptake in the CNS. Our data show that the rate of iron uptake into astrocytes is ∼2% that of macrophages (21Kim S. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33035-33042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and ∼3.5% that of hepatocytes (27Richardson D.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 134: 454-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This slow rate of uptake into astrocytes might explain the slow accumulation of iron and late onset of neurological symptoms in aceruloplasminemia. Iron deficiency states do not seem primarily to affect the brain, suggesting that it is capable of possibly reusing iron or mobilizing it from other sources to maintain normal physiological functions. In addition, high levels of serum iron, as occurs in hemochromatosis, does not lead to iron accumulation in the CNS (reviewed in Ref. 28Anderson G.J. Powell L.W. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 76: 203-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possibly indicating a unique homeostatic mechanism at either the level of the endothelial cells in the CNS or in cells that surround CNS capillaries, namely astrocytes. In contrast, iron accumulates in the brain in aceruloplasminemia in humans and mice (3Miyajima H. Nishimura Y. Mizoguchi K. Sakamoto M. Shimizu T. Honda N. Neurology. 1987; 37: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which serum iron and serum transferrin saturation levels are very low (5Harris Z.L. Durley A.P. Man T.K. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10812-10817Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 6Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. Jeong S.Y. Zhu Q. Julien J.P. David S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that a lack of ceruloplasmin expression by astrocytes leads to disruption of iron efflux. The requirement of GPI-Cp for iron efflux from astrocytes indicates that oxidation of ferrous iron transported across the cell membrane, probably via the transmembrane transporter IREG1, is an essential step. Recently, soluble ceruloplasmin was shown to be essential for iron transport across the oocyte membranes when IREG1 was expressed in these cells in vitro (16McKie A.T. Marciani P. Rolfs A. Brennan K. Wehr K. Barrow D. Miret S. Bomford A. Peters T.J. Farzaneh F. Hediger M.A. Hentze M.W. Simpson R.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 299-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on the yeast showed that a transmembrane multicopper oxidase Fet3 with homology to ceruloplasmin interacts with an iron permease, Ftr1p, to transport iron across the cell membrane (29Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). We now show that IREG1 is expressed by astrocytes from the brain and is physically associated with GPI-Cp. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that the expression of IREG1 alone is insufficient to allow iron efflux in the absence of GPI-Cp. BecauseIREG1 transports ferrous iron that is highly toxic, ceruloplasmin as the major ferroxidase in the CNS plays a crucial role in detoxifying it to the ferric state. The inability of IREG1 to efflux ferrous iron in the absence of ceruloplasmin may therefore serve as a protective mechanism to prevent efflux of toxic ferrous iron, leading to the rapid generation of free radicals. The slow accumulation of iron intracellularly may eventually surpass the ability of the intracellular sequestering capacity of the cell and lead to cell damage and death. Because soluble ceruloplasmin in the CSF, which is produced by the choroid plexus, is extremely low (1 μg/ml compared with 300 μg/ml in the serum), it is likely to contribute minimally to the ferroxidase activity in the CNS. Astrocytes are known to be the only cell type in the CNS to express ceruloplasmin (20Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 31Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which is of the GPI-anchored form (8Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4305-4310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The severe accumulation of iron in the brain in cases of aceruloplasminemia indicates that ceruloplasmin expressed on the surface of astrocytes plays an important role in the maintenance of normal iron levels in the CNS and its mobilization out of the CNS. Furthermore, GPI-Cp expressed by astrocytes also seems to be capable of effluxing iron from neurons, because iron accumulates in neurons in aceruloplasminemia. How GPI-Cp regulates neuronal iron levels is not yet known but may involve the transfer of GPI-Cp from the astrocyte to the neuronal cell membrane, because GPI-anchored proteins can transfer from one cell to another by cell-to-cell contact (32Kooyman D.L. Byrne G.W. McClellan S. Nielsen D. Tone M. Waldmann H. Coffman T.M. McCurry K.R. Platt J.L. Logan J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This might explain why Cp is found in both astrocytes and neurons in the CNS (33Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas Cp mRNA is found only in the astrocytes (31Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1989-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One advantage of the GPI-anchored form or ceruloplasmin in the brain is that it reduces the need to have high levels of ceruloplasmin in the CSF. Our results indicate that at least 300 to 400 μg/ml of ceruloplasmin would be needed in the CSF to efflux iron from astrocytes. This contrasts sharply with the total protein concentration of 350 μg/ml in human CSF (34Fishman R.A. Cerebrospinal Fluid in Diseases of the Nervous System. 2nd ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1992Google Scholar). Some of the other features that GPI anchors confer to proteins may also aid in the physiological function of ceruloplasmin; e.g. GPI-anchored proteins, which are located in lipid-rich microdomains, have a much greater degree of lateral mobility (35Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and may also help serve as an apical targeting signal (36Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The latter feature may lead to the targeting of GPI-Cp in vivo to the astrocytic end-feet that surround capillaries in the CNS and thus position the iron efflux mechanism near blood vessels via which iron can be mobilized out of the CNS. This work provides the basis for understanding why iron accumulates in the CNS in aceruloplasminemia and may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases in which iron accumulation occurs, such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease."

Since phosphorylation is a prominent mechanism by which these processes are regulated, we examined phosphorylation of ataxin-1 and found that serine 776 (S776) was phosphorylated. Residue 776 appeared to affect cellular deposition of ataxin-1[82Q] in that ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 failed to form nuclear inclusions in tissue culture cells. The importance of S776 for polyglutamine-induced pathogenesis was examined by generating ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 transgenic mice. These mice expressed ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 within Purkinje cell nuclei, yet the ability of ataxin-1[82Q]-A776 to induce disease was substantially reduced. These studies demonstrate that polyglutamine tract expansion and localization of ataxin-1 to the nucleus of Purkinje cells are not sufficient to induce disease. We suggest that S776 of ataxin-1 also has a critical role in SCA1 pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2051465511,"During spinal cord development, commissural neurons extend their axons ventrally, away from the roof plate. The roof plate is the source of a diffusible repellent that orients commissural axons in vitro and, thus, may regulate the trajectory of commissural axons in vivo. Of three Bmps expressed in the roof plate, BMP7, but not BMP6 or GDF7, mimics the roof plate activity in vitro. We show here that expression of both Bmp7 and Gdf7 by roof plate cells is required for the fidelity of commissural axon growth in vivo. We also demonstrate that BMP7 and GDF7 heterodimerize in vitro and that, under these conditions, GDF7 enhances the axon-orienting activity of BMP7. Our findings suggest that a GDF7:BMP7 heterodimer functions as a roof plate-derived repellent that establishes the initial ventral trajectory of commissural axons."
https://openalex.org/W2096247801,"The concept of bell-shaped persistent neural activity represents a cornerstone of the theory for the internal representation of analog quantities, such as spatial location or head direction. Previous models, however, relied on the unrealistic assumption of network homogeneity. We investigate this issue in a network model where fine tuning of parameters is destroyed by heterogeneities in cellular and synaptic properties. Heterogeneities result in the loss of stored spatial information in a few seconds. Accurate encoding is recovered when a homeostatic mechanism scales the excitatory synapses to each cell to compensate for the heterogeneity in cellular excitability and synaptic inputs. Moreover, the more realistic model produces a wide diversity of tuning curves, as commonly observed in recordings from prefrontal neurons. We conclude that recurrent attractor networks in conjunction with appropriate homeostatic mechanisms provide a robust, biologically plausible theoretical framework for understanding the neural circuit basis of spatial working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2120834475,"To study the role of NT3 in directing axonal projections of proprioceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, NT3(-/-) mice were crossed with mice carrying a targeted deletion of the proapoptotic gene Bax. In Bax(-/-)/NT3(-/-) mice, NT3-dependent neurons survived and expressed the proprioceptive neuronal marker parvalbumin. Initial extension and collateralization of proprioceptive axons into the spinal cord occurred normally, but proprioceptive axons extended only as far as the intermediate spinal cord. This projection defect is similar to the defect in mice lacking the ETS transcription factor ER81. Few if any DRG neurons from Bax(-/-)/NT3(-/-) mice expressed ER81 protein. Expression of a NT3 transgene in muscle restored DRG ER81 expression in NT3(-/-) mice. Finally, addition of NT3 to DRG explant cultures resulted in induction of ER81 protein. Our data indicate that NT3 mediates the formation of proprioceptive afferent-motor neuron connections via regulation of ER81."
https://openalex.org/W2014448346,"The overexpression of antioxidative enzymes such as CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, and catalase has previously been reported to extend life span in transgenic flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The purpose of this study was to determine whether life-extending effects persist if the recipient control strains of flies are relatively long-lived. Accordingly, the life spans of large numbers of replicate control and overexpressor lines were determined in two long-lived genetic backgrounds involving a combined total of >90,000 flies. Significant increases in the activities of both CuZn-SOD and catalase had no beneficial effect on survivorship in relatively long-lived y w mutant flies and were associated with slightly decreased life spans in wild type flies of the Oregon-R strain. The introduction of additional transgenes encoding Mn-SOD or thioredoxin reductase in the same genetic background also failed to cause life span extension. In conjunction with data from earlier studies, the results show that increasing the activities of these major antioxidative enzymes above wild type levels does not decrease the rate of aging in long-lived strains of Drosophila, although there may be some effect in relatively short-lived strains. The overexpression of antioxidative enzymes such as CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD, and catalase has previously been reported to extend life span in transgenic flies (Drosophila melanogaster).

The free radical hypothesis of aging postulates that senescence is due to an accumulation of molecular oxidative damage, caused largely by oxidants that are produced as by-products of normal metabolic processes (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6329) Google Scholar). A logical prediction based on this hypothesis is that the elevation of antioxidative defenses should delay aging and extend life span (2Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1The abbreviation used is: SOD, superoxide dismustase.1The abbreviation used is: SOD, superoxide dismustase. and catalase act in tandem to eliminate superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, thereby constituting the primary line of intracellular, enzymatic, and antioxidative defense (2Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD serves to eliminate superoxide radicals in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas thioredoxin reductase regenerates both reduced glutathione and thioredoxin in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster (3Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.-M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Several early studies revealed little or no increase in life span following overexpression of these enzymes in transgenic flies (4Seto N.O.L. Hayashi S. Tener G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4270-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Reveillaud I. Niedzwiecki A. Bensch K.G. Fleming J.E. Mol. Cell.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Subsequently, three groups reported life span extensions, ranging maximally from 33 to 48%, in flies overexpressing CuZn-SOD alone or in conjunction with catalase (2Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 8Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat.

While the latter studies ostensibly confirmed the free radical hypothesis, the strength of their conclusions has been questioned on the basis that insufficient numbers of control strains were used (10Tatar M. Am. Nat. 1999; 154: S67-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or that the controls had artificially short life spans, possibly because of inbreeding depression or other genetic background effects (11Tower J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). For instance, in one study (9Sun J. Tower J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the life spans of control flies ranged from 25 to 65 days, whereas life span extension ranged from –3 to +48% in flies overexpressing CuZn-SOD. The greatest proportional increase in longevity occurred in the shortest-lived genetic background, extending the life span to only 37 days, whereas the 3% decrease in mean survival time was observed in a background with a control life span of 59 days. An additional complicating factor is the discordant findings that overexpression of the mitochondrial enzyme, Mn-SOD, either extends life span in a dose-dependent manner (13Sun J. Folk D. Bradley T.J. Tower J. Genetics. 2002; 161: 661-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or has no positive effect on life span (14Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Rahmandar J.J. Benes J.J. Radyuk S.N. Klichko V.I. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The experiments reported here were undertaken to clarify the effects of simultaneous overexpression of different antioxidative gene combinations in relatively long-lived strains. The combinations employed were as follows: (i) CuZn-SOD and catalase; (ii) CuZn-SOD, catalase, and Mn-SOD; (iii) CuZn-SOD and thioredoxin reductase; (iv) catalase and thioredoxin reductase; and (v) CuZn-SOD, catalase, and thioredoxin reductase. A large number of replicate lines were used to control for insertional position effects of the transgenes. Increases in the gene dosages and activities of these enzymes were shown not to extend the life span of Drosophila in two outbred genetic backgrounds. Construction of Transgenic Fly Lines—In this study, 15 Drosophila lines were constructed by recombination of transgenes containing the Drosophila genomic CuZn-SOD and catalase sequences, each inserted at one of five distinct loci, onto a single chromosome 2 homologue, which was subsequently maintained over the balancer chromosome CyO. Similarly, 17 control lines were constructed with transgenes containing empty vector sequences inserted at two of seven different loci and balanced over CyO. The construction of the individual transgenes and their effects on longevity have been described previously (6Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additional transgenic lines were generated by recombination of a thioredoxin reductase transgene at one of six different loci (15Mockett R.J. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with either CuZn-SOD (19 combinations), catalase (14 combinations), or both CuZn-SOD and catalase (28 combinations). Similarly, 28 combinations were made using CuZn-SOD, catalase, and Mn-SOD transgenes (the Mn-SOD transgenes were inserted at one of seven different loci). For the experiments involving three antioxidant transgenes, controls were generated by recombination of groups of three empty vector transgenes inserted at a total of seven loci (20 combinations). The presence of all of the transgenes in each stock maintained over the CyO balancer chromosome was verified by Southern analysis. For antioxidant overexpressor stocks, separate probes were used for each antioxidant gene sequence. For controls, vector sequences were used in the probe. Life Spans and Enzyme Assays—Male transgenic flies were backcrossed to parental y w females, and heterozygous male progeny were collected for measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities. CuZn-superoxide dismutase activity was measured by the method of Spitz and Oberley (16Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) using 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate pretreatment for 30 min to remove Mn-SOD activity (17Geller B.L. Winge D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as described previously (18Mockett R.J. Bayne A.-C.V. Sohal B.H. Sohal R.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was measured by monitoring rates of H2O2 consumption at 30 °C as also described previously (15Mockett R.J. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Lück H. Bergmeyer H.-U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 885-894Crossref Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase activity was measured using a surrogate assay with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as the substrate (15Mockett R.J. Sohal R.S. Orr W.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1733-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For life span experiments, male transgenic flies balanced over CyO were backcrossed to virgin y w females or outcrossed to Oregon R (wild type) females. Male CyO + progeny, heterozygous for each transgene, were collected 1 ± 1 day post-eclosion and maintained at 25 ± 1 °C. Fresh vials containing standard medium (yeast-cornmeal-sugar-agar) were provided, and survivorship was scored every second day initially and every single day beginning 20–30 days after collection. Statistical Analysis—Within each life span experiment, the mean value for each transgenic line was calculated as recommended by Tatar (10Tatar M. Am. Nat. 1999; 154: S67-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and compared using an unpaired Student's t test. Enzyme activities (overexpressor versus control) were also compared using unpaired Student's t tests. Correlation analysis involving enzyme activity and life span data for individual fly lines in different experiments was performed using Microsoft Excel software. Critical values of the correlation coefficient (r) were obtained from published tables (20Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984Google Scholar). Overexpression of CuZn-SOD and Catalase—Enzyme activities were determined for the 15 lines containing heterozygous CuZn-SOD and catalase transgenes in a yw background and 17 controls containing two empty-vector transgenes (Fig. 1). The CuZn-SOD activity of the SOD/catalase strains was increased by 50 ± 29% (mean ± S.D.; range: +19–128%) in comparison with the mean of the control values, whereas catalase activity was increased by 61 ± 41% (range: +18–144%). The differences in activity between overexpressor and control lines were highly significant for both enzymes (p < 0.0001). Effects of Different Transgene Combinations on Life Span: CuZn-SOD and Catalase—The mean life spans of the SOD/catalase and control lines were 69.4 and 67.8 days, respectively, in the first of two independent experiments in the y w background (Fig. 2A). The respective life spans in the second experiment were 63.0 and 67.0 days. The net differences in survival times in the two experiments (SOD/catalase versus control) were +2.3% and –6.0% (Table I). All of the transgenic lines were also outcrossed to wild type (Oregon-R) females in two independent experiments, yielding life spans of 58.9 versus 61.3 days (–3.8%) and 60.0 versus 64.7 days (–7.2%). Among the four experiments, only the life span reduction of the latter cohort in the wild type background reached statistical significance (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). Comparisons among the individual lines overexpressing CuZn-SOD and catalase demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between the activities of the two enzymes, or between the activity of either enzyme and life span in any of the four experiments, or among the life spans of the individual lines in replicate experiments in either genetic background.Table ISummary of life span effects resulting from overexpression of enzymatic antioxidantsTransgenes (background)Overexpressor life spanaResults are expressed as mean ± S.D. of the mean life spans of individual lines of flies.Control life spanaResults are expressed as mean ± S.D. of the mean life spans of individual lines of flies.Increase in life spanbPercent differences in mean life spans are of overexpressor versus control lines.

Open table in a new tab CuZn-SOD, Catalase, and Mn-SOD—In a separate study, a total of three life span experiments were conducted in two genetic backgrounds with flies containing CuZn-SOD, catalase, and Mn-SOD transgenes (Fig. 3A). Survivorship data were obtained for a total of >25,000 flies. In each experiment, there was a non-significant decrease (<5%) in the mean life spans of flies containing antioxidative transgenes. None of these differences was statistically significant. CuZn-SOD, Catalase, and Thioredoxin Reductase—Another experiment was conducted to examine the effects of CuZn-SOD and thioredoxin reductase transgenes in a y w background as well as two experiments with catalase and thioredoxin reductase transgenes. Overexpression of both enzymes was verified experimentally in the latter case (results not shown), whereas in the former case it was inferred from increased enzymatic activity in the ancestral transgenic lines prior to recombination. Each experiment involved in excess of 2800 experimental and 3000 control flies, but there were no significant changes in survival times (Table I). Finally, in an independent study, the CuZn-SOD, catalase, and thioredoxin reductase transgenes were introduced into the same flies. An initial study of 5995 backcrossed experimental flies demonstrated a significant 7.9% increase in life span in comparison with 4300 control flies (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). However, a second experiment failed to replicate this result (Fig. 3C). The main finding of this study is that the introduction of transgenes resulting in overexpression of major antioxidative enzymes had no significant effect on survival times if relatively long-lived fly lines were used as controls. A grand total of >90,000 flies were studied using two genetic backgrounds and large numbers of replicate lines with transgenes inserted at different loci to control for insertional position effects. These results demonstrate unequivocally that overexpression of the Drosophila CuZn-SOD, Mn-SOD, catalase, and thioredoxin reductase genes in the normal spatial and temporal patterns has no beneficial effect on longevity in long-lived outbred backgrounds. These findings differ from those of previous studies in which the pattern of gene expression was altered and/or the life spans of the control populations were relatively short. The absence of life span extension in this study is seemingly at odds with the conclusions of several existing studies involving overexpression of SOD and/or catalase (2Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 8Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat.

Tower J. Genetics. 2002; 161: 661-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been noted previously (12Sohal R.S. Mockett R.J. Orr W.C. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) that reports of large relative increases in longevity in Drosophila, in response to regulated SOD overexpression (9Sun J. Tower J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and other genetic or dietary modifications (21Tatar M. Kopelman A. Epstein D. Tu M.-P. Yin C.-M. Garofalo R.S.

Biol. 2002; 12: 712-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), have been based on control populations with life spans as short as 25–35 days. Such results should be interpreted with great caution, because the reference point is barely half of the normal value. The “extended” life spans of experimental populations in these studies do not exceed those of healthy control strains of the same species maintained under optimal conditions. This point is underscored by the finding of Sun and Tower that a single transgene insertion (SOD3B2) caused a significant 16–20% extension of life span in a short-lived TM3, Sb background, and a non-significant 1–3% decrease in survival times in a long-lived DrMIO background (9Sun J. Tower J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, a second line (SOD3A1) had a significant 10–14% increase in life span following SOD overexpression in either background. This indicates that both the starting life span and epistatic interactions with other loci can affect the life span extension resulting from transgene overexpression. If the maximum life span extensions from all of the published studies of antioxidative enzyme overexpression are considered together, it appears that the beneficial effects are minimized or disappear completely in animals with relatively long reference life spans (Fig. 4A). If all of the data from each study are considered, i.e. the average of the life span extensions instead of the maximum beneficial effect, then a similar trend is observed, but the extension of life span associated with shorter-lived backgrounds becomes much smaller in magnitude (Fig. 4B). The clearest exception to this generalization is the targeted expression of human CuZn-SOD in Drosophila motor neurons (8Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), which resulted in some extension of life span even when the SOD allele contained mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (23Elia A.J. Parkes T.L. Kirby K. St. George-Hyslop P. Boulianne G.L. Phillips J.P. Hilliker A.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the level of expression of CuZn-SOD in the central nervous system of adult Drosophila is normally very low (24Klichko V.I. Radyuk S.N. Orr W.C. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, targeted expression may rescue an insufficiency in this tissue type, rather than supporting a general conclusion that increasing antioxidant levels slows the aging process. Furthermore, in the absence of replication in alternative genetic backgrounds, the possibility that this is a strain-dependent effect cannot be ruled out. It should also be noted that the complete abolition of Drosophila CuZn-SOD and its replacement with human SOD at 5–10% of wild type activity levels were recently reported to have no detectable impact on survivorship or other biochemical and physiological parameters pertaining to oxidative stress and the rate of aging (25Mockett R.J. Radyuk S.N. Benes J.J. Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Given that mortality rates are either unaffected or even increased in both humans and mice with bolstered levels of superoxide dismutase or other antioxidants (26Huang T.-T. Carlson E.J. Gillespie A.M. Shi Y. Epstein C.J. J. Gerontol. Biol. Sci. 2000; 55A: B5-B9Google Scholar, 27Ledvina M. Hodáňová M. Exp.

Public Health. 1993; 83: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is striking to find that in lower organisms the antioxidant theory of aging is also less strongly supported than has been previously maintained. It is also crucial to recognize that these results do not contradict the broader oxidative stress hypothesis of aging, according to which the key parameter is oxidative damage arising from an imbalance among oxidant production, antioxidant defenses, and repair processes. However, the available evidence backed by the current findings suggests that antioxidant levels are not the limiting factor in this imbalance. The authors are grateful to P. Benes, J. G. Hubbard, S.

Exposure to Zn2+ ions induces Akt activation, suggesting that PTEN may be modulated in this process. Therefore, the effects of Zn2+ on PTEN were studied in human airway epithelial cells and rat lungs. Treatment with Zn2+ resulted in a significant reduction in levels of PTEN protein in a dose- and time-dependent fashion in a human airway epithelial cell line. This effect of Zn2+was also observed in normal human airway epithelial cells in primary culture and in rat airway epithelium in vivo. Concomitantly, levels of PTEN mRNA were also significantly reduced by Zn2+ exposure. PTEN phosphatase activity evaluated by measuring Akt phosphorylation decreased after Zn2+ treatment. Pretreatment of the cells with a proteasome inhibitor significantly blocked zinc-induced reduction of PTEN protein as well as the increase in Akt phosphorylation, implicating the involvement of proteasome-mediated PTEN degradation. Further study revealed that Zn2+-induced ubiquitination of PTEN protein may mediate this process. A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor blocked PTEN degradation induced by Zn2+, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may participate in the regulation of PTEN. However, both the proteasome inhibitor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor failed to prevent significant down-regulation of PTEN mRNA expression in response to Zn2+.

PIP3 is specifically produced from phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by cell receptors including various tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and integrins (25Stephens L.

BEAS-2B cells (passages 70–80) were grown to confluence on tissue culture-treated Costar 6- or 12-well plates in keratinocyte basal medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 5 ng/ml human EGF, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 0.1 mm ethanolamine, 0.1 mm phosphoethanolamine, and 5 ng/ml insulin, as described previously (43Wu W. Jaspers I. Zhang W. Graves L.M. Samet J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L1040-L1048Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were placed in keratinocyte basal medium (without supplements) for 20–22 h before treatment with zinc sulfate (Sigma). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (passages 2–3) were obtained from normal adult volunteers by transbronchoscopic brush biopsy of mainstem bronchi, conducted while following a protocol approved by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (45Samet J.M. Silbajoris R. Wu W. Graves L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells were plated in supplemented bronchial epithelial cell basal medium (0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin-B, 52 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, and 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid) grown to confluence and then cultured with bronchial epithelial cell basal medium deprived of epidermal growth factor for 12–16 h before challenge with zinc sulfate. Immunoprecipitation—BEAS-2B cells pretreated with MG132 were stimulated with Zn2+ for 1 h. Cells treated with different doses of Zn2+ were lysed with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm vanadyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml trans-epoxy succinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mg/ml bestatin, 10 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.1 ng/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates (300 μg) were precleared with protein A-agarose and then incubated with agarose-conjugated ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed with cold RIPA buffer before immunoblotting using a murine monoclonal anti-human PTEN antibody (Cascade Bioscience, Winchester, MA). Immunoblotting—Cells with or without pretreatment of pharmacological inhibitors were treated with Zn2+ and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Cleared cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, as described before (42Wu W. Graves L.M. Gill G.N. Parsons S.J. Samet J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk, washed briefly, incubated with antibodies against human PTEN (Cascade Bioscience), phospho-specific Akt and Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and β-actin (USBiological, Swampscott, MA), respectively, at 4 °C overnight followed by incubating with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblot images were detected using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and the Gene Gynome Imaging System (Syngene, Frederick, MD). Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—BEAS-2B cells grown to confluence were exposed to 50 μm Zn2+. Cells were lysed with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate (Roche Applied Science), 50 mm sodium citrate, 0.5% sarkoyl, and 0.01 m dithiothreitol. Total RNA (200 ng) was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (47Yang F. Wang X. Haile D.J. Piantadosi C.A. Ghio A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L932-L939PubMed Google Scholar). PTEN mRNA levels were normalized using the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Relative amounts of PTEN and GAPDH mRNA were based on standard curves prepared by serial dilution of cDNA from human BEAS-2B cells. The following oligonucleotide primers and probes were used: PTEN, 5′-TGT TGT TTC ACA AGA TGA TGT TTG A-3′ (sense), 5′-CGT CGT GTG GGT CCT GAA TT-3′ (antisense), 5′-ACT ATT CCA ATG TTC AGT GGC GGA ACT TGC-3′ (probe); GAPDH, 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′ (sense), 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′ (antisense), 5′-CAA GCT TCC CGT TCT CAG CC-3′ (probe). In addition, PTEN mRNA expression was also determined in cells pretreated with vehicle or inhibitors (MG132 or LY294002) prior to zinc exposure according to the same procedure. Immunohistochemistry—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (60 days old) were anesthetized with halothane and instilled with either 0.5 ml of saline or 0.5 ml of 50 μm zinc sulfate in saline. 24 h after instillation, the lungs of euthanized rats were fixed with 10% formalin (35 ml/kg of body weight) (Fisher). The immunochemical staining was conducted as described before (48Wang X. Ghio A.J. Yang F. Dolan K.G. Garrick M.D. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L987-L995Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were mounted on silane-treated slides (Fisher) and air-dried overnight. The slides were heat-fixed at 600 °C in a slide dryer (Shandon Lipshaw, Pittsburgh, PA) and then followed by deparaffinization and hydration to 95% alcohol (xylene for 10 min, absolute alcohol for 5 min, and 95% alcohol for 5 min). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with H2O2 in absolute methanol (30% H2O2 in 30 ml of methanol) for 8 min. Slides were rinsed in 95% alcohol for 2 min, placed in deionized H2O, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. After treatment with Cyto Q Background Buster (Innovex Biosciences) for 10 min, slides were incubated with mouse anti-human PTEN antibody (Cascade Bioscience, Winchester, MA) diluted 1:100 in 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C followed by incubation with biotinylated linking secondary antibody from Stat-Q staining system (Innovex Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and peroxidase enzyme label from Stat-Q Staining System was applied. Tissue sections were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and counter-stained with hematoxylin. Coverslips were applied using a permanent mounting medium. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t tests with conferring correction were used for pairwise comparison. Reduction of PTEN Protein Levels in Human Airway Epithelial Cells Exposed to Zn2 + —Previous studies showed that Zn2+-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (44Kim S. Jung Y. Kim D. Koh H. Chung J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25979-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) suggested that this metal may affect PTEN protein. To test this assumption, PTEN protein levels were measured in human airway epithelial cells exposed to Zn2+ using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, exposure to 50 μm Zn2+ for 4 and 8 h significantly decreased PTEN protein levels in BEAS-2B cells. Exposure of BEAS-2B cells to 50 μm Zn2+ for 8 h did not result in significant alterations in cell viability, as assessed by assay of lactate dehydrogenase activity released into the culture medium (data not shown). The magnitude of the Zn2+-induced reduction in PTEN content was proportional to the concentration of Zn2+ administered to the cells (Fig. 1B). PTEN protein level in untreated cells appeared constant over time (Fig. 1A). This finding was reproduced in normal human airway epithelial cells, excluding the possibility that this effect is an artifact of the BEAS-2B cell line (Fig. 1C). In comparison, 50 μm vanadyl sulfate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (45Samet J.M. Silbajoris R. Wu W. Graves L.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), produced only a minimal effect on PTEN protein levels in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, exposure of cells to 100 ng/ml EGF, a potent EGF receptor ligand (49Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h did not show a significant effect on PTEN levels (data not shown). These data indicated that Zn2+ treatment specifically reduced PTEN protein content in human airway epithelial cells. To determine whether this effect of Zn2+ also occurs in airway epithelium in vivo, Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally instilled with 50 μm Zn2+ or with saline as negative control. Both airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages in normal rat lung tissue were positively stained for PTEN protein that predominantly existed in cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PTEN protein immunostaining decreased markedly in airway epithelium exposed to Zn2+ (Fig. 2B), which was consistent with the in vitro observations. Interestingly, PTEN immunostaining in alveolar macrophages remained unchanged with Zn2+ exposure (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Zn2+-induced PTEN reduction may be cell type-specific. Zn2 + -induced PI3K/Akt Activation in Human Airway Epithelial Cells—Since PTEN antagonizes the PI3K/Akt pathway (13Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Downes C.P. Bennett D. McConnachie G. Leslie N.R. Pass I. MacPhee C. Patel L. Gray A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 846-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar), reduction of PTEN protein levels induced by Zn2+ should result in Akt activation. To further characterize the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on PTEN-associated signaling, we next studied the effect of Zn2+ treatment on the activation of Akt in BEAS-2B cells, as measured by the phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 (50Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to Zn2+ markedly induced Akt phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, robust Akt phosphorylation was evident 1 h after Zn2+ exposure, when there was minimal effect on the total PTEN protein level. Next, a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K activity, LY294002 (51Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11684-11691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was further used to ascertain the dependence of Zn2+-induced Akt phosphorylation on PI3K (52Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation was clearly inhibited in BEAS-2B cells pretreated with LY294002 (Fig. 3C). As vehicle control, Me2SO appeared to elevate the baseline of Akt phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 3C). PTEN mRNA Level Was Significantly Reduced by Zn2 + Exposure—Reduction of PTEN protein level and function may be associated with decreased PTEN mRNA expression in several tumor cell lines (53Bruni P. Boccia A. Baldassarre G. Trapasso F. Santoro M. Chiappetta G. Fusco A. Viglietto G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To identify the mechanisms responsible for PTEN protein reduction, PTEN mRNA expression in zinc-exposed cells was quantified using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. BEAS-2B cells were exposed to different doses of Zn2+ for different periods. As shown in Fig. 4A, reduction of PTEN mRNA expression (about 50%) was observed when cells were exposed to 50 μm Zn2+. Down-regulation of PTEN mRNA expression was only detected upon stimulation of BEAS-2B cells with 50 μm Zn2+ for 8 h (Fig. 4B). Thus, in contrast to PTEN protein levels in BEAS-2B cells, which declined as early as 4 h of exposure, the reduction of PTEN mRNA expression induced by Zn2+ occurred after PTEN protein levels had fallen. PTEN protein is a relatively stable protein with a half-life of 48–72 h (16Wu X. Hepner K. Castelino-Prabhu S. Do D. Kaye M.B. Yuan X.J. Wood J. Ross C. Sawyers C.L. Whang Y.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4233-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, PTEN protein level in untreated BEAS-2B cells appeared constant within 8 h of exposure. Therefore, these data suggested that the down-regulation of PTEN mRNA levels might not play a major role in Zn2+-induced PTEN reduction. Proteasome-mediated PTEN Degradation in Zn2 + -exposed Cells—The involvement of the proteasome in the degradation and regulation of the function of short-lived proteins, including oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle proteins, has been extensively documented as a mechanism for post-translational regulation of protein levels (54Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether PTEN degradation in response to Zn2+ exposure was proteasome-dependent. BEAS-2B cells were pretreated with a specific proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (55Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and PTEN protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. As shown earlier, exposure of cells to 50 μm Zn2+ for 8 h caused significant decreases of PTEN protein levels and Akt activation. In comparison, pretreatment with the MG132 completely prevented both Zn2+-induced PTEN protein loss as well as Akt activation (Fig. 5, A and B). As seen before (Fig. 3C), Me2SO vehicle control appeared to elevate the baseline of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). To exclude the potential effect of MG132 on PTEN mRNA expression, PTEN mRNA expression induced by Zn2+ in BEAS-2B cells was examined using reverse transcriptase-PCR as described above. Using the same exposure conditions, MG132 had no significant effect on Zn2+-induced PTEN mRNA expression (Fig. 5C). These data strongly implied that the 26 S proteasome played a critical role in Zn2+-induced PTEN degradation. One of the required steps in the proteasome degradation pathway is the formation of an ubiquitin-protein conjugate (56Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). The covalent addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the target protein is requisite for efficient recognition and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (18Tolkacheva T. Boddapati M. Sanfiz A. Tsuchida K. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4985-4989PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the state of ubiquitination of PTEN in Zn2+-exposed cells was determined using an immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of BEAS-2B cells with Zn2+ induced PTEN ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner. These data strongly suggested that Zn2+ treatment led to ubiquitination of PTEN protein, targeting PTEN protein to degradation by the proteasome in airway epithelial cells. A PI3K Inhibitor, LY294002, Blocked Zn2 + -induced PTEN Degradation—The role of PTEN in antagonizing the PI3K/Akt pathway has been well recognized (4Waite K.A. Eng C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 829-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar"
https://openalex.org/W2095559982,"Myosin V is an unconventional myosin that transports cargo such as vesicles, melanosomes, or mRNA on actin filaments. It is a two-headed myosin with an unusually long neck that has six IQ motifs complexed with calmodulin. In vitro studies have shown that myosin V moves processively on actin, taking multiple 36-nm steps that coincide with the helical repeat of actin. This allows the molecule to “walk” across the top of an actin filament, a feature necessary for moving large vesicles along an actin filament bound to the cytoskeleton. The extended neck length of the two heads is thought to be critical for taking 36-nm steps for processive movements. To test this hypothesis we have expressed myosin V heavy meromyosin-like fragments containing 6IQ motifs, as well as ones that shorten (2IQ, 4IQ) or lengthen (8IQ) the neck region or alter the spacing between 3rd and 4th IQ motifs. The step size was proportional to neck length for the 2IQ, 4IQ, 6IQ, and 8IQ molecules, but the molecule with the altered spacing took shorter than expected steps. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to determine whether the heavy meromyosin IQ molecules were capable of processive movements on actin. At saturating ATP concentrations, all molecules except for the 2IQ mutant moved processively on actin. When the ATP concentration was lowered to 10 μm or less, the 2IQ mutant demonstrated some processive movements but with reduced run lengths compared with the other mutants. Its weak processivity was also confirmed by actin landing assays. Myosin V is an unconventional myosin that transports cargo such as vesicles, melanosomes, or mRNA on actin filaments.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Class V myosins transport cargos such as endoplasmic reticulum in neurons, melanosomes in melanocytes, and mRNA in yeast (2Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1496: 36-51Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Similar to other myosins, they are composed of a head that binds ATP and actin and a neck region consisting of calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; WT, wild type; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; WT, wild type; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. molecules bound to an α-helical segment of the myosin heavy chain. The C-terminal tail domain of myosin V has coiled-coil forming motifs that dimerize and create two-headed molecules but do not self-associate into filamentous structures. The IQ motifs of the heavy chain, implicated in the binding of CaM or light chain subunits, have the consensus sequence, IQXXXRGXXXR, where X is any amino acid (3Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The neck of mouse myosin V has six IQ motifs, each of which binds CaM, making its neck longer than that of most myosins (4Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The six IQ motifs of all myosin V superfamily members are separated by 25–23-25–23-25 amino acids. The well studied myosin II class molecules that power muscle contraction and participate in cytokinesis in nonmuscle cells polymerize into filaments that are interdigitated with actin filaments. Kinetic and mechanical studies have demonstrated that these myosins interact only transiently with actin and typically spend greater than 95% of their kinetic cycle detached from actin. The term “low duty cycle” motor has been used to describe this behavior adopted to allow the sliding of actin filaments past myosin filaments to be unimpeded by nonproductive strongly bound myosin heads that have completed their powerstroke. If a vesicle translocating myosin had similar kinetics, a patch of 20 or more myosins would have to be positioned to possibly interact with actin to keep the vesicle attached to the actin filament so that it could move processively. Alternatively, if the myosin ATPase kinetics were altered such that the myosin spent most of its kinetic cycle strongly bound to actin, then a small number or possibly even a single myosin could efficiently translocate its vesicle processively along an actin filament. Another consideration for vesicle movement is that the actin filament is a helical polymer composed of 5 nm monomers with a 36-nm half-repeat that is usually bound to the cytoskeleton. If the moving myosin stepped from one actin monomer to the next, the motor and vesicle would rotate around the actin filament and crash its cargo into the cytoskeleton before any appreciable distance could be covered. Alternatively, if the motor could take large steps that matched the actin pseudo-repeat, it could effectively walk across the “top” of the cytoskeletal-bound actin filament while holding its cargo above. Experiments using optical trapping nanometry, electron microscopy, and single molecule motility studies demonstrated that myosin V moves processively along actin filaments, taking many 36-nm steps before dissociating (5Mehta A.D.

Kinetic analyses demonstrated that it is a high duty cycle motor that associates strongly with actin in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP (9De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The processive nature and long step size reflect the intracellular function of the molecule as a cargo motor. The processivity is necessary to keep the cargo tethered to the actin filament, whereas the long step size matches the pseudo-repeat of the actin filament, allowing myosin V to “walk” across the top of, rather than rotate around, the actin filament, which would occur if the molecule took steps either longer or shorter than 36 nm. This behavior is in marked contrast to the myosin II molecules that power muscle contraction. These low duty ratio myosins are designed to make single transient interactions with actin and spend most of their kinetic cycle dissociated from actin (10Harris D.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14764-14768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Uyeda T.Q.P. Warrick H.M. Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1991; 352: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To test whether the long neck is essential for processive movement and how neck length affects the working stroke, we engineered recombinant heavy meromyosin (HMM)-like myosin V molecules with shorter or longer necks than that of wild type (WT) myosin V HMM by altering the number of IQ motifs. The effect of neck length on step size was measured in an optical trap, and the processivity was measured by directly observing the movements of single, fluorescently labeled molecules on actin using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The results strongly suggest that a neck containing more than two CaM subunits is necessary for efficient processive movement, and the step size is roughly proportional to the length of the neck.

The HMM-6IQ cDNA in baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 was used to subclone the IQ mutants using a PCR-based strategy. The arrangements of the IQ motifs in the final products are as depicted in Fig. 1. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced as described previously (12Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B.

Cell Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) MgATPase Assay—The MgATPase activity was measured using an NADH-coupled assay at 25 °C in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 0.15 mm EGTA, 40 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase, 200 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 200 μm NADH, and 1 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate. V max and KATPase, were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. In Vitro Motility Assays—The motility assay was performed and quantified as described previously in a motility buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 μm CaM, 25 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 45 μg/ml catalase, 2.5 mg/ml glucose, and 50 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C (12Wang F.

The TIRF assay was performed on an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped for objective type TIRF using a PlanApo (×60, numerical aperture 1.45) objective lens and a relay lens (PE5, ×5 or PE2.5, ×2.5; Olympus) connected to an image-intensified (KS1380; Videoscope) neuvicon camera (model C2400; Hamamatsu Photonics). Excitation light sources were an argon laser (488 nm, model 163-C0201; Spectra Physics) and a diode green laser (532 nm, model GCC-025-C; Crystal Laser). To prevent nonspecific binding of fluorescently labeled-protein, the coverslips (top, 18 × 18 mm and bottom, 24 × 50 mm) comprising the flow cell were prepared as follows. Coverslips were soaked in 5 n NaOH for 2 days, washed extensively with warm water, and placed into a sealed plastic box containing an open Eppendorf tube of acryloyl silanes (prepared by mixing 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy-silane (Sigma) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Pierce) in a 10:1 ratio) for 1 h at 50 °C. Unbound silane was removed by a brief rinse in 100% methanol. A solution of 2% acrylamide, 0.5% bisacrylamide, 0.1% cystamine, 0.1% ammonium persulfate, and 1% TEMED, was dropped onto the silane-coated coverslips, which were then inverted and placed on top of a 25 × 100-mm microscope slide with the wet surface adhering to the slide. After 45 min at 37 °C the coverslip and slide were separated with a razor, and unbound acrylamide and cystamine were washed away by filtered (0.45-μm pore diameter) deionized water (dH2O). Coverslips were then immersed in 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 15 min to reduce disulfide bonds in the cystamine and then washed with a gentle flow of filtered dH2O. Biotin-maleimide (2 mm) in 20 mm TES, pH 7.0, was dropped onto the acrylamide-coated coverslip and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Upper coverslips (18 × 18 mm) were treated the same as the bottom one except that no cystamine was used. The flow cell, 15 μl in volume, was prepared using double-sticky cellophane tape. For TIRF assays, 30 μl streptavidin (47 μg/ml) solution was applied to the flow cell, incubated for 4 min, and washed with motility assay buffer (1 ml). Biotin-labeled, rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled rabbit F-actin filaments (1 μm) were applied to the flow cell and incubated for 2 min. Unbound actin was washed off with 1 ml of motility assay buffer. Fluorescently labeled HMM in 100 μl of motility assay buffer containing 1 μm CaM was introduced into the flow cell, which was then mounted onto the microscope for imaging. Data were captured on a sVHS videotape, and the run length and the velocity of single fluorescently labeled myosin V HMM molecules were measured using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). Landing assays were performed in the motility assay buffer described above, except containing 2 mm ATP (5Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Ridf M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The sample was illuminated by laser at an angle less than the critical angle for TIRF to produce conditions in which higher concentrations of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled rabbit F-actin (21 μg/ml) could be used than with conventional epifluorescence illumination, yet actin filaments could be imaged farther away from the surface than when using conventional TIRF. Optical Trapping Conditions—The optical trapping apparatus, detection, and quantification of events and solution conditions were as described previously (8Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 59-65Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 14Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys.

In brief, a single actin filament was captured between two N-ethylmaleimide-myosin coated latex beads (1 μm diameter) held in two independent optical traps. The actin was positioned over a third surface-bound bead that was sparsely coated with HMM-IQ molecules. The surface density was adjusted by serial dilution of the HMM-IQ solutions such that only one in three beads gave binding events. Mechanical interactions were measured by monitoring the positions of the beads holding the actin filament using two photo-detectors (14Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Rotary shadowed images of HMM-IQ mutants were obtained as described previously (12Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Uber A. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Characterization of Expressed Myosin IQ Mutant—To examine the role of the myosin V neck in its ability to take long steps and move processively on actin, recombinant HMM-like fragments were engineered in which IQ motifs in the neck region of myosin V were deleted, added, or modified. The common structural elements of the myosin V IQ mutants are an N-terminal motor domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil region. The number of IQ motifs for each mutant varied according to Fig. 1. One mutant retained all IQ motifs but had two alanine residues inserted between the 3rd and 4th motifs (HMM-2Ala-6IQ). This mutation alters the regular 25/23 amino acid repeating pattern between adjacent IQ motifs common to all myosin V members and thus may alter the flexibility or orientation of the neck (Fig. 2a). The electrophoretic mobility of the HMM-IQ mutants varied in proportion to the number of IQ motifs (Fig. 2b). Rotary shadowed electron microscopic images of the molecules were consistent with the neck lengths, but no obvious differences were observed between the images of HMM-2Ala-6IQ and HMM-6IQ in terms of neck flexibility (Fig. 2c). ATPase Activity—The steady-state MgATPase at various actin concentrations was measured using an NADH-coupled assay to prevent ADP build up. The MgATPase activities of all HMM-IQ constructs were <0.02 s–1 in the absence of actin and were activated ∼750-fold by actin (Table I). The V max of myosin V S1–6IQ (15.3 s–1) was consistently higher than that of all HMM-IQ molecules (between 10 and 12 s–1 head–1). The KATPase of HMM-6IQ (WT), HMM-8IQ, and HMM-2Ala-6IQ were slightly lower than that of HMM-2IQ and HMM-4IQ, whereas that of myosin V S1–6IQ was much higher than those of the HMM constructs.Table IProperties of the expressed myosin V HMM-IQ moleculesMyosin V MutantsS1-6IQHMM-2IQHMM-4IQHMM-6IQHMM-8IQHMM-2Ala-6IQV max (s-1 per head)15.3 ± 4.310.8 ± 2.612.4 ± 1.99.7 ± 1.010.5 ± 1.610.2 ± 1.4KATPase (μM)3.6 ± 1.00.64 ± 0.170.88 ± 0.120.32 ± 0.090.37 ± 0.120.26 ± 0.10Actin sliding velocity (μm/s)0.20 ± 0.03aExperiments carried out at 40 mm KCl.0.29 ± 0.070.36 ± 0.080.38 ± 0.090.43 ± 0.120.31 ± 0.13a Experiments carried out at 40 mm KCl. Open table in a new tab Sliding Actin In Vitro Motility Assay—In vitro actin sliding assays under conditions where multiple HMM molecules can interact with actin showed that the velocity increased with increasing neck length for the HMM-2IQ, HMM-4IQ, HMM-6IQ, and HMM-8IQ (Table I). The velocity of HMM-2Ala-6IQ was intermediate between that of HMM-2IQ and HMM-4IQ. The velocity of S1 was slower than that of HMM-6IQ (Table I) (12Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer III, J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4329-4335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Optical Trapping—The mechanical properties of the HMM-IQ constructs undergoing single step interactions with actin were observed using a dual optical trapping apparatus (8Veigel C. Wang F. Bartoo M.L. Sellers J.R. Molloy J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 59-65Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The amplitudes of single displacement events of HMM-2IQ, HMM-4IQ, HMM-6IQ, and HMM-8IQ were proportional to neck length. The displacements for HMM-4IQ and HMM-6IQ were similar to those observed for S1–4IQ and S1–6IQ constructs (18Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), suggesting that they represent the working stroke produced by a single head. HMM-2Ala-6IQ gave a significantly shorter step size than expected from its neck length, which may be because of extra flexibility in the lever arm caused by the insertion of the two alanines (Fig. 3). The lifetimes of attachment (t 50) for all constructs were about 0.22 s at 5 μm ATP. Landing Assay—The actin landing rate, a measure of how many actin filaments land on the surface in a given period of time and move longer than 0.2 μm as the myosin surface density is decreased, distinguishes between processive motors requiring only a single myosin molecule to move actin filaments and nonprocessive ones requiring multiple myosins to translocate actin filaments (5Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Ridf M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The data of HMM-6IQ, HMM-4IQ, HMM-8IQ, and HMM-2Ala-6IQ were well fitted with n = 1 for the landing equation, consistent with these molecules being processive motors (Fig. 4). In contrast, the data for HMM-2IQ was fitted with an n = 2 suggesting that this molecule is not processive. Myosin V S1–6IQ and skeletal muscle HMM did not support movement at surface densities less than 3000 and 9000 molecules/μm2 and were fitted by n = 3 and n = 6, respectively (Fig. 4). At very low surface density (less than 20 molecules per μm2), HMM-4IQ, HMM-6IQ, HMM-8IQ, and HMM-2Ala-6IQ supported movement of landed actin filaments, but the moving filaments often pivoted about a single attachment point as described for intact myosin V and kinesin at low surfaces densities (5Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Ridf M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y.

Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). This behavior was not seen for HMM-2IQ and S1–6IQ. Single Molecule Motility Assay (TIRF Assay)—The endogenous CaMs of HMM-IQ mutants were partially exchanged for Alexa-488-labeled CaM, and single-fluorescently labeled HMM-IQ molecules were visualized using TIRF microscopy (6Sakamoto T. Amitani I. Yokota E. Ando T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The ratio between the fluorescence intensity and the HMM concentration in solution was used to determine the average number of fluorophores per HMM molecule, and the quantal photobleaching characteristics of the individual fluorescent molecules bound to the surface were then measured as a function of time (data not shown). The labeling ratio of all HMM-IQ constructs corresponded to the average number of photobleaching events observed in single spots in TIRF microscopy, suggesting that each fluorescent spot is a single HMM molecule. The average number of photobleaching events did not increase linearly with the number of IQ motifs of the HMM-IQ constructs (HMM-2IQ, 3.1 events; HMM-4IQ, 3.1; HMM-6IQ, 4.5; HMM-8IQ, 6.0; S1, 2), suggesting that not all CaMs exchange uniformly. Single HMM-6IQ molecules bound to and moved in a highly processive manner along actin filaments bound to the surface, often moving all the way to the end of the actin filament before detaching (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b plots the “full run frequency” defined as the probability that, upon attachment, an HMM molecule moves all the way to the end of the actin filament without detachment. The mean length of the actin filaments bound to the surface is 4.3 ± 2.5 μm. At 25 mm KCl and 2 mm ATP, the full run frequency for HMM-6IQ was about 80% (Fig. 5b). Under the same conditions, HMM-4IQ, HMM-8IQ, and HMM-2Ala-6IQ also moved highly processively with full run frequencies of more than 50%. In marked contrast, almost no HMM-2IQ molecules were able to move the entire remaining length of the actin filament under these conditions. When the ATP concentration in the assay was lowered, the full run frequency increased for all of the HMM-IQ molecules. At low ATP concentrations (1 μm and 10 μm) even HMM-2IQ exhibited a significant full run frequency. Another way to demonstrate the difference between the behaviors of HMM-2IQ and HMM-6IQ is to examine movement frequency, the number of molecules that attach and have detectable movement as opposed to merely attaching and detaching. At 25 mm KCl and 10 μm ATP, only 7% of the HMM-2IQ molecules that attached to actin moved, whereas 98% of the HMM-6IQ molecules that bound moved (Table II). At the same KCl concentration and 2 mm ATP, greater than 99% of the HMM-6IQ molecules that attached to actin moved, whereas in the same observation period no movement events were observed for HMM-2IQ. Fig. 5, c–h shows a distribution of the actual measured run lengths. This distribution will be blunted for a highly processive motor as its run length will be limited by the available length of the actin filament. The bar on the far left represents HMM molecules that attached but moved less than 200 nm. At 25 mm KCl, all of the HMM-IQ molecules except the HMM-2IQ exhibited long processive runs (>0.5 μm). The mean run length of HMM-6IQ (1.81 μm) was longer than that of HMM-4IQ (0.74 μm), HMM-8IQ (1.38 μm), and HMM-2Ala-6IQ (0.76 μm). HMM-2IQ exhibited some movements longer than 200 nm, but the frequency was low, and the length of the run was typically shorter (Fig. 5, a and c). At 100 mm KCl concentration very few processive movements were seen for HMM-4IQ (Fig. 5e), but HMM-6IQ and HMM-8IQ molecules still showed long processive run lengths (data not shown).Table IIPercentage of attached HMM-IQ molecules that movedMyosin V mutant10 μm ATP2 mm ATP%HMM-2IQ70HMM-6IQ9899 Open table in a new tab The velocity of single HMM-IQ mutants on actin filaments in the TIRF assay was roughly proportional to neck length at 10 μm ATP (Fig. 6). However at 2 mm ATP, single molecules of HMM-6IQ moved faster than any other mutant, including the HMM-8IQ. No movements of HMM-2IQ were observed under these conditions, and HMM-2Ala-6IQ moved slower than HMM-6IQ. Single myosin V S1–6IQ molecules could bind to actin filaments, but no movements were observed (Fig. 7). The attachment lifetime at 2 mm ATP (0.12 s) is shorter than that at 1 μm ATP concentration (0.52 s). The value at 2 mm ATP is consistent with the V max of the actin-activated Mg-ATPase and the expected dwell time (0.11 s) from Tanaka et al. (20Tanaka H. Homma K. Iwane A.H. Katayama E. Ikebe R. Saito J. Yanagida T. Ikebe M. Nature. 2002; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) if S1 is not a processive molecule. At 1 μm ATP the lifetime is longer as expected for a second order reaction at low substrate concentration. Myosin V molecules have six IQ motifs that are always separated by 25–23-25–23-25–23 amino acids, respectively. The extended neck allows the myosin V to take long steps that match the pseudo-repeat of the actin filament (5Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Ridf M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 7Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer III, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J.

In doing so, myosin V should keep its cargo positioned above the cytoskeleton while stepping from one actin filament crossover point to the next. To determine how the length of the neck affected the mechanical properties of the myosin and whether a long neck was a requirement for processive movement on actin filaments, we expressed myosin V HMM molecules that had two, four, six, or eight IQ motifs in the neck. Another contained all six IQ motifs, but altered the spacing between the 3rd and 4th IQ motifs by the insertion of two alanine residues. Mouse myosin V that has only CaM as light chains has advantages over similar experiments performed earlier with either myosin II molecules or chicken myosin V that have two types of lights chains bound to the IQ motifs (12Wang F.

We have subsequently discovered another change in the ybp1-1 allele; a “C” is inserted in the coding strand (see below). This insertion alters the third base of the codon for Pro-243, and the codon for Asp-244 is changed to a Stop codon (TGA). Importantly, this additional change does not affect the conclusions of the paper with regard to the role of Ybp1 in the regulation of Yap1 or that W303-1a contains a mutant allele of the YBP1 gene.

ROS are highly reactive and can damage many cellular components. Indeed, cells of the immune system make use of the damaging effects of ROS to eliminate invading pathogens such as fungi (for a review see Ref. 1Babior B.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 109: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Organisms have an array of proteins that protect against ROS-induced damage. For example, antioxidant proteins scavenge and inactivate ROS. However, if the level of ROS exceeds the antioxidant defenses then oxidative stress occurs, triggering a mechanism, called the oxidative stress response (OSR), that increases the production of antioxidant proteins to restore homeostasis. ROS have been linked with a wide range of diseases and hence the characterization of the mechanisms of the OSR has important implications for understanding disease processes in higher eukaryotes. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in studies of the regulation of the OSR (2Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The Yap1 and Skn7 transcription factors are required for the OSR to regulate the H2O2-induced expression of many antioxidant encoding genes. These include the TRX2, TRR1, and TSA1 genes (3Kuge S.

AP-l-like proteins contain a bZip structural motif consisting of a leucine-rich zipper region and an adjacent basic region that are important for dimerization and DNA binding, respectively. Yap1 is a member of a subfamily of AP-1-like transcription factors that also includes Cap1 from Candida albicans and Pap1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (8Toone W.M. Morgan B.A. Jones N.

Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, different oxidative stress agents appear to regulate Yap1 by different mechanisms. In particular, H2O2 and diamide (a free thiol oxidizing agent) cause oxidation of different cysteine residues in the CRDs of Yap1 (15Delaunay A. Isnard A.-D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 16Kuge S. Arita M. Murayama A. Maeta K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Nomoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6139-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, both H2O2 and diamide treatment result in the nuclear accumulation and activation of Yap1. Although the mechanism of regulation of Yap1 by diamide is unclear, Delaunay et al. (18Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a thiol peroxidase, Gpx3, forms a complex with Yap1 and is important for the H2O2-induced oxidation of the protein. Here, we have identified an open reading frame (ORF), YBR216c, which we have named YBP1 (Yap1-binding protein), that is important for the OSR in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ybp1 forms a stress-induced complex with Yap1 in vivo and influences the nuclear localization of Yap1 in response to H2O2 but not diamide. Yap1 oxidation is induced by H2O2 and is important for the regulation of the protein. Our data reveal that Ybp1 is required for the H2O2-induced oxidation of Yap1 and acts in the same pathway as Gpx3. Thus, Ybp1 represents a new class of redox regulator protein. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used were as follows: W303–1a (MATa ade2–1 trp1–1 can1–100 leu2–3,112 his3–11 ura3); W303–1a diploid (MATa/MATα ade2–1 trp1–1 can1–100 leu2–3,112 his3–11 ura3) (19Ross S.J.

Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The two independent ybp1Δ mutants, SR1 and SR2, were isolated by sporulation of a ybp1–1/ybp1Δ heterozygous W303–1a diploid where one copy of the ybp1–1 allele had been replaced with the HIS3 gene from YDp-H (21Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The YBP1 strain (SR6) was created by replacing the chromosomal ybp1::HIS3 in SR1 with the wild type YBP1 gene contained on a PCR fragment. The yap1Δybp1Δ haploids SR4 (yap1::URA3 ybp1::HIS3) and SR8 (yap1::TRP1 ybp1::HIS3) were from a cross between SR2 with either DWYU or yap1Δ, respectively. The yap1ΔYBP1 strain (SR5) was created by replacing the chromosomal ybp1::HIS3 in SR4 with the wild type YBP1 gene as described above. The yap1Δgpx3Δ strain SR7 (yap1::TRP1 gpx3::HIS3) was constructed by replacement of the GPX3 gene in the yap1Δ strain with the HIS3 gene from YDp-H (21Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The yap1Δybp1Δgpx3Δ strain SR9 (yap1::TRP1 ybp1::HIS3 gpx3::HIS3) was from a cross between SR7 and SR8. The YBP1 gpx3::HIS3 (SR10) and ybp1::HIS3 gpx3::HIS3 (SR14) strains were from a cross between SR6 and SR9. Yeast media has been described previously (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Growth was at 30 °C unless stated otherwise. H2O2 (Sigma) and tetra-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH; Sigma) were used at concentrations stated. For sensitivity tests 5 μl of serial 10-fold dilutions of mid-log cultures were spotted on to media containing various concentrations of H2O2, tBOOH, and diamide (Sigma) and plated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Yeast Techniques—Yeast cells were transformed using a lithium acetate method (23Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated from yeast cells by the method of Robzyk and Kassir (24Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Yeast genomic DNA was isolated as described by Hoffman and Winston (25Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—A 3.7-kb BamHI fragment, containing the YBP1 gene and promoter, was introduced into Yep24 (26Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene. 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), YCplac111, and YCplac22 (27Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) creating Yep24-YBP1, YCplac111-YBP1, and YCplac22-YBP1, respectively. To create YEplac181-YBP1 a 3.7-kb SacI/XbaI fragment from YCplac22-YBP1 was ligated with SacI/XbaI-digested YEplac181 (27Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). YEplac181-YBP1-Pk was constructed by first ligating a 240-bp PstI/BamHI PCR fragment containing the C terminus of Ybp1 into the pRep42PkC plasmid (28Craven R.A. Griffiths D.J. Sheldrick K.S. Randall R.E. Hagan I.M. Carr A.M. Gene. 1998; 221: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes to create pRep42-YBP1-PkC. YEplac181-YBP1-Pk was then obtained by ligating a 1.2-kb BglII/SacI fragment from pRep42-YBP1-PkC with BglII/SacI-digested YEplac181-YBP1. pBTM-YBP1 was constructed by ligating YBP1 into BamHI-digested pBTM116 (20Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The pGAD-Yap1 (1–650) plasmid was constructed by ligating YAP1 into EcoRI-digested pGAD-C1 (29James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pGAD-Yap1 (157–650), pGAD-Yap1 (379–650), and pGAD-Yap1 (460–650) appropriate PCR products were ligated into EcoRI-digested pGAD-C2 (29James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the YCplac111-YBP1-His6 plasmid a 1.3-kb SalI/XhoI fragment of YBP1 was first ligated with SalI/XhoI-digested pET-Hnef-PFH (30Zhao L.-J. Narayan O. Gene. 1993; 137: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Digestion of this plasmid with XhoI/HindIII released a fragment of YBP1 with in-frame FLAGHis6, which was then ligated with XhoI/HindIII-digested YCplac22-YBP1 to form YCplac22-YBP1-His6FLAG. Finally, a fragment of YCplac22-YBP1-His6FLAG, containing the full-length YBP1 gene with in-frame FLAGHis6, was ligated with KpnI/HindIII-digested YCplac111 (27Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) to generate YCplac111-YBP1-His6FLAG. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for PCR can be supplied upon request. The pRS-cp-GFP-YAP1 (11Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and pRS316-Yap1-Myc plasmids (15Delaunay A. Isnard A.-D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by S. Kuge and M. Toledano, respectively. RNA Analysis—RNA was extracted (31Aves S.J. Durkacz B.W. Carr A. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) from mid-log cells growing in SD media. RNA analyses were performed as described previously (32Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merrill G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The TRX2 cDNA was obtained by PCR using gene-specific oligonucleotides (4Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An ACT1 cDNA probe was used as a loading control (4Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Autoradiography of probed membranes was carried out using Fuji medical x-ray film (Super RX), and membranes were also analyzed using a phosphorimager (bio-imaging analyzer; Fuji film Bas-1500) and quantitated using Tina 2.0 software (Raytest). β-Galactosidase Assays—β–Galactosidase assays were performed (33Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) on cells grown to mid-log in SD media. Protein Interaction Studies—Crude protein extracts were prepared from ∼2 × 109 cells by lysing cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5g/100 ml Nonidet P-40, with 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 ml/100 ml aprotinin). For purification of His6FLAG-tagged Ybp1, crude extract was added to 30 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in the lysis buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 60 min, the beads and any coupled proteins were pelleted, washed with lysis buffer, and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The ability of Myc-tagged Yap1 protein to co-purify with His6FLAG-tagged Ybp1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (9E10; Sigma). Preparation of Cell Extracts for Monitoring Yap1 Oxidation—Cell extracts were prepared as described by Delaunay et al. (15Delaunay A. Isnard A.-D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Iodoacetamide-treated proteins were treated with alkaline phosphatase and then separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (9E10; Sigma) to detect the oxidized and reduced forms of Myc-tagged Yap1. Localization of GFP-tagged Yap1—Cells containing the GFP-Yap1 expression plasmid were concentrated into ∼25 μl of medium and 5 μl spotted on to a glass slide. This spot was mixed on the slide with 5 μl of 40 °C 1% (w/v) low melting temperature agarose (Invitrogen) containing an appropriate concentration of H2O2 or diamide to give the desired level of stress. A coverslip was placed on top, and GFP-tagged Yap1 was detected by exciting cells with 450–490 nm using a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope, with a ×40 oil immersion objective and an Axiovision digital imaging system. Localization of Pk-tagged Ybp1—Cells were prepared essentially as described by Kilmartin and Adams (34Kilmartin J.V. Adams A.E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 922-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) except that 5 mg/ml lyticase in 50% glycerol for 30 min at 30 °C was used. Anti-Pk primary antibodies (Serotec) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used. DAPI-stained nuclei and anti-Pk immunofluorescence were visualized by excitation at 365 nm (DAPI) and 450–490 nm (Alexa 488) using a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope, with a ×63 oil immersion lens and an Axiovision digital imaging system. Identification of a Novel Protein Involved in Peroxide Resistance—The deletion of the TSA1 gene, which encodes thioredoxin peroxidase, in the W303-1a strain reduces the H2O2-induced expression of the TRX2 promoter and increases peroxide sensitivity (19Ross S.J. Findlay V.J. Malakasi P. Morgan B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A high copy suppressor screen revealed a previously uncharacterized ORF, YBR216c (named YBP1 from here on), that increased the peroxide resistance of the tsa1Δ mutant and stimulated the H2O2-induced expression of the TRX2 gene in tsa1Δ cells (data not shown). These results suggest that Ybp1 functions downstream of Tsa1, or within a separate pathway, to protect cells against peroxide stress. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of Ybp1 did not reveal homology to identified domains or provide clues to the biochemical activity of the protein. Because the Yap1 and Skn7 transcription factors regulate peroxide-induced TRX2 gene expression (3Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 4Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) the effect of expression of YBP1 from the Yep24 vector on H2O2 and tBOOH resistance was examined in the W303–1a (YAP1 SKN7), yap1Δ, and skn7Δ strains. Yep24-YBP1 greatly increased the resistance of W303–1a cells to these peroxides (Fig. 1A) but was unable to restore tBOOH resistance to the yap1Δ and skn7Δ mutants (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the increased resistance associated with the presence of Yep24-YBP1 in W303–1a is dependent on Yap1 and Skn7 (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly, Yep24-YBP1 did not confer any increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide and, in fact, actually slightly increased the sensitivity of W303–1a (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that Ybp1 is a new protein involved in the peroxide-induced OSR but not the general response to oxidative stress. Ybp1 Regulates H 2 O 2 -induced Gene Expression—Several genes, including those encoding proteins of the thioredoxin system, are induced by H2O2 in a Yap1- and Skn7-dependent manner (3Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 4Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). RNA analysis of the W303–1a strain, either untreated or treated with H2O2, revealed that both the basal and H2O2-induced levels of TRX2 mRNA were increased in cells containing the high copy number plasmid, Yep24-YBP1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, Yep24-YBP1 had no significant effect on the basal or H2O2-induced levels of TRX2 mRNA in the yap1Δ mutant and barely increased levels in the skn7Δ mutant (Fig. 2A). The expression of YBP1 from a high copy number plasmid also increased the expression of a reporter, where the TRX2 promoter was fused to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, indicating that Ybp1 stimulates transcription from the TRX2 promoter (data not shown). To examine the role of Ybp1 in H2O2-induced expression of TRX2 RNA analysis was performed using a derivative of W303–1a where the YBP1 gene has been deleted. Less induction of TRX2 mRNA occurred after 20 and 40 min of H2O2 treatment in the ybp1Δ mutants (SR1 and SR2) compared with the isogenic W303–1a strain (Fig. 2B) revealing that Ybp1 is normally required for the response to H2O2. However, the induction of expression by H2O2 was greater than that seen in the yap1Δ or skn7Δ mutants (Fig. 2B). As expected, a low copy number (CEN) plasmid carrying the library-encoded YBP1 gene, expressed from its own promoter, rescued the H2O2-induced expression of TRX2 in the ybp1Δ strain (data not shown), confirming that Ybp1 is required for H2O2-induced TRX2 expression. To determine whether Ybp1 affects Yap1 activity the effect of expression of YBP1 from a high copy number plasmid (YEplac181-YBP1) on the expression of a Yap1-specific lacZ reporter (regulated by SV40-derived AP-1 binding sites) was examined (3Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Importantly, the presence of YEplac181-YBP1 stimulated H2O2-induced β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2C) and had no detectable effect on the expression of the SV40AP1-lacZ reporter in a yap1Δ mutant treated with H2O2 (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that Ybp1 is important for H2O2-induced gene expression and are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased peroxide resistance of W303–1a cells containing Yep24-YBP1 is attributed to increased Yap1-dependent antioxidant gene expression. Ybp1 Is Required for Resistance to Peroxide—The role of Ybp1 in peroxide resistance was examined. The growth rates of the ybp1Δ strain (SR1) containing either the low copy number (CEN) plasmid YCplac22 or YCplac22-YBP1 (carrying the library-encoded YBP1 gene expressed from its own promoter) were the same under non-stressed conditions (data not shown). However, in contrast, ybp1Δ cells containing vector took four-five times longer to start growing again following treatment with a non-lethal concentration of H2O2 than those containing YCplac22-YBP1 (Fig. 3A), although they recovered much more quickly than yap1Δ cells (data not shown). Surprisingly, the W303–1a strain containing vector recovered from H2O2 treatment much more slowly than the isogenic ybp1Δ strain containing YCplac22-YBP1 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, W303–1a was much more sensitive to peroxide in plate assays than the ybp1Δ mutant containing YCplac22-YBP1 (Fig. 3B) or a ybp1Δ mutant where the YBP1 gene from the library plasmid was integrated at the normal locus (Fig. 3C). Expression of YBP1 from a plasmid (see Fig. 1A and Fig. 3B) or from the normal genomic locus (Fig. 3C) did not increase the resistance to diamide but in fact resulted in increased sensitivity. These data suggest that the YBP1 gene in W303–1a and the Yep24 library are different. The sequence of the YBP1 gene from the Yep24 plasmid was found to be identical to the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the YBR216c ORF in the genome sequence. However, in contrast, the sequence of the YBP1 gene in W303–1a contains four amino acid substitutions; isoleucine at position 7 to leucine, phenylalanine at position 328 to valine, lysine at position 343 to glutamate, and asparagine at position 571 to aspartate (see Fig. 9).Fig. 9Alignment of Ybp1 family members. The primary amino acid sequences of Ybp1 (encoded by YBR216c), Ybp2 (encoded by YGL060w), and CaYbp1 (encoded by CA5230) were aligned using ClustalW (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). Dashes indicate single-residue gaps introduced to maximize the alignment. Amino acids conserved between Ybp1 and either Ybp2 or CaYbp1 are indicated; black boldface = identical, black type = highly similar, gray boldface = similar. Non-conserved amino acids are shown in gray type. * represents the amino acid substitutions I7L, F328V, K343E, and N571D encoded by the ybp1–1 allele of W303–1a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This analysis reveals that Ybp1 plays an important role in the normal cellular resistance to peroxide and that W303–1a contains an allele of the YBP1 gene, which we have named ybp1–1, that results in increased sensitivity to peroxide. In agreement with our data, a recent investigation of ∼600 gene deletion mutants demonstrated that a deletion of the YBR216c ORF inhibited growth in response to H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide (35Higgins V.J. Alic N. Thorpe G.W. Breitenbach M. Larsson V. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ybp1 Forms a Complex with Yap1—The relationship between Ybp1 and the Yap1/Skn7 pathway suggested that Ybp1 may form a complex with one or both of these proteins. Moreover, large scale studies of the yeast proteome have identified potential interactions between Yap1 and Ybp1 by two-hybrid (36Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2946) Google Scholar) and affinity precipitation (37Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M.

Hence, to further investigate the relationship between Ybp1 and Yap1/Skn7, the wild type YBP1 gene was fused in-frame with the DNA binding domain of the E. coli LexA protein (LexA:Ybp1) in plasmid pBTM-YBP1. This plasmid was introduced into the two-hybrid reporter strain CTY10–5d in conjunction with derivatives of the pGAD-C2 vector (29James P."

https://openalex.org/W2166781388,"Malignant transformation of cells causes disruption of cell-cell adhesion, enhancement of cell motility, and invasion into surrounding tissues. Nectins have both homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities and organize adherens junctions in cooperation with cadherins. We examined here whether Tage4, which was originally identified to be a gene overexpressed in colon carcinoma and has a domain structure similar to those of nectins, is involved in cell adhesion and/or migration. Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacted with nectin-3, but not homophilically with Tage4. Expression of Tage4 was markedly elevated in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic Ki-Ras (V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells) as compared with that of wild-type NIH3T3 cells. trans-Interaction of Tage4 with nectin-3 enhanced motility of V12Ras-NIH3T3 cells. Tage4 did not bind afadin, a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein that connects nectins to the actin cytoskeleton and cadherins through catenins. Thus, Tage4 heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3 and regulates cell migration. Tage4 is tentatively re-named here nectin-like molecule-5 (necl-5) on the basis of its function and domain structure similar to those of nectins."
https://openalex.org/W2078344962,"AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-like 15) is currently the only reported member of the plant MADS domain family of transcriptional regulators that preferentially accumulates during embryo development. Additionally, AGL15 is one of the more divergent members of the MADS domain family, including within the DNA-binding domain. Previous studies have shown that MADS domain proteins bind to DNA sequences with an overall consensus of CC(A/T)6GG (called a CArG motif). Nonetheless, different MADS domain proteins exhibit similar yet distinct binding site preferences that may be critical for differential gene regulation. To determine the consensus sequence preferentially bound by AGL15 in vitro, PCR-assisted binding site selection assays were performed. AGL15 was observed to prefer a CArG motif with a longer A/T-rich core and is to date the only plant MADS domain protein having such a preference. Next, the Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes containing AGL15 binding sites as candidates for direct regulation by AGL15. One gene, DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4), was identified by this method, and then confirmed as a direct target of AGL15 in vivo. AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-like 15) is currently the only reported member of the plant MADS domain family of transcriptional regulators that preferentially accumulates during embryo development. Additionally, AGL15 is one of the more divergent members of the MADS domain family, including within the DNA-binding domain. Previous studies have shown that MADS domain proteins bind to DNA sequences with an overall consensus of CC(A/T)6GG (called a CArG motif). Nonetheless, different MADS domain proteins exhibit similar yet distinct binding site preferences that may be critical for differential gene regulation. To determine the consensus sequence preferentially bound by AGL15 in vitro, PCR-assisted binding site selection assays were performed. AGL15 was observed to prefer a CArG motif with a longer A/T-rich core and is to date the only plant MADS domain protein having such a preference. Next, the Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes containing AGL15 binding sites as candidates for direct regulation by AGL15. One gene, DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4), was identified by this method, and then confirmed as a direct target of AGL15 in vivo. MADS domain proteins are a family of regulatory factors found in yeast, animals, and plants, containing a conserved ∼60-amino acid domain that mediates DNA binding and dimerization (for a review of the MADS domain, see Ref. 1Riechmann J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1079-1101PubMed Google Scholar). MADS domain proteins generally bind to a consensus DNA sequence called a CArG motif 1The abbreviations used are: CArG motif, C-(A/T)-rich G sequence; EMSA; electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; SRF, serum response factor. (CC(A/T)6GG; canonical sequence); however, more detailed studies revealed that different MADS factors have overlapping but distinct binding site preferences (reviewed in Ref. 2Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In plants, MADS box genes are expressed throughout the life cycle, and many members have been shown to be involved in homeotic regulation of programs in flower development (reviewed in Ref. 1Riechmann J.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1079-1101PubMed Google Scholar). MADS box genes are more numerous in plants (e.g. over 80 in Arabidopsis thaliana) (3Jack T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) than in organisms from other kingdoms. The reason for this greater diversity in plants is not clear, but it raises an important question concerning how these factors specifically regulate their downstream target genes. One possible mechanism to achieve such specificity is through differential binding to target genes. AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-like 15) is especially intriguing because it is currently the only reported MADS domain protein that preferentially accumulates in developing plant embryos (4Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AGL15 has been found in nuclei of tissue developing in an embryonic mode in a wide variety of situations (5Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Perry S.E. Lehti M.D. Fernandez D.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although AGL15 appears to be expressed at its highest level during plant embryo development, it is also expressed at lower levels after germination (7Fernandez D.E. Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Patterson S.E. Bleecker A.B. Fang S.-C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). AGL15 is also one of the more divergent members of the MADS domain family in terms of primary structure, including within the MADS domain (8Theissen G. Kim J.T. Saedler H. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 484-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 9Alvarez-Buylla E.R. Pelaz S. Lilegren S.J. Gould S.E. Burgeff C. Ditta G.S. de Pouplana L.R. Martinez-Castilla L. Yanofsky M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5328-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be particularly interesting to determine whether this relatively divergent member of the family preferentially binds DNA sequences distinct from the general CArG motif. In this study, the consensus binding sequence of AGL15 was determined using PCR-assisted in vitro binding site selection assay. AGL15 was found to prefer a type of CArG motif with a longer central A/T-rich sequence, similar to the N-10 site of the MEF2A binding consensus (10Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This preference is thus far unique for plant MADS domain proteins and may contribute to functional specificity of AGL15. To understand the regulatory roles AGL15 plays, it is important to have a comprehensive knowledge of the downstream target genes it regulates in vivo. The in vitro information obtained from the binding site experiments was applied to identify potential in vivo targets of AGL15. The Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes containing AGL15 binding sites. One such identified gene, DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4), was further tested to verify that it represents a direct in vivo target of AGL15. Such an approach may be useful for identifying downstream target genes of other DNA-binding regulatory proteins. PCR-assisted in Vitro Binding Site Selection—The approach for binding site selection was modified from Huang et al. (11Huang H. Mizukami Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA sequences encoding full-length AGL15, AGL15 lacking the DNA-binding MADS domain (AGL15ΔM), and AG were modified by PCR to add a T7 tag sequence to the C-terminal ends of the recombinant proteins, cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI), and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Expression and isolation of inclusion body proteins were performed as described previously (4Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The protein samples were further purified using anti-T7 antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity and integrity of the proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE and by Western analysis using anti-T7 antibodies (Novagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). To produce a pool of double-stranded degenerate oligonucleotides, a 76-mer template was synthesized containing a core of 26 randomized positions, hand-mixed during synthesis to ensure equal representation of each base (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA): ACTCGAGGAATTCGGTACCCCGGGTN26TGGATCCGGAGAGCTCCCAACGCGT. Two additional primers corresponding to the nondegenerate arms of the 76-mer were used to convert and amplify the 76-mer to double strand, using KlenTaq1 DNA polymerase (AB Peptide, St. Louis, MO). The double-stranded 76-mer population was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using PCR and purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× TBE), as described by Ausubel et al. (12Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 12.11.1-12.11.8Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), ∼100 ng of fulllength AGL15, AGL15ΔM, or AG was added to 1× binding buffer supplemented with 5% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. In the AG binding reaction, 1.2 m urea was included (11Huang H. Mizukami Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After preincubation at room temperature for 15 min, 104 to 105 cpm of 32P-labeled 76-mer probe was added. After a further 15 min at room temperature, the entire 20-μl binding reaction was resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (0.5× TBE, 5% glycerol) to separate free probe and protein-DNA complexes. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). The regions corresponding to shifted bands were excised, electroeluted in 0.1× TBE buffer, and precipitated. An aliquot was amplified and radiolabeled with PCR, gel-purified, and used as probe for the next round of binding and EMSA. This procedure was repeated for 3–5 rounds to enrich the oligonucleotides bound by AGL15 and AG. Analysis of Selected Sequences—The selected oligonucleotides were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To reveal the consensus binding sequences, both strands of the random core and part of the flanking linker region were aligned using ClustalW and Jalview programs (available on the World Wide Web at www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw), followed by manual inspection and adjustment. Competitive EMSA—Probes were labeled by PCR with [α-32P]dCTP as above. To ensure equal specific activity of the probes, the labeled to unlabeled dCTP ratio was adjusted for each PCR according to the base composition of the templates. Equal cpm (104 to 105) of probes were used in EMSA. Unlabeled competitor concentrations were verified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. EMSAs were performed under the same conditions as for binding site selection, except various amounts of unlabeled competitors were incubated with proteins for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of probes. Transient Reporter Expression Assay—Eight tandem repeats including a high affinity AGL15 binding site (TTACTATATATAGTAA) or a mutated binding site (TTAGTATATATACTAA) were placed before the minimal 35S CaMV promoter (TATA-box region) (13Campisi L. Yang Y.Z. Yi Y. Heilig E. Herman B. Cassista A.J. Allen D.W. Xiang H.J. Jack T. Plant J. 1999; 17: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and an introncontaining GUS (β-glucuronidase) reporter gene (14Vancanneyt G. Schmidt R. Oconnorsanchez A. Willmitzer L. Rochasosa M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs were cloned into the binary vector pBI101 (Clontech). The effector encoded an activated form of AGL15 containing a viral VP16 transcription activation domain (15Dalrymple M.A. McGeoch D.J. Davison A.J. Preston C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7865-7879Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) at the C-terminal end (constructed by Dr. H. Wang, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The AGL15-VP16 sequence was inserted downstream of the 35S CaMV promoter of the binary vector pBIMC (a gift from Dr. D. Falcone, University of Kentucky) for constitutive expression. All constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3850. The transient expression assay was performed using a petunia infiltration system (a formal detailed procedure will be reported by Drs. M. Schoenbeck and J. Chappell, University of Kentucky). Briefly outlined here, overnight agrobacteria cultures were washed once and resuspended to A 600 of 0.5 in 10% sucrose. Cells harboring reporter and effector constructs were mixed at various ratios. The mixture was infiltrated into the abaxial side of leaves of 4–6 week old Petunia hybrida plants grown under standard greenhouse conditions. The leaves were then left in a moist chamber at room temperature for 3–5 days. GUS activity was measured by 4-MUG assay (16Yang Y.N. Li R.G. Qi M. Plant J. 2000; 22: 543-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Hoefer DynaQuant 200 fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Enrichment Tests—To determine whether AGL15 binds in vivo to DNA sequences identified in vitro, enrichment assays were performed on populations of DNA fragments isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from an embryonic culture tissue using AGL15-specific antiserum. The AGL15 antiserum has been previously described and evaluated for specificity (4Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Perry S.E. Lehti M.D. Fernandez D.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Fernandez D.E. Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Patterson S.E. Bleecker A.B. Fang S.-C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The detailed ChIP protocol is described elsewhere (17Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Potential in vivo targets of AGL15 were identified by searching the data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org) with the preferred in vitro binding sites. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to amplify the target DNA fragments containing these sites, as well as the coding regions of β-2-tubulin (18Snustad D.P. Haas N.A. Kopczak S.D. Silflow C.D. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar), and elongation factor 1α (19Axelos M. Bardet C. Liboz T. Thai A.L.V. Curie C. Lescure B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) for controls. Both target and control primer pairs were used in multiplex PCR. A series of dilutions of total input chromatin DNA (before ChIP), AGL15-antiserum ChIP-selected DNA, and preimmune serum ChIP-selected DNA were used as templates. PCRs were resolved on 2% agarose gels. Expression Pattern of Target Gene—A. thaliana silique RNA was isolated using the hot borate method (20Wilkins T.A. Smart L.B. Krieg P.A. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 21-41Google Scholar). cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression level was determined semiquantitatively using PCR. The coding region of elongation factor 1α was amplified as a normalization control. Selection of AGL15 Binding Sites in Vitro—PCR-assisted in vitro binding site selection was used to isolate DNA sequences preferentially bound by AGL15 and AG from a random population of oligonucleotides. Binding site selection has previously been performed for AG (11Huang H. Mizukami Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Shiraishi H. Okada K. Shimura Y. Plant J. 1993; 4: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and served as a positive control in our experiments. AGL15 and AG proteins were isolated as inclusion bodies from E. coli and further purified via a C-terminal T7 tag. The integrity and purity of recombinant proteins were confirmed by Coomassie staining and Western analysis (not shown). Oligonucleotides bound by AGL15 or AG were separated from free DNA by EMSA and amplified by PCR. After 3–5 rounds of selection, shifted bands were clearly visible, indicating enrichment of AGL15 and AG binding sites (not shown). Binding site selection was also performed using a form of AGL15 that lacked the DNA-binding MADS domain (AGL15ΔM). This form of AGL15 does not bind to a CArG motif from the yeast STE6 promoter, whereas full-length AGL15 is able to bind to this site in EMSA (5Perry S.E. Nichols K.W. Fernandez D.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, AGL15ΔM served to monitor the background binding site selection. No DNA was recovered when AGL15ΔM was used (not shown). Selected binding site sequences were aligned and consensus sequences were calculated. Summaries of base preferences of AGL15 and AG at each position of the binding site are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Selected sequences were categorized into three groups, where the number refers to the length of the A/T-rich core: CC-6-GG represents a canonical CArG motif with the sequence 5′-CC-(A/T-rich)6-GG-3′; C-8-G contains a longer A/T-rich core (i.e. 5′-C-(A/T-rich)8-G-3′); and C-7-GG/CC-7-G is an intermediate form. The calculated consensus sequence from alignment indicated that the preferred binding site of AGL15 contained a longer A/T-rich core. In the AGL15-selected population, the canonical CC-6-GG motifs constituted less than 25% of the selected sites (Fig. 1C). The majority of the binding sites were of the C-8-G and C-7-GG/CC-7-G forms, with the former predominating. The opposite trend was observed in the AG-selected population. The preferred AG binding sites had the canonical form, as previously reported (11Huang H. Mizukami Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Shiraishi H. Okada K. Shimura Y. Plant J. 1993; 4: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The preference of AGL15 for a C-8-G type of CArG motif is unique among plant MADS domain protein binding site sequences reported thus far (11Huang H. Mizukami Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Shiraishi H. Okada K. Shimura Y. Plant J. 1993; 4: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Huang H. Tudor M. Su T. Zhang Y. Hu Y. Ma H. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 81-94PubMed Google Scholar, 23West A.G. Causier B.E. Davies B. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5277-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Even among MADS domain proteins from different kingdoms, only MEF2A has similar binding site preference (10Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). AGL15 Has Higher Affinity for CArG Motifs with a Longer A/T-rich Core—To test whether AGL15 binds to the C-8-G CArG motif with higher affinity, several individual CArG sequences were selected from the populations for EMSAs. CArG1 and CArG2 were AG-selected CC-6-GG type motifs. CArG3 was a C-8-G type CArG repeatedly selected by AGL15. A representative EMSA is shown in Fig. 2A. For AG, all three individual CArGs had similar binding affinity. This was not an artifact of probe or protein saturation, because the same pattern was observed over a wide range of probe/protein ratios (not shown). AGL15, however, showed clear differential affinity among the three CArGs. CArG3, containing the longer A/T core, showed a strong interaction with AGL15 in EMSA, whereas binding to CArG1 and CArG2 (CC-6-GG type) was considerably weaker. Reciprocal competition assays were used to confirm the preference of AGL15 for the C-8-G CArG motif. Unlabeled CArG sequences were used as competitors against themselves and each other. For AGL15, CArG3 was a much stronger competitor than CArG1 or CArG2 (Fig. 2B). When CArG3 was used as the radiolabeled probe, unlabeled CArG3 could effectively compete with the probe (Fig. 2B , lanes 2–4). In the presence of a 750-fold excess of CArG3 competitor, shifted bands were virtually undetectable (not shown). In contrast, unlabeled CArG1 or CArG2 competitors had little effect in the competition with radiolabeled CArG3 probe, even at a much higher competitor excess (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5–7 and lanes 8–10 with lanes 2–4; note the difference in -fold level of unlabeled competitor). When CArG1 or CArG2 was used as radiolabeled probe, unlabeled CArG3 also competed better (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 15–17 with lanes 12–14, and compare lanes 22–24 with lanes 19–21). Taken together, these data suggest that for AGL15, a C-8-G type CArG3 with a longer A/T core was a much stronger competitor than CC-6-GG type CArGs, and, therefore, AGL15 had higher binding affinity to this form of CArG sequence. Competitive EMSAs revealed a lack of preference of AG for any particular form of CArG motif, although CC-6-GG type CArG motifs competed slightly better than the C-8-G motif (Fig. 2C). Identifying in Vivo Targets of AGL15—PCR-assisted binding site selection assay identified an array of DNA sequences that AGL15 could bind under in vitro conditions and revealed a preference for binding to an unusual C-8-G type CArG motif. Although the situation in vivo is likely to be very different, correlations have been reported between in vitro binding affinity and functional in vivo binding (24Carr A. Biggin M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the context of the chromatin environment, with the presence of interacting proteins, it is very likely that AGL15 binds DNA sequences that it is unable to bind in vitro (17Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), just as the animal MADS domain protein SRF binds sites in vivo that it is unable to bind in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 2Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Conversely, due to chromatin structure, it is also likely that DNA sequences that correspond to preferred sites in vitro are not bound in vivo (17Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Wyrick J.J. Young R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to test whether the information obtained through a strictly in vitro study could be used to identify in vivo targets of AGL15. Among all of the selected AGL15 binding sites, one particular sequence (TTACTATATATAGTAA) was especially intriguing. AGL15 showed high affinity for oligonucleotides containing this perfect 16-bp palindromic sequence (e.g. CArG3 in Fig. 2B). More interestingly, this CArG motif was highly represented in the AGL15-selected populations. About 30% (12 of 44) of the oligonucleotides after three rounds of selection contained this site. The percentage rose to 50% after the fourth round of selection and almost 100% after the fifth round (not shown). In addition, the consensus derived from alignment of nonredundant binding sites selected by AGL15 matched this particular motif (Fig. 1A). Does AGL15 bind to this type of CArG motif in vivo? To address this question, this site was first assessed for function in vivo using a transient reporter assay. Eight tandem repeats containing this site were placed in front of a minimal 35S CaMV promoter (TATA-box), which in turn drives the expression of a GUS reporter gene. As a control, a similar construct containing tandem repeats of a mutated version of the binding site (TTAGTATATATACTAA) was also prepared. AGL15 cannot bind to this mutated sequence in vitro, as tested by EMSA (not shown). The effector, an activated form of AGL15 that contains a viral VP16 transactivation domain at the C-terminal end, was placed under the control of a strong CaMV 35S promoter for constitutive expression (Fig. 3A). Cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the reporter constructs and the effector construct were mixed and co-infiltrated into the abaxial side of P. hybrida leaves. GUS activity was measured 3–5 days later. As shown in Fig. 3B, when both the 8XCArG::GUS and AGL15-VP16 were present, the GUS reporter was highly expressed. GUS activity measured 1000-fold higher than controls transformed with only the reporter or effector constructs. However, when the mutated CArG was used, virtually no GUS activity was detected, similar to the background levels detected with the reporter or effector alone. Reporter and effector cultures were mixed at several different ratios (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1), and the number of tandem repeats in the reporter constructs was varied (4× and 8×). GUS activity was also confirmed qualitatively by histochemical staining with X-Gluc. In all cases, the same trend was observed (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Therefore, this type of CArG motif sequence can function as an in vivo binding site for AGL15. The A. thaliana genome sequence data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org) was searched to identify genes containing the sequence TTACTATATATAGTAA. Only one exact 16-bp match was found, and it lies within the single intron of a gene that encodes an unknown protein (GenBank™ accession number NM_106625). This gene is referred to as DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4). Although transient reporter expression assay showed that AGL15 could bind to this DNA sequence in vivo, the question remains whether this naturally occurring site in the chromatin context was also associated with AGL15. To test this, enrichment tests in conjunction with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were preformed. ChIP isolates in vivo AGL15-DNA complexes and has been shown to be an effective approach to select direct downstream targets of AGL15 (17Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For the enrichment tests, primers were designed to amplify the genomic DNA region containing the potential AGL15 binding site within DTA4 as well as primers to amplify coding regions of various genes that are not expected to be bound by AGL15 as controls. Multiplex PCR was performed using both target and control primer pairs on ChIP-selected DNA populations (Fig. 4, ChIP) from embryonic culture tissue as well as DNA populations selected with preimmune serum (PI-ChIP) and nonselected input DNA (Input). Enrichment is defined as a greater abundance of target amplification product with ChIP DNA compared with that of input DNA (before ChIP) or PI-ChIP DNA, using the control amplification product as a reference. An in vivo AGL15-bound DNA fragment should be represented at higher abundance in the population after ChIP selection than in total DNA (i.e. it is enriched by ChIP). A representative gel image of an enrichment test is shown in Fig. 4. Input chromatin DNA was diluted so that the β-2-tubulin control was amplified to a comparable amount as in the ChIP and PI-ChIP populations. The intensity of the DTA4 band in ChIP was significantly stronger than observed in input or PI-ChIP, indicating strong enrichment of the DTA4 fragment by ChIP. Reproducible results were obtained from enrichment assays performed on several independently isolated ChIP populations. The DTA4 fragment was also not enriched in control ChIP experiments using immune serum depleted for anti-AGL15 IgGs, or in ChIP populations from wild type flower buds that accumulate many members of the MADS domain family but lack detectable amounts of AGL15 (not shown). Therefore, the binding site identified within DTA4 is associated with AGL15 in vivo. Does in vivo binding by AGL15 result in a change in expression of DTA4? Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed to determine whether DTA4 expression level was responsive to the level of AGL15 accumulation. Transgenic A. thaliana with a p35S::AGL15 transgene has a somewhat higher AGL15 level than wild type in developing siliques (7Fernandez D.E. Heck G.R. Perry S.E. Patterson S.E. Bleecker A.B. Fang S.-C. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 183-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from wild type and transgenic plant siliques at the same developmental stages. As shown in Fig. 5, expression of DTA4 was increased in the p35S::AGL15 siliques, where there is an elevated level of AGL15 at all developmental stages examined (5–6, 9–10, and 11–12 days after flowering). Many DNA-binding regulatory factors are members of large families, generally grouped by homology to a DNA-binding domain. Members of these families often recognize similar or identical DNA sequences. Although cross-regulation could be involved in extending the developmental roles of a transcription factor, discrimination is likely to be an important aspect to execute specific developmental programs. How do individual members achieve different developmental consequences? It is possible that there is discrimination in binding sites, leading to differential gene regulation. Or perhaps binding site recognition overlaps extensively, and different developmental programs are realized through other mechanisms such as interactions with other proteins or chromatin architecture. Most likely, all of these mechanisms contribute to functional specificity. The problem of functional specificity is especially obvious for plant MADS domain proteins, which number over 80 in A. thaliana, and play diverse, critical roles in develop"
https://openalex.org/W2014234851,"Patient studies suggest that speech and environmental sounds are differentially processed by the left and right hemispheres. Here, using functional imaging in normal subjects, we compared semantic processing of spoken words to equivalent processing of environmental sounds, after controlling for low-level perceptual differences. Words enhanced activation in left anterior and posterior superior temporal regions, while environmental sounds enhanced activation in a right posterior superior temporal region. This left/right dissociation was unchanged by different attentional/working memory contexts, but it was specific to tasks requiring semantic analysis. While semantic processing involves widely distributed networks in both hemispheres, our results support the hypothesis of a dual access route specific for verbal and nonverbal material, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2104998210,"ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels activate under metabolic stress to protect neurons and cardiac myocytes. However, excessive channel activation may cause arrhythmia in the heart and silence neurons in the brain. Here, we report that PKC-mediated downregulation of K(ATP) channel number, via dynamin-dependent channel internalization, can act as a brake mechanism to control K(ATP) activation. A dileucine motif in the pore-lining Kir6.2 subunit of K(ATP), but not the site of PKC phosphorylation for channel activation, is essential for PKC downregulation. Whereas K(ATP) activation results in a rapid shortening of the action potential duration (APD) in metabolically inhibited ventricular myocytes, adenosine receptor stimulation and consequent PKC-mediated K(ATP) channel internalization can act as a brake to lessen this APD shortening. Likewise, in hippocampal CA1 neurons under metabolic stress, PKC-mediated, dynamin-dependent K(ATP) channel internalization can also act as a brake to dampen the rapid decline of excitability due to K(ATP) activation."

Only 45% of the polypeptide chain is found ordered in the crystal. The MazE monomer consisting of two β-hairpins connected by a short α-helix has no hydrophobic core on its own and represents only one half of a typical protein domain. A complete domain structure is formed by the association of two chains, creating a hydrophobic core between two four-stranded β-sheets. This hydrophobic core consists exclusively of short aliphatic residues. The folded part of MazE contains a novel DNA binding motif. A model for DNA binding that is consistent with the available biochemical data is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1992980803,"The expression of cutaneous fatty acid-binding protein (C-FABP) in prostate tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. Among the 76 cases, all seven (100%) normal tissues were unstained. Of the 35 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 25 (71.4%) specimens were unstained and 10 (28.6%) were stained positively. For the 34 prostatic carcinomas, the C-FABP expression was remarkably increased: 25 (73.5%) samples stained positively, and only nine (26.5%) were unstained. Transfection of a vector expressing an antisense C-FABP transcript into the PC-3M prostatic cancer cells yielded two transfectant lines: PC-3M-CFABP-1 and PC-3M-CFABP-3, producing, respectively, a 3.8- and a 6.9-fold reduction in C-FABP levels. Comparing with the control transfectants, the in vitro invasiveness of both PC-3M-CFABP-1 and PC-3M-CFABP-3 was significantly reduced. When tested in nude mouse, the average size of tumours produced by PC-3M-CFABP-1 and by PC-3M-CFABP-3 was reduced by 2.9- and 4.2-fold respectively, in comparison with that of tumours produced by the control transfectants. Analysis showed that the decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel densities in the tumours were associated with the reduced C-FABP. These data show that C-FABP is increased in prostatic carcinoma cells and suppression of its expression can significantly inhibit the tumorigenicity, probably by reducing the expression of VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2089804952,"Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) expression ca-uses deregulation of contact inhibition of cell growth, which might be one of the bases of the tumor suppressor function of VHL. Here we show that this function of the VHL gene product (pVHL) depends on cell autonomous events. To identify the target gene of pVHL, which is directly involved in the contact inhibition, we compared the gene expression profile between VHL-deficient renal carcinoma 786-O cells and those infected with an adenovirus vector encoding VHL. In addition to known pVHL-regulated genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and carbonic anhydrase, we found cyclinD1 as a new target of pVHL at a high cell density. In VHL-expressing cells (VHL (+) cells), the cyclinD1 mRNA expression level diminishes at a high cell density, while it remains at a relatively high level in VHL-deficient cells (VHL (-) cells). The cyclinD1 expression level was also abnormally high in VHL (-) cells at a high cell density. Consequently, the phosporylation level of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein remained high in these cells, whereas there was no phosporylated Rb in VHL (+) cells under the contact inhibition. The abnormal expression of cyclinD1 at a high cell density was observed even in VHL (+) cells under the hypoxic state. Moreover, ectopic expression of a HIF mutant resistant to pVHL-mediated proteolysis causes the abnormal cyclinD1 expression in VHL (+) cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that VHL is required for the downregulation of cyclinD1 at a high cell density through HIF."
https://openalex.org/W2048049150,"In mammals, imprinted genes have parent-of-origin-specific patterns of DNA methylation that cause allele-specific expression. At Rasgrf1 (encoding RAS protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1), a repeated DNA element is needed to establish methylation and expression of the active paternal allele. At Igf2r (encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor), a sequence called region 2 is needed for methylation of the active maternal allele. Here we show that replacing the Rasgrf1 repeats on the paternal allele with region 2 allows both methylation and expression of the paternal copy of Rasgrf1, indicating that sequences that control methylation can function ectopically. Paternal transmission of the mutated allele also induced methylation and expression in trans of the normally unmethylated and silent wild-type maternal allele. Once activated, the wild-type maternal Rasgrf1 allele maintained its activated state in the next generation independently of the paternal allele. These results recapitulate in mice several features in common with paramutation described in plants."

Microtubule dynamics are an intrinsic property of the polymer of tubulin and are highly regulated by the balance of the activity of different factors throughout the cell cycle (10Hyman A.A.

At each stage of mitosis or meiosis, dyneins and various KRPs interact with microtubules in order to ensure centrosome separation, spindle formation and maintenance, chromosome congression, and cytokinesis completion (15Hirokawa N.

However, whereas it is well established that the p34cdc2 kinase is centrally involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis (20Verde F. Labbe J.C. Doree M. Karsenti E. Nature. 1990; 343: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), only a few Cdc2 substrates with plausible involvement in the control of microtubule dynamics have been identified so far. The p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylates the ubiquitous microtubule-associated protein 4 during M phase (21Ookata K. Hisanaga S. Sugita M. Okuyama A. Murofushi H. Kitazawa H. Chari S. Bulinski J.C. Kishimoto T.

There is evidence that the phosphorylation of the microtubule destabilizing protein Stathmin/Op18 by p34cdc2 is important for mitotic progression (23Melander Gradin H. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Similar phosphorylation of the mitotic KRP Eg5 is required for Eg5-dependent centrosome migration and bipolar spindle formation in vivo (17Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Herin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mitotic kinases regulate microtubule dynamics and organization by phosphorylating various microtubule-interacting proteins, and this has been an incentive for the systematic search of mitotic phosphoproteins. We have recently identified a subset of M phase phosphoproteins by expression library screening using the MPM2 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a phosphoepitope present on a set of 40–50 proteins that become phosphorylated at the G2/M transition (1Matsumoto-Taniura N.

Among the 11 proteins identified, we show here that M phase phosphoprotein 1 (MPP1) has extensive homology with proteins of the kinesin superfamily. We demonstrate that MPP1 is a plus-end-directed molecular motor with an important role in cytokinesis. Cloning and Sequencing of Full-length Human MPP1 cDNA— Human MPP1 cDNAs were obtained by screening two λzapII cDNA libraries made from HeLa, one a generous gift from P. Chambon and the other a Uni-ZAP XR library from Stratagene, following standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Starting with the 645-bp N-terminal fragment of the previously described partial-length MPP1 cDNA 6-1 (24Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) as a probe, the human MPP1 cDNA, 1L9 (4265 bp), was isolated. The overlapping MPP1 cDNA, 1C12 (2822 bp) was obtained by a second round of screening using an N-terminal fragment of pBS-1L9. Full-length MPP1 plasmid, pBS-MPP1, was obtained by subcloning the 2408-bp N-terminal fragment of the pBS-1C12 in pBS-1L9. The HsMPP1 sequences are available under accession numbers AY282406, AY282407. Sequencing was performed by the Genome Express Company (Grenoble, France). The sequences were analyzed, and data base searches were performed with the GCG, FASTA, and BLAST programs available at NCBI or INFO-BIOGEN resources. Specific motifs were searched using PESTFIND, COIL, PredictNLS, and pSORT programs. FLAG Epitope Tagging of MPP1 by Mutagenesis—The MPP1 coding sequence starting at base 70 was tagged using a mutagenesis technique based on the M13-phage single-stranded DNA protocol (Amersham Sculptor Kit). 1C12 single-stranded DNA was obtained using standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 66-mer oligonucleotide was designed that introduced, between bases 69 and 70, 36 bp containing a NotI restriction site and encoding MDYKDDDDK amino acids, which correspond to the FLAG epitope upstream of the cleavage sequence of enterokinase. After sequencing of the 5′-end of a selected clone, the 3′-end fragment NsiI-BamHI (2484 bp) was replaced by the similar fragment obtained from the original 1C12 to ensure that no other mutations were introduced in plasmid pBS-m1C12. Orientation of the mutated N-terminal EcoRI fragment (484 bp) was inverted in the pBluescript vector, and the 5145-bp NsiI fragment of pBS-MPP1 was subcloned into this plasmid to construct pBS-mMPP1, which encoded full-length MPP1 tagged with the FLAG epitope. Expression and Purification of Recombinant MPP1 Mutants in Insect Cells—A recombinant full-length MPP1 (rMPP1) and a truncated form (rMC1), both tagged with an N-terminal FLAG epitope, were produced by baculovirus expression following the manufacturer's instructions of the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). The mutated NotI-KpnI fragment of pBS-mMPP1 and the NotI-XhoI of pBS-m1C12 were respectively subcloned into the pFastBac HTb vector in phase with its His6 coding sequence to generate doubly tagged recombinant viruses in Sf9 cells. Recombinant proteins were then expressed in High-Five cells, a generous gift of Dr. B. Goud. Cells were harvested at 48 h after viral infection at a multiplicity of infection of 2, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100, in the presence of Complete™ inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C and loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2-agarose column (Sigma). After washing, the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 3.5 m MgCl2 and buffer-exchanged on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl. For biochemical studies, the His6 tag, which induces protein precipitation, was removed by cleavage with the TEV protease as described in the technical information (Invitrogen). The rMPP1 and rMC1 proteins were then concentrated on Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp.). The final fractions were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For gliding assays, the proteins were complemented with 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml casein and frozen without concentration. Protein concentration was determined colorimetrically using bovine serum albumin as a standard and Bio-Rad protein assay. Anti-MPP1 Antibody Production and Purification—A polyclonal anti-MPP1 antibody was raised by Eurogentec using four injections of 100 μg of His6-rMPP1 proteins in a rabbit. The antibody was affinity-purified by three-step positive-negative affinity purification. The antiserum was filtered through His6-FLAG-unrelated protein and His6-rMC1 affinity columns in order to remove any antibodies reacting with tags and conserved motifs present in the MPP1 motor domain. Specific anti-MPP1 antibody, which recognizes epitopes present in the C2 to tail domains, was then purified by passage of the filtrate onto a His6-rMPP1 affinity column. Purified anti-MPP1 antibody was eluted with 50 mm Tris, 3.5 m MgCl2, pH 7.5, dialyzed overnight against PBS, and stored at 4 °C. Fluorescent Microtubule Spindown Assay—Purification of bovine brain tubulin (28Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), polymerization, and purification on a glycerol cushion of taxol-stabilized microtubules (MTs) were performed using standard procedures. MT concentration (i.e. concentration of tubulin dimer in MT polymer) was determined according to Desai et al. (29Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Recombinant MPP1 proteins, routinely 0.1 μm, were cleared by ultracentrifugation and mixed with taxol-MTs (1 μm) in 100 μl of BRB80 buffer supplemented with 10 μm taxol. After incubation for 15 min at 25 °C, reaction was fixed with 1 ml of fixative buffer (100 mm Mes, pH 6.75, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 plus 50% sucrose and 1% glutaraldehyde). MTs were diluted and sedimented through a glycerol cushion onto coverslips as described in Ref. 30Pirollet F. Job D. Margolis R.L. Garel J.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3247-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Coverslips were postfixed in –20 °C methanol for 6 min and washed three times for 10 min in PBS containing 0.1% NaBH4 to prevent glutaraldehyde autofluorescence. MTs and recombinant proteins were stained with rabbit anti-Glu and Δ2-tubulin antibodies (1:1000; a generous gift of Dr. D. Job (31Paturle-Lafanechère L. Manier M. Trigault N. Pirollet F. Mazarguil H. Job D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1529-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and a mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:500; Sigma). Fluorescent labeling was performed with Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit (1:4000) and TRITC-labeled anti-mouse (1:1000) IgG antibodies from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and Jackson. Measurement of Steady State ATPase Rates—Steady-state MT-activated ATPase rates were measured using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-linked assay, mainly as described in Ref. 32Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, ATPase activities were assayed at 30 °C in a 1-ml reaction volume of 100 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phosphoenol-pyruvate, 0.3 mm NADH, 40 units of pyruvate kinase, and 55 units of lactate dehydrogenase. NADH oxidation was followed at 340 nm in a temperature-controlled UVIKON 923 spectrophotometer. Rates were determined during the linear phase after 5 min for attainment of steady state, using ϵ-NADH = 6220 m–1·cm–1. The kinetic parameters k cat, K MT (the concentration of MTs required for half-maximal activation), and K m for ATP were obtained by least squares fitting the MT activation or ATP dependent data to rectangular hyperbolae using Sigmaplot. Motility Assay with Polarity-marked Microtubules—A standard motility assay (33Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9106-9111Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was performed with recombinant MPP1 proteins using the fluorescence-based kinesin motility kit from Cytoskeleton. Polarity-marked MTs with a bright seed and a dim elongated segment at their plus-end were prepared by inclusion of N-ethylmaleimide-treated tubulin, according to previously described protocols (see the “Methods” page at the kinesin Web site at www.proweb.org/kinesin). Briefly, acid-washed flow cells were coated with motor protein (typically 0.15 and 0.3 μm for rMPP1 and rMC1, respectively) in motility assay buffer (BRB80 buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml casein, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm taxol, and an oxygen scavenging mix). After 5 min at room temperature, nonadsorbed motor was washed out with two flow cell volumes of motility assay buffer. Asymmetrically labeled MTs (0.2 μm) were then flowed through the cell and allowed to interact with the motor for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, unbound MTs were washed out with two flow cell volumes of motility assay buffer. Video images of MTs were acquired in a thermostated room with a Princeton CCD Micromax RTE 1317K1 camera on a Zeiss Axioscop with a 100 × 1.3 numerical aperture Plan-Neofluar lens using IPLab software (Ropper Scientific). Measurement of MT velocities was performed using the RETRAC program (available on the World Wide Web at mc11.mcri.ac.uk). Preparation of a GFP-fused Mutant of MPP1—The bp 70–981 portion of MPP1 cDNA was amplified by recombinant PCR using the TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen). This fragment was cloned into the XhoI site of pEGFP-C2 eukaryotic expression vector (Clontech), using an XhoI restriction site introduced upstream of the initiation codon. The pEGFP-sM plasmid obtained encodes the GFP protein fused to the N terminus region of MPP1 extending from aa 1 to 304. The C-terminal HindIII-KpnI fragment of pBS-MPP1 was subcloned into this plasmid to construct pEGFP-MPP1-FL, which encodes the full-length fusion protein GFP-MPP1. Cell Culture and Cloning—HeLa and HCT116 cells, a generous gift from Dr. R. L. Margolis, were grown in RPMI 1640 and McCoy medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-MPP1-FL plasmid using the FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable clones expressing the GFP-MPP1 fusion protein were then isolated, by using the limited dilution method in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. In some instances, cells were analyzed by treatment with 250 nm trichostatin A overnight to increase expression (34Condreay J.P. Witherspoon S.M. Clay W.C. Kost T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). SiRNA Preparation and Transfection—MPP1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were designed according to Harborth et al. (35Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of the type AA(N19)UU (where N represents any nucleotide) were searched in the open reading frame of MPP1-mRNA and submitted to a BLAST search to ensure their specificity. Selected 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotides targeting MPP1 from positions 424–446 (siRNA1) or 4782–4804 (siRNA2) relative to the start codon were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) in deprotected and desalted form. As nonspecific siRNA controls, we used an unrelated sequence that failed to target p160ROCK mRNA (siRNAU) (36Chevrier V. Piel M. Collomb N. Saoudi Y. Frank R. Paintrand M. Narumiya S. Bornens M.

Annealing and transfection was performed as previously described (37Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were transfected with siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Mock transfections were also performed using control buffer instead of oligonucleotides. At different time points after transfection, cells were harvested and either fixed and processed for FACS analysis or analyzed by Western blot after the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Time-lapse imaging was also performed. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Exponentially growing cells were plated on glass coverslips and incubated for 24–36 h. Cells were fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 8 min and processed with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies used were purified anti-MPP1 IgGs (5 μg/ml, this study), a mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin 2-3 B11 (1:5000; a generous gift of Drs. A. Giraudel and L. Lafanechère), 2A. Giraudel and L. Lafanechère, unpublished results. or mouse monoclonal anti-mitosin 14C10 (1 μg/ml, from GeneTex). Suitable Cy3-conjugated (Jackson; 1:1000) or Alexa 488-conjugated (Molecular Probes; 1:500) antibodies were applied as secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml) or Topro 3 (1:1500; Molecular Probes). The coverslips were examined on a Zeiss microscope by using a 100 × 1.4 oil immersion objective. Confocal images were obtained on a TCS-SP2 Leica laser-scanning microscope. Z series were collected, and displayed images correspond to projections of optical sections (0.2 μm thick), the number of which varied in relation to the cell depth. Flow Cytometric Analysis—For standard analysis of DNA content, cells were washed once with PBS, trypsinized, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. DNA was stained overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml Hoechst. Cells were sorted on a FACS Star Plus cytometer (BD Biosciences). After collection of 20,000 events, results were analyzed with CellQuest software, and aggregated cells were gated out. For double staining of DNA and specific antigen, cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Labeling of MPP1 or mitosin was performed before the DNA counterstaining step by incubation with anti-MPP1 or anti-mitosin antibodies followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs (1:500; Molecular Probes). Time Lapse Imaging—For phase-contrast imaging, control or MPP1 siRNA-transfected cells were trypsinized 6 h after transfection and transferred into a multiple well chamber of a polydimethyl siloxane gel fixed on a glass chamber coated with collagen and fibronectin. Sequential phase-contrast images of the various samples were recorded on a Leica DMIRBE microscope controlled by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) for 66 h. The microscope was equipped with an open chamber equilibrated in 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C, and images were taken with a × 20 objective using a cooled MicroMax 1-MHz CCD camera (Roper Scientific). For GFP-MPP1 imaging during mitosis, stably transfected cells were plated on coated coverslips and maintained at 37 °C in sealed chambers containing complete phenol red-free RPMI medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes. Rounded cells were searched and time lapse Z-sequences were collected as described by Savino et al. (38Savino T.M. Gebrane-Younes J. De Mey J. Sibarita J.B. HernandezVerdun D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) on a Leica DMIRBE microscope controlled by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). This microscope was equipped with a piezoelectric device for rapid and reproducible focal changes, a 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture Plan Apo lens, a cooled CCD camera (Micromax, 5 MHz; Roper Scientific), and a DG4 illumination device. Z-stacks were deconvoluted and maximal intensity projections were constructed. Identification of MPP1 as a Kinesin-related Protein Present in Several Human Tissues—The entire human MPP1 cDNA (6325 bp) was cloned using two rounds of conventional cDNA library screening, starting with the previously obtained partial clone 6-1 (24Westendorf J.M. Rao P.N. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison in data bases showed that MPP1 belongs to the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins with the characteristic organization into three domains (15Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Okada Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), as detailed in Fig 1A. A search of genome resources indicated that a unique human MPP1 gene located on chromosome 10 in the 10q23.31 region spreads at least 73 kb and consists of 33 exons. A mouse ortholog (82% similarity) encoded by a conserved syntheny was found on murine chromosome 19. Alignment of the conserved motor domains of MPP1 and conventional kinesin heavy chain, KHC (Fig. 1B) showed that the MPP1 motor exhibits two large insertions (186–263 and 480–507), which span between α-helix 2 and β-sheet 4 and α-helix 6 and β-sheet 9, respectively, when compared with KHC structural data (39Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Schonbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 91: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 40Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of MPP1 distribution, we used an affinity-purified MPP1 antibody directed against the C2 to tail domains (aa 651–1780) of MPP1 (Fig. 2). This antibody reacted with a single 200-kDa band in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 3), which co-migrates with purified recombinant full-length MPP1 (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 1). MPP1 was detected in several human tissues, including brain, ovary, and kidney (Fig. 2B). In the testis extract, a strong signal corresponding to a slightly lower molecular weight band was detected and may correspond to a testis-specific splicing variant of MPP1. Recombinant MPP1 Behaves as a Genuine Molecular Motor—To assay MPP1 motor activity, we used recombinant proteins corresponding either to the complete MPP1 (rMPP1) or to a deletion mutant of the protein containing the putative motor domain and the first α-helical domain (rMC1) (Fig. 2A). The proteins were assayed for the characteristic activities of genuine KRP (i.e. regulated ATPase activity, binding to MTs, and ability to induce microtubule gliding on motor-coated coverslips) (15Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Okada Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 41Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Both rMPP1 and rMC1 exhibited a basal ATPase activity, which was activated by the addition of MTs (∼280- or 630-fold for rMPP1 and rMC1, respectively; Fig. 3A). The k cat and K m(ATP) values of rMPP1 and rMC1 were close to each other, and the MT concentration required for half-maximal activation was ∼6-fold higher for rMC1 mutant than for rMPP1. The microtubule binding activity of rMPP1 and rMC1 could not be assayed by conventional MT pelleting assays (42Lockhart A. Crevel I.M. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) due to partial insolubility of the unbound proteins. For visualization of microtubule binding, control microtubules or microtubules incubated with rMPP1 or with rMC1 were centrifuged on coverslips and subsequently double-stained with tubulin and FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3B). In control samples, short individual MTs were observed. Incubation with rMPP1 or rMC1 prior to centrifugation induced extensive MT cross-linking. Recombinant proteins were associated with microtubule bundles, while being undetectable on single polymers. When ATP was added in the incubation medium, microtubule bundling was inhibited in a dose-dependent way, and many individual MTs could be observed on the coverslip (Fig. 3B and data not shown). These results indicate that both rMPP1 and rMC1 bind to MTs in an ATP-dependent way and induce microtubule bundling in vitro. To test the force-producing capability of MPP1, we used a multiple-motor assay using polarity-marked MTs. Protein rMC1 induced MT motility with the minus-end leading, and most of the MTs (>90%) were seen gliding (Fig. 3C). MT gliding was also observed with rMPP1, but, curiously, only a subset of relatively short microtubules (1–5 μm in length) was seen moving (data not shown). In both cases, gliding was abolished in the presence of 1 mm AMP-PNP (data not shown). The average velocity of microtubule gliding was 0.07 ± 0.01 μm/s and 0.071 ± 0.007 μm/s for rMPP1 and rMC1, respectively. These data demonstrate that MPP1 is a slow plus-end-directed KRP, when compared with already described motors (43Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). MPP1 Distribution during the Cell Cycle—MPP1 expression and localization during the cell cyc"
https://openalex.org/W2008028241,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus are predatory bacteria that penetrate Gram-negative bacteria and grow intraperiplasmically at the expense of the prey. It was suggested that B. bacteriovorus partially degrade and reutilize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the host, thus synthesizing an outer membrane containing structural elements of the prey. According to this hypothesis a host-independent mutant should possess a chemically different LPS. Therefore, the lipopolysaccharides of B. bacteriovorus HD100 and its host-independent derivative B. bacteriovorus HI100 were isolated and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. LPS of both strains were identified as smooth-form LPS with different repeating units. The lipid As were isolated after mild acid hydrolysis and their structures were determined by chemical analysis, by mass spectrometric methods, and by NMR spectroscopy. Both lipid As were characterized by an unusual chemical structure, consisting of a β-(1→6)-linked 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose disaccharide carrying six fatty acids that were all hydroxylated. Instead of phosphate groups substituting position O-1 of the reducing and O-4′ of the nonreducing end α-d-mannopyranose residues were found in these lipid As. Thus, they represent the first lipid As completely missing negatively charged groups. A reduced endotoxic activity as determined by cytokine induction from human macrophages was shown for this novel structure. Only minor differences with respect to fatty acids were detected between the lipid As of the host-dependent wild type strain HD100 and for its host-independent derivative HI100. From the results of the detailed analysis it can be concluded that the wild type strain HD100 synthesizes an innate LPS.

Bdellovibrionaceae were discovered in 1962 by their lytic activity against Gram-negative bacteria in experiments designed for the isolation of bacteriophages in soil samples (1Stolp H. Starr M.P. Antonie Leeuvewenhoek. 1963; 29: 217-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). They are small, motile Gram-negative bacteria and possess a predatory lifestyle that includes an obligate growth and replication phase taking place in the periplasm of the prey. Bdellovibrionaceae are widely spread in the environment, e.g. soil, marine sediments, rhizosphere of plants, sewage, etc. (1Stolp H. Starr M.P.

In the latter environment it was found that Bdellovibrionaceae are involved in the reduction of bacterial counts thus supporting the self-purification of domestic waste waters (4Richardson I.R. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1990; 69: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 5Lambina W.A. Ledowa L.A. Tschurkina L.G. Mikrobiologiia. 1987; 56: 860-864PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bdellovibrionaceae were found in the intestinal tract of mammals and might be important for the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in this environment (6Ibragimov F. Zh. Mikrobiol. Epidemiol. Immunobiol. 1980; : 97-99PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schwudke D. Strauch E. Krueger M. Appel B. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 24: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite the unique predatory lifestyle and common morphological features, Bdellovibrionaceae show a great phylogenetic diversity based on 16 S rRNA analyses. Bdellovibrionaceae are divided into the species Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, Bacteriovorax stolpii, Bacteriovorax starrii, and some strains yet to be assigned (3Jurkevitch E. Minz D. Ramati B.

Starr M.P. Antonie Leeuvewenhoek. 1963; 29: 217-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). B. bacteriovorus possesses a life cycle consisting of an attack phase followed by attachment and invasion of the periplasmatic space of the prey bacterium. After penetration into the periplasmatic space of the prey the peptidoglycan layer of the host is partially degraded in a short period of time leading to swelling of the prey bacteria and the formation of spherical bdelloplasts. The former outer membrane of the prey forms a barrier against the surrounding environment and thus retains the available nutrients in a confined space (9Cover W.H. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 391-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cover W.H. Martinez R.J. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 385-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inside the prey elongation and multiplication take place and finally the prey bacteria are lysed (11Abram D. Castro e Melo J. Chou D. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 663-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tudor J.J. McCann M.P. Acrich I.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2421-2426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. bacteriovorus wild type strains solely grow on living bacteria. However, in a multistep selection procedure including streptomycin tolerance as marker host-independent (HI) mutants can be isolated that grow slowly on rich media but show a number of aberrant morphological features (13Seidler R.J. Starr M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 769-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Barel G. Jurkevitch E. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In former studies enzymatic activity of host-dependent (HD) B. bacteriovorus against the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria including the LPS of the outer membrane was detected (15Thomashow M.F. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rosson R.A. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 620-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to the degradation of macromolecular compounds of the prey several studies also indicated that B. bacteriovorus reutilizes outer membrane proteins, lipid A, and fatty acids of the prey bacteria by integration into its membrane system (15Thomashow M.F. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 998-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rosson R.A. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 620-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Talley B.G.

To understand the cell wall degrading mechanisms detailed information about its own membrane system is needed, as the predatory lifestyle requires that its own cell wall is protected against degradation. Nelson and Rittenberg (18Nelson D.R. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) detected two different lipid A species in LPS preparations from host-dependent B. bacteriovorus 109J by thin layer chromatography (TLC). One lipid A showed more similarity to that of the prey bacteria whereas the other shared common features with the lipid A from a host-independent B. bacteriovorus strain. Chemical analysis revealed a nonadecenoic acid and (OH)-13:0 as characteristic fatty acids, and furthermore, glucosamine was determined as constituent of the lipid A backbone. However, these results did not include a complete structural description of lipid A. The structural determination of LPS and lipid As derived form wild type B. bacteriovorus (HD100) and its derivative (HI100) is a prerequisite to elucidate the molecular interaction between predator and prey bacteria. The structures of the lipid As of the host-dependent strain B. bacterivorus HD100 and its host-independent mutant HI100 were determined in detail and cytokine release were measured for assessment of biological activity. Bacterial Strains and Culture Condition—The host-dependent B. bacteriovorus HD100 (DSM 50701) was grown on Escherichia coli K12 (DSM 423) as described earlier (7Schwudke D. Strauch E. Krueger M. Appel B. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 24: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The host-independent mutant B. bacteriovorus HI100 (DSM 12732) was grown in PYE medium (ATCC medium 526) at 30 °C for 3 to 5 days (7Schwudke D. Strauch E. Krueger M. Appel B. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2001; 24: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). LPS Isolation—The bacterial pellets were washed twice with 1% phenol, ethanol, and acetone and than dried at room temperature. For the host-dependent strain the yield was 4 g (pooled from a 22-liter culture) and for the host-independent strain 3.8 g (pooled from a 7-liter culture). After enzymatic degradation of nucleic acids and incubation with proteinase K the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum, 2:5:8 (v/v/v), method was used for LPS extraction (20Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Water was added to the extract of the host-dependent strain HD100 until a fraction H1 precipitated. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The remaining supernatant was concentrated until the phenol crystallized on ice water. A second LPS fraction, H2 , was obtained by adding ethanol to the remaining solution on ice water and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The LPS of the host-independent strain HI100 could only be precipitated with ethanol. All three LPS fractions were washed with acetone three times and dried. The yield was 206 mg for H1 and 110 mg for H2. From the host-independent strain HI100 190 mg of LPS was isolated. For further purification the crude LPS fractions were resuspended in twice distilled water and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 100 μg ml–1 and incubated at 37 °C overnight. These suspensions were dialyzed against twice distilled water and the LPS solutions of about 12 mg ml–1 were centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The sediments were lyophilized giving a yield of 161.5 mg of LPS of H1 , 79.6 mg of LPS of H2 , and 111.4 mg of LPS of B. bacteriovorus HI100. Isolation of Lipid A—Free B. bacteriovorus lipid As were obtained by hydrolysis of LPSs (49.6 mg of HD100, 52.7 mg of HI100) with 1% acetic acid for 90 min at 100 °C. Both lipid As were centrifuged and fractionated on a silica gel column (Silica Gel F60, Merck) with chloroform, chloroform/methanol, 9:1 (v/v), chloroform/methanol, 8:2 (v/v), and chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v), each. The preparations were analyzed by TLC (Silica Gel 60 F254 plate, Merck; CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 100:75:15 (v/v/v)) and both lipid As were found in the respective last fractions. The lipid A yield of strain HD100 was 7.3 and 8.1 mg of strain HI100. Fatty Acid Analysis—Fatty acids were released and converted to their methyl esters with HCl in methanol (for determination of total fatty acid: 2 m HCl, 24 h, 120 °C; for ester-linked fatty acids: 0.5 m HCl, 30 min, 85 °C). Fatty acid residues were extracted with chloroform and incubated with diazomethane to obtain the methylated products. After treatment with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide the trimethylsilylethers of the fatty acids were analyzed by GC-MS. The absolute configuration of the hydroxy fatty acids was determined by GC-MS of the 1-phenylethylamide derivatives (21Wollenweber H.W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). GC-MS was performed on a Hewlett Packard mass spectrometer 5989A equipped with a fused silica capillary column (HP-5MS: 30 m, inner diameter: 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm). Helium served as carrier gas and the GC temperature was initially 150 °C for 3 min, then raised to 320 °C at 5 °C min–1. Electron impact was carried out at 70 eV and chemical ionization mass spectra (chemical ionization-MS) were recorded with ammonia as reactant gas (0.1 kilopascal). Sugar Analysis—Qualitative examination of the sugar portion of LPS was performed by methylation (0.5 m HCl/CH3OH, 45 min, 85 °C, and 2 m HCl/CH3OH, 16 h, 85 °C) followed by peracetylation (22Bryn K. Jantzen E. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 240: 405-413Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The absolute configuration of the mannose and 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxyglucose of the lipid A from B. bacteriovorus HD100 was determined with the acetylated (R)-2-butylglycosides (23Gerwig G.J. Kammerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The parameters of the GC-MS analysis were identical as described for fatty acid analysis. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—MALDI-TOF MS of LPS and lipid A were performed with a Bruker-Reflex III (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear (LIN-) and/or reflector (REF-) TOF configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. Samples were dispersed in H2O (LPS), or chloroform/methanol, 1:1 (v/v) (lipid A), at a concentration of 10 μg μl–1 and mixed on the target with equal volumes of matrix solution. The best results were obtained using a saturated solution of recrystallized 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (gentisic acid, DHB, Aldrich) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile, 1:1, as matrix solution. The mass spectra show the average of at least 50 single laser shots. Mass scale calibration was performed externally with similar compounds of known chemical structure. Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS)—ESI FT-ICR MS was performed in the negative and positive ion mode using an APEX II Instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 7-tesla magnet and an Apollo ion source. Samples were dissolved at a concentration of about 10 ng μl–1 in a 50:50:0.001 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propanol, water, and triethylamine and sprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl min–1. Capillary voltage was set to 3.8 kV, and drying gas temperature to 150 °C. Capillary skimmer dissociation was induced by increasing the capillary exit voltage from –100 to –350 V. Infrared multiphoton dissociation of isolated parent ions was performed with a 35 W, 10.6-μm CO2 laser (Synrad, Mukilteo, WA). The unfocused laser beam was directed through the center of the ICR cell for 40 ms and the fragment ions were detected after a delay of 0.5 ms. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—For NMR spectroscopy all exchangeable lipid A protons were replaced with deuterium by dissolving 5.0 mg of lipid A in 1.0 ml of chloroform-d/methanol-d 4, 1:1 (v/v). After evaporating it in a slight N2 stream, lipid As were dissolved in 0.5 ml of chloroform-d/methanol-d 4 7:3 (v/v) and transferred into 5-mm high precision NMR sample tubes (Promochem, Wesel, Germany). Tetramethylsilane was used as internal standard for 1H (0.00 ppm) and 13C (0.00 ppm) spectra. Proton and all two-dimensional spectra were recorded at 600.1 MHz on a 14-tesla AVANCE DRX-600 (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) and 13C spectra were measured on a 8.4-tesla AVANCE DPX-360 (Bruker) at 90.6 MHz. All spectra were measured at 310 K and performed with Bruker XWINNMR 2.6 software. One-dimensional measurements were recorded with a 90° pulse angle, an acquisition of 16,384 data points, and a relaxation delay of 1.0 s. After zero filling to 32,768 data points they were Fourier transformed to spectra with a range of 7200 Hz (1H) or 22,000 Hz (13C). To determine DQF-COSY, TOCSY (100-ms mixing time), ROESY (250-ms mixing time), HMQC (coupled and decoupled), HMQC-TOCSY, and HMBC, between 256 and 512 experiments in the F1-dimension were recorded, each with 2048 data points in the F2-dimension. Sinusoidal multiplication and Fourier transformation led to two-dimensional spectra with a range of 4800 Hz in the proton dimension as well as 22,000 Hz and 32,000 Hz in the carbon dimension for HMQC and HMBC, respectively. Immunological Characterization of LPS—Purified LPS was separated by SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with alkaline silver nitrate (24Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar) or detected with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) after electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by tank-blotting (Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell). Prior to use, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were wetted in methanol and rinsed carefully in distilled water (at least 10 min), where they were kept until further use. Blotting was carried out at 4 °C for 16 h at 10 mA, all following steps were performed at room temperature. After transfer, membranes were placed in distilled water for 30 min, washed six times for 5 min each in blot buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.4), blocked 1 h in blot buffer supplemented with 10% nonfat dry milk, and incubated for 1 h with mAb A6, directed against a bisphosphorylated lipid A backbone (25Kuhn H.M. Brade L. Appelmelk B.J. Kusumoto S. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), A20, recognizing a terminal Kdo residue (26Brade L. Kosma P. Appelmelk B.J. Paulsen H. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 462-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or mAb WN1, reacting with the core region of E. coli LPS (27Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schuetze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B.L. Rietschel E.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody A6 was used as the cell culture supernatant (RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum), A20 (2 μgml–1) and WN1 (5 μgml–1) were diluted in the same medium. Blots were washed six times (5 min each in blot buffer) to remove the primary antibody, followed by incubation for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (H+L, Dianova, diluted 1:2000 in blot buffer supplemented with 10% nonfat dry milk), washed as before, and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride as substrates according to the supplier's instructions. Release of Cytokines from Human Mononuclear Cells—Human mononuclear cells (hMNC) were isolated from healthy donors. Heparinized blood (20 IU ml–1) was processed directly by mixing with an equal volume Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifugation on Ficoll density gradient for 40 min (21 °C, 500 × g). The interphase layer of mononuclear cells was collected and washed twice in serum free Hanks' solution and once in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units ml–1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin. Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium, and the cell number was adjusted to 5 × 106 ml–1. For the stimulation experiment 200 μl of hMNC were transferred to each well of 96-well culture plates and LPS and lipid A were added to give final concentrations of 100 ng ml–1,10ng ml–1,and 1 ng ml–1. The samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation of the culture plates for 10 min at 400 × g and stored at –20 °C until further use. The release of TNF-α in the cell supernatants was performed in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described elsewhere (28Gallati H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1982; 20: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates (Greiner, Solingen, Germany) were coated with a mAb against TNF-α (Intex AG, Switzerland). Cell culture supernatants and standard (recombinant TNF-α, rTNF-α, Intex) were added as appropriately diluted test samples and serial dilutions of rTNF-α. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rTNF-α antibody was added and the plates were incubated while shaking for 16 to 24 h at 4 °C. After six washings with distilled water the color reaction was initiated by addition of tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2 in alcoholic solution and stopped with the same amount of 1 m H2SO4. The resulting yellow oxidation product was determined at a wavelength of 450 nm on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Rainbow, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). Interleukin-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Intex AG, Switzerland). Determination of (β ↔ α) Gel to Liquid-Crystalline Phase Transition—The phase behavior was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy on a IFS55 (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) using 10 mm lipid A and LPS suspensions isolated from HI100 and from E. coli K12 according to methods as described in the literature (29Brandenburg K. Kusumoto S. Seydel U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The peak position of the symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene groups was taken as a measure of the acyl chain order, lying below 2850 cm–1 in the highly ordered gel phase (low fluidity) and above 2852 cm–1 in the less ordered liquid-crystalline phase (high fluidity). LPS Isolation and SDS-PAGE—Extraction of dried bacterial cells using a modified phenol/chloroform/light petroleum method gave LPS preparations, which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The sample H2 and HI100 LPS showed characteristic patterns for S-form LPS (lanes 1, 4, and 5). The sample H1 and E. coli K12 LPS preparations showed profiles typical for R-form LPS (lanes 2, 3, and 6–8). As can be deduced from the obvious similarity between H1 of HD100 (lanes 2 and 3) and the LPS of E. coli K12 (lanes 6 and 7) the water-precipitated LPS fraction H1 contains mainly the R-form LPS of E. coli K12. In contrast, the ethanol-precipitated fraction H2 of HD100 (lanes 4 and 5) as well as the LPS of HI100 (lane 1) showed ladders of repeating units typical for S-form LPS. However, the distances of the bands are larger for the host-independent strain HI100 indicating a size difference of the repeating units of both strains. Small amounts of the LPS of B. bacteriovorus HD100 were also observed in H1 (lanes 2 and 3). Immunological Characterization of LPS of B. bacteriovorus— For further characterization of the different LPS preparations three monoclonal antibodies (A20, A6, and WN1) were used for Western blots. The mAb A20 recognizes a terminal Kdo residue, mAb A6 reacts specifically with bisphosphorylated lipid A backbone, and mAb WN1 identifies the core region of E. coli K12 (Fig. 2). With mAb A20 (panel B) with water and ethanol-precipitated fractions H1 and H2 from strain HD100 (lane 6 and 1, respectively), LPS from strain HI100 (lane 3), and LPS from E. coli K12 LPS (lane 5) showed reactivity. This shows that B. bacteriovorus possess Kdo residues, which are accessible to mAb A20. However, it does not allow a differentiation of B. bacteriovorus LPS and that of E. coli K12. To detect residual host LPS in preparations of B. bacteriovorus strain HD100 mAb WN1 was used (Fig. 2, panel A). Strong reactivity was visible with the control LPS of K12 (lane 5) as well as with H1 of strain HD100 (lane 6). However, the fraction H2 of HD100 contained considerably less of the host LPS (lane 1). In contrast, purified LPS of the host-independent strain HI100 did not show any reaction with mAb WN1 (lane 3), indicating structural differences to the core region of E. coli. A structural difference of the lipid A backbones could be demonstrated with mAb A6 (panel C). In addition to E. coli K12 LPS (lane 5) and both B. bacteriovorus HD100 preparations (lanes 1 and 6), the purified lipid A of B. bacteriovorus HD100 showed a positive reaction with this mAb (lane 2). Neither the LPS of strain HI100 nor the isolated lipid A was recognized by mAb A6 (lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results indicate that B. bacteriovorus LPS possesses Kdo, that its core region and the lipid A backbone are different from that of E. coli, and that residual LPS from the host E. coli K12 is found in the HD100 LPS preparation. The free lipid A of B. bacteriovorus HI100 did not react with any available antibody (lane 4). Mass Spectrometry of LPS of B. bacteriovorus—The negative ion MALDI LIN-TOF mass spectra of the complete LPS of B. bacteriovorus HD100 and B. bacteriovorus HI100 (Fig. 3, A and B) show typical patterns of S-form LPS with a series of molecular ion peaks, representing LPS species with different numbers of repeating units (M0, M1, M2, M3,...) and laser-induced in-source fragment ions originating from the cleavage of the labile linkage between lipid A and core oligosaccharides. Fragments representing the core oligosaccharide (O1, O2) were identified by accompanying fragments (–44 Da) originating from decarboxylation of KdoI. These results are in good agreement with the data from experiments using α-Kdo-mAb A20 (Fig. 2B). Although the spectra are not well resolved because of the heterogeneity and adduct ion formation, they reveal important data concerning the differences of LPS HD100 and HI100. The R-form LPS (M0) can be assigned to the peaks at m/z 4759 (HI100) and m/z 4689 (HD100). The same mass differences were observed for the core oligosaccharides (O1). The repeating unit of HI100 has an average mass of 950 Da whereas HD100 has an average mass of 716 Da. Laser-induced cleavage in the core oligosaccharide lead to fragments at m/z 3831 and m/z 3783 for HD100 and HI100, respectively. Furthermore, the host-dependent strain HD100 shows up to three peaks in the LPS population attributing to heterogeneity in the core oligosaccharide. High resolution ESI FT-ICR MS of the R-form LPS (M0) gave a complex pattern of peaks differing by 14 Da combined with species at –2 and –4 Da indicating that the fatty acid composition must be very heterogeneous with respect to chain length and the degree of saturation (data not shown). Chemical Analysis of B. bacteriovorus LPS (GC-MS)—Kdo, Glc, GlcN, and Hep were detected as part of the oligosaccharide portion of the complete LPS of B. bacteriovorus by GC-MS after methylation. The sugar portion of the lipid A was identified as 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcpN3N) and d-mannopyranose (Manp). Fatty acid analysis revealed only hydroxylated fatty acids for both strains. The most abundant fatty acid component of B. bacteriovorus HD100 was (R)-3-hydroxy-11-methyl-dodecanoic acid (iso-C13:0(3-OH)). In small amounts unbranched 3-hydroxy fatty acids were detected.

https://openalex.org/W2094366341,"The adapter molecule p130Cas (Cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. The ability of Cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src (Src). The association between Src and Cas enhances Src kinase activity, and like Cas, Src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we show that Src and Cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active Src. Another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of Cas, AND-34/BCAR3 (AND-34), functions synergistically with Cas to enhance Src activation and cell migration. The carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of AND-34, as well as the activity of its putative target Rap1, contribute to these events. A mechanism through which AND-34 may regulate Cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that Cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of AND-34 overexpressing cells. These data thus provide insight into how Cas and AND-34 may function together to stimulate Src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.

Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown to be comprised of multiple protein-protein interaction modules, consistent with its predicted role as an adapter molecule (5Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Cas is a component of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that form at sites of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The presence of Cas in focal adhesions is consistent with a role for Cas in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration (6Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 7Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J.

Acta. 2000; 1499: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One of the major initiating events for cell migration is engagement of integrin receptors by ECM ligands. In this way, integrins directly link ECM components to the actin cytoskeleton (for review see Ref. 10Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Integrins also recruit cellular proteins, including kinases and adapter molecules such as Cas, to newly formed focal complexes and mature focal adhesions (for review see Ref. 11Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Ultimately, many of the signaling molecules that participate in cell adhesion and migration impact the Rho family of small GTPases, which modify the actin cytoskeleton by regulating actin polymerization and the molecular composition of adhesion sites (12Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidating the functions of focal adhesion proteins that participate in the regulation of these small GTPases is critical for understanding mechanisms that govern cell motility. Several pieces of evidence suggest that Cas plays a critical role in cell migration. Consistent with its presence in focal adhesions, Cas becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to integrin ligation by numerous ECM components, including fibronectin (FN), collagen, laminin, and vitronectin (8Harte M.T.

In addition, overexpression of Cas has been shown to enhance migration of FG pancreatic carcinoma cells and COS cells (16Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Conversely, Cas–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts do not migrate as efficiently as their wild-type counterparts unless they are engineered to express ectopic Cas (17Honda H. Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recent studies (19Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that the carboxyl terminus of Cas is required to fully rescue this defect in cell migration. The Cas carboxyl terminus contains a bipartite binding site for the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) c-Src (Src) (20Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This PTK is not only a mediator of cell proliferation and survival (for review see Refs. 21Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar and 22Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130PubMed Google Scholar), but it also plays an essential role in cell migration. Fibroblasts derived from mice lacking three Src family members (Src, Yes, and Fyn) are deficient in migration, and this defect can be rescued by re-expression of Src alone (23Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In addition, the kinase activity of Src has been shown to be essential for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (24Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Li L. Okura M. Imamoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that Src family kinases mediate integrin-dependent Cas phosphorylation (23Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 26Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S.I. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and that Src is the primary PTK responsible for phosphorylation of Cas (29Ruest P.J. Shin N.Y. Polte T.R. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7641-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cas is not only a substrate of Src, but also a potent enhancer of Src kinase activity (30Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Xing L. Ge C. Zeltser R. Maskevitch G. Mayer B.J. Alexandropoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7363-7377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Src is typically found in a closed or kinase-inactive conformation, held in place by repressive intramolecular interactions involving its Src homology-2 (SH2) and -3 (SH3) domains (for review see Ref. 32Hubbard S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because Cas contains motifs that interact with the SH2 and SH3 domains, it can prevent the adoption of this autoinhibitory conformation by directly binding to Src. We and others (30Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Xing L. Ge C. Zeltser R. Maskevitch G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28190-28196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have shown that the formation of Src/Cas complexes leads to a significant increase in PTK activity, as well as serum- and anchorage-independent growth. Interactions between Src and Cas may therefore initiate signaling cascades that lead to a number of cellular processes, including cell migration. In addition to Src, members of a second group of proteins called NSPs (novel SH2-containing proteins) have also been shown to bind to the carboxyl terminus of Cas (34Lu Y.M. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These proteins contain an amino-terminal SH2 domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain with sequence homology to the Cdc25 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Ras family GTPases. The association between Cas and one of these proteins, Chat (Nsp3), has been shown recently (35Sakakibara A. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4915-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion. A second family member, AND-34/BCAR3 (Nsp2), hereafter referred to as AND-34, also binds to the carboxyl terminus of Cas (36Cai D.P. Clayton L.K. Smolyar A. Lerner A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2104-2112PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gotoh T. Cai D. Tian X. Feig L.A. Lerner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30118-30123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Murine AND-34 has been shown to exhibit GEF activity toward the small GTPases RalA, Rap1, and R-Ras (37Gotoh T. Cai D. Tian X. Feig L.A. Lerner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30118-30123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because all three of these GTPases have been reported to function in various aspects of cell adhesion, migration, and/or proliferation (for review see Refs. 38Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), it is interesting to speculate that AND-34 may contribute to some of the functions attributed to the carboxyl terminus of Cas- and Src/Cas-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we focused on determining whether Cas and AND-34 function cooperatively to regulate cell signaling pathways that lead to Src activation and cell migration. The use of strategies involving protein overexpression is supported for these studies by the fact that both Src and Cas are highly expressed in a number of naturally occurring cellular contexts, including human breast tumors (41Biscardi J.S. Belsches A.P. Parsons S.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Canc.

Moreover, the human homologues of both Cas (BCAR1) and AND-34 (BCAR3) were identified in a screen for genes that promoted resistance to the antiestrogen tamoxifen when overexpressed in breast cancer cells (43van der Flier S. Brinkman A. Look M.P. Kok E.M. Meijer-van Gelder M.E. Klijn J.G. Dorssers L.C. Foekens J.A. J. Natl.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We found that Cas promotes haptotactic and chemotactic migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active Src and that AND-34 functions synergistically with Cas to enhance both cell migration and Src activation. The carboxyl-terminal GEF domain of AND-34 was found to contribute to these activities, as was one of the reported targets of this GEF activity, Rap1. Immunolocalization studies suggest that AND-34 may participate in these processes by relocalizing Cas to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of migrating cells. Together, these data indicate that Cas and AND-34 can function together to stimulate Src signaling pathways and promote cell migration. Cells and Antibodies—COS-1 and REF-52 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin.

TR-phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—pRK5 constructs encoding the genes for Myc-tagged full-length Cas, deletion of the minimal carboxyl terminus (ΔmCT; deletion of amino acids 693–874), and the minimal carboxyl terminus (mCT; amino acids 693–874) have been described previously (9Harte M.T.

Carcinog. 1999; 26: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Single point mutations substituting a proline residue for leucine 791 (L791P) in full-length Cas and mCT, as well as mutation of leucine 762 (L762P) in mCT, were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The mCT double mutant (L762/791P) was generated by subjecting mCT-L791P to a second round of mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged Cas was constructed by inserting the complete Cas cDNA as a BamHI/XbaI fragment into pLP-EYFP-C1 using the Creator™ cloning and expression system (Clontech). pCDNA-c-Src was generously supplied by S. J. Parsons (University of Virginia) (50Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FLAG-tagged AND-34 was constructed in pcDNA3 by replacing the polylinker of pcDNA3 with that of pFLAG-CMV2 (pFLAG3). The expressed sequence tag AI115884 was found to contain the entire coding sequence of the mouse BCAR3 homologue, AND-34. The first 24 amino acids of AND-34 were deleted to allow use of an NcoI site to blunt into the newly created pFLAG3 vector, resulting in pFLAG3-AND-34. AND-34 deleted for the GEF-containing carboxyl terminus (ΔGEF) was created from wild-type cDNA by synthesizing a PCR product using a 5′ primer that contained a unique EcoRI site just upstream of codon 25 and a 3′ primer containing a unique XbaI site just downstream of codon 593. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated in-frame into pCDNA3FLAG2AB in place of the analogous restriction fragment.

Transfection and Protein Expression—Transient transfections in COS-1 and REF-52 cells were performed according to manufacturer specifications using Superfect™ purchased from Qiagen, and C3H10T½ cell lines were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). In those cases where cells were co-transfected with two or more constructs, immunofluorescence was performed to confirm that >90% of transfected cells expressed both proteins. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) as described previously (54Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay from Pierce. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For Myc immunoprecipitates, cell lysate was incubated with mAb 9E10 overnight at 4 °C with rotation, and the immune complexes were recovered by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin. For FLAG immunoprecipitates, cell lysates were incubated with M2 resin (25 μl/mg protein) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Complexes were washed twice in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice in Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibodies as indicated. Proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Migration—C3H10T½ cell lines were transfected with the indicated constructs and cultured overnight in low-serum migration medium (DMEM containing 0.05% FCS). The following day, cells were trypsinized, counted, and a total of 105 cells in 500 μl of migration medium were loaded into the top of a modified Boyden chamber (24-well, 8.0-μm BioCoat insert; BD Biosciences). For migration toward FN (Sigma), the underside of the insert membrane was preincubated with FN overnight at 4 °C (20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), and the bottom chamber was filled with migration medium. For migration toward serum, uncoated inserts were placed in wells filled with DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were allowed to migrate for2hat37 °C, and the nonmigratory cells were then removed from the top of the membrane with cotton swabs. The underside of the membrane was fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and mounted on glass slides using VectaShield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Migrated cells were counted using a Nikon fluorescence microscope, and the ratio of fluorescent cells to total cells (visualized by phase microscopy) was used to determine percent migration. This was divided by the percent transfection for each condition, resulting in the migratory index (55Slack J.K. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27177-27184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The log values for each group of data were analyzed by single factor analysis of variance. When significant differences were found between groups at the 5% level, they were compared using the Student's t test assuming unequal variance. The data are shown as the mean relative migratory index (normalized to vector-transfected cells) ± S.D. Immunofluorescence—For immunolocalization of AND-34 wild-type and mutant constructs, REF-52 cells were transfected as described above. The following day, cells were replated on FN-coated coverslips (20 μg/ml) for 4–5 h. The cells were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized using 0.4% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with FLAG M5 mAb in 2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and TR-conjugated phalloidin for 1 h. For Cas/AND-34 colocalization, transfected REF-52 cells were plated on FN-coated coverslips for 4–5 h and then fixed, permeabilized, incubated with FLAG M5 and Cas B polyclonal antisera, and subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and TR-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. Cells were visualized through a Nikon fluorescence microscope and photographed using a cooled CCD camera controlled by Inovision Isee software. Cell Migration Is Induced by Overexpression of Src and Cas—We have shown previously (30Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that Src and Cas form stable molecular complexes under conditions in which they are both overexpressed. Using a cell system derived from C3H10T½-5H murine fibroblasts, which stably overexpress wild-type (WT) Src at levels 16-fold greater than endogenous Src (45Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that one functional consequence of these interactions is serum- and anchorage-independent proliferation (30Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because both Src and Cas have been shown to also play a role in cell adhesion and migration, we used the C3H10T½-5H model to determine whether these molecules functioned cooperatively in these processes. Src-overexpressing C3H10T½-5H cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding YFP or YFP-Cas and analyzed 24 h later for their ability to migrate toward FN or serum (Fig. 1, WT). The relative migratory index represents the percent of migrated fluorescent cells corrected for transfection efficiency and normalized to vector-transfected cells. Cas was found to promote a significant 2-fold increase in migration toward FN and serum in the presence of overexpressed WT Src. To determine whether this augmentation of cell migration by Cas was dependent on the kinase activity of overexpressed Src, a similar experiment was performed using C3H10T½-KD fibroblasts stably overexpressing kinase-dead (KD) Src (46Wilson L.K. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1471-1480PubMed Google Scholar). Cas was unable to promote migration toward either FN or serum in cells expressing KD Src. This deficiency did not appear to be because of an inability of Cas to associate with KD Src, because KD Src-Cas complexes were readily detectable in these cell lysates (data not shown). Thus, it appears from these data that Cas-dependent cell migration requires Src kinase activity. AND-34 Synergizes with Cas to Promote Src Activation and Cell Migration—Coincident with their effect on cell migration, interactions between Src and Cas result in the activation of Src, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of several Src substrates and the promotion of adhesion- and serum-independent growth (30Burnham M.R. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Harte M.T. Weidow C.L. Ma A. Weed S.A. Bouton A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A recently identified Cas binding partner, AND-34, also demonstrates pro-proliferative effects when overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines grown in the presence of the antiestrogen tamoxifen (44van Agthoven T. van Agthoven T.L. Dekker A. van der Spek P.J. Vreede L. Dorssers L.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether AND-34 participates in Cas-mediated Src activation and substrate phosphorylation, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding WT Src, Myc-tagged Cas, and/or FLAG-tagged AND-34. PTK activity was determined 24 h post-transfection by measuring the level of pTyr on the Src substrate paxillin, which was expressed as a FLAG-tagged construct, together with the other proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2024316646,"Neurophysiological events responsible for different types of human memory tend to occur concurrently and are therefore difficult to measure independently. To surmount this problem, we produced perceptual priming (indicated by speeded responses) in the absence of conscious remembering. At encoding, faces appeared briefly while subjects' attention was diverted to other stimuli. Faces appeared again in either an implicit or explicit memory test. Neural correlates of priming were identified as brain potentials beginning 270 ms after face onset with more negative amplitudes for repeated than for new faces. Remembered faces, in contrast, activated a different configuration of intracranial sources producing positive potentials maximal at 600-700 ms. We thus disentangled and characterized distinct neural events associated with memory with and without awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2155304029,"The processes of ovarian cancer dissemination are characterized by altered local proteolysis, cellular proliferation, cell attachment, and invasion, suggesting that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its specific inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1)) could be involved in the pathogenesis of peritoneal dissemination. We showed previously that expression of uPA and PAI-1 in the human ovarian cancer cell line HRA can be down-regulated by exogenous bikunin (bik), a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, via suppression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) up-regulation and that overexpression of the bik gene can specifically suppress the in vivo growth and peritoneal dissemination of HRA cells in an animal model. We hypothesize that the plasminogen activator system in mesothelial cells can be modulated by HRA cells. To test this hypothesis, we used complementary techniques in mesothelial cells to determine whether uPA and PAI-1 expression are altered by exposure to culture media conditioned by HRA cells. Here we show the following: 1) that expression of PAI-1, but not uPA, was markedly induced by culture media conditioned by wild-type HRA cells but not by bik transfected clones; 2) that by antibody neutralization the effect appeared to be mediated by HRA cell-derived TGF-β1; 3) that exogenous TGF-β1 specifically enhanced PAI-1 up-regulation at the mRNA and protein level in mesothelial cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, mainly through MAPK-dependent activation mechanism; and 4) that mesothelial cell-derived PAI-1 may promote tumor invasion possibly by enhancing cell-cell interaction. This represents a novel pathway by which tumor cells can regulate the plasminogen activator system-dependent cellular responses in mesothelial cells that may contribute to formation of peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer.

The dissemination of ovarian cancer cells within the abdominal cavity involves interaction of tumor cells with the peritoneal mesothelium. In the previous study (4Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y.

Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we transfected the human ovarian carcinoma cell line HRA, highly invasive cells, with an expression vector harboring a cDNA encoding for human bik to investigate the effect of bik overexpression and changes in tumor cell phenotype and invasiveness in the stably transfected clones. We found that transfection of HRA with the bik gene constitutively suppresses ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation and uPA mRNA and protein expression as well as significantly reduced invasion relative to the parental cells (4Suzuki M.

We conclude that transfection of HRA cells with the bik cDNA constitutively suppresses ERK1/2 activation, which results in inhibition of uPA mRNA and protein expression and subsequently reduces dissemination of bik + clones. In conditions of peritoneal dissemination, there is extensive remodeling of the peritoneum, involving proteolysis of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cell proliferation, attachment, migration, and angiogenesis (5Hashizume K.

The metastatic process in epithelial ovarian cancer is thought to involve surface shedding and subsequent dissemination of ovarian cancer cells, facilitated by localized proteolysis at the interface between ovarian cancer cells and peritoneal surfaces. One of the factors regulating the metastatic process is considered to be TGF-β, which is a multifunctional cytokine that elicits numerous cellular effects pertinent to the metastatic process (8Rodriguez G.C. Haisley C. Hurteau J. Moser T.L. Whitaker R. Bast Jr., R.C. Stack M.S. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 80: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TGF-β is an effective inducer of matrix deposition/turnover, cell locomotion, and PAI-1 expression (9Kutz S.M. Hordines J. McKeown-Longo P.J. Higgins P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rodriguez et al. (8Rodriguez G.C. Haisley C. Hurteau J. Moser T.L. Whitaker R. Bast Jr., R.C. Stack M.S. Gynecol. Oncol. 2001; 80: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggest that TGF-β may enhance the invasiveness of ovarian cancers. Receptor complexes of the TGF-β superfamily consist of a ligand-binding type II receptor serine-threonine kinase that, following ligand binding, binds to and transphosphorylates the signal transducing type I serine-threonine kinase (10Massague J. Weis-Garcia F. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 41-64PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors activate, through a phosphorylation event, members of a family of downstream signaling intermediates, the Smads (11Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Smad pathway is widely represented in most of the cell types and tissues studied, additional pathways may be activated following treatment with TGF-β in specific contexts (12Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). For example, activation of Ras, ERK1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by TGF-β signaling has been reported in nonmalignant and malignant cell lines (11Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activation of protein kinase A contributes to TGF-β-signaling responses in murine cells. In addition, TGF-β-activated kinase-1, a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family and activator of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways, is rapidly activated by TGF-β in certain cell systems (11Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633PubMed Google Scholar, 12Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PAI-1 may be regulated by different cytokines and growth factors among which TGF-β plays a pivotal role. Indeed, TGF-β stimulates PAI-1 secretion in various cell lines and in vivo (13Rougier J.P. Guia S. Hagege J. Nguyen G. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Tietze L. Elbrecht A. Schauerte C. Klosterhalfen B.

Lab. Invest. 2000; 60: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In considering these data, we asked whether the PA system expressed by mesothelial cells could be involved in the pathogenesis of peritoneal dissemination by ovarian cancer. Although the PA system has been identified in the mesothelial cells, it is not known whether ovarian cancer exposure might alter PA system expression. In this study we determined whether culture media conditioned by human ovarian cancer cell line HRA induced uPA and PAI-1 expression in cultured human peritoneal mesothelial cells and dermal fibroblast cells as a control, either by incubation with culture medium conditioned by the bik + clones or the controls (wild-type HRA cells and the luciferase transfected (luc +) clones). By using antibody neutralization techniques, we tested whether the effects were mediated by selected cytokines. Our results demonstrate that culture medium conditioned by wild-type cells, rather than bik + clones, increases PAI-1 expression of cultured mesothelial cells at least via a TGF-β1-mediated MAPK pathway and that TGF-β1 enhances tumor cell adhesion and subsequent invasion via overexpression of PAI-1. We also demonstrate the involvement of PAI-1 in an increased cell-cell interaction between ovarian cancer cells and mesothelial cells. These findings suggest that altered expression of PAI-1 by the mesothelium could influence the processes of peritoneal dissemination in ovarian cancer cells.

The antibodies against uPA (Ab 3689, recognizes uPA B-chain; Ab 3471, reacts with uPA A-chain; interferes with binding of uPA to its receptor), PAI-1 (Ab 379, recognizes all forms of PAI-1 and its complexes and neutralizes PAI-1 inhibition), and uPAR (3932, equally reactive with occupied and unoccupied uPAR; and Ab 3936, interferes with receptor binding) were gifts from Dr. R. Hart (American Diagnostics, Greenwich, CT). High molecular weight recombinant uPA, synthetic chromogenic substrate of uPA (Spectrozyme UK), chromogenic plasmin substrate (Spectrozyme PL), Glu-type plasminogen, and purified plasmin were also obtained from American Diagnostics. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and Calbiochem, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies that recognize the total and phosphorylated (activated) forms of JNK and p38 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Neutralizing antibody against TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems and Sigma. Neutralizing mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies to TNF-α or IL-1β were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig were obtained from Dako (Copenhagen, Denmark). MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Tissue culture plastics were purchased from Costar/Corning (Cambridge, MA) and Falcon (BD Biosciences). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tris base, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and ammonium persulfate were commercially obtained from Sigma. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and PVDF membranes were from Bio-Rad. Matrigel was purchased from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). X-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—Human ovarian cancer cell line HRA was grown and cultured as described previously (16Kikuchi Y. Kizawa I. Oomori K. Miyauchi M. Kita T. Sugita M. Tenjin Y. Kato K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 592-596PubMed Google Scholar). The HRA cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a cell culture incubator (constantly set at 37 °C with 5% CO2). Human peritoneal mesothelial cells were isolated during elective surgery from patients operated on for a nonperitonitis cause and without disseminated cancer. Isolation of human peritoneal mesothelial cells and primary cultures were performed as already reported (17Rougier J.P. Moullier P.H. Piedagnel R. Ronco P.M. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Stylianou E. Jenner L.A. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1563-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Human peritoneal mesothelial cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured weekly by incubation at 37 °C for 2 min with 0.0125% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA, followed by addition of complete medium, washing, and resuspension in fresh medium. Fresh medium was given three times a week, twice at 2-day intervals and once after a weekend interval. Confluent cultures of mesothelial cells were routinely split 1:4 and grown in gelatin-coated culture dishes or flasks in the presence of antibiotics. All of the experiments described below were performed in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 mm sodium pyruvate with mesothelial cells between passage 2 and 3 and dermal fibroblasts between passages 2 and 5, respectively. Confluent cultured peritoneal mesothelial cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h before testing the effects of compounds. For some experiments, ∼5 × 105 cells/well were plated out in 35-mm dishes and transferred to serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then exposed to the different agents at the indicated concentrations and for the times indicated. For the inhibition studies, optimized concentrations of SB202190, PD98059, and H-89 were added 1 h prior to TGF-β treatment. Incubation of cells with doses of tested compounds for up to 48 h did not have a significant effect on cell viability. At confluence, growth medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium (control), with culture media containing concentrated culture media supernatants from ovarian cancer cells, or TGF-β1 at concentrations indicated in the figures for different times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Human dermal fibroblasts were isolated from full thickness human skin (19Garner W.L. Karmiol S. Rodriguez J.L. Smith Jr., D.J. Phan S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS with antibiotics. Before exposure to TGF-β1, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM. Preparation of Conditioned Medium and Cell Lysate—For the preparation of conditioned medium, subconfluent cultures of ovarian cancer cell clones were washed three times with PBS and incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cell debris, filtered, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C until needed. The cell monolayers treated with or without various agents for the indicated times were washed with PBS. 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 15 min and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 3,000 × g to remove cell debris. All samples were stored at –20 °C until use. In parallel, cells treated in the same condition in different dishes were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. Detection of Cell Surface-associated Plasminogen Activators by Colorimetric Assay—Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in the maintenance medium and allowed to reach ∼90% confluence. The cell monolayers treated with or without various agents for the indicated times were washed with PBS. The cells were washed once with PBS and analyzed in a PBS-based reaction buffer (100 μl/well). The reactions were initiated by the addition of the chromogenic amidolytic substrate specific for either uPA (Spectrozyme UK) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm in the presence or absence of amiloride (1 mm) or neutralizing antibodies to uPA (10 μg/ml). Cell surface-associated plasmin activity was determined spectrophotometrically using a Spectrozyme PL. No amidolytic substrate was added in the blank reactions. The photometric absorbance of the reaction mixtures at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C over the next 30 min. Lactate Dehydrogenase and Total Protein Assays—TGF-β1 cytotoxicity was approximated by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and compared between treatment groups and control. LDH was measured using the ultraviolet method kit (Sigma). In addition, the trypan blue cell staining procedure was performed. Total protein determinations were made using a spectrophotometric technique using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). Determinations of LDH and proteins were made in triplicate. Quantitation of uPA, PAI-1, and TGF-β1 Levels, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—The amount of uPA was measured in the cellconditioned medium and in the cell lysate using the Imubind uPA ELISA kit from American Diagnostics Inc. PAI-1 levels were determined using the Imubind PAI-1 ELISA kit from the same vendor. Lower detection levels were set at 10 pg/ml for the uPA kit and below 1 ng/ml for the PAI-1 kit. The uPA assay measured all forms of uPA and its complexes. PAI-1 ELISA detected the active and latent forms of PAI-1, as well as PAI-1 in complex with PAs. The active and total (active plus latent) TGF-β1 were assayed with a human TGF-β1 ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure total TGF-β1, samples were acidified with acetic acid and then neutralized as described previously (20Zhang H. Morisaki T. Matsunaga H. Sato N. Uchiyama A. Hashizume K. Nagumo F. Tadano J. Katano M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Culture cells were harvested and washed with washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3 (pH 7.4)). Because uPAR is trypsin-sensitive, cells were treated with hyaluronidase and used for further experiments. A single cell suspension (106/ml) was incubated with affinity-purified antibodies or isotype control antibodies on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with washing buffer, and 2 μl of the primary antibody (Ab 3471 plus Ab 3689 (uPA), Ab 379 (PAI-1), and 3932 (uPAR)) and 3 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (Dako) were added for 1 h on ice, respectively. The cells were washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer and then subjected to flow cytometry using the FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data (mean fluorescence intensity) were quantified. At least 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample in all experiments. All experiments were performed at least twice. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Equal protein amounts of each sample (conditioned media and cell lysates) were resolved on a 12% acrylamide, 0.5% bisacrylamide SDS gel under nonreducing and reducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA in wash buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight hybridization with a 1:1000 dilution of each antibody in the same buffer at 4 °C and washed and then with a goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Finally, the membranes were washed and developed with a chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used are as follows: anti-uPA (Ab 3471 plus Ab 3689), anti-PAI-1 (Ab 379), anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-total Smad2, and anti-phospho-Smad2. As loading controls, Western blots were also performed using antibodies against total ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and Smad2. Isolation of Cytoplasmic RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—The HRA cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish. When cells grown in monolayer reached an early phase of confluency, total cellular RNA samples were extracted by Trizol (from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analysis, cytoplasmic RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed onto a formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon filter. After transfer, RNA was cross-linked onto the membranes by UV irradiation. The nylon filter was hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe in 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 20 h. Quantitative analysis was performed with a Bio-Rad model 620Video Densitometer with a one-dimensional analyst software package for Macintosh. The uPA cDNA probe was prepared as described previously (21Kobayashi H. Hirashima Y. Sun G.W. Fujie M. Shibata K. Tamotsu S. Miura K. Sugino D. Tanaka Y. Kondo S. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pSP64-hPAI-1, a 1.4-kbp EcoRI-BglII fragment (position 54–1480 (22Pannekoek H. Veerman H. Lambers H. Diergaarde P.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2539-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)) isolated from pPAI1-C1, a plasmid containing a 2.2-kbp human PAI-1 cDNA insert (23Andreasen P.A. Riccio A. Welinder K.G.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), was subcloned between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pSP64 (24Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Adhesion Assay—To quantify tumor cell adhesion to the peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblast cells, a standardized cell adhesion assay was developed according to methods described previously (25Catterall J.B. Gardner M.J. Cancer Lett. 1994; 87: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26van Rossen M.E. Hofland L.J. van den Tol M.P. van Koetsveld P.M. Jeekel J. Marquet R.L. van Eijck C.H. J. Pathol. 2001; 193: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mesothelial and fibroblast monolayers were established in a 96-well plate precoated with gelatin. In order to determine the effect of TGF-β1 on tumor cell adhesion, mesothelial and fibroblast monolayers were preincubated with increasing doses of TGF-β1 for 12 h in the presence or absence of specific antibodies. Non-preincubated monolayers served as controls. Tumor cells were labeled with calcein-AM solution as described previously (26van Rossen M.E. Hofland L.J. van den Tol M.P. van Koetsveld P.M. Jeekel J. Marquet R.L. van Eijck C.H. J. Pathol. 2001; 193: 530-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The labeled tumor cells were washed to remove free dye. Two hundred μl of DMEM, 0.5% BSA containing 3 × 104 calcein-labeled tumor cells were added. After plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, the medium of each well was removed and washed twice with DMEM, 0.5% BSA. The remaining fluorescence per well was measured on a plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using 485 excitation and 530 emission filters. The amount of adherent cells was determined by calibrating the measured fluorescence of the experimental wells in relation to the standard. Invasion Assay of Cancer Cells—An invasion assay was performed according to the method reported by Mizutani et al. (7Mizutani K. Kofuji K. Shirouzu K. Surg. Today. 2000; 30: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An invasion assay upper chamber with an 8-μm porosity cell-permeable polycarbonate filter covered with Matrigel was placed on a cell culture plate. Peritoneal mesothelial cells or dermal fibroblast cells were cultured fully on Matrigel, pretreated with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 12 h in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibodies, and washed, and 2 × 105 HRA cells were then added to the invasion assay upper chamber. As a chemoattractant, NIH3T3 fibroblast conditioned medium was used. After cultivation for 36 h, the chambers were immersed in 100% methanol for 1 min for fixation, and all cells were then stained by hematoxylin. The cells remaining on the top surface of the membrane were completely removed with a cotton swab, and the membrane was removed from the chamber and mounted on a glass slide. These preparations were examined under a microscope at ×100 magnification. The number of infiltrating HRA cells were counted in five regions selected at random, and the extent of invading HRA cells was determined by the mean count. Duplicate filters were used, and the experiments were repeated three times. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent triplicate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We transfected the HRA cells with an expression vector harboring a cDNA encoding for human bikunin (4Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The bikunin expression vector pCMV-bikunin-IRES-bsr (bik +) and the control vector pCMV-luciferase-IRES-bsr encoding luciferase (luc +) were transfected into HRA cells by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. We conclude that bik + clones significantly reduced invasion and that animals inoculated with bik + clones induced reduced peritoneal dissemination and long term survival (4Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether ovarian cancer cells produce factors that can stimulate PA system expression in mesothelial cells. Expression of uPA and PAI-1 in Human Peritoneal Mesothelial Cells and Dermal Fibroblast Cells—The culture media conditioned by mesothelial and fibroblast cells were initially tested by ELISA for uPA and PAI-1. Basal secretion of PAI-1 was greater in mesothelial cells and to a lesser extent in fibroblast cells. Unlike PAI-1, uPA was secreted to a lesser degree by these cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blot assays were used to determine the level of PA system expression in the cell lysate and conditioned medium. Expression of PAI-1 was greater in mesothelial cell lysate and to a lesser extent in fibroblast cell lysate (Fig. 1C). uPA expression is low in these cell lysates, as suggested by the inability to detect protein in cell lysates by Western blot. The faint band of uPA·PAI-1 complex was detected i"

While in a heterodimer complex with the regulator RcsA the RcsAB box consensus is recognized, DNA binding sites for RcsB without RcsA have also been identified. The conformation of RcsB might therefore be modulated upon interaction with various coactivators, resulting in the recognition of different DNA targets. We report the solution structure of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the RcsB protein from Erwinia amylovora spanning amino acid residues 129–215 solved by heteronuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The C-terminal domain is composed of four α-helices where two central helices form a helix-turn-helix motif similar to the structures of the regulatory proteins GerE, NarL, and TraR. Amino acid residues involved in the RcsA independent DNA binding of RcsB were identified by titration studies with a RcsAB box consensus fragment. Data obtained from NMR spectroscopy together with surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrate that the RcsAB box is specifically recognized by the RcsAB heterodimer as well as by RcsB alone. However, the binding constant of RcsB alone at target promoters from Escherichia coli, E. amylovora, and Pantoea stewartii was approximately 1 order of magnitude higher compared with that of the RcsAB heterodimer. We present evidence that the obvious role of RcsA is not to alter the DNA binding specificity of RcsB but to stabilize RcsB-DNA complexes.

RcsB is essential for the induction of exopolysaccharide (EPS)1biosynthesis (1Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an important factor for the virulence of bacterial pathogens. It is further involved in rcsA autoregulation (2Ebel W. Trempy J.E. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and probably in regulation of motility and chemotaxis (7Arricau N. Hermant D. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Duffey P.S. Popoff M.Y.

The Rcs regulation system is different from homologous systems as the phosphorylation of RcsB involves two other proteins, the membrane sensor RcsC (1Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the histidine-containing phosphotransmitter RcsD (YojN) (8Takeda S.I. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A third protein, RcsF, might be additionally involved in the activation of RcsB (10Gervais F.G. Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8016-8022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas specific signals recognized by the sensor protein RcsC still remain unknown, the RcsB regulation pathway can be activated by osmotic shock (11Sledjeski D.D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and desiccation, by mutations affecting the integrity and composition of the cell envelope (12Gottesman S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 253-262Google Scholar, 13Clavel T. Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Portalier R. Mol.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).A further modification of the RcsB regulation mechanism if compared with conventional two-component systems might be the ability of RcsB to recognize different nucleic acid structures in combination with other proteins. RcsB does interact with various coinducers like RcsA (12Gottesman S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 253-262Google Scholar) and probably TviA (16Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the formation of alternative protein complexes might direct the regulator to different targets. It has been shown that the EPS production is induced by the binding of a heterodimer of RcsB and RcsA at the RcsAB box (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This 14-bp consensus sequence is present in the promoters of all analyzed Rcs-regulated operons for capsule synthesis, as well as in rcsA promoters. However, several other genes in Escherichia coli, like the osmoregulated gene osmC (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as cell division genes controlled by the fts promoter (5Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 25: 442-450Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the genes responsible for Vi antigen synthesis in Salmonella typhi(16Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were reported to be controlled by RcsB in a completely RcsA independent mechanism. Still it remains unclear whether the RcsA independent regulation mechanisms are mediated by RcsB alone or by the interaction of RcsB with further, yet unidentified coinducers. The requirement for RcsA in EPS regulation can be bypassed by increasing the copy number of RcsB (19Brill J.A. Quinlan-Walshe C. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2599-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that RcsA modulates the RcsB-mediated transcriptional activation, but that it seems not to be essential for the general regulation mechanism. RcsA might help to keep RcsB in an active conformation by stabilizing its phosphorylation. This assumption might be supported by the observation that a mutant in the putative RcsB phosphorylation motif results in the RcsA independent overproduction of EPS in E. coli (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In any case, regulation of different operons by RcsB alone or in combinations with certain coactivators would imply different modes of DNA binding.DNA binding activity of RcsB alone could not be clearly demonstrated so far. An interaction with specific DNA-binding sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assays could be shown only in combination with RcsA (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or RNA polymerase (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two well conserved sequence motifs can be found in RcsB, a N-terminal phosphorylation motif involving three aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 11, and 56, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding motif spanning amino acid positions 151–194 and sharing sequence homology with the autoinducer homoserine lactone-dependent LuxR-type regulators (20Henikoff S. Wallace J.C. Brown J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 111-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation controlled FixJ/UhpA family of activators (21Kahn D. Ditta G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 24-kDa protein RcsB can therefore be divided into a N-terminal “receiver” and probably protein interacting domain, and into a C-terminal “effector” domain interacting with DNA. To analyze the DNA binding properties of RcsB, we have solved the solution structure of the RcsB effector domain by high resolution 1H,15N, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and we have further analyzed the interaction of RcsB with one of its DNA targets. Specific amino acid residues of RcsB interacting with the RcsAB box have been identified and we could show that RcsA considerably stabilizes the RcsAB-DNA complex. However, we also could demonstrate that RcsA is not essential for the specific recognition of the RcsAB box by RcsB.DISCUSSIONProteins with structures homologous to RcsB are the regulator for nitrate uptake NarL (43Baikalov I.

C-RcsB could best be aligned with NarL and GerE, showing that the effector domain starts with helix α7 and that the HTH motif is composed of helices α8, the scaffold helix, and α9, the recognition helix. The complete structural unit is composed of a four-helix bundle including helices α7 and α10. Amino acid residues 143 to 152 represent a flexible tether between the RcsB receiver and effector domain, and helix α6 might function as a linker helix between the two domains as suggested for the homologous helices α6 of NarL and TraR. The analyzed C-RcsB protein therefore comprises the complete effector domain including the interdomain region. The C-RcsB protein was found to be correctly folded as indicated by competition experiments in DNA interaction assays. The inhibition of RcsAB-DNA complex formation by C-RcsB is most likely because of an interaction of its HTH motif with the DNA target, but an additional interaction with either the RcsA or RcsB protein cannot be excluded. For GerE as well as for TraR, an involvement of helix α10 in protein dimerization was reported (44Ducros V.M.A. Lewis R.J. Verma C.S. Dodson E.J. Leonard G. Turkenburg J.P. Murshudov G.N. Wilkinson A.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muragila E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Inactive protein complexes might therefore be formed by oligomerization of C-RcsB with RcsA or RcsB. However, it is not known whether RcsB forms dimers or oligomers in solution or upon binding to DNA.The DNA binding surface of C-RcsB at the 14-bp RcsAB box was analyzed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy in DNA titration experiments. In general, the amide protons in the majority of residues exhibit none or only very small chemical shift changes indicating that the overall fold of the protein is not altered upon binding to DNA. The data gave no evidence for a very strong interaction, which is in agreement with our results obtained by SPR measurements of the RcsB/RcsAB box interactions, where the DNA binding affinity and the half-time of the RcsB-DNA complex was considerably decreased in the absence of RcsA. However, a specific recognition of the RcsAB box by RcsB alone was evident. The highest accumulation of chemical shift changes of C-RcsB was found in the recognition helix of the HTH motif and in the linker between scaffold and recognition helix, the turn of the HTH motif. The sequence RSIKTIS of the C-RcsB HTH motif is most likely responsible for DNA recognition and we could identify five of these residues being involved in the interaction with the RcsAB box. Accordingly, the N-terminal ends of recognition helices in homologous HTH containing proteins are supposed to contact specific bases in the major groove of the DNA binding motifs (43Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 45Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muragila E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Chemical shift variations of C-RcsB were detected at positions of the highly conserved residues Val-157 and Ile-182 that participate in a hydrophobic cluster fixing helices α7 to α9 in their proper position. In addition, residue Glu-154 showing also a considerable chemical shift change upon complexation is involved in a salt bridge stabilizing the HTH motif. A less clear explanation can be given for the chemical shift perturbation in Ser-206 and Val-208. Both residues are located at the C terminus of helix α10 and are not in the proximity of the DNA-binding site. A possible explanation would be the formation of a dimer upon DNA binding. In a model of C-RcsB bound to DNA obtained by backbone superposition of two identical C-RcsB structures (residues 153–215) on subunits A and C (residues 176–228; r.m.s.d. 1.2 and 1.1 Å) of TraR bound to DNA (Protein Data Bank code 1L3L (46Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar)), the residues Ser-206 and Val-208 are located in the α10 helix that determines the contact between the two monomers. However, the NMR chemical shift perturbation data do not indicate a significant change in the chemical environment of other residues in α10 that should come in close contact upon dimerization. Additionally, to obtain the dimer of C-RcsB in a position suitable for DNA binding the linker helix α6 had to be deleted because of overlap with α10 of the other dimer unit. We may conclude that binding to DNA as dimer in a fashion equivalent to TraR would require a significant change in the position of the linker helix α6. Interestingly, a similar observation that a change in position of α6 is necessary to allow the entry of α9 into the major groove was made in the case of NarL (43Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).The RcsAB box has been identified as the binding site for the RcsAB heterodimer and might represent only a suboptimal binding site for RcsB alone. This assumption is supported by our observation that the affinity of RcsB to the RcsAB box is 1 order of magnitude lower in the absence of RcsA. The weaker binding specificity of the RcsB HTH recognition helix might be compensated in combination with corresponding helices from coactivators like RcsA. Interaction with a coinducer could, furthermore, allosterically affect the binding specificity of the HTH motif. Unfortunately, the effect of RcsA on the structural conformation and on the DNA interaction of RcsB could not be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy so far. The RcsA protein can only be produced in an active conformation when fused to the large maltose-binding protein (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and tends to aggregate at higher concentrations.Potential DNA targets recognized by RcsB alone or at least independently from RcsA have been proposed for the ftsA1ppromoter regulating ftsAZ and for omsC expression (5Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 25: 442-450Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The proposed 18-bp RcsB box differs from the RcsAB box mostly in nucleotide positions located at the 3′ end of the consensus (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and therefore positioning of RcsB at the left site of the RcsAB box in the RcsAB-DNA complex was suggested. However, it was not possible to demonstrate the interaction of RcsB alone with the RcsB box by electrophoretical mobility shift assays, indicating also a somehow instable complex. An α-helix of a HTH motif can access only one side of the DNA and it is therefore able to bind no more than 5 base pairs because of the curvature of the DNA major groove. The length of the suggested RcsB box gives therefore evidence for the interaction of more than one RcsB monomer with the DNA, or for the involvement of other yet unidentified coactivators. If the formation of RcsB homodimers or homo-oligomers enables or supports DNA binding, then the protein interface should involve at least parts of the C-terminal domain as the C-RcsB protein was still able to interact with DNA.Our results show that heterodimerization with RcsA is not required for a RcsB/DNA interaction but that it considerably enhances its efficiency. The formation of relatively unstable complexes of RcsB alone with promoters containing RcsAB or RcsB boxes might therefore be important to maintain an essential basal level of expression of the corresponding genes. Modulation of the DNA recognition specificity or the stabilization of RcsB-DNA complexes by heterodimerization with specific coinducers as a response to distinct external signals might represent an additional option to rapidly increase the expression of selected genes or operons. The results presented in this report indicate that in the case of the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer formation, the stabilization of the protein-DNA complex is the predominant function. The RcsB protein is a key regulator in enteric and plant pathogenic bacteria and represents the transcriptional effector of a modified two-component system. RcsB is essential for the induction of exopolysaccharide (EPS)1biosynthesis (1Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an important factor for the virulence of bacterial pathogens. It is further involved in rcsA autoregulation (2Ebel W. Trempy J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,3Wehland M. Bernhard F. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and probably in regulation of motility and chemotaxis (7Arricau N. Hermant D. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Duffey P.S. Popoff M.Y.

The Rcs regulation system is different from homologous systems as the phosphorylation of RcsB involves two other proteins, the membrane sensor RcsC (1Stout V. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the histidine-containing phosphotransmitter RcsD (YojN) (8Takeda S.I. Fujisawa Y. Matsubara M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A third protein, RcsF, might be additionally involved in the activation of RcsB (10Gervais F.G. Drapeau G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8016-8022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas specific signals recognized by the sensor protein RcsC still remain unknown, the RcsB regulation pathway can be activated by osmotic shock (11Sledjeski D.D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and desiccation, by mutations affecting the integrity and composition of the cell envelope (12Gottesman S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 253-262Google Scholar, 13Clavel T. Lazzaroni J.C. Vianney A. Portalier R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), by treatment with the cationic amphipathic substance chlorpromazine (9Conter A. Sturny R. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and by overproduction of the chaperone-like transmembrane protein DjlA (14Clarke D.J. Holland I.B. Jacq A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,15Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A further modification of the RcsB regulation mechanism if compared with conventional two-component systems might be the ability of RcsB to recognize different nucleic acid structures in combination with other proteins. RcsB does interact with various coinducers like RcsA (12Gottesman S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 253-262Google Scholar) and probably TviA (16Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the formation of alternative protein complexes might direct the regulator to different targets. It has been shown that the EPS production is induced by the binding of a heterodimer of RcsB and RcsA at the RcsAB box (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Wehland M. Kiecker C. Coplin D.L. Kelm O. Saenger W. Bernhard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3300-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This 14-bp consensus sequence is present in the promoters of all analyzed Rcs-regulated operons for capsule synthesis, as well as in rcsA promoters. However, several other genes in Escherichia coli, like the osmoregulated gene osmC (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as cell division genes controlled by the fts promoter (5Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 25: 442-450Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the genes responsible for Vi antigen synthesis in Salmonella typhi(16Virlogeux I. Waxin H. Ecobichon C. Lee J.O. Popoff M.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were reported to be controlled by RcsB in a completely RcsA independent mechanism. Still it remains unclear whether the RcsA independent regulation mechanisms are mediated by RcsB alone or by the interaction of RcsB with further, yet unidentified coinducers. The requirement for RcsA in EPS regulation can be bypassed by increasing the copy number of RcsB (19Brill J.A. Quinlan-Walshe C. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2599-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that RcsA modulates the RcsB-mediated transcriptional activation, but that it seems not to be essential for the general regulation mechanism. RcsA might help to keep RcsB in an active conformation by stabilizing its phosphorylation. This assumption might be supported by the observation that a mutant in the putative RcsB phosphorylation motif results in the RcsA independent overproduction of EPS in E. coli (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In any case, regulation of different operons by RcsB alone or in combinations with certain coactivators would imply different modes of DNA binding. DNA binding activity of RcsB alone could not be clearly demonstrated so far. An interaction with specific DNA-binding sites by electrophoretic mobility shift assays could be shown only in combination with RcsA (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or RNA polymerase (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two well conserved sequence motifs can be found in RcsB, a N-terminal phosphorylation motif involving three aspartic acid residues at positions 10, 11, and 56, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding motif spanning amino acid positions 151–194 and sharing sequence homology with the autoinducer homoserine lactone-dependent LuxR-type regulators (20Henikoff S. Wallace J.C. Brown J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 111-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation controlled FixJ/UhpA family of activators (21Kahn D. Ditta G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 24-kDa protein RcsB can therefore be divided into a N-terminal “receiver” and probably protein interacting domain, and into a C-terminal “effector” domain interacting with DNA. To analyze the DNA binding properties of RcsB, we have solved the solution structure of the RcsB effector domain by high resolution 1H,15N, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and we have further analyzed the interaction of RcsB with one of its DNA targets. Specific amino acid residues of RcsB interacting with the RcsAB box have been identified and we could show that RcsA considerably stabilizes the RcsAB-DNA complex.

If the formation of RcsB homodimers or homo-oligomers enables or supports DNA binding, then the protein interface should involve at least parts of the C-terminal domain as the C-RcsB protein was still able to interact with DNA.Our results show that heterodimerization with RcsA is not required for a RcsB/DNA interaction but that it considerably enhances its efficiency. The formation of relatively unstable complexes of RcsB alone with promoters containing RcsAB or RcsB boxes might therefore be important to maintain an essential basal level of expression of the corresponding genes. Modulation of the DNA recognition specificity or the stabilization of RcsB-DNA complexes by heterodimerization with specific coinducers as a response to distinct external signals might represent an additional option to rapidly increase the expression of selected genes or operons. The results presented in this report indicate that in the case of the RcsA/RcsB heterodimer formation, the stabilization of the protein-DNA complex is the predominant function. Proteins with structures homologous to RcsB are the regulator for nitrate uptake NarL (43Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) of E. coli, belonging to the FixJ family of response regulators, the sporulation regulator GerE (44Ducros V.M.A. Lewis R.J.

C-RcsB could best be aligned with NarL and GerE, showing that the effector domain starts with helix α7 and that the HTH motif is composed of helices α8, the scaffold helix, and α9, the recognition helix. The complete structural unit is composed of a four-helix bundle including helices α7 and α10. Amino acid residues 143 to 152 represent a flexible tether between the RcsB receiver and effector domain, and helix α6 might function as a linker helix between the two domains as suggested for the homologous helices α6 of NarL and TraR. The analyzed C-RcsB protein therefore comprises the complete effector domain including the interdomain region. The C-RcsB protein was found to be correctly folded as indicated by competition experiments in DNA interaction assays. The inhibition of RcsAB-DNA complex formation by C-RcsB is most likely because of an interaction of its HTH motif with the DNA target, but an additional interaction with either the RcsA or RcsB protein cannot be excluded. For GerE as well as for TraR, an involvement of helix α10 in protein dimerization was reported (44Ducros V.M.A. Lewis R.J. Verma C.S. Dodson E.J. Leonard G. Turkenburg J.P. Murshudov G.N. Wilkinson A.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muragila E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Inactive protein complexes might therefore be formed by oligomerization of C-RcsB with RcsA or RcsB. However, it is not known whether RcsB forms dimers or oligomers in solution or upon binding to DNA. The DNA binding surface of C-RcsB at the 14-bp RcsAB box was analyzed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy in DNA titration experiments. In general, the amide protons in the majority of residues exhibit none or only very small chemical shift changes indicating that the overall fold of the protein is not altered upon binding to DNA. The data gave no evidence for a very strong interaction, which is in agreement with our results obtained by SPR measurements of the RcsB/RcsAB box interactions, where the DNA binding affinity and the half-time of the RcsB-DNA complex was considerably decreased in the absence of RcsA. However, a specific recognition of the RcsAB box by RcsB alone was evident. The highest accumulation of chemical shift changes of C-RcsB was found in the recognition helix of the HTH motif and in the linker between scaffold and recognition helix, the turn of the HTH motif. The sequence RSIKTIS of the C-RcsB HTH motif is most likely responsible for DNA recognition and we could identify five of these residues being involved in the interaction with the RcsAB box. Accordingly, the N-terminal ends of recognition helices in homologous HTH containing proteins are supposed to contact specific bases in the major groove of the DNA binding motifs (43Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 45Vannini A. Volpari C. Gargioli C. Muragila E. Cortese R. De Francesco R. Neddermann P. Di Marco S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Chemical shift variations of C-RcsB were detected at positions of the highly conserved residues Val-157 and Ile-182 that participate in a hydrophobic cluster fixing helices α7 to α9 in their proper position. In addition, residue Glu-154 showing also a considerable chemical shift change upon complexation is involved in a salt bridge stabilizing the HTH motif. A less clear explanation can be given for the chemical shift perturbation in Ser-206 and Val-208. Both residues are located at the C terminus of helix α10 and are not in the proximity of the DNA-binding site. A possible explanation would be the formation of a dimer upon DNA binding. In a model of C-RcsB bound to DNA obtained by backbone superposition of two identical C-RcsB structures (residues 153–215) on subunits A and C (residues 176–228; r.m.s.d. 1.2 and 1.1 Å) of TraR bound to DNA (Protein Data Bank code 1L3L (46Zhang R.G. Pappas T. Brace J.L. Miller P.C. Oulmassov T. Molyneaux J.M. Anderson J.C. Bashkin J.K. Winans S. Joachimiak A. Nature. 2002; 417: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar)), the residues Ser-206 and Val-208 are located in the α10 helix that determines the contact between the two monomers. However, the NMR chemical shift perturbation data do not indicate a significant change in the chemical environment of other residues in α10 that should come in close contact upon dimerization. Additionally, to obtain the dimer of C-RcsB in a position suitable for DNA binding the linker helix α6 had to be deleted because of overlap with α10 of the other dimer unit. We may conclude that binding to DNA as dimer in a fashion equivalent to TraR would require a significant change in the position of the linker helix α6. Interestingly, a similar observation that a change in position of α6 is necessary to allow the entry of α9 into the major groove was made in the case of NarL (43Baikalov I. Schröder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The RcsAB box has been identified as the binding site for the RcsAB heterodimer and might represent only a suboptimal binding site for RcsB alone. This assumption is supported by our observation that the affinity of RcsB to the RcsAB box is 1 order of magnitude lower in the absence of RcsA. The weaker binding specificity of the RcsB HTH recognition helix might be compensated in combination with corresponding helices from coactivators like RcsA. Interaction with a coinducer could, furthermore, allosterically affect the binding specificity of the HTH motif. Unfortunately, the effect of RcsA on the structural conformation and on the DNA interaction of RcsB could not be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy so far. The RcsA protein can only be produced in an active conformation when fused to the large maltose-binding protein (17Kelm O. Kiecker C. Geider K. Bernhard F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and tends to aggregate at higher concentrations. Potential DNA targets recognized by RcsB alone or at least independently from RcsA have been proposed for the ftsA1ppromoter regulating ftsAZ and for omsC expression (5Carballes F. Bertrand C. Bouche J.P. Cam K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 25: 442-450Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The proposed 18-bp RcsB box differs from the RcsAB box mostly in nucleotide positions located at the 3′ end of the consensus (6Davalos-Garcia M. Conter A. Toesca I. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5870-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and therefore positioning of RcsB at the left site of the RcsAB box in the RcsAB-DNA complex was suggested. However, it was not possible to demonstrate the interaction of RcsB alone with the RcsB box by electrophoretical mobility shift assays, indicating also a somehow instable complex. An α-helix of a HTH motif can access only one side of the DNA and it is therefore able to bind no more than 5 base pairs because of the curvature of the DNA major groove. The length of the suggested RcsB box gives therefore evidence for the interaction of more than one RcsB monomer with the DNA, or for the involvement of other yet unidentified coactivators. If the formation of RcsB homodimers or homo-oligomers enables or supports DNA binding, then the protein interface should involve at least parts of the C-terminal domain as the C-RcsB protein was still able to interact with DNA. Our results show that heterodimerization with RcsA is not required for a RcsB/DNA interaction but that it considerably enhances its efficiency.

The binding sites of Gβγ in the ubiquitous GIRK1 (Kir3.1) subunit have not been unequivocally charted, and in the neuronal GIRK2 (Kir3.2) subunit the binding of Gβγ has not been studied.

Gβγ acts by directly binding to the channel molecule. Historically, GIRK was the first identified Gβγ effector (reviewed in Refs. 1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

A functional channel is composed of four identical subunits (homotetramer) or different subunits (heterotetramer). Heterotetramers appear to compose the majority of functional GIRK channels in the body.

Heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 and GIRK1/4 channels contain a pair of each subunits, giving a GIRK12GIRKx 2 stoichiometry. As in all inward rectifier K channels of the Kir family, each subunit consists of a core transmembrane domain flanked by cytoplasmic N and C termini (reviewed in Ref. 10Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 505: 267-282Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The structure of the core domain, which contains two membrane-spanning α-helixes M1 and M2 and a reentrant helix-P-loop, follows the universal K+ channel pattern (11Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J.

Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The crystal structure shows that four cytoplasmic domains, without the transmembrane core domain, form a tetramer that folds to encircle a 60-Å-long cytoplasmic water-filled channel, presumably a direct continuation of the transmembrane channel; the external walls of this structure are exposed to the cytoplasm. Direct binding of Gβγ to GIRK has been studied only in GIRK1 and GIRK4; in both, Gβγ binds to the cytoplasmic N and C termini (6Inanobe A. Ito H. Ito M. Hosoya Y. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The exact location of Gβγ-binding sites in GIRK1 and GIRK4, and their functional impact, are not unequivocal. Up to three separate Gβγ-binding segments in each subunit have been reported; not all are identical in GIRK1 and GIRK4. We designated the various proposed Gβγ-binding segments as sites 1–4 for simplicity (see Fig. 1). The N-terminal Gβγ-binding site 1, and a mid-C-terminal site 3, amino acids (a.a.) ∼318–374 (numbering by GIRK1), were identified by direct binding (pull down) experiments between Gβγ and GST-fused GIRK fragments, and are present both in GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (13Huang C.L.

Peptide competition experiments tested the ability of 20-mer peptides, corresponding to cytosolic segments of GIRK1 and GIRK4, to inhibit the binding of Gβγ to purified GIRK1/4 protein. These experiments, in conjunction with mutagenesis, suggested a high affinity site 2 in the proximal part of the C terminus of GIRK4 (a.a. ∼209–245 in GIRK4). Corresponding peptides from GIRK1 produced little or no inhibition of Gβγ-GIRK1/4 binding, implying that GIRK1 lacks this binding site (20Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Later binding studies with GST fusion proteins of GIRK4 (19He C. Yang X.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) did not assign a major role for site 2 in Gβγ-GIRK4 binding and implicated the region between a.a. 253 and 348 in GIRK4 as a minimal C-terminal Gβγ-binding segment. Finally, some pull-down experiments suggested the presence of a unique distal site 4 in GIRK1 (a.a. 390–462) but not in GIRK4 (17Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, peptides from this region did not affect the binding of Gβγ to purified GIRK1/4 (20Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, the Gβγ-binding surface of GIRK1 remains to be better delineated. A unique functional role has been assigned to site 3 as a low affinity site underlying agonist-induced activation (18He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutation of Leu333 in site 3 of GIRK1 and the corresponding Leu339 in GIRK4 eliminate G protein-coupled receptor-induced activation but leave the Gβγ-dependent basal activity largely intact, implying that the latter may be determined by a distinct site (18He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent studies by He et al. (19He C. Yang X. Zhang H.

Mutation of Leu268 has been reported to reduce the binding of Gβγ to a GST fusion protein encompassing a.a. 253–348 of GIRK4, suggesting the importance of this residue in the interaction of GIRK4 with Gβγ (19He C. Yang X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, in GIRK1, Leu262 lies well outside any previously identified Gβγ-binding sites, again calling for a better mapping of Gβγ-binding surfaces in GIRK1. This study addresses the mechanisms associated with the binding of Gβγ to the C-terminal region of two GIRK subunits, the ubiquitous GIRK1 and a highly important neuronal GIRK2 subunit, and the relation between the roles of several crucial amino acids in Gβγ binding and channel gating. We also address the correspondence between the Gβγ-binding sites identified by standard biochemical methods and the recently revealed crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of GIRK1. Surprisingly, the standard pull-down approach suggested the presence of a very large Gβγ-binding surface in GIRK1, which included sites 1–3, whereas in GIRK2 Gβγ bound only to fragments corresponding to sites 1 and 3 defined above. An alternative indirect approach, in which GST-fused fragments of GIRK1 were assayed for their ability to prevent the interaction between Gαi1 and Gβγ, suggested a prominent C-terminal Gβγ-interacting segment between a.a. 336 and 409, that is most of site 3 and part of site 4. Mutation of the crucial C-terminal leucines 262 and 333 in GIRK1 and the corresponding leucines 273 and 344 in GIRK2 dramatically altered the function of heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 channels. However, these mutations did not significantly reduce Gβγ binding to relevant GST fusion fragments, suggesting that their involvement in the interaction with Gβγ is mainly relevant to changes in GIRK gating rather than Gβγ binding. cDNA Constructs and RNA—GST-GIRK1 and GST-GIRK2 fusion constructs were created using PCR. DNA fragments encoding the indicated amino acid residues (Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3D) from rat GIRK1, mouse GIRK2, and mouse Kir2.1 were cloned into the vector pGEX-cs or pGEX-4T-1 (21Wang C.R. Esser L.

All DNA constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. We found a variation, possibly polymorphic, in the reported mouse GIRK2 cDNA (22Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T.

Data acquisition and analysis were done using the Axotape and the pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). All experiments were done at 20–22 °C. Whole-cell GIRK currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at –80 mV in the ND-96 solution, and GIRK currents were measured in a high K+ solution containing 96 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), as described (25Dascal N. Schreibmayer W. Lim N.F. Wang W. Chavkin C. DiMagno L. Labarca C. Kieffer B.L. Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Trollinger D. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Myristoylated Gαi1 and Gβγ were purified from Escherichia coli and Sf9 cells as described previously (27Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 28Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). GST-GIRK fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) or BL21(RIL) cells and purified using glutathione affinity resin, as described (29Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein was eluted from the glutathione affinity resin with 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm KCl, and 10 or 15 mm glutathione. In some cases, protein was then concentrated and dialyzed overnight in elution buffer lacking glutathione. Inhibition of Gβγ-mediated ADP-ribosylation—The capacity of Gβγ to support the ADP-ribosylation of recombinant myristoylated Gαi1 was assessed as described, with minor modifications (30Casey P.J. Pang I.H. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The final dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid concentration was increased to 1 mm, and purified Gαi1 (20 pmol/assay) was used as substrate. Gαi1, Gβγ (0.3 pmol/assay), and GST-GIRK1 fusion proteins were added on ice in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction was started with 15 μl of pertussis toxin mix and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped, and the amount of [32P]NAD incorporated was assessed by filter binding using 6% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. Interaction between GST Fusion Proteins and Gβγ—With in vivo synthesized Gβγ, the procedures were essentially as described (29Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, [35S]Met-labeled Gβ1 and Gγ2 were translated on the template of in vitro synthesized RNAs using a rabbit reticulocyte translation kit (Promega). Purified GST fusion proteins (5–10 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of the lysate (in the case of in vitro synthesized Gβγ) containing the 35S-labeled proteins in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline or high K+ buffer (in mm: 150 KCl, 50 Tris, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA (pH 7.0)) with the addition of 0.5% CHAPS, for 1 h at room temperature, with gentle rocking. Then 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times in 1 ml of the same buffer, first time with 0.5% CHAPS and in the following with 0.1% CHAPS. Following washing, GST fusion proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 15 mm reduced glutathione in elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)) and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The labeled products were identified and quantified by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) as described (31Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the summary shown in Fig. 1B, the radioactive signals obtained by PhosphorImager were additionally corrected for the differences in the amount of fusion proteins in each band in the following way. The dried gels, with proteins stained by Coomassie Blue, were scanned to a bitmap file, and the relative amount of each protein in a band was measured in arbitrary OD units using TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and then normalized to the amount of G1-C1 fusion protein (see Fig. 1A) in the same experiment. The differences between the amounts of the various GST fusion proteins estimated by this method never exceeded 2-fold. With purified Gβ1γ2, the reaction contained 5 μg of GST fusion protein and 1 μl of 20 μm purified Gβγ, in a final volume of 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Lubrol at 0.01% (32Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hebert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or 0.1% (19He C. Yang X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained at both concentrations of Lubrol. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and the reaction proceeded as above for in vitro synthesized Gβγ. The proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting with the common Gβ antibody (Calbiochem) at 1:750 dilution. The proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal Substrate ECL kit (Pierce). Confocal Imaging of GIRK in Plasma Membrane—The level of GIRK1 protein in plasma membrane was measured as described (23Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 87-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Singer-Lahat D. Dascal N. Mittelman L. Peleg S. Lotan I. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 627-633PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, large oocyte membrane patches, free of any visible cytosolic contaminants or pigment granules, were attached to coverslips, fixated, stained by a specific GIRK1 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), and visualized using a Cy3-conjugated rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using the Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. Intensity of labeling (OD units) was measured with TINA software. Data Presentation and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparison between two groups of treatment was done using the two-tailed Student's t test. Comparison between several groups of data has been performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnet's test. Direct Binding of Gβγ to GST-fused Fragments of GIRK1 and GIRK2—We have probed Gβγ binding to different parts of GIRK1 by a standard pull-down approach, widely used in previous studies. A series of GST fusion proteins of various length, covering the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal portions of GIRK1, has been prepared (Fig. 1A). The C terminus was arbitrarily subdivided into 6 fragments with little or no overlap; in addition, fusion proteins covering a.a. 183–363 and 363–501 (G1-(183–363) and G1-(362–501), respectively) and the whole C terminus (G1-(183–501)) were prepared. We measured the binding of [35S]methionine-labeled Gβ1γ2, synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, to GST fusion proteins immobilized of glutathione-agarose affinity beads. The functional activity of in vitro synthesized Gβγ has been verified by its binding to a GST-fused Gαi3 in the presence of GDP but not GTPγS (24Rishal I. Keren-Raifman T. Yakubovich D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Slepak V.Z. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3840-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesized, metabolically labeled Gβγ has been successfully used in the past to identify Gβγ-binding sites of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (34Zamponi G.W. Bourinet E. Nelson D. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 35Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Barzilai R. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275,: 39846-39854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It gives the advantage of a highly sensitive and accurate quantitation of bound protein, because the radioactive signal from labeled Gβγ is measured from dried gels by PhosphorImager directly, in an almost unlimited linear range, and with high precision. In comparison, in Western blotting, several additional intermediate steps are involved (transfer of protein to membranes, binding of secondary antibody, and chemiluminescent reaction) that reduce the accuracy of measurement. In the initial experiments, we verified that, as reported previously (13Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the whole-length N terminus (G1-(1–84)) and C terminus (G1-(183–501)) of GIRK1 and G1-(183–363) bind Gβγ (data not shown; see also Fig. 6A). Shorter fragments of the C terminus were explored in more detail. G1-C1, G1-C2, and G1-C3 reproducibly bound Gβγ (Fig. 1B). For comparison, we constructed a fusion protein 2.1s that presents a fragment from a homologous but Gβγ-insensitive inwardly rectifying K+ channel, Kir2.1, exactly corresponding to G1-C3 of GIRK1. This protein did not bind Gβγ (e.g. Fig. 6A). The lower panel of Fig. 1B summarizes the results of pull-down experiments, showing that G1-C2 and G1-C3 bound Gβγ to a similar extent, whereas G1-C1 bound the best (Fig. 1B). G1-(363–501), which covers all of the previously proposed (17Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) site 4 (a.a. 390–462), showed rather low Gβγ binding, which was also highly variable (data not shown). The latter suggests poor folding of this fusion protein (see also Ref. 17Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Poor binding of Gβγ to a corresponding fragment of GIRK1-(357–501) was also reported by Kunkel and Peralta (15Kunkel M.T. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). None of the subdivisions of this fragment (G1-C4 through G1-C6) bound Gβγ (Fig. 1B). G1-C1 and G1-C2 have not been designated previously as Gβγ-binding sites in GIRK1. To make sure that the binding to G1-C1 or G1-C2 is not due to some contamination present in the reticulocyte lysate, we tested the binding of highly purified recombinant Gβ1γ2, instead of in vitro synthesized Gβγ, to the same fusion proteins; the bound Gβγ was visualized using Western blot methodology. As shown in Fig. 1C, the results were essentially the same as with in vitro synthesized Gβγ. Whereas quantitative assessment in this case was less accurate, G1-C1, G1-C2, and G1-C3 clearly bound Gβγ. Neither G1-C4 nor the Kir2.1 fragment 2.1s bound any Gβγ, but a weak binding to whole-length C terminus of Kir2.1 (2.1l) was sometimes observed. We have similarly mapped the cytoplasmic parts of GIRK2, using in vitro synthesized Gβγ (Fig. 2), with GST fusion proteins that covered all of the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic parts of GIRK2 (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B shows that in the N terminus the distal but not the proximal half bound Gβγ. In the C terminus, binding was observed only in the distal half (G2-C2), and within this segment, only the proximal part (G2-C2–1) bound Gβγ (this fragment corresponds to the end of G1-C2 and all of G1-C3 of GIRK1; see Fig. 7A). Thus, no Gβγ binding is found in the C terminus of GIRK2 at segments corresponding to the hypothetical sites 2 and 4 or to G1-C1 fragment of GIRK1. The fragment G2-C2–1, identified as sufficient for Gβγ binding, overlaps site 3. Mapping Gβγ Binding Segments of C Terminus of GIRK1 by Competition with Gαi1 2These experiments were performed in the laboratory of A. G. Gilman.—To obtain an independent measure of binding of Gβγ to segments of the C terminus of GIRK1, we chose to assay the competition between Gα and C-terminal GST fusion proteins for the binding to Gβγ. Such competition is reasonable, because at least some of the residues of Gβ that interact with GIRK are located at the Gα-binding surface of Gβ (36Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Our assay is based on the fact that ADP-ribosylation of Gαi-GDP, catalyzed by pertussis toxin, is possible only in the heterotrimeric form of the G protein (37Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar). If a GST fusion protein interacts with Gβγ and (sterically or allosterically) reduces the binding of Gβγ to Gα, the pertussis toxin-catalyzed incorporation of NAD into Gα will be reduced. In these experiments, we used purified recombinant Gβ1γ2 and Gαi1; we have verified that the latter does not bind to full-length C terminus of GIRK1 or any one of the fusion proteins G1-C1 through G1-C6. 3T. Ivanina, D. Varon, and N. Dascal, unpublished observations. Therefore, only binding of the fusion proteins to Gβγ could interfere with ADP-ribosylation. Fig. 3 (A–C) shows the results of three independent experiments with an extensive array of GST fusion proteins. The array of fusion proteins used and the results are summarized in Fig. 3D, where (+) indicates the ability of a given GST fusion protein to inhibit ADP-ribosylation of Gαi1-GDP. In this assay, the full-length C terminus of GIRK1 (G1-(183–501)) blocks Gβγ interactions with the Gα subunit in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Of all the GST fusion proteins tested, only those containing amino acids 336–409 were able to counteract ADP-ribosylation. G1-(336–409) was the shortest effective fusion protein. Neith"
https://openalex.org/W2039157245,"Ets proteins constitute a family of conserved sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins and function as transcription factors. ETS1 plays important roles in differentiation, lymphoid cell development, invasiveness and angiogenesis. Such diverse roles of ETS1 are likely to be dependent on its associated proteins. A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted and here we describe a novel ETS1 interacting protein designated as ETS1-associated protein II (EAPII). EAPII protein interacts with ETS1 and other Ets proteins (ETS2 and FLI1) both in vitro and in vivo. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that EAPII is predominately localized to the nucleus of mammalian cells. EAPII negatively modulates ETS1 transcriptional activity and attenuates synergistic transactivation by ETS1 and AP-1. Significantly, re-expression of EAPII inhibits the migration of epithelial cancer cells, but does not affect cell viability. Therefore, EAPII is a novel ETS1 modulator that regulates specific aspects of the ETS1 functions."

Moreover, inhibition of COX-2 activity eliminated mRNA upregulation of EP2 and EP3a1 induced by shear. Hence, a biochemical pathway exists wherein fluid shear activates COX-2, via a JNK2/c-Jun-dependent pathway, which in turn elicits downstream EP2 and EP3a1 mRNA synthesis.

DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). COX is known to exist in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, with similar sequence identities (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 2Spencer A.G. Thuresson E. Otto J.C. Song I. Smith T. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32936-32942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the two isoforms have analogous active site structures, catalytic mechanisms, products, and kinetics, they exhibit differences in their regulation and function (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). COX-1, is constitutively expressed in many tissues and cell types and is presumed to be responsible for the synthesis of “housekeeping” prostaglandins that are critical for normal physiological functions (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). However, COX-1 has been reported to be differentially regulated in endothelial cells stimulated with fluid shear (3McCormick S.M. Whitson P.A. Wu K.K. McIntire L.V. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2000; 28: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (4Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Hajibeigi A. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Wu K.K. Am. J.

Abreu C. Fletcher B.S. Herschman H.R. Raisz L.G. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a variety of chemical stimuli, such as interleukin-1α has failed to regulate COX-1 in chondrocytic cells (6Curtis C.L. Hughes C.E. Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Harwood J.L. Caterson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 721-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). On the other hand, COX-2 is expressed in few tissues under basal conditions. However, COX-2 mRNA and protein synthesis are induced in a timeand dose-dependent manner in inflammation models such as cytokine-stimulated human macrophages (7Barrios-Rodiles M. Chadee K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2441-2448PubMed Google Scholar) and rat mesangial cells (8Feng L. Xia Y. Garcia G.E. Hwang D. Wilson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Moreover, in chondrocytic models, COX-2 is regulated by chemical agonists such as okadaic acid via activator protein-1 and cAMP-response element (CRE) binding proteins (9Miller C. Zhang M. He Y. Zhao J. Pelletier J.P. Martel-Pelletier J. Di Battista J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 392-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as nitric oxide via extracellular signal-related protein kinase 1/2 and p38 kinase (10Notoya K. Jovanovic D.V. Reboul P. Martel-Pelletier J. Mineau F. Pelletier J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3402-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis alpha via nuclear factor-κB (11Sakai T. Kambe F.

Thus, several discrete signaling pathways have been implicated in the genesis of COX-2 synthesis that are dependent on the stimulus imposed on the cell. Although fluid shear has been reported to induce COX-2 expression in endothelial (3McCormick S.M. Whitson P.A. Wu K.K. McIntire L.V. Ann. Biomed.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), its effect on chondrocytic cells remains to be investigated. Moreover, the transcription factors and signaling intermediates regulating COX-2 expression in response to fluid shear have not been previously elucidated in any cell type. COX inhibitors have been extensively used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Of the various prostanoids, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is thought to play a key role in the erosion of cartilage and juxta-articular bone. The biological actions of PGE2 are mediated through its binding to specific G-protein-coupled cell surface prostaglandin EP receptors. There are at least four subtypes of EP receptors, termed EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, that directly modulate intracellular levels of inositol phosphate or cAMP (16Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The significance of the prostaglandin EP receptors was recently documented in a mouse model of experimentally induced arthritis (17McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). COX-1, but not COX-2, has been implicated in the regulation of the expression of the prostaglandin receptors in cervical carcinomas (18Sales K.J. Katz A.A. Howard B. Soeters R.P. Millar R.P. Jabbour H.N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 424-432PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, inactivation of COX-2 has been reported to increase EP3 and EP4 receptor expression in a murine kidney cell line (19Nasrallah R. Laneuville O. Ferguson S. Hebert R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F123-F132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it failed to interfere with it in an osteogenic cell line (20Weinreb M. Kelner A. Keila S. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 174: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effects of mechanical stimuli and COX activity on the regulation of prostaglandin receptors in chondrocytic cells have yet to be examined. Evidence suggests that abnormal mechanical loading of cartilage may be detrimental to the tissue. Pressure gradients generated from mechanical loading during daily activities drive interstitial fluid movement within the cartilage tissue, suggesting that fluid shear is a pathophysiologically relevant mechanical signal in cartilage metabolism. In this regard, our studies have been directed at examining the effects of shear flow on the regulation of COX-1 and COX-2 expression in chondrocytic cells, as well as elucidating potential upstream and downstream pathways, using microarray technology and computational analysis in conjunction with traditional molecular biology techniques. Our findings show that high shear stress (20 dyn/cm2) activates the signaling molecule c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2), which then triggers the phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun. These signaling events are involved in the shear-induced up-regulation of COX-2 at the mRNA and protein levels. Given that COX-1 is not regulated by fluid shear, we show, through the use of a specific COX-2 inhibitor, that COX-2 activity ultimately stimulates the synthesis of the prostaglandin receptor subtypes EP2 and EP3a1. Cell Culture—The human T/C-28a2 chondrocytic cell line (21Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin.

Biophys. 2000; 383: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was chosen as a model system for monitoring chondrocytic cellular responses to fluid shear for three important reasons. First, the T/C-28a2 cells have been extensively characterized and shown to behave much like primary human chondrocytes when cultured under appropriate conditions (21Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 22Kaarniranta K. Elo M. Sironen R. Lammi M.J.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Second, a sufficient number of primary human chondrocytic cells to perform microarray and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) experiments are difficult to obtain from a single operative procedure, whereas the chondrocytic phenotype is gradually lost in primary cultures over serial passaging. Finally, the inherent genetic variation in human chondrocyte cultures prepared from different cartilage donors could make reproducibility an issue. T/C-28a2 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.), supplemented with 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Paragon Biotech), and propagated for a maximum of 10 passages. Before shearing experiments, T/C-28a2 cells were detached from tissue culture flasks by mild trypsinization, then seeded (1 × 106 cells/ml) on 75 × 38-mm glass slides (Corning Glass) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. 24 h before shear stress exposure, T/C-28a2 cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline lacking Ca2+/Mg2+ (DPBS), and incubated in serum-free medium composed of 1:1 Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, supplemented with 1× antibiotic-antimycotic and 1% Nutridoma SP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to maintain chondrocytic phenotype (23Kokenyesi R. Tan L. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Throughout cell culturing and shearing experiments, the T/C-28a2 cells maintained their polygonal morphology and failed to exhibit Type I collagen expression, both of which are congruent with the chondrocyte phenotype (21Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Shear Stress Exposure—Confluent monolayers of T/C-28a2 cells were exposed to shear stress (4, 10, or 20 dyn/cm2) for predefined periods of time by using a parallel plate flow chamber placed in a flow loop gassed with 95% air and 5% CO2, and enclosed within a 37 °C convective air incubator (24Frangos J.A. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Ives C.L. Science. 1985; 227: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 25Diamond S.L. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Science. 1989; 243: 1483-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Serum-free media containing 1% Nutridoma was circulating in the shear apparatus for the duration of the experiment. As a control, T/C-28a2 cells were placed on flow chambers, but no shear flow was generated. These matched static specimens were otherwise exposed to the same conditions as their shear analogs. RNA Isolation—RNA from sheared specimens and their matched static controls was immediately isolated using TRIzolreagent (Invitrogen). T/C-28a2 cells from four independent flow chambers were pooled together to generate a sheared (or static) sample for either RPA or microarray analysis. RNA was quantified using UV spectrophotometry at the A of 260 nm, and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—RPA was used to quantify the relative mRNA expression levels for a selected number of genes at the end of shear flow exposure compared with static controls. Clones for c-Fos, JNK2, c-Jun, COX-1, COX-2, prostaglandin receptors EP3a1 and EP2, and the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Research Genetics) were digested at appropriate restriction sites to serve as in vitro transcription templates. Antisense RNA probes were generated using either T3 or T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [32P]UTP (ICN Radiochemicals), and allowed to hybridize overnight at 55 °C to 10 μg of total RNA isolated from the shear and static specimens. The RNA:RNA duplexes were digested with RNase at 30 °C for 1 h (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). RNase was inactivated by incubating with proteinase K (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) at 37 °C for 20 min, and extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Invitrogen). The mixture was ethanol precipitated, and RNA fragments were resolved using a denaturing 5% monomer (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel (National Diagnostics). The gel was dried, exposed to film, and bands of interest were subjected to densitometric analysis. Probe Generation and Purification for Microarray Experiments—10 μg of total RNA were reversed transcribed in a mixture containing 6 μg of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 m dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), 1× aminoallyl-dNTP mixture (25 mm concentrations of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mm dTTP, and 10 mm aminoallyl-dUTP) (Sigma), 1× reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C overnight. RNA template was then hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 m, respectively, at 70 °C for 15 min. Unincorporated aminoallyl-dUTP was removed using a Qiagen QIAquick column (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). The probe was eluted using a phosphate elution buffer (4 mm KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). To couple the aminoallyl with fluorescent labels, NHS-Cy3 (in static control samples) or NHS-Cy5 (in sheared specimens) (Amersham Biosciences) was added in the dark at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. Uncoupled label was removed using the QIAquick column (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). Microarray Hybridization, Normalization, and Analysis—Aminosilane-coated microscope slides printed with a set of 32,448 expressed sequence tags were prehybridized in 5× SSC (Invitrogen), 0.1% SDS (Invitrogen), and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 42 °C for 45 min (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). Subsequently, the slides were washed at RT with deionized water, dipped in 100% isopropanol at RT, and allowed to dry. Equal volumes of the Cy-3 and Cy-5 labeled probes were combined and supplemented with 20 μg each of COT1-DNA and poly(A)-DNA (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). This mixture was heated to 95 °C for 3 min, after which an equal volume of hybridization buffer, composed of 50% formamide (Roche), 10× SSC, and 0.2% SDS, was added. The probes were added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize at 42 °C overnight. Subsequently, the slide was sequentially washed in solutions containing 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 42 °C, 0.1× SSC and 0.2% SDS at RT, and 0.1× SSC at RT, each for 4 min (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar), then air-dried and scanned using the ScanArray 3000 (GSI Lumonics). Expression ratios from individual genes were extracted using TIGR Spotfinder, and normalized with the total intensity algorithm of the TIGR multiexperiment viewer (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed for each condition, thereby permitting an analysis that satisfies conservative statistical criteria. Genes with a ratio of measured Cy5-to-Cy3 intensities of ≥2.0 for each of the three experiments were considered positively regulated by shear stress, whereas those with a ratio of ≤0.5 were regarded as negatively regulated (12McCormick S.M. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Teng C.L. Lu C.M. Russell C.G. Chittur K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). After data normalization, average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis with a Euclidean distance metric was performed using the TIGR multiexperiment viewer (26Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 29. 2000: 548-550Google Scholar), in which genes are iteratively grouped together based on their distance metric. Alternatively, clustering analysis was performed using self-organizing maps (Euclidean distance metric, 3 × 3 hexagonal topology) (27Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2405) Google Scholar), in which a neural network is trained via competitive learning and subsequently used to cluster the gene expression data. Both clustering algorithms were executed on a data set containing elements that had a fluorescence value of at least 500 to eliminate points suffering from poor hybridization or spotting that may have potentially confounded the clustering output and interpretation. Western Hybridization—T/C-28a2 cells, from sheared and matched static control specimens, were harvested by mild trypsinization, and washed with DPBS. Total protein was liberated using a cell lysis buffer (10 mm NaPO4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 120 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor) (28Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred on PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked overnight in 5% blocking solution (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C, incubated with a primary antibody against JNK2, COX-1, COX-2, c-Jun, or phospho-c-Jun (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at RT, washed five times in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:3000; Sigma) at RT. The membrane was washed three times in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, and reactive bands were detected using a Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce). To ensure equal loading of samples in each lane, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin antibody (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Inhibition Studies—To inhibit viable JNK2, c-Jun, or c-Fos transcript, an antisense oligonucleotide specific for JNK2, c-Jun, or c-Fos (Isis Pharmaceuticals) was transfected into the T/C-28a2 cells. Briefly, confluent T/C-28a2 cells were washed and incubated with 400 nm c-Fos, JNK2, or c-Jun antisense oligonucleotide with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of serum-free medium. After 5 h, 1 ml of medium supplemented with 2% Nutridoma was added. Cells remained in a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h until they were exposed to shear flow or stationary conditions. β-Galactosidase staining was used to verify transfection efficiency. The antisense oligonucleotide targeting JNK2 and a mismatch control oligonucleotide were synthesized as uniform phosphorothioate, chimeric oligonucleotides with 2′-O-methoxyethylmodified sugars on nucleotides 1–5 and 16–20 and 2-deoxy sugars on nucleotides 6–15. The antisense oligonucleotides targeting c-Jun or c-Fos alone and a chemistry control oligonucleotide were synthesized as uniform phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and 2′-deoxy sugars on all nucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and purified as described previously (29Baker B.F. Lot S.S. Condon T.P. Cheng-Flournoy S. Lesnik E.A. Sasmor H.M. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11994-12000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these studies are as follows: JNK2 antisense 5′-GCTCAGTGGACATGGATGAG-3′; JNK2 control, 5′-GCACATTGCACGTGAATTAC-3′; c-Jun antisense, 5′-TCAGCCCCCGACGGTCTCTC-3′; c-Fos antisense, 5′-AAGTCCTTGAGGCCCACAGC-3′; c-Jun/c-Fos control, 5′-GTGCGCGCGAGCCCGAAATC-3′. To inhibit COX-2 enzyme activity, the specific inhibitor NS-398 (Cayman Chemical) was used at a concentration of 30 μm (30Copeland R.A. Williams J.M. Giannaras J. Nurnberg S. Covington M. Pinto D. Pick S. Trzaskos J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) within the flow media for the entire duration of the shear experiment as well as for their respective matched static control specimens. Immunofluorescence Analysis—T/C-28a2 cells on glass slides from sheared specimens and their matched static controls were washed with DPBS, and fixed for 2 min in either ice-cold pure acetone or methanol. Thereafter, specimens were washed in DPBS and incubated with 10% normal blocking serum for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with COX-2 antibody (2 μg/ml; Oxford Biomedical) in 1.5% normal blocking serum for1hat37 °C and subsequently underwent three 5-min washes with DPBS. A fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody was added for 45 min at RT, followed with three washes in DPBS. Samples were then mounted using antifade mounting medium and examined using confocal microscopy. To investigate chondrocytic cellular responses to fluid shear, T/C-28a2 chondrocytic cells were exposed to a stress level of 20 dyn/cm2 (representative of a high shear environment, as evidenced in previous studies (31Smith R.L.

Res. 2002; 20: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) for prescribed periods of time using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber placed in a flow loop. Microarray analysis revealed that 301 known genes responded to shear stress after a 24-h chondrocytic cell shear exposure, of which 188 were up-regulated and 113 were down-regulated compared with matched static controls. 2J. P. Abulencia, Z. R. Healy, and K. Konstantopoulos, unpublished observations. Shorter shear exposure times (1.5 h) resulted in the up- and down-regulation of 34 and 30 known genes, respectively, some of which are listed in Fig. 1. Using an average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm with Euclidean distance metric (TIGR multiexperiment viewer program), we determined that JNK2, c-Jun, and COX-2 are contained within the same subtree structure (supplemental Fig. 1a), thereby implicating co-regulation among the three genes upon T/C-28a2 cell exposure to fluid shear. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that the prostaglandin EP2 and EP3a1 receptors, which may act as potential downstream targets of the COX activity, are co-regulated although they reside in a subtree structure different from the one mentioned above (supplemental Fig. 1a). The gene expression data were also analyzed using self-organizing maps (Euclidean distance metric, 3 × 3 hexagonal topology). The results from this analysis indicate that JNK2, c-Jun, COX-2, and both prostaglandin EP2 and EP3a1 receptors are contained within the same cluster (supplemental Fig. 1b). Moreover, hierarchical analysis within the aforementioned cluster reveals the existence of distinct subtree structures in which JNK2, c-Jun, and COX-2 are tightly grouped together, separately from the prostaglandin EP2 and EP3a1 receptors (supplemental Fig. 1b). Cumulatively, these results indicate that the clustering pattern of the selected genes is conserved irrespective of the algorithm implemented. These microarray clustering data prompted us to hypothesize that fluid shear activates COX-2 via a JNK2-dependent pathway involving phosphorylation of c-Jun, which in turn elicits downstream EP2 and EP3a1 mRNA synthesis. As a first step, we examined the accuracy of the microarray gene expression profiling by performing an RPA analysis on the aforementioned genes. Fig. 1 shows microarray ratios, RPA ratios, and RPA autoradiographs on these selected genes at both 1.5 and 24 h. The results from the RPA analysis are in very good agreement with the microarray data, thus validating our microarray procedure and analysis. We next wished to systematically investigate whether up-regulation of JNK2, c-Jun, and COX-2 precedes that of EP2 and EP3a1. To this end, an RPA time-course experiment was performed at 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 16, and 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mRNA expression levels of JNK2, c-Jun, and COX-2 increased after exposure of chondrocytic cells to shear stress for 1.5 h and also remained elevated at the 24-h time point. In marked contrast, significant up-regulation of EP2 and EP3a1 mRNA expression occurred only after 24 h of shear exposure (Fig. 2B), and ensued COX-2 protein expression, which was detected at the 16-h time point (Fig. 3A). No COX-2 protein was detected at earlier time points in both static and sheared samples (Fig. 3A). Subsequent experiments aimed to determine the localization of COX-2 protein after the application of shear stress, using immunofluorescence analysis. In accord with the Western blotting data, COX-2 was absent from T/C-28a2 chondrocytic cells subjected to static (no-flow) conditions for 24 h (Fig. 3B). However, COX-2 staining was evident in chondrocytic cells sheared for 24 h at 20 dyn/cm2 and observed to be present in the cytosol and nuclear envelope of shear-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3A, effects of shear exposure time on COX-1 and COX-2 protein levels in T/C28a2 chondrocytic cells. Cells were exposed to shear stress (20 dyn/cm2) for durations ranging from 0.75 to 24 h. The constitutively expressed “housekeeping” pr"

Treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with retinoic acid results in increased tTG expression, which is both necessary and sufficient for differentiation. The goal of the present study was to determine whether tTG modulates the activation of the cyclic AMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein, CREB, an event that likely plays a central role in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with active wild type tTG, tTG without transamidating activity (C277S), an antisense tTG construct that depleted the endogenous levels of tTG, or vector only were used for the study. Treatment with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, increased that activation-associated phosphorylation of CREB, which was prolonged by tTG overexpression. CRE-reporter gene activity was also significantly elevated in the tTG cells compared with the other cells. The enhancement of CREB phosphorylation/activation in the tTG cells is likely due to the fact that tTG significantly potentiates cAMP production, and our findings indicate that tTG enhances adenylyl cyclase activity by modulating the conformation state of adenylyl cyclase. This is the first study to provide evidence of the mechanism by which tTG may contribute to neuronal differentiation.

Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, tTG is both necessary and sufficient for the neuronal differentiation of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The cyclic AMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein, CREB, was originally identified as a transcriptional activator that responds to cAMP and is phosphorylated and activated by protein kinase A (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). CREB belongs to the CREB transcription factor family that, besides CREB, consists of the cAMP modulatory protein (CREM) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) (22Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 23Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). CREB has been postulated to play a key role in the modulation of neuronal differentiation, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity in the vertebrate nervous system (24Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Indeed, CREB phosphorylation and CRE reporter gene activity are increased in cortical neurons during specific periods of nervous system development (25Pham T.A. Impey S. Storm D.R. Stryker M.P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CREB in SK-N-BE cells leads to morphological alterations typical of neuronal differentiation (26Ciani E. Guidi S. Della Valle G. Perini G. Bartesaghi R. Contestabile A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49896-49902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of a dominant negative CREB construct induced a round, poorly differentiated phenotype (26Ciani E. Guidi S. Della Valle G. Perini G. Bartesaghi R. Contestabile A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49896-49902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CREB has been described as the first transcription factor to be activated in response to an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels (27Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar).Cyclic AMP has multiple, diverse effects on cellular processes such as gene expression, cell cycle control, and cell survival-death decisions (for recent reviews, see Refs. 28Antoni F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 103-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyclic AMP also promotes neuronal survival in a manner independent of neurotrophic factors (32Hanson Jr., M.G. Shen S. Wiemelt A.P. McMorris F.A. Barres B.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 34Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although cAMP has been shown to have other functions in the cell, the primary mechanism by which it acts as a second messenger is by activation of protein kinase A (35Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), and CREB is a primary target of protein kinase A (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In a previous study (20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that tTG is required for development of the neuronal morphology of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Indeed, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the transglutaminase inhibitor monodansylcadaverine inhibited the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (36Singh U.S. Pan J. Kao Y.L. Joshi S. Young K.L. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that tTG is necessary for neuronal differentiation, the molecular mechanisms by which tTG contributes to this process are unclear. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to determine whether tTG modulates CREB phosphorylation/activation, which likely plays a significant role in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (37Sayas C.L. Moreno-Flores M.T. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37046-37052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 38Sanchez S. Sayas C.L. Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address this question, SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with active wild type tTG, tTG without transamidating activity (C277S), an antisense tTG construct that depletes endogenous tTG, or vector only (18Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were treated with forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator (39Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin treatment resulted in a significant enhancement of CREB phosphorylation that lasted longer in the cells overexpressing tTG compared with the other cell lines. Furthermore, CRE-reporter gene activity was also significantly elevated in the tTG-overexpressing cells compared with the other cells. The enhancement of CREB phosphorylation/activation in the tTG-overexpressing cells is likely due to the fact that tTG significantly potentiates cAMP production, and our findings indicate that tTG directly modulates adenylyl cyclase activity, most likely by facilitating the conversion of adenylyl cyclase into a more active conformation. This is the first study to provide evidence of the mechanism by which tTG may contribute to neuronal differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatments—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y stably expressing wild type tTG (tTG), tTG without transamidating activity due to a point mutation within the active site (C277S), and an antisense tTG DNA construct (anti-tTG) along with cells stably transfected with vector-only pcDNA3.1 (SH/pc) were described previously (18Tucholski J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In some experiments we used two different tTG cell lines, tTG-1 and tTG-2, and two different C277S cell lines, C277S-1 and C277S-2. The majority of experiments were carried out in the tTG-2 and C277S-2 cell lines, which are referred to as tTG cells and C277S cells, respectively, throughout.Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 10 μg/ml final concentration each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and sonicated on ice. Lysates were clarified, and the protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Lysates (10 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with following antibodies: anti-phospho (Ser133) CREB or anti-CREB from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-tTG (TG100) from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); anti-adenylyl cyclase (R-32); anti-Gαs (K-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Gαi (a gift from Dr. R. Jope) (40Li X. Mumby S.M. Greenwood A. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); or anti-actin from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). After incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were quantified using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 densitometer.Dual Luciferase Assay—Cells were grown in low serum conditions with 1% Fetal Clone II (HyClone) and 4% horse serum to ∼30% confluency prior to transient transfection with the pCRE-Luc reporter construct (Stratagene) and pRL-TK vector as an internal control (Promega, Madison, WI) at a 10:1 ratio. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were transferred to serum free media for 3 h subsequent to incubation for 4 h with 10 μm forskolin. Luciferase levels were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system kit (Promega) and a TD-2021 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The Firefly luciferase data was normalized to the Renilla luciferase values for each sample.Measurement of cAMP Accumulation—The levels of cAMP in control and stimulated cells were determined by using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 104 cells/well were plated in low serum conditions with 1% Fetal Clone II and 4% horse serum 12 h before being transferred to serum-free media for 3 h prior to treatment. After each treatment, the cells were rinsed and then incubated with the lysis reagent (0.5% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide) for 15 min at room temperature. Cellular extracts were then transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with donkey anti-rabbit antibody, and then rabbit antiserum against cAMP was added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h. cAMP-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were added to each individual well and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washing, peroxidase substrate was added, incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h, and the plate was read at 450 nm after stopping reaction with 50 μl of 1 m sulfuric acid.Statistics—Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTSElevated tTG Expression Leads to Enhanced CREB Phosphorylation and Its Transcriptional Activation in Response to Forskolin—Tissue TG is essential for retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (20Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Singh U.S. Pan J. Kao Y.L. Joshi S. Young K.L. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One of the proteins that likely plays a key role in differentiation and survival processes in neuronal cells is the CREB protein (24Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser133, located within a 60-amino acid kinase-inducible domain, is a prerequisite for CREB transcriptional activation (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). To enhance CREB phosphorylation on Ser133, cells were treated with forskolin, a direct adenylyl cyclase activator (39Seamon K.B. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 201-224PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, treatment with 10 μm forskolin resulted in a significant and transient increase in CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 in all of the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines (Fig. 1). However, in the tTG cells, forskolin treatment resulted in a more robust and sustained CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1). To determine whether the differences in CREB phosphorylation in response to forskolin treatment in the different SH-SY5Y cell lines resulted in differential CREB transcriptional activity, studies were carried out with a luciferase CRE-reporter vector. In the control SH/pc cells, forskolin treatment resulted in a significant increase in CRE-luciferase activity. CRE-luciferase was also elevated in the tTG cells in response to forskolin, although the increase was significantly greater then it was in the SH/pc cells (6.9-fold increase for the tTG cells compared with a 3.7-fold increase for the SH/pc cells) (Fig. 2). In contrast, forskolin-stimulated CRE activity was significantly attenuated in the anti-tTG cells compared with the SH/pc or tTG cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 2tTG significantly increases CREB transcriptional activity in response to forskolin treatment. SH/pc, tTG, anti-tTG, and C277S cells were transfected transiently with the pCRE (Firefly luciferase) reporter construct along with an internal control, pRL-TK vector (Renilla luciferase), followed by treatment with 10 μm forskolin. Luciferase activity was significantly greater in cells expressing wild type tTG and significantly suppressed in the anti-tTG cells compared with control cells (SH/pc) (mean ± S.E., n = 3 experiments; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)cAMP Accumulation Is Directly Modulated by tTG Expression in SH-SY5Y Cells—The data described above suggest that tTG may increase forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, which, in turn, leads to enhanced CREB activation. Therefore, basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels were measured in two different tTG cell lines, tTG-1 and tTG-2, and two different cell lines overexpressing transglutaminase inactive C277S-tTG, C277S-1 and C277S-2, along with the control SH/pc cells and the anti-tTG cells. Basal cAMP levels in all cell lines were in the range of 30–70 fmol/well (Fig. 3). However, after stimulation with 10 μm forskolin, the different cell lines exhibited significantly different increases in the levels of cAMP. In both wild type tTG-expressing cell lines, cAMP levels were elevated to a significantly greater extent compared with the SH/pc cells. In contrast, forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in the anti-tTG and the C277S cells were significantly lower than what was observed in the SH/pc cells (Fig. 3). Given the finding that both tTG cell lines and both C277S cell lines responded similarly, in all subsequent experiments just the tTG-2 and C277S-2 cells lines were used and referred to as tTG cells and C277S cells, respectively. These were also the cell lines used for Figs. 1 and 2.Fig. 3In response to forskolin treatment, cAMP levels increased to a significantly greater extent in cells overexpressing tTG. Cyclic AMP levels were measured under basal conditions (con) and, after stimulation with 10 μm forskolin (FSK), in vector control cells (SH/pc), two cell lines overexpressing wild type tTG (tTG-2 and tTG-1), two cell lines expressing C277S mutant tTG (C277S-2 and C277S-2), and the antisense tTG cells (anti-tTG). Forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was significantly greater in both wild type tTG-expressing cell lines compared with the control SH/pc cells (mean ± S.E., n = 3 experiments; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The level of intracellular cAMP is regulated by the balance between the activities of adenylyl cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) (42Tang W.J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 43Houslay M.D. Adams D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). To test whether the observed enhancement of cAMP accumulation in the tTG cells is due to a decrease in the levels and/or activity of PDE, cells were pretreated for 3 h with 30 μm rolipram, a specific inhibitor of the high-affinity cAMP PDE (44Wachtel H. Psychopharmacology. 1982; 77: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), prior to treatment with 10 μm forskolin for 5 min. Rolipram treatment significantly increased cAMP levels only in the tTG cells from a basal level of 46 ± 12 fmol cAMP/well to 281 ± 69 fmol cAMP/well after rolipram treatment (Fig. 4A). Treatment with rolipram and forskolin together resulted in a dramatic synergistic increase of cAMP in all the cell lines (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the extent of cAMP accumulation in the tTG cells was significantly greater then that observed in the other cell lines (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that decreases in PDE are not responsible for enhanced cAMP production in the tTG cells, as inhibiting PDE did not prevent the enhanced forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the tTG cells compared with the other cell lines.Fig. 4Inhibition of PDE with rolipram in cells overexpressing tTG results in cAMP accumulation. A, cAMP levels under basal conditions (con) and after treatment with 30 μm rolipram (Rol) were measured in SH/pc, tTG, anti-tTG, and C277S cells. The cAMP levels in the tTG cells after rolipram treatment were significantly increased when compared with control SH/pc cells (**, p < 0.001). B, cAMP levels were measured in the same cells in either the presence of rolipram alone (Rol) or rolipram and 10 μm forskolin (Rol + FSK). When cells were treated with rolipram and forskolin together, the accumulation of cAMP was significantly greater in the tTG cells compared with SH/pc cells (**, p < 0.001). All data is mean ± S.E., n = 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several studies indicate that there are two conformations of adenylyl cyclase for forskolin binding. There is a lower affinity binding state, wherein forskolin binds and activates adenylyl cyclase at concentrations of ≥10 μm, and a higher affinity binding state, in which forskolin can activate adenylyl cyclase at a concentration of ∼0.1 μm (45Barovsky K. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the higher affinity forskolin binding state of adenylyl cyclase is usually due to the binding of Gαs (46Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11369-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which results in a conformational change in adenylyl cyclase. Treatment of the cells with 0.1 μm forskolin for 5 min significantly increased cAMP levels only in the tTG cells from a basal level of 30 ± 20 fmol cAMP/well to 192 ± 26 fmol cAMP/well after forskolin treatment (Fig. 5A). In contrast, no changes in cAMP levels were observed in either the SH/pc or C277S cells (Fig. 5A). This suggests that adenylyl cyclase in the tTG cells may be in a conformation that allows forskolin to bind with a high affinity.Fig. 5Treatment of tTG cells with 0.1 μm forskolin (FSK) or CTX alone results in a significant elevation of cAMP levels. A, cAMP levels were measured in SH/pc, tTG, or C277S cells after incubation in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm forskolin. An elevation of cAMP in response to 0.1 μm forskolin was only observed in the tTG cells. B, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 20 μm CTX prior to the measurement of cAMP. A significant CTX-induced increase in cAMP was only observed in the tTG cells. C, cells were incubated with 20 μm CTX in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm forskolin. Although cAMP levels in cells treated with CTX and 0.1 μm forskolin were significantly greater than cAMP levels in cells treated with CTX alone, the levels of cAMP in the tTG cells were significantly greater than those observed in the other cell lines. D, cAMP levels were measured in cells incubated with 20 μm CTX alone, 10 μm forskolin alone, or in cells treated with CTX and, subsequently, 10 μm forskolin. CTX pretreatment of SH/pc and C277S cells, but not tTG cells, resulted in a synergistic increase in cAMP production in response to forskolin (mean ± S.E., n = 3 experiments; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess whether the Gαs subunit may be involved in the observed enhancement of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the tTG cells, cholera toxin (CTX) was used in the next set of experiments.

Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 32-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTX-induced stabilization of the activated conformation of Gαs results in a long-lived activation of adenylyl cyclase (49Cassel D. Selinger Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Treatment with 20 μm CTX alone for 4 h did not result in any significant increases in cAMP levels in either the SH/pc or C277S cells (Fig. 5B). However, CTX treatment of the tTG cells increased cAMP levels from 30 ± 20 fmol cAMP/well under basal conditions to 331 ± 83 fmol cAMP/well (Fig. 5B). Treatment with CTX and 0.1 μm forskolin together resulted in a dramatic synergistic increase in cAMP levels in all the cell lines (Fig. 5C); however, the extent of cAMP accumulation in the tTG cells was significantly greater then than that observed in the other cell lines (Fig. 5C). In the next set of experiments, cAMP accumulation was measured in the different cells lines after treatment with CTX alone for 4 h, 10 μm forskolin for 5 min, or CTX for 4 h and, subsequently, 10 μm forskolin for an additional 5 min (Fig. 5D).

https://openalex.org/W2054847175,"cJun is a major component of the transcription factor AP-1 and mediates a diverse set of biologic properties including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. To identify cJun-responsive genes, we inducibly expressed cJun in Rat-1a cells and observed two distinct phenotypes: changes in cellular morphology with adherent growth and anchorage-independent growth. The biologic effects of cJun were entirely reversible demonstrating that they require the continued presence of cJun. To determine the genes, which mediate the biologic effects of cJun, we employed multiple methods including differential gene analysis, suppression subtractive hybridization, and cDNA microarrays. We identified 38 cJun-responsive genes including three uncharacterized genes under adherent and/or nonadherent conditions. Half of the known 36 genes were cytoskeleton- and adhesion-related genes, suggesting a major role of cJun in the regulation of the genes related to cell morphology. As proof of the principle that this approach could identify genes whose upregulation was necessary for nonadherent growth, we investigated one gene, stathmin whose upregulation by cJun was observed only under these conditions. Although overexpression of stathmin did not result in nonadherent growth, inhibition of stathmin protein expression by antisense oligonucleotides in cJun-induced Rat-1a cells prevented nonadherent growth. These results suggest that stathmin plays an essential role in anchorage-independent growth by cJun and may be a potential target for specific inhibitors for AP-1-dependent processes involved in carcinogenesis."

This pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of the intermediate compounds, chorismate and prephenate, which are precursors to the aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp), catechols, and p-aminobenzoic acid (folic acid biosynthesis) as well as a number of other highly important microbial compounds (1Walsh C.T. Benson T.E. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3 (91): 93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAHP synthases exist in most microorganisms and plants. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this protein family has been separated into two classes, Class I and Class II, by Birck and Woodard (2Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Jensen and co-workers (3Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) classified DAHP synthases into two distinct homology families (AroAI and AroAII). The AroAII family was defined as “plant-like” DAHP synthases that included the higher plant proteins and a cluster of microbial proteins (5Gosset G. Bonner C.A. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The AroAI family was further divided into subfamilies AroAIα and AroAIβ, which correspond to Class II and Class I, respectively (4Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli expresses three DAHP synthase isoenzymes that are representative of Class II or the AroAIα family and require a divalent metal for activity (6Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20810-20817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the isoenzymes is specifically feedback-inhibited by only one of the three aromatic amino acids, Phe, Tyr, or Trp (7Brown K.D. Doy C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 157-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bacillus subtilis DAHP synthase, which is representative of Class I or the AroAIβ family, is inhibited by the intermediates prephenate and chorismate in the Shikimate pathway and has been reported by Jensen and Nester (8Jensen R.A. Nester E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3365-3372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jensen R.A. Nester E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3373-3380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be insensitive to EDTA treatment and was thus proposed as a non-metalloenzyme (2Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on the total lack of any information of a DAHP synthase from a thermophile, an investigation of a DAHP synthase from a thermophilic eubacterium was initiated in order to provide further insight into the biochemical reason for the bifurcation in the DAHP synthase phylogenetic tree. The extreme thermophile Thermotoga maritima DAHP synthase, which belongs to Class I (or the AroAIβ subfamily), was chosen for this study. Evolutionary studies have placed this bacterium in one of the deepest and most slowly evolving branches of the domain Bacteria (10Achenbach-Richter L. Gupta R. Stetter K.O. Woese C.R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1987; 9: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Bocchetta M. Gribaldo S. Sanangelantoni A. Cammarano P. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, studies on the DAHP synthase from this bacterium should provide a better understanding of the divergence of the two classes of DAHP synthase and the evolution of the aldol-like condensation catalyzed by this enzyme family. Herein the cloning, overexpression, purification, and biochemical characterization of the T. maritima DAHP synthase are reported. The metal requirements and feedback inhibition profile of the enzyme are also reported. This is the first description of a thermophilic eubacterial DAHP synthase. Materials and General Methods—Genomic T. maritima DNA was purchased from ATCC (ATCC 43589D). The Promega Wizard DNA purification kit was utilized for plasmid isolation and purification. The E. coli cells, XL1-Blue and BL21(DE3), were obtained from Stratagene Cloning System and Novagen, respectively. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Thermal cycling was performed using an MJR Research Thermal Cycler. DNA sequencing and primer syntheses were performed by the University of Michigan Biomedical Resources Core Facility. The PEP mono(cyclo-hexylammonium) salt, E4P sodium salt, d-arabinose 5-phosphate disodium salt, 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate sodium salt, d-ribose 5-phosphate disodium salt, reagent grade chorismate, shikimate, and prephenate were obtained from Sigma. Puratronic grade NiCl2, MgCl2, CoCl2, MnCl2, CdCl2, FeSO4, CuSO4, ZnSO4, and HCl (99.999%, metal basis) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. The 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (BTP) was purchased from Research Organics. The EDTA disodium salt was obtained from Mallinckrodt. High grade Spectra/Por® 7 dialysis tubing (M r 10,000 cutoff and metal-free) was obtained from VWR Scientific. The Mono Q (HR10/10), Phenyl Superose (HR10/10), Superose 12 (HR10/30), and FAST Desalting (HR10/10) chromatography columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent, with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) serving as the standard. Optical spectroscopy was performed using a HP 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Unless otherwise stated, the pH of all buffers was measured at 25 °C, and all purification steps were performed at 25 °C. Construction of Plasmids—Standard polymerase chain reaction methodologies were used to amplify the aroG-like gene (gi:7448834) from T. maritima genomic DNA. The forward primer was GATTCTGAATTCATATGATAGTCGTTTTGAAACCCGG, and the reverse primer was GATTCTGAATTCGGATCCTCAATTCACCTTCACCCCC. The amplification product was isolated, restricted with NdeI and BamHI (underlined), and ligated into the similarly restricted expression vector, pT7-7. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells. The presence of plasmids containing the desired gene from several transformants was verified by restriction analysis, and the gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. One plasmid with the correct sequence, pT7-aroG, was used to transform chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Overexpression and Purification of DAHP Synthase—The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pT7-aroG plasmid were grown in 2× YT medium containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C with shaking (220 rpm). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm when the culture reached an absorbance of 1.5. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation (29,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the pellet was suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the suspension was subjected to sonication on ice (30-s pulses with a 2-min rest between pulses, five times). The crude extract was centrifuged to remove cell debris (40,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Solid sodium chloride was added to the supernatant (typically, a solution of 40 ml containing 400 mg of total protein is obtained from a 1.0-liter culture) to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and the solution was heated at 80 °C for 1.5 min and then heated at 60 °C for 10 min with gentle continuous hand swirling. The suspension was allowed to cool to 25 °C and placed on ice for 15 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (29,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (32 ml; 64 mg of total protein) was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) overnight at 4 °C and then applied to a Mono Q column (HR 10/10) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was developed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m potassium chloride in the same buffer over 50 min. The fractions containing DAHP synthase activity as determined by the discontinuous assay were pooled (14 ml; 48 mg of total protein). Solid (NH4)2SO4 was slowly added with stirring to the pooled fractions to a final concentration of 25% (w/v). The sample was filtered (0.22 μm) and loaded onto a Phenyl Superose column (HR 10/10) equilibrated with 25% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. A reverse gradient from 25% to 0% (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A was applied at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min over 60 min, and elution was continued with buffer A for 20 min. The fractions containing DAHP synthase activity were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A overnight at 4 °C. The final preparation was homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE. The purified enzyme was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. DAHP Synthase Activity Assay—The DAHP synthase activity was determined by either discontinuous colorimetric assay or continuous spectrophotometric assay. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the production of 1 μmol of DAHP or the disappearance of 1 μmol of PEP per minute. The standard discontinuous colorimetric assay was measured in a final volume of 50 μl containing PEP (3 mm), DAHP synthase (varying amounts), and Tris acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.5) using thin-walled PCR tubes as the reaction vessel. The assay solution was preincubated at the desired temperature (2 min) utilizing a thermal cycler as a heat block, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of E4P to a final concentration of 3 mm. After the appropriate incubation times, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 10% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The amount of DAHP produced was quantitated using a modified Aminoff periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay (12Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The continuous spectrophotometric assay measures the disappearance of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl absorbance (τ = 232 nm, ϵ = 2,840 m–1 cm–1) of PEP in an assay mixture containing 100 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5), 300 μm PEP, 600 μm E4P, and 20–80 nm DAHP synthase. Molecular Weight Determinations—The subunit molecular weight of DAHP synthase was determined by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions on a 12% polyacrylamide gel with a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) and visualized with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 stain. The native molecular weight of DAHP synthase was determined by gel filtration utilizing a Superose 12 column (HR10/30) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The elution volume was determined in triplicate for all samples and standards. pH Dependence of DAHP Synthase—The activity of the enzyme (1 μm) was measured between pH 4.5 and 8.5 at 60 °C by discontinuous assay described above using either 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (pH 4.5–6.0), Tris acetate (pH 6.0–8.0), or glycylglycine (pH 8.0–8.5) at a concentration of 100 mm each. The pH values of the buffer solutions were measured at 60 °C. Reactions were carried out at the respective pH values for 30 s. Temperature Dependence and Thermostability of DAHP Synthase— Temperature dependence of the enzyme activity was determined by measuring the activity between 30 °C and 100 °C in 3 mm PEP, 3 mm E4P, 1 μm enzyme, and 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer using the discontinuous colorimetric assay. Because the pH of Tris buffer is quite temperature-dependent, the pH of each buffer was adjusted to pH 7.0 at the desired temperatures. For each temperature, the enzyme activity was measured by preincubating the Tris-HCl buffer for 2 min to allow it to reach the final pH of 7.0. A mixture of PEP and DAHP synthase (held at 25 °C in a small volume relative to the main reaction mixture) was then added, and the entire reaction mixture was incubated for 1 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of E4P and allowed to proceed for an additional 30 s. The thermostability of the enzyme was determined by incubating the purified enzyme (5.3 μm) in 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) at 60 °C, 70 °C, or 80 °C. At various times, aliquots of enzymes were removed, centrifuged, and assayed for residual activity at the respective incubation temperatures by the discontinuous colorimetric assay. Kinetic Studies—Reactions were carried out separately by continuous assay at 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C in 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) and 50 μm MnCl2. The concentration of one substrate was held constant (10 × K m), whereas the other was varied over the range of 0.1–10 × K m. Feedback Inhibition—Feedback inhibition of DAHP synthase was determined by incubating 0.5 μm enzyme and 3 mm PEP with a fixed concentration of possible inhibitor (1 mm) in 100 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) on ice for 40 min. The enzymatic activity was measured at 60 °C by discontinuous assay. Reactions were carried out for 3 min. Addition of the inhibitor after the enzymatic reaction but before the assay served as a control for potential interference of the inhibitor with the colorimetric assay. Preparation of Apo-DAHP Synthase—The DAHP synthase used for metal studies was purified by a modification of the method described above. The cells were suspended and sonicated in 10 mm BTP buffer (pH 7.0) instead of Tris-HCl buffer. The heat-treated supernatant containing the enzyme was diluted 2-fold with buffer B (10 mm BTP buffer, pH 7.0) containing 1 mm PEP and applied to a Mono Q column (HR 10/10) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was developed at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.3 m potassium chloride in buffer B over 80 min. PEP was added immediately to the fractions containing DAHP synthase to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-10 concentrator) to 8 mg/ml and used immediately in the following studies. The freshly purified DAHP synthase was treated with 10 mm EDTA in buffer B containing 0.5 mm PEP for 2 h at 25 °C and then dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer C (metal-free 10 mm BTP, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm PEP) for 24 h at 25 °C with two buffer changes. The metal-free BTP buffer was prepared from Chelex 100 Resin-treated 1 m BTP, metal-free HCl, and distilled deionized water (PURELAB Plus System). Dependence of DAHP Synthase Activity on Metals—To investigate the metal dependence of DAHP synthase activity, divalent metal ions were added to the continuous assay mixture, and the assay was performed as described above with the following modification. A metal-free 20 mm BTP buffer solution (pH 7.0) in a 1-ml cuvette was first incubated at 60 °C for 5 min before the addition of PEP, apo-enzyme (78 nm), and metal salt (10 μm). The entire reaction mixture was held at 60 °C for an additional 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of E4P, and the progress of the reaction was monitored for 2 min. The stoichiometry of DAHP synthase metal binding was determined by adding a 4-fold molar excess of metal salt per enzyme subunit to the apo-enzyme (100 μm) in buffer C. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, centrifuged, and then applied to a Fast Desalting column (HR 10/10), previously equilibrated with buffer C, to remove excess metal salts from the protein-metal complex. The column was developed at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min using the same buffer. The fraction eluting between 2.5 and 3.3 min post-sample injection containing the protein was collected. The protein concentration and enzymatic activity of each protein-metal complex were determined immediately. The identity and quantity of metals in the enzyme preparations and buffer solutions were determined by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on a Finnigan MAT ELEMENT instrument at the W. M. Keck Elemental Geochemistry Laboratory (Department of Geology, University of Michigan) by Dr. Ted Huston. In a separate experiment, the apo-enzyme was incubated with a mixture of the metal salts containing 1 molar equivalent of each metal per enzyme subunit (see Table IV), desalted, and analyzed as described above.Table IVMetal analysis of DAHP synthaseIncubation metal saltZincCadmiumManganeseCopperCobaltNickelMagnesiumIronSpecific activityMolar equivalent metal/enzyme subunitunits/mgAs isolated0.20—a—, value < 0.01.————0.010.059.0Zn2+ + as isolatedbEnzyme as isolated was incubated with 4-fold molar excess of Zn2+ and dialyzed.0.34—————0.010.048.7Apo-enzyme0.02—————0.010.020.6ZnSO40.40—————0.040.036.5CdCl20.030.43————0.020.035.2MnCl20.06—0.21———0.020.022.8CuSO40.02——0.23——0.010.022.2CoCl20.06———0.250.040.020.022.0NiCl20.03————0.160.010.021.5MgCl20.02—————0.030.020.5AllcApo-enzyme was incubated with 1 mol equivalent each of a mixture of metal salts and desalted as described above.0.140.210.020.040.060.010.020.025.0BlankdA solution, without enzyme, comprising all of the metal salts (400 μm each), was subjected to gel filtration under conditions identical to those used for the enzyme-containing samples.

Open table in a new tab To determine the metal content of the enzyme directly after purification, the enzyme as isolated was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B overnight at 25 °C. In another experiment, the enzyme as isolated was treated with a 4-fold molar excess of Zn2+ per subunit for 2 h at 25 °C and then dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B overnight. The dialyzed enzyme samples were assayed for protein concentration and enzymatic activity and subjected to metal analysis as described above. As a control, the metal content of the dialysis buffer after dialysis was analyzed. The time dependence of Cu2+ binding to T. maritima apo-DAHP synthase was determined by adding CuSO4 (400 μm, final concentration) to 100 μm apo-enzyme in buffer C that had been preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Spectra were taken 5, 10, and 30 min after addition of Cu2+ at 37 °C. Sequence Alignments—Sequences were aligned using Clustal W (13Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55405) Google Scholar). Overexpression and Purification of the Enzyme—The T. maritima DAHP synthase was highly overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the pT7-aroG plasmid. The purification procedure was developed by taking advantage of the expected thermal stability of the protein. Heat treatment of the cell extract resulted in substantial precipitation of the host cell proteins, whereas negligible loss of total enzymatic activity was observed. After two chromatographic steps, the recombinant protein was determined to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. The typical yield of purified protein was 30–40 mg/liter cell culture. Physical Properties—The molecular weight of the purified enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE was 38,000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography was 134,000, 3.5 times the molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE. For comparison, the Phe-sensitive E. coli DAHP synthase (David L. Howe, this laboratory) was subjected to similar analysis. The molecular weight of the native E. coli enzyme is 3.4 times that of its monomer. Based on its crystal structure, E. coli DAHP synthase (Phe-sensitive) has been assumed to be that of a tetramer (14Shumilin I.A. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, T. maritima enzyme is likely to adopt a tetrameric structure. pH Optimum—The purified enzyme exhibited the highest enzymatic activity (>90% of maximum) between pH 6.0 and 7.0, with an optimum of pH 6.3 at 60 °C (Fig. 1). Temperature Optimum and Thermostability—During preliminary experiments, it was determined that the substrate PEP is about 10 times more stable at higher temperatures than the other substrate, E4P (data not shown). Based on these findings, the enzyme assays were carried out by preincubation of PEP and enzyme at a desired temperature. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of E4P, and the substrates were allowed to react for 30 s after the addition of E4P. The reaction rates were measured under initial rate conditions between 30 °C and 80 °C (data not shown). Enzyme activities at higher temperatures could not be measured accurately due to the thermal instability of E4P. Under these restricting reaction conditions, the temperature optimum was found to be 90 °C (Fig. 2). An Arrhenius plot of the data (Fig. 2, inset) showed a transition point at 60 °C, resulting in activation energy values of 62 kJ/mol between 30 °C and 60 °C and 51 kJ/mol between 60 °C and 80 °C. The thermostability of the purified DAHP synthase was determined at 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C (Fig. 3). After 9 h of incubation at 60 °C, maximum DAHP synthase activity was reached as compared with that of the enzyme as isolated when assayed at 60 °C. Further incubation at 60 °C resulted in diminished activity. No significant gain or loss of enzyme activity was observed for the first 5 h at 70 °C; however, the enzyme activity appeared to decrease exponentially after 5 h. When incubated at 80 °C, a simple exponential decay was observed. As shown in Fig. 3, 50% of the enzyme activity was retained after ∼5 h (80 °C), 21 h (70 °C), and 86 h (60 °C) of incubation. Kinetic Studies—The kinetic constants of DAHP synthase were determined for E4P and PEP under saturating conditions at various temperatures (Table I). The enzyme exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K m for PEP = 9.5–13 μm, K m for E4P = 57.3–350.1 μm, and k cat = 2.3–7.6 s–1 between 50 °C and 70 °C. The K m value for E4P increased with increasing temperature, whereas the K m for PEP was not greatly affected by temperature.Table IKinetic constants of DAHP synthase at various temperaturesTemperature (°C)kcatKm PEPKm E4Ps-1μMμM502.3 ± 0.213.0 ± 2.657.3 ± 4.3605.0 ± 0.311.7 ± 1.5138.0 ± 10.6707.6 ± 0.59.5 ± 1.1350.1 ± 21.6 Open table in a new tab Feedback Inhibition—The data in Table II illustrate the effects of possible feedback inhibitors on DAHP synthase activity. The results showed that l-Phe and l-Tyr significantly inhibited T. maritima DAHP synthase with only 32% and 23% of activity remaining, respectively. The compounds l-Trp, chorismate, shikimate, prephenate, d-Phe, and l-His had no effect on enzymatic activity under the experimental conditions.Table IIFeedback inhibition of DAHP synthaseCompoundsActivity remaining after treatment%NoneaAddition of the inhibitor after enzymatic reaction but before assay served as control for potential interference of inhibitor with the colorimetric assay.100L-Phe32 ± 2L-Tyr23 ± 2L-Trp102 ± 3Chorismate106 ± 2Shikimate95 ± 3Prephenate94 ± 3D-Phe103 ± 1L-His98 ± 4a Addition of the inhibitor after enzymatic reaction but before assay served as control for potential interference of inhibitor with the colorimetric assay. Open table in a new tab Metal Requirement—The results from the metal analysis studies demonstrated that the enzyme as isolated contains ∼0.20 mol equivalent of Zn2+ per subunit and trace amounts of other metals (Table IV). Furthermore, when the above-mentioned enzyme was incubated with a 4-fold molar excess of Zn2+ per subunit and then dialyzed to remove non-bound Zn2+, 70% more Zn2+ was incorporated, yet the specific activity was unchanged. To investigate the metal requirements for DAHP synthase activity, the enzyme as isolated was treated with EDTA. EDTA inactivated the enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Apo-DAHP synthase was prepared by treating enzyme with 10 mm EDTA followed by extensive dialysis against metal-free buffer. The enzymatic activity was reduced to 0.6 unit/mg or 7% that of the untreated enzyme. The apo-enzyme was reconstituted by adding a divalent metal ion directly to the assay mixture (Table III). The results from these experiments demonstrated that Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ restored the enzymatic activity to 3–5 units/mg, whereas Fe2+ and Mg2+ had little effect on enzyme activity.Table IIIActivation of apo-DAHP synthase after preincubation with metalsMetal saltSpecific activityunits/mgAs isolated9.0 ± 1.0Apo-enzyme0.6 ± 0.2MnCl25.3 ± 0.4ZnSO45.0 ± 0.4CdCl24.9 ± 0.3NiCl24.6 ± 0.8CoCl24.2 ± 0.5CuSO43.0 ± 0.1FeSO41.0 ± 0.2MgCl20.8 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab In order to determine the stoichiometry of the enzyme-metal complex, the apo-enzyme was incubated with a 4-fold molar excess of metal salt per subunit followed by the removal of free metal by gel filtration. The protein-metal fraction was analyzed for specific activity and metal content. As can be seen from Table IV, the DAHP synthase binds twice as much Cd2+ and Zn2+ as Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+. When apo-enzyme was incubated with a mixture of metals (1 mol equivalent of each of the above metals per subunit), the DAHP synthase bound mainly Zn2+ and Cd2+ as well as a trace amount of the other metals. As can also be seen in Table IV, DAHP synthase activity was only partially restored. Furthermore, the Zn2+ reconstituted apo-enzyme could bind twice as much Zn2+ but only regained 72% of the specific activity as compared with the original enzyme. Because Cu2+ has been shown to bind to a number of DAHP synthases, leading to a spectral signature that provided insight into the nature/identity of the enzyme's metal ligands (6Stephens C.M.

https://openalex.org/W1992480558,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a major regulator of bone metabolism, activates the PTHR1 receptor on the osteoblast plasma membrane to initiate signaling and induce transcription of primary response genes. Subsequently, primary genes with transcriptional activity regulate expression of downstream PTH targets. We have identified the adenovirus E4 promoter-binding protein/nuclear factor regulated by IL-3 (E4bp4) as a PTH-induced primary gene in osteoblasts. E4BP4 is a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that represses or activates transcription in non-osteoblastic cells. We report here that PTH rapidly and transiently induced E4bp4 mRNA in osteoblastic cells and that this induction did not require protein synthesis. PTH also induced E4BP4 protein synthesis and E4BP4 binding to a consensus but not to a mutant E4BP4 response element (EBPRE). E4BP4 overexpression inhibited an EBPRE-containing promoter-reporter construct, whereas PTH treatment attenuated activity of the same construct in primary mouse osteoblasts. Finally, E4BP4 overexpression inhibited PTH-induced activity of a cyclooxygenase-2 promoter-reporter construct. Our data suggest a role for E4BP4 in attenuation of PTH target gene transcription in osteoblasts. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a major regulator of bone metabolism, activates the PTHR1 receptor on the osteoblast plasma membrane to initiate signaling and induce transcription of primary response genes. Subsequently, primary genes with transcriptional activity regulate expression of downstream PTH targets. We have identified the adenovirus E4 promoter-binding protein/nuclear factor regulated by IL-3 (E4bp4) as a PTH-induced primary gene in osteoblasts.

However, the target cell of PTH in bone is the osteoblast, which expresses PTHR1, a G protein-coupled heptahelical receptor that also binds PTH-related peptide (4Strewler G.J. J. Clin.

Ligand-bound PTHR1 initiates signaling cascades that phosphorylate and activate transcription factors that in turn induce transcription of several primary response genes (8Fujimori A. Cheng S.L. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 29-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Partridge N.C. Bloch S.R. Pearman A.T. J. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Primary gene products perform many functions and ultimately lead to changes in osteoblastic phenotype. To map early changes in regulation of osteoblastic primary gene expression, we performed representational difference analysis (RDA) of mRNA from control and PTH-treated osteoblastic cells (11Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we report that PTH rapidly induced expression of the bZIP transcription factor adenovirus E4 promoter-binding protein/nuclear factor regulated by IL-3 (E4BP4). E4bp4 was isolated by screening a placental cDNA λgt11 expression library for binding to the ATF site of the adenovirus E4 promoter (12Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or to the CRE/ATF-like sequence of the upstream regulatory region of the human IL-1β gene (13Chen W.J. Lewis K.S. Chandra G. Cogswell J.P. Stinnett S.W. Kadwell S.H. Gray J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Later, through screening of an expression λgt11 cDNA library prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T-cell mRNA for binding to regulatory sequences of the IL3 promoter, a nuclear factor named NF-IL3 was identified and found to be identical to E4bp4 (14Zhang W. Zhang J. Kornuc M. Kwan K. Frank R. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6055-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 2-kb cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1386 bases and encodes a 462-amino acid (51.4 kDa) protein (12Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). E4BP4 is a bZIP transcription factor and acts both as a transcriptional repressor and transcriptional activator. E4BP4 has been hypothesized to be involved in cellular functions such as cell survival versus apoptosis, the anti-inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm regulation (15Cowell I.G. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, no involvement of E4BP4 expression in the function of bone cells has been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that PTH rapidly and transiently induced E4bp4 mRNA in primary mouse osteoblasts and that this induction did not require new protein synthesis. PTH also induced E4BP4 protein synthesis. Furthermore, PTH induced nuclear protein binding to a consensus E4BP4 response element (EBPRE). A specific E4BP4 antibody supershifted the majority of this binding action. E4BP4 overexpression inhibited promoter activity of a reporter luciferase construct containing EBPRE consensus sites in primary osteoblasts. PTH treatment attenuated the promoter activity of the same construct. Finally, E4BP4 overexpression inhibited PTH-induced activity of a cyclooxygenase-2 promoter-reporter construct. Our data suggest that E4BP4 induction might mediate PTH inhibition of target gene transcription. Cell Culture—Primary mouse osteoblasts (MOB) were obtained from the calvariae of neonatal mice as previously described (11Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2, and MOB cells were plated at 15,000 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. ROS 17/2.8 cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 and were grown in F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were grown in non-differentiating media (no ascorbic acid or β-glycerophosphate) and were treated with agents at the time of confluence. Mouse Calvariae Organ Culture—Hemicalvariae from 6- to 8-day-old CD-1 mice were dissected and cultured individually in 6-well dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) containing 2 ml of BGJb medium (Invitrogen) with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All animals used in these studies were sacrificed according to protocol approved by the UCLA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ARC number 1998-175-12). RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Assays—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twelve to fifteen micrograms of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/3.7% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Gene Screen Plus hybridization filter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Filters were prehybridized at 68 °C for 15 min, hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h using the QuickHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a 32P-labeled probe (see below). Filters were washed and were used to expose radiographic film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at –80 °C. E4bp4 mRNA intensity was measured and corrected for GAPDH expression using a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—To generate a full-length E4bp4 probe, mRNA from MC3T3-E1 cells treated with 10 nm PTH for 2 h, was reverse-transcribed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). cDNA was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers that span the full-length open reading frame of E4bp4 (sense primer, 5′-CCG CCA TGC AGC TGA GAA AAA TGC AG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TTA TTA CCT GGA GTC CGA AGC CG-3′ (16Tetradis S. Nervina J.M. Nemoto K. Kream B.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). The resulting amplification product was purified and subcloned into the pcDNA 3.1 expression vector downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To generate E4bp4 cDNA probe for Northern analysis, the E4bp4 cDNA insert was excised, gel-purified, and labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primer labeling technique. Total and Nuclear Protein Extraction—MOB cells were treated accordingly and then washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. For total protein extracts, cells were resuspended for 30 min in 1 ml of triple detergent lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1× protease inhibitors. Lysates were spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used for Western blot assays. Nuclear proteins were prepared as previously described (17Tomaras G.D. Foster D.A. Burrer C.M. Taffet S.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) supplemented with freshly added 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for 15 min on ice. Then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the cells were vortexed vigorously for 10 s and centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 s in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with freshly added 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor. After incubating for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform, nuclear lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. Western Blot Analysis—Fifty micrograms total or nuclear proteins were combined with equal volume of 2× loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking at 20 mA and 10% resolving gel at 40 mA), and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 22 V and 4 °C. Membranes were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid (v/v) to determine equal loading. Then membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (0.5% Tween), incubated with a polyclonal E4BP4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, catalog number SC-9549) at 1:100 dilution in 5% nonfat milk/TBS-T for 1–2 h at room temperature, washed with TBS-T, and incubated with anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in 5% nonfat milk/TBS-T for 1 h. Following incubation, membranes were washed with TBS-T, and proteins were visualized using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions and autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) carrying an E4BP4 consensus response element (EBPRE, 5′-GGGGATCCGTTATGTAACGGATCC-3′) or EBPRE with single nucleotide mutations (EBPRE-m1, 5′-GGGGATCCGTTATtTAACGGATCC-3′; EBPRE-m2, 5′-GGGGATCCGTaATGTAACGGATCC-3′) were used (12Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In vitro protein synthesis was performed using the TnT Quickcouple Transcription/Translation kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear or in vitro-synthesized proteins were incubated with probes in the presence of EMSA buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI·dC), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) at room temperature for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were resolved by non-denaturing 4% PAGE in 0.5× TBE at 135 V for 1.5 h. The gel was fixed with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 10 min, dried onto Whatman 3MM paper, and used to expose x-ray film. For supershift experiments, proteins were incubated with 1.5 μl of antibody for 20 min at room temperature prior to loading onto gel. Transfection—Three tandem wild type or mutant EBPREs, described earlier, were subcloned into the pTK-luciferase vector (pTK-LUC, ATCC, Manassas, VA) upstream of the basal thymidine kinase promoter to generate pTK-EBPRE, pTK-EBPRE-m1, and pTK-EBPRE-m2 luciferase reporter constructs. MOB cells were plated in 24-well plates at 50–60% confluence and were co-transfected with 75 ng/well pcDNA3.1-E4BP4 expression vector or with an equimolar amount of pcDNA3.1 empty vector and 75 ng/well pTK-EBPRE, pTK-EBPRE-m1, or pTK-EBPRE-m2 reporter construct utilizing LipofectAMINE Plus and the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 2–4 days later luciferase assay was performed with the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using microplate reader (Multiscan, Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Statistics—Statistical differences between two groups were detected with Student's t test. Comparisons among groups were performed by analysis of variance, and statistical differences were detected with a Bonferroni post hoc test. All experiments were performed at least three times. PTH Induced E4bp4 Gene Expression in the Absence of Protein Synthesis in MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells—Using RDA to identify osteoblastic primary response genes induced by PTH (11Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we cloned a DNA fragment that corresponded to E4bp4 (data not shown). To confirm that E4bp4 was a PTH-induced primary response gene, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 10 μg/μl CHX for 30 min followed by 10 nm PTH for 90 min. Total RNA was extracted, and Northern blot analysis was performed using the RDA-isolated cDNA fragment as a probe. E4bp4 was constitutively expressed in CHX-treated cells and was markedly induced by PTH treatment (Fig. 1A). PTH Induced E4bp4 mRNA Levels in MC3T3-E1 and ROS 17/2.8 Osteoblastic Cells in a Time-dependent Manner—Confluent MC3T3-E1 and ROS 17/2.8 cells were treated with 10 nm PTH for 1–6 h. RT-PCR of total RNA utilizing E4bp4-specific primers demonstrated that PTH induced E4BP4 mRNA in both osteoblastic cell lines with a peak at 2 h (Fig. 1B). DNA sequencing confirmed that the PCR product had the previously published E4bp4 sequence (accession number NM_017373, National Institutes of Health data base). PTH Induced E4bp4 Expression in Primary Mouse Osteoblasts and Calvariae—MC3T3-E1 and ROS 17/2.8 cells are immortalized cell lines that retain a pre-osteoblastic/osteoblastic phenotype. To test if PTH induces E4bp4 gene expression in primary osteoblastic cells and normal bone, MOB cells or calvariae organ cultures were treated with 10 nm PTH for various times, total RNA was extracted, and Northern blot analyses were performed. PTH-induced E4bp4 mRNA expression in both MOB cells and cultured calvariae peaked at 2 h and declined thereafter (Fig. 2). PTH Induction of E4bp4 mRNA Does Not Require New Protein Synthesis in MOB Cells and Is Regulated at the Transcriptional Level—To verify that E4bp4 is a PTH-induced primary response gene in MOB cells and to investigate if E4bp4 gene transcription is required for the PTH effects, MOB cells were pretreated with 3 μg/ml CHX or with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (ActD) for 30 min and then with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h (Fig. 3). Pretreatment with CHX enhanced PTH-induced E4bp4 mRNA levels that were sustained for the duration of the experiment. Pretreatment with ActD completely inhibited PTH-induced E4bp4 mRNA expression (Fig. 3). PTH Induced E4BP4 Protein Synthesis in MOB Cells—To determine if PTH induced E4BP4 protein synthesis, MOB cells were treated with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h, and total or nuclear proteins were extracted. Western immunoblot analysis indicated that PTH induced E4BP4 protein expression in MOB cells that peaked between 2 and 4 h and declined thereafter (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with both total and nuclear proteins, although nuclear proteins demonstrated a delayed peak and decline (Fig. 4, compare A and B). Recombinant E4BP4 protein was used as a control (lane R, Fig. 4A). PTH Induced Nuclear Protein Binding to a Consensus E4BP4 Response Element (EBPRE)—EMSAs were performed to test the ability of in vitro synthesized E4BP4 protein to bind consensus or either of two mutant EBPREs. E4BP4 bound with high, moderate, and low affinity to wild type EBPRE, to EBPRE-m1, and to EBPRE-m2, respectively (Fig. 5A). In vitro synthesized luciferase control showed no binding to the DNA probes. To investigate potential PTH-induced binding to the consensus or mutant EBPREs, EMSAs utilizing nuclear proteins from PTH-treated MOB cells and the EBPRE probes were performed. Untreated cells showed a low binding of nuclear proteins to the consensus EBPRE. Treatment with 10 nm PTH increased this binding that peaked at 4 h and declined by 6 h. Similar to in vitro synthesized E4BP4, the binding of the nuclear extracts was reduced or almost abolished when EBPRE-m1 or EBPRE-m2 probes were used (Fig. 5B). The PTH-induced binding to the EBPRE probe was completely, partially, or minimally inhibited by 25× and 50× excesses of EBPRE, EBPRE-m1, or EBPRE-m2 cold competitor suggesting specific binding of the nuclear proteins to the wild type probe (Fig. 5C). E4BP4 Protein Is Part of the PTH-induced Binding to a Consensus EBPRE—Basal E4BP4 mRNA and protein levels were very low, whereas PTH treatment significantly induced E4bp4 gene expression. To test if the PTH-induced binding to the consensus EBPRE was due to an existing or to a newly synthesized protein, such as E4BP4, MOB cells were pretreated with 3 μg/ml CHX for 30 min and then treated with 10 nm PTH for 0–6 h. Nuclear extracts were utilized for EMSAs. In the absence of CHX, PTH induced binding to the EBPRE. However, CHX abolished this PTH effect suggesting that the PTH-induced binding was due to newly synthesized proteins (Fig. 6A). To confirm that E4BP4 was part of the PTH-induced complexes, we utilized a polyclonal antibody against E4BP4 protein. First we determined that the antibody was able to supershift in vitro synthesized E4BP4 protein. E4BP4 or luciferase proteins were incubated with EBPRE probes and then with E4BP4 antibody or a nonspecific antibody (Nurr1 antibody at the same concentration, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, catalog number SC-990). The E4BP4 antibody supershifted the entire E4BP4·EBPRE binding complex, whereas the nonspecific antibody had no effect (Fig. 6B). Similarly, the E4BP4 antibody supershifted part of the PTH-induced nuclear extract·EBPRE complex, whereas the nonspecific antibody had no effect. Interestingly, not all of the PTH-induced complexes were supershifted, in contrast to the in vitro synthesized E4BP4 protein (Fig. 6C). Because the consensus EBPRE is very similar to the consensus C/EBPβ binding site (18Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that C/EBPβ is part of the PTH-inducible binding to the EBPRE. Indeed, a C/EBPβ antibody supershifted part of the PTH-induced nuclear extract·EBPRE complex (Fig. 6D). E4BP4 Inhibited Promoter Activity in Osteoblasts—To study the regulatory role of E4BP4 on osteoblastic gene expression, MOB cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-E4BP4 or empty vector and with pTK-Luc, pTK-EBPRE, pTK-EBPRE-m1, or pTK-EBPRE-m2 reporter constructs. E4BP4 overexpression had no effect on the basal thymidine kinase promoter activity. However, E4BP4 strongly inhibited pTK-EBPRE activity by 92% (Fig. 7A). When mutant EBPREs were inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter, E4BP4 overexpression inhibited promoter activity to a lesser degree (pTK-EBPRE-m1 by 59% and pTK-EBPRE-m2 by 39%), in parallel to the ability of E4BP4 to bind these mutant sites, as described above. Because E4BP4 overexpression inhibited luciferase activity of the pTK-EBPRE reporter construct, we tested the ability of PTH treatment to affect this construct. MOB cells were transfected with pTK-Luc, pTK-EBPRE, pTK-EBPRE-m1, or pTK-EBPRE-m2 reporter constructs and then treated with PTH for 12 h. PTH treatment caused a statistically significant attenuation of the promoter activity by 25%, compared with the untreated control (Fig. 7B). In contrast, PTH treatment had no statistical effect on the pTK-EBPRE-m1 or pTK-EBPRE-m2 constructs (Fig. 7B). Finally, we tested the ability of E4BP4 to affect activity of endogenous promoters. Computer analysis revealed four EBPRE-like elements (seven of eight nucleotides) within the proximal 963 bp of the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) promoter (the kind gift of Dr. Harvey Herschman, UCLA). MOB cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter that contained 1 kb of the cox-2 promoter and with pcDNA3.1-E4BP4 or empty vector. Four days later, cells were treated with vehicle or 10 nm PTH for 3 h, and luciferase activity was measured. As previously described (19Tetradis S. Pilbeam C.C. Liu Y. Herschman H.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), PTH induced cox-2 promoter activity (Fig. 7C). E4BP4 overexpression inhibited basal luciferase activity, although not at statistically significant levels. More importantly, E4BP4 overexpression significantly inhibited PTH-induced cox-2 promoter activity. PTH has important effects on bone metabolism (1Rubin M.R. Cosman F. Lindsay R. Bilezikian J.P. Osteoporos. Int. 2002; 13: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts are the direct PTH target in bone, yet the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of PTH on osteoblastic gene expression remain largely elusive (9Partridge N.C. Bloch S.R. Pearman A.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PTH-triggered osteoblast activity begins with the rapid and transient induction of primary response gene expression (9Partridge N.C. Bloch S.R. Pearman A.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Subsequently, primary gene products mediate downstream PTH effects (19Tetradis S. Pilbeam C.C. Liu Y. Herschman H.R. Kream B.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3594-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Kream B.E. LaFrancis D. Petersen D.N. Woody C. Clark S. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A. Mol.

Among the primary genes induced by PTH are several transcription factors, including the AP-1 transcription factors c-fos and c-jun (23Clohisy J.C. Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the nuclear orphan receptors Nurr1 (11Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Nur77 (24Tetradis S. Bezouglaia O. Tsingotjidou A. Vila A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the transcriptional repressor ICER (16Tetradis S. Nervina J.M. Nemoto K. Kream B.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PTH induced E4BP4, which appears to be a transcriptional repressor in osteoblasts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of osseous localization and PTH regulation of E4bp4 gene expression. E4BP4 is constitutively present in a variety of tissues, including spleen, prostate, testis, ovary, heart, brain, lung, liver, and skeletal muscle (25Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J.

In addition, E4BP4 expression is induced by phytohemagglutinin, thapsigargin, and phorbol ester in T-cells (14Zhang W. Zhang J. Kornuc M. Kwan K. Frank R. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Similar to other tissues, osteoblastic cell lines and calvariae demonstrated low basal expression of E4bp4 mRNA levels. PTH treatment rapidly and transiently induced E4bp4 gene expression that peaked around 2 h and declined thereafter. In MC3T3-E1 and MOB cells, PTH-induced E4bp4 mRNA levels did not require protein synthesis suggesting that E4bp4 is a primary response gene in PTH-treated osteoblasts. In fact, CHX pretreatment led to sustained E4bp4 mRNA levels following PTH treatment. This is in agreement with the glucocorticoid induction of E4bp4 in mouse fibroblasts, where CHX pretreatment enhances the induction of E4bp4 mRNA levels (28Wallace A.D. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our findings contrast the observation that CHX abolishes IL-3-induced E4bp4 expression"

However peroxynitrite (ONOO–), an oxidant formed from the reaction of NO• and superoxide, appears mostly detrimental to cell function. This occurs both through direct oxidant reactions and by decreasing the availability of NO• for interacting with CcOX. When isolated CcOX respires with ascorbate as a reducing substrate, the conversion of ONOO– to NO• is observed. It is not known whether this can be ascribed to a direct interaction of the enzyme with ONOO–. In this investigation, the role of ascorbate in this system was examined using polarographic methods to measure NO• production and CcOX activity simultaneously in both the purified enzyme and isolated mitochondria. It was found that ascorbate alone accounts for >90% of the NO• yield from ONOO– in the presence or absence of purified CcOX in turnover. The yield of NO was CcOX-independent but was dependent on ascorbate and ONOO– concentrations and was not affected by metal chelators. Consistent with this, the interaction of ONOO– with CcOX in respiring isolated mitochondria only yielded NO• when ascorbate was also present in the incubation. These observations are discussed in the context of ONOO–/ascorbate reactivity and the interaction of CcOX with reactive nitrogen species.

Nitric oxide (NO•), 1The abbreviations used are: NO•, nitric oxide; ONOO–, peroxynitrite; AscH·¯ , ascorbyl radical; CcOX, cytochrome c oxidase; DHA, dehydroascorbate; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; O2·¯ , superoxide anion; TMPD, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. endogenously produced by the NO•-synthase family of enzymes, is thought to modulate mitochondrial respiration by reversibly inhibiting complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX) (1Sarti P.

Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This interaction has been suggested to play a key role in both mitochondrial physiology and intracellular redox signaling (2Brookes P.S. Levonen A.L. Shiva S. Sarti P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, prolonged exposure of mitochondria to NO• results in irreversible damage to several mitochondrial proteins (complexes I, II, IV, V, aconitase, manganese superoxide dismutase) and these changes are likely to contribute to its cytotoxicity (3Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These deleterious effects have been attributed to peroxynitrite (ONOO–), which is produced by the reaction between NO• and superoxide (O2·¯ ), the latter reported to be generated in substantial amounts within mitochondria (3Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies have shown that direct addition of ONOO– to mitochondria results in inhibition of the same mitochondrial proteins as inhibited by long term NO• exposure (3Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 4Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Direct or indirect scavenging of ONOO– in the mitochondrion by intracellular antioxidants such as glutathione is, therefore, of critical importance to NO• biology and could control the balance between physiological and pathological effects of reactive nitrogen species in the organelle (5Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Besides the ubiquitous cellular defenses against oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione (4Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 5Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), CcOX has recently been proposed to contribute to the antioxidant defenses of mitochondria by directly scavenging ONOO– (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E.

Studies performed on purified CcOX have shown that the enzyme in turnover may represent a significant sink for ONOO– (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol.

The detailed mechanisms are not entirely clear with one study indicating a catalytic production of NO• from the interaction of ONOO– with the enzyme (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and other studies suggesting a peroxynitrite reductase activity in CcOX with the product being nitrite (7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35763-35767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Pearce L.L. Kanai A.J. Birder L.A. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that NO• can be oxidized to nitrite by CcOX directly (9Sarti P. Giuffrè A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Rosquist A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or by oxygen in a reaction that is accelerated in the lipid bilayer of mitochondrial membranes (11Liu X. Miller M.J.S.

Darley-Usmar V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7212-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The suggestion that CcOX can metabolize ONOO– is in agreement with other studies showing that some hemeproteins and synthetic iron-porphyrin complexes can scavenge this highly reactive species (see Refs. 13Jensen M.P. Riley D.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 41: 4788-4797Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar and 14Herold S. Shivashankar K. Mehl M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13460-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar for recent reports). Despite these observations, the potential interaction of ONOO– with the high concentrations of reductants used to assess purified CcOX activity has not been defined (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Specifically ascorbate, a ubiquitous antioxidant, is used in some of these studies at millimolar concentrations. This is potentially important because ascorbate has been shown to increase NO• bioavailability in blood vessels, an effect which may be mediated by enhanced synthesis of NO• and/or by prevention of its breakdown (15May J.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrion the role of ascorbate is unknown, but its concentration in the mitochondrial matrix has been estimated in the low millimolar range. 2T. M. Hagen, personal communication. Moreover, Li et al. (16Li X. Cobb C.E. May J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that the mitochondrial respiratory chain can recycle ascorbate from its oxidized form (DHA) to the reduced form. In this study, we investigated the possible contribution of ascorbate to the release of NO• from ONOO– in the presence and absence of CcOX using both the purified enzyme and isolated mitochondria. All biochemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Solutions of ONOO– were prepared in 0.5 m NaOH according to Reed et al. (17Reed J.W. Ho H.H. Jolly W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 1248-1249Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C, and their concentrations were spectrophoto-metrically determined just before use (ϵ302 = 1670 m–1 cm–1 (18Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar)). Concentrated stock solutions (typically ∼150 mm) were diluted to 10 mm in water on the day of the experiment. Solutions of (+)-sodium l-ascorbate were freshly prepared daily. Bovine heart CcOX was purified according to Yonetani (19Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 235: 845-852Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and stored in 0.1 m K+ phosphate buffer, 0.5% (w/v) lauryl maltoside, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, at –80 °C. Concentration is expressed in functional units (cytochrome-aa 3, Δϵ445 red-ox = 156 mm–1 cm–1). Rat liver mitochondria were prepared as described by Rickwood et al. (20Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 3-5Google Scholar). Nitric oxide solutions were obtained by equilibrating degassed water with pure NO• gas (21Brookes P.S. Shiva S. Patel R.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and their concentrations were determined with an NO• electrode (see next paragraph). Polarographic measurements (21Brookes P.S. Shiva S. Patel R.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 359: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were performed in a thermostated chamber equipped with electrodes for oxygen and NO• (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA and WPI, Sarasota, FL, respectively). The NO• electrode was calibrated using the acidified nitrite/potassium iodide method as recommended by the supplier (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). In experimental traces, a known amount of authentic NO• (from the calibrated stock solution) was always added at the end to quantify the amount of NO• generated in the experiment. Data were digitally recorded and analyzed with Windaq software (Dataq Instruments, Inc., Akron, OH). Unless otherwise stated, all isolated CcOX incubations were performed at 20 °C in 25 mm K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, with 0.1% w/v lauryl maltoside. Isolated mitochondrial incubations were performed in respiration medium comprising KCl (100 mm), sucrose (25 mm), HEPES (10 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), KH2PO4 (5 mm), EGTA (1 mm), pH 7.3, at 37 °C. Errors are expressed as standard deviations of at least three independent experiments unless otherwise specified. Statistical significance was assessed with an unpaired Student's t test and a p value < 0.05. The ability of CcOX to catalyze the conversion of ONOO– to NO• was investigated using both the purified enzyme and isolated mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 1A, purified CcOX was incubated in the presence of ascorbate, TMPD, and cytochrome c in air-equilibrated buffer at 20 °C. This temperature was selected to maintain the activity of the purified enzyme during the course of the experiment. Both O2 consumption and NO• were recorded. Upon addition of ONOO–, release of NO• and inhibition of CcOX activity were observed as being consistent with previous observations (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following aerobic decomposition of NO• from the solution, the enzymatic activity recovered almost completely. For comparison, Fig. 1A also shows the effects of authentic NO• on CcOX in turnover under the same conditions. In both cases CcOX inhibition occurred almost instantaneously upon appearance of NO• in the solution, although recovery of activity did not occur until well after disappearance of NO• from the solution consistent with the slow dissociation rate of NO• from CcOX at this temperature (9Sarti P. Giuffrè A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Brunori M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The percentage recovery from inhibition was similar for ONOO– and NO• with an ∼10% irreversible component for ONOO–, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.186; Fig. 1B). The observation that NO• produced from ONOO– leads to the same inhibition of CcOX as seen with authentic NO• provides further functional evidence that NO• is produced from ONOO–. To assess the role of CcOX in the production of NO• from ONOO–, we added ONOO– to ascorbate, TMPD, or cytochrome c 2+ alone under the same conditions as described previously. As Fig. 1C shows, addition of ONOO– to ascorbate produced a significant amount of NO• comparable with that observed when ONOO– was added to CcOX in turnover (2.0 ± 0.02 versus 2.4 ± 0.13 μm; quantified in Fig. 1D). This suggests that ascorbate, not CcOX, is mainly responsible for the NO• generation seen in Fig. 1A. The concentration of ascorbate in the cytosol (22Slade R. Stead A.G. Graham J.A. Hatch G.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 742-746PubMed Google Scholar, 23Washko P. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the reported ascorbate levels in the mitochondrial matrix (see the Introduction) suggest that this mechanism of NO• generation from ONOO– may be relevant to mitochondrial physiology. However, these data do not preclude the possibility that CcOX alone may contribute to the NO• generation from ONOO–. To test this, we examined isolated mitochondria respiring in the presence of glutamate, malate, and ADP (Fig. 1E). In this system, electrons are delivered to CcOX through the respiratory chain (complex I ubiquinone complex III cytochrome c complex IV), thus reducing substrates such as ascorbate are not required. Addition of ONOO– to respiring mitochondria resulted in neither NO• generation nor inhibition of respiration. However, in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate NO• was produced and consequently respiration was inhibited. The effect of authentic NO• on mitochondrial respiration is also shown further suggesting that the inhibition of respiration caused by ONOO– is due to NO•. Taken together, the data in Fig. 1 show that at 50–100 μm ONOO–, CcOX does not catalyze the reduction of ONOO– to NO•, whereas ascorbate does. However, the concentrations of ascorbate used in the experiments described above are either nonphysiological (20 mm) or in the high intracellular physiological range (1 mm) (22Slade R. Stead A.G. Graham J.A. Hatch G.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 742-746PubMed Google Scholar, 23Washko P. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the ability of ascorbate to release NO• from ONOO–, we measured NO• production at different concentrations of ascorbate and ONOO–. Fig. 2A shows that ONOO– addition to phosphate buffer at neutral pH did not result in significant release of NO•. Even upon subsequent addition of ascorbate, NO• was not produced, thus ruling out the possibility of NO• generation from a reaction between ascorbate and the products of ONOO– decomposition, NO3- and NO2- (24Kissner R. Koppenol W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, when ONOO– was added again to the chamber in the presence of ascorbate (50 μm), a transient production of NO• was observed. The height of the NO• peak was proportional to the concentration of ONOO– in the range 10–100 μm and to the concentration of ascorbate up to 1 mm (Fig. 2, B and C). However, above 1 mm ascorbate, the generation of NO• reaches a plateau. The saturation kinetics in the supra-millimolar range suggest that the production of NO• does not occur through a direct reaction between ONOO– and ascorbate but through a more complex mechanism. To provide further insight to the NO• production by ONOO– and ascorbate, we studied the yield of NO• under different conditions (Fig. 3). Because the reactivity of both ascorbate and ONOO– might be affected by even trace catalytic amounts of transition metals, we performed the same experiment described in Fig. 2A, in the presence of the metal chelators, neocuproine, EDTA, or DTPA (Fig. 3, A and B). The peak height of NO• generated was not decreased significantly by neocuproine or DTPA and only slightly by EDTA (∼10% less NO• versus control, p = 0.003). Interestingly, DTPA increased NO• stability, as measured by the slope of the decomposition curve for NO•, by ∼5-fold compared with control (p = 0.04). To determine whether the generation of NO• from ascorbate plus ONOO– requires the reduced form of ascorbate, we studied the interaction of ONOO– with DHA, the oxidized form where one of the hydroxyl groups of ascorbate is replaced by a carbonyl. Fig. 3C shows that although a small amount of NO• is still generated (∼5% of control), the reaction yield is significantly reduced suggesting that ascorbate must act as a reductant for this reaction to occur. The effects of NaHCO3 and superoxide dismutase are also shown in Fig. 3C. These data show that generation of NO• from ascorbate plus ONOO– is abrogated by the presence of NaHCO3. In contrast, superoxide dismutase enhanced the generation of NO• by a small but significant amount (p = 0.043). Because the stability of ONOO– is affected by several factors, including the equilibrium with its protonated form (ONOOH, pK a ∼ 6.8), we also studied the effect of pH on the amount of NO• produced (Fig. 3D). A decrease in the yield of the reaction was observed with decreasing pH. In this study, it has been shown that physiological concentrations of ascorbate can mediate the release of NO• from ONOO–. This result has implications not only for the physiologic scavenging of ONOO– but also for interpretation of the interactions of this reactive nitrogen species with CcOX (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The peroxynitrite-reductase activity of CcOX results in the formation of nitrite as shown in a recent study (7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35763-35767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this pathway is likely to be contributing to the metabolism of ONOO– in this system. However, an additional process is required to explain the production of NO• observed in the present study. The data presented herein suggest that the majority of NO• release from CcOX in turnover can be accounted for by the presence of ascorbate in the reaction mixture. This is in contrast to the results of Sharpe and Cooper (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) who report that CcOX in turnover is required for NO• generation from ONOO– and that little or no NO• is generated in the absence of the enzyme. However, several differences between the experimental systems may account for this discrepancy. For example, the temperatures are different (20 °C here versus 30 °C in Sharpe and Cooper (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), and HEPES was a constituent of the buffer in Sharpe and Cooper (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The use of HEPES was avoided in this study because it has been shown that it can react with ONOO– to form a labile NO• donor (5Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Schmidt K. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 859-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, and acknowledged in Ref. 7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35763-35767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, it is possible that the reaction that yields NO• from ONOO– is enhanced by the ascorbyl radical (AscH·¯ ), which in turn is produced by auto-oxidation of ascorbate under aerobic conditions. In this case, the formation of NO• from ascorbate plus ONOO– would be accelerated in the presence of any system that enhances ascorbate oxidation including the TMPD cytochrome c CcOX system. This may explain the slightly greater generation of NO• observed with CcOX versus ascorbate alone (Fig. 1E). In addition, this may underlie the dependence of NO• generation on CcOX turnover rate as reported for un-coupled versus coupled CcOX vesicles (6Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), because a greater CcOX turnover would equate to greater oxidation of ascorbate and, thus, more AscH·¯ . In considering a possible mechanism for the formation of NO• from ascorbate plus ONOO–, the data in Fig. 3 are of particular importance. First, the observation that less NO• is made at acidic pH suggests that the source of NO• is ONOO– rather than ONOOH (pK a ∼ 6.8). This is consistent with the observation that NaHCO3 abolished NO• formation in this system, because it is known that CO2 can react with ONOO– but not ONOOH (26Merenyi G. Lind J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms may exist for the generation of NO• from ONOO–. For example, it is possible that ascorbate or one of its derivatives (e.g. AscH·¯ ) may react with ONOO– to form an intermediate that is an NO• donor, as previously shown, for low-molecular weight compounds such as HEPES and glutathione (5Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Schmidt K. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 859-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the rapid appearance of NO• in the medium following ONOO– addition (see Figs. 1, 2, 3) suggests that any such intermediate would have a very short half-life so that both are made and degraded within the response time of the NO• electrode. In addition, because the decomposition of certain NO• donors is accelerated in the presence of metals, the lack of an effect of metal chelators on NO• generation (Fig. 3A) suggests this is not a significant pathway. Another possible mechanism for NO• generation from ONOO– could be the scavenging of O2·¯ by the ascorbate system (ascorbate plus AscH2·¯ ). This would serve to drive the equilibrium (NO• + O2·¯ ONOO–) to the left. Literature evidence to date has concentrated on the diffusion-limited forward reaction between NO• and O2·¯ to yield ONOO–. However, a significant back-reaction does exist (k = 0.02 s–1 at 25 °C) and could be enhanced in the presence of a sink for O2·¯ (27Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merenyi G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this regard, Jackson et al. (28Jackson T.S. Xu A. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) have shown that ascorbate can effectively scavenge O2·¯ and compete with NO• for reaction with O2·¯ , although only at concentrations in the high millimolar range (28Jackson T.S. Xu A. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Notably, the reaction between AscH2·¯ and O2·¯ is ∼1000× faster than that between ascorbate and O2·¯ (k = 2.3 × 108m–1 s–1 versus 3 × 105m–1 s–1, respectively) (29Scarpa M. Stevanato R. Viglino P. Rigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6695-6697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Thus, in a system where ascorbate oxidation is enhanced (e.g. CcOX in turnover), O2·¯ scavenging may be enhanced because of greater formation of AscH2·¯ (see above). Such enhancement may decrease into the physiological range the effective concentration of ascorbate required for such O2·¯ scavenging. In support of a role for O2·¯ scavenging by ascorbate, Fig. 3 shows that superoxide dismutase can mildly enhance NO• formation in this system. However this effect appears small, because this experiment was performed at 5 mm ascorbate at which point O2·¯ scavenging may have already been saturated (see concentration dependence, Fig. 2B). Additional mechanisms for the ascorbate-driven generation of NO• from ONOO– may be hypothesized including reactions between ascorbate/AscH2·¯ and other known decomposition products of ONOO– (e.g. NO2-,NO3- , OH•, NO2· (27Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merenyi G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Hancock J.T. Desikan R. Neill S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). However, it is not yet clear whether any of these reactions would yield NO•. Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggest an ∼2% yield of NO• from ONOO–. In a physiologic context, where ONOO– must have come from NO• originally, this raises the question whether this reaction is a significant pathway for the regeneration of NO•. However, given that soluble guanylate cyclase and cytochrome c oxidase are sensitive to low nanomolar concentrations of NO• and that cell signaling is amplified at these enzymes, biological responses are plausible. Moreover, it does appear that ascorbate can act as an antioxidant for the prevention of ONOO– formation (28Jackson T.S. Xu A. Vita J.A. Keaney J.F. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), thus increasing NO• availability. In the context of the mitochondrion, the organelle has been proposed as a potential source of ONOO– (32Packer M.A. Porteous C.M. Murphy M.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 40: 527-534PubMed Google Scholar). A significant store of ∼1 mm ascorbate is proposed to exist in the matrix (see Introduction), and thus ascorbate-driven ONOO– decomposition may occur in this organelle. Whereas the data in Fig. 1 do not show NO• generation from ONOO– in mitochondria, it is unclear whether ascorbate survived the mitochondrial isolation procedure and, if so, what its redox state was, because DHA does not catalyze NO• release from ONOO– (Fig. 3C). Overall, water-soluble antioxidants such as glutathione (5Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and ascorbate may comprise the primary mitochondrial defense against ONOO–. This raises the possibility that only ONOO– made in situ may be damaging to the organelle. Furthermore, the ability of CO2 to modulate ascorbate-driven ONOO– degradation (Fig. 3) is unique from a mitochondrial perspective, because the organelle is a major cellular source of CO2. Protein tyrosine nitration mediated by ONOO– is enhanced by CO2, thus raising the possibility of modulation of this post-translational modification by ascorbate of mitochondrial proteins. Whereas it is unlikely that the ascorbate plus ONOO– reaction represents a significant source of NO•, it is the balance between these reactive nitrogen species that is important for cellular function. Therefore, these results have implications for the role of mitochondria and reactive nitrogen species in processes such as apoptosis, because it has been shown that NO• can prevent cytochrome c release from mitochondria, whereas ONOO– enhances it (33Brookes P.S. Padilla Salinas E. Darley-Usmar K. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Anderson P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20474-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 34Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, ascorbate may act as a modulator of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling as has previously been proposed for glutathione (31Hancock J.T. Desikan R. Neill S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the generation of NO• from ONOO– by CcOX in turnover is most likely because of ascorbate, and it appears that, whereas CcOX does possess a ONOO– reductase activity (7Pearce L.L. Pitt B.R. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35763-35767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this is not the primary source of NO• in this system. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise roles of AscH·¯ and the scavenging of O2·¯ in this system. We thank Paolo Sarti (Rome, Italy), Jack R. Lancaster, Jr., and Rakesh Patel (University of Alabama at Birmingham) for insightful discussions."

Each mutant protein was expressed at levels comparable with wild-type enzyme and was isolated in highly purified form. Initial kinetic characterization indicated that F204L exhibits a substantial (>300-fold) decrease in catalytic rate (k cat). Upon modification with the mechanism-based inhibitor, 3-chloropropionyl-CoA, or in formation of a stable binary complex with acetoacetyl-CoA, F204L exhibits binding stoichiometries comparable with wild-type enzyme, suggesting substantial retention of active site integrity. Y130L and Y376L exhibit inflated values (80- and 40-fold, respectively) for the K m for acetyl-CoA in the acetyl-CoA hydrolysis partial reaction; these mutants also exhibit an order of magnitude decrease in k cat. Formation of the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate by Y130L, F204L, and Y376L proceeds slowly in comparison with wild-type enzyme. However, solvent exchange into the thioester carbonyl oxygen of these acetyl-S-enzyme intermediates is not slow in comparison with previous observations for D159A and D203A mutants, which also exhibit slow acetyl-S-enzyme formation. The magnitude of the differential isotope shift upon exchange of H218O into [13C]acetyl-S-enzyme suggests a polarization of the thioester carbonyl and a reduction in bond order. Such an effect may substantially contribute to the upfield 13C NMR shift observed for [13C]acetyl-S-enzyme. The influence on acetyl-S-enzyme formation, as well as observed k cat (F204L) and K m (Y130L; Y376L) effects, implicate these invariant residues as part of the catalytic site.

The cytosolic isoform, involved in isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis, is transcriptionally regulated (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

The condensation of substrates acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) to form HMG-CoA may be viewed as a three-step process (3Miziorko H.M Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1414-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involving formation of an acetyl-S-enzyme intermediate, condensation to form a transient enzyme-S-HMG-CoA intermediate, and hydrolysis to release product HMG-CoA (Scheme 1). Early mechanistic and protein chemistry studies led to selective modification (4Miziorko H.M. Behnke C.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3174-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and mapping (5Miziorko H.M. Behnke C.E. J. Biol.

Evaluation of invariant residues implicated as active site residues not only a histidine (7Misra I. Miziorko H.M.

Vinarov D.V. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14670-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or condensation of this intermediate with the second substrate (9Chun K.Y. Vinarov D.V.

A report on acetoacetyl-CoA binding to acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (11Miura R. Nishina Y. Fujii S. Shiga K. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) documented large NMR shifts for the bound metabolite that are comparable in magnitude with those observed for HMG-CoA synthase's acetyl-S-enzyme intermediate (10Vinarov D.A. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 270-271Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Vinarov D.A. Miziorko H.M.

Biochem. 1996; 119: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggested that the effect was potentially attributable to stacking of metabolite with the heterocyclic flavin cofactor of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. These observations suggested the potential influence of hydrophobic, aromatic residues at the active site of HMG-CoA synthase and prompted evaluation of the importance of aromatic residues that are conserved in this protein. This report documents the characterization of mutant enzymes in which aromatic side chains have been replaced and indicates that several conserved aromatic residues influence either the catalytic rate or enzyme-substrate interactions.

Sequence Homology Analysis—All sequences used in the alignment analysis are defined in the published data bases as HMG-CoA synthases. Only sequences encoding full-length proteins were included in the analysis. Amino acid sequences were aligned using the Pileup program in the Genetics Computer Group-Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Synthesis of Radiolabeled 3-Chloropropionyl-CoA—Synthesis was performed according to the procedures of Miziorko and Behnke (4Miziorko H.M. Behnke C.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3174-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) except that ethylchloroformate was used to activate the 3-chloro-[1-14C]propionic acid to the mixed anhydride, and this intermediate was used to thioesterify CoASH. The product was precipitated from cold methanol/acetone (1:4). The purified product was assessed for concentration and purity by UV spectroscopy and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Synthesis of Radiolabeled Acetoacetyl-CoA—[3-14C]Acetoacetyl-CoA was prepared according to the method of Hersh and Jencks (14Hersh L.B. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3468-3480Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as modified by Miziorko and Lane (3Miziorko H.M Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1414-1420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ethyl [3-14C]acetoacetate (3.7 μmol; 54 mCi/mmol) was hydrolyzed in 80 mm LiOH at 22 °C for 7 h. After hydrolysis, pH was adjusted to 7.2. Unlabeled acetoacetyl-CoA (80 μmol, Li+ salt), and porcine heart succinyl-CoA transferase (2 units) were added to the hydrolyzed product. The exchange was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by cooling of the incubation mixture on ice and adjustment to pH 2.5 with HCl. The mixture was extracted with cold ethyl ether to remove free acetoacetate. The aqueous layer was evaporated and dissolved in cold methanol, and 4 volumes of cold acetone were added to precipitate [3-14C]acetoacetyl-CoA as the Li+ salt. Construction of Mutant HMG-CoA Synthases—Mutagenesis was performed using Stratagene's QuikChange mutagenesis kit and a pair of complementary mutagenic primers appropriate for substitution of the aromatic residue encoding codon by a leucine encoding codon.

The plasmids containing various mutants were used to transform competent XL1-Blue cells. Mutagenic plasmid DNA was isolated from selected transformants and analyzed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The verified mutant clones were transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells for expression and isolation as previously described for wild type HMG-CoA synthase (6Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of HMG-CoA Synthase—The procedure developed for purification of the wild-type enzyme (6Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was followed for isolation of the aromatic substituted enzymes from isopropyl thiogalactoside-induced bacterial cultures. Protein content of the purified enzymes was estimated by the Bradford assay (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purity of the enzymes was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Activity Assay and Enzymological Characterization of HMG-CoA Synthase Mutants—Either the standard spectrophotometric assay (6Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the more sensitive radioisotopic assay (16Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to measure activity. In the spectrophotometric assay, the reaction mix included 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, 100 μm EDTA, appropriate amounts of HMG-CoA synthase (∼6 μg for wild-type enzyme), 20 μm acetoacetyl-CoA, and 200 μm acetyl-CoA (unless varied concentrations were used for K m determinations). The reaction was performed at 30 °C, and acetyl-CoA-dependent loss of acetoacetyl-CoA was measured as a decrease in 300-nm absorbance, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 3.6. For improved sensitivity, the spectrophotometric assay can be performed in the presence of 40 mm MgCl2; in such cases, the millimolar extinction coefficient of 20.0 is used for acetoacetyl-CoA. For the radioisotopic assay, the reaction mixture included 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 100 μm EDTA, 20 μm acetoacetyl-CoA, 200 μm [14C]acetyl-CoA (8600–10,000 dpm/nmol) (unless reagent concentration was varied for K m determinations), and appropriate amounts of wild-type or mutant HMG-CoA synthase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of radiolabeled acetyl-CoA to the assay mixture containing the rest of the components at 30 °C. At specified time intervals, 40-μl aliquots were removed from the incubation mixture and acidified with 6 n HCl. The mixture was heated to dryness, and acid-stable radioactivity due to [14C]-HMG-CoA was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity of wild type and mutant synthases was measured as reported previously (17Miziorko H.M. Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5768-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by monitoring enzyme-dependent depletion of [14C]acetyl-CoA after conversion of residual substrate to acid-stable [14C]citrate, using excess citrate synthase and oxaloacetate. Stoichiometry of covalent acetylation (i.e. acetyl-S-enzyme formation) was determined according to the procedure described by Miziorko et al. (17Miziorko H.M. Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5768-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 45-μl (90 μg of enzyme) aliquots of incubation mixture containing 1 mm [14C]acetyl-CoA (8,600–10,000 dpm/nmol) and enzyme (2 mg/ml) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The denatured protein was transferred to a glass fiber filter. The filters were washed extensively with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 500 mm HCl and once with cold absolute ethanol. Filters were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Rates of covalent acetylation were determined by taking aliquots at specified times after initiation of the reaction by [14C]acetyl-CoA addition and isolating covalent acetyl-S-enzyme as described above. Rates were determined by linear regression analysis of the initial linear region of the time course. Modification stoichiometry upon inactivation of HMG-CoA synthase by the mechanism-based inhibitor, 3-chloro-[1-14C]propionyl-CoA, was measured according the following protocol. 25-μl aliquots of an incubation mixture containing 3-chloro-[1-14C]propionyl-CoA (126 nmol, 10,000 dpm/nmol) and enzyme (6 nmol) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, were removed and treated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid at specified time intervals. The denatured protein was transferred to a glass fiber filter. The filters were washed extensively with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 500 mm HCl and a final wash with cold absolute ethanol. Filters (containing ∼35 μg of enzyme) were dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The stoichiometry of noncovalent acetoacetyl-CoA binding was determined using a modification of the procedure of Vollmer et al. (18Vollmer S.H. Mende-Mueller L.M. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4288-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The enzyme (150 μg) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. [14C]acetoacetyl-CoA (2500 dpm/nmol) was added to bring the final concentration to 1000 μm. Unbound acetoacetyl-CoA was removed using a Sephadex G-50 centrifugal column equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein in the recovered samples was estimated by the Bradford assay, and radioactivity bound to enzyme was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 13C NMR Measurements—For measurement of the chemical shifts of [1,2-13C]acetyl-S-enzyme or [1,2-13C]acetyl-S-CoA, proton-decoupled experiments were performed using a Bruker AC-300 instrument operating at 75.5 MHz for 13C. Spectra were recorded at 21 °C. Chemical shifts are referenced to TMS. 16,000 data point spectra were recorded using a 35° pulse angle and a 2-s pulse delay. 6000 transients were acquired for each spectrum. Samples contained 0.5 mm enzyme sites and 1.5 mm [1,2-13C]acetyl-CoA in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 20% D2O for a lock signal. For measurement of 18O differential isotope shifts of the mutant or wild-type [1,2-13C]acetyl-S-enzymes, a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer, equipped with a QNP probe operating at 151 MHz for 13C was used. Proton-decoupled spectra (32,000 data points) were acquired using a 45° pulse angle and a 2-s pulse delay. 1500 transients were recorded for each spectrum, except for samples containing F204L, where 2500 transients were recorded. Spectra were recorded at 23 °C. Samples were prepared by dissolving matched, buffered, freeze-dried proteins in either reagent grade 16O water, supplemented with 10% D2O, or 18O-enriched (95%) water supplemented with 10% D2O. Final samples (0.5 ml) contained 0.6 mm enzyme sites and 1.3 mm [1,2-13C]acetyl-CoA in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm EDTA. A minimum of two spectra were consecutively run for each 16O- or 18O-containing sample. Additional spectra for 18O samples were run after overnight incubation (minimum 12 h) with no further changes in isotope shifts being detected. Reported isotope shifts are not corrected for dilution of 18O-enriched solvent by inclusion of 10% D2O in the sample. Strategy for Identification of Mutagenesis Targets—Alignments of 28 deduced sequences for HMG-CoA synthases indicate that six aromatic residues are invariant or highly conserved. Fig. 1 depicts regions from an alignment of 10 representative sequences, selected from fungal, plant, animal, and bacterial proteins. These regions include Tyr130, Tyr163, Phe204, Tyr225, Tyr346, and Tyr376 (residue numbering corresponds to animal cytosolic proteins). The lineups also contain residues Cys129, Asp159, and Asp203, which have been demonstrated (6Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chun K.Y. Vinarov D.V. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14670-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to have a large impact on catalysis. The sequences flanking Tyr346 and Tyr376 are among the most conserved regions observed upon alignment of HMG-CoA synthases. In order to eliminate side chain aromaticity without changing the hydrophobicity, plasmids encoding leucine substitutions for each of these aromatic residues were constructed by mutagenesis of the pET-3d-derived plasmid that encodes wild-type avian HMG-CoA synthase. These plasmids were validated by DNA sequencing to ensure the presence of the mutated codon and the absence of PCR artifacts. Expression, Isolation, and Preliminary Characterization of Mutant HMG-CoA Synthases—Plasmids encoding leucine substitutions for the aromatic residues were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and used for protein expression. Soluble mutant proteins were produced at levels comparable with those achieved when expressing wild-type avian cytosolic enzyme. Purification of the mutants employed the procedure described for wild-type enzyme (6Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the six mutant enzymes was recovered from anion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences fast-Q resin) in substantially homogeneous form (Fig. 2), eluting at an ionic strength comparable with that used for isolation of wild-type enzyme. Each of the six mutants was characterized by a variety of kinetic and binding stoichiometry measurements. Table I summarizes the measured values for V max in the overall condensation reaction, K m for acetyl-CoA in the overall condensation reaction, and K m for acetyl-CoA in the partial reaction in which acetyl-CoA hydrolysis occurs in the absence of the second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA. Due to substrate inhibition by acetoacetyl-CoA, the K m value for acetyl-CoA in the overall reaction does not correlate as well with intrinsic binding affinity as does the corresponding K m value measured in the hydrolysis partial reaction (6Misra I.

Open table in a new tab Upon comparison of the Vmax values in Table I, it is apparent that, with the exception of F204L, the substitution of aromatic side chains has only modest effects on catalysis, with changes of approximately 1 order of magnitude or less being observed. In the case of F204L, V max is decreased by over 300-fold; this effect seems substantial for substitution of a side chain that should not be involved in reaction chemistry or traditional hydrogen bonding. Little effect of this substitution is observed for K m acetyl-CoA values in the overall reaction or the hydrolysis partial reaction. The other contrasts that appear in Table I include a 2–3-fold inflation in the K m acetyl-CoA values for Y130L, Y346L, and Y376L, as measured in the overall condensation reaction. K m of acetyl-CoA in the hydrolysis partial reaction correlates more closely with the saturation of enzyme by acetyl-CoA to form the acetyl-S-enzyme (Fig. 3), providing a better estimate of intrinsic affinity of enzyme for this substrate. Upon inspection of the values measured for K m of acetyl-CoA in the hydrolysis partial reaction, substantial inflation of K m is observed for Y130L and Y376L but not for Y346L. 80- and 40-fold changes (Table I) are measured for Y130L and Y376L, respectively, in comparison with the value for wild-type enzyme. Thus, these substitutions most notably influence acetyl-CoA saturation and have a smaller, albeit significant, effect on catalytic rate. In order to evaluate whether the loss of tyrosine's alcohol substituent or the aromatic ring accounted for the effects observed with the leucine-substituted proteins, Y130F and Y376F mutant enzymes were also constructed, expressed, and isolated. Characterization of these phenylalanine substituted enzymes indicated catalytic rates that are comparable with wild-type enzyme (Y130F: V max = 4.93 units/mg; Y376F: V max = 4.95 units/mg). Changes in K m acetyl-CoA in the overall reaction are also less pronounced (Y130F: K m of acetyl-CoA = 565 ± 65 μm (overall reaction; this value diminishes to 28 ± 8 μm for the hydrolysis partial reaction); Y376F: K m of acetyl-CoA = 307 ± 8 μm (overall reaction)). On the basis of the contrasts measured for F204L, Y130L, and Y376L in comparison with wild-type enzyme, these three mutants were subjected to more detailed enzymological and biophysical characterization. Enzymological Characterization of HMG-CoA Synthase Mutants Y130L, F204L, and Y376L—For Y130L and Y376L mutants, activity levels are sufficiently high to support measurement of K m for the second substrate, AcAc-CoA; only modest (4-fold) increases in this parameter are observed (Table II). The low level of residual activity of F204L complicates measurements at suboptimal levels of second substrate. Nonetheless, an upper limit of 5 μm can be estimated for K m AcAc-CoA, which suggests that substitution of Phe204 by leucine does not have a large influence on interaction with this second substrate. Upon comparison of the mutants' ability to catalyze the acetyl-CoA hydrolysis partial reaction, the most notable contrast with the value measured for wild-type enzyme occurs for F204L (Table II), once again reflecting a difference in catalytic efficiency as a dominant characteristic of this mutant.Table IIKinetic parameters and binding properties of wild-type and aromatic mutant HMG-CoA synthasesParameterWild typeY130LF204LY376LV max (Overall reaction) (units/mg)4.40 ± 0.39aData taken from Ref. 8.0.30 ± 0.030.012 ± 0.0010.44 ± 0.01Km of AcAc-CoA (μM)0.9 ± 0.1bData taken from Ref. 7.3.3 ± 0.4<53.1 ± 0.2V max (hydrolysis) (units/mg)0.018 ± 0.0020.012 ± 0.0030.0020 ± 0.00010.018 ± 0.001Acetylation rate (units/mg)1.59 ± 0.16aData taken from Ref. 8.0.0031 ± 0.00030.0016 ± 0.00010.0050 ± 0.0001Acetylation stoichiometry0.62 ± 0.03aData taken from Ref. 8.0.54 ± 0.020.35 ± 0.050.64 ± 0.01Cl-prop-CoAc3-Chloropropionyl-CoA. modification stoichiometry0.7 ± 0.07—dValue not determined for this mutant.0.8 ± 0.05—AcAc-CoA binding stoichiometry0.8 ± 0.05—1.0 ± 0.08—a Data taken from Ref. 8Chun K.Y.

Open table in a new tab Initial measurements of the formation of the covalent acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate upon short (5-s) incubations with acetyl-CoA indicated that each of these mutants exhibited lower levels of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable adduct than measured for wild-type enzyme. This prompted experiments (Fig. 4) that measured the time course of covalent acetyl-S-enzyme formation. Initial rates for formation of this reaction intermediate (Table II) could be measured due to the slow kinetics of this process. Comparison of these rates with steady state rates of condensation or hydrolysis reactions is not straightforward due to differences in pH and other reaction conditions used in the various assays (a correction factor of >9-fold is required (8Chun K.Y. Vinarov D.V. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14670-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). Nonetheless, the acetylation rates of Y130L, F204L, and Y376L mutants are significantly lower than the value measured for wild-type enzyme. A similar effect has been observed (8Chun K.Y. Vinarov D.V.
