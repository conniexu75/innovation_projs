https://openalex.org/W2070693959,"The proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun function cooperatively as inducible transcription factors in signal transduction processes. Their protein products, Fos and Jun, form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with the DNA regulatory element known as the activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site. Dimerization occurs via interaction between leucine zipper domains and serves to bring into proper juxtaposition a region in each protein that is rich in basic amino acids and that forms a DNA-binding domain. DNA binding of the Fos-Jun heterodimer was modulated by reduction-oxidation (redox) of a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins. Furthermore, a nuclear protein was identified that reduced Fos and Jun and stimulated DNA-binding activity in vitro. These results suggest that transcriptional activity mediated by AP-1 binding factors may be regulated by a redox mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2119725374,"The mechanism by which a single factor evokes opposite regulatory effects from a specific DNA sequence is not well understood. In this study, a 25-base pair element that resides upstream of the mouse proliferin gene was examined; it conferred on linked promoters either positive or negative glucocorticoid regulation, depending upon physiological context. This sequence, denoted a ""composite"" glucocorticoid response element (GRE), was bound selectively in vitro both by the glucocorticoid receptor and by c-Jun and c-Fos, components of the phorbol ester-activated AP-1 transcription factor. Indeed, c-Jun and c-Fos served as selectors of hormone responsiveness: the composite GRE was inactive in the absence of c-Jun, whereas it conferred a positive glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun, and a negative glucocorticoid effect in the presence of c-Jun and relatively high levels of c-Fos. The receptor also interacted selectively with c-Jun in vitro. A general model for composite GRE action is proposed that invokes both DNA binding and protein-protein interactions by receptor and nonreceptor factors."
https://openalex.org/W1493349125,"Mastoparan (MP), a cationic, amphiphilic tetradecapeptide, stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange by GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) in a manner similar to that of G protein-coupled receptors. 1) MP stimulated exchange by isolated G protein alpha subunits and alpha beta gamma trimers. Relative stimulation was greater with alpha beta gamma trimers and beta gamma subunits could increase net MP-stimulated activity. 2) MP action was enhanced by reconstitution of trimeric G protein into phospholipid vesicles. Hill coefficients for activation were 2-4. The membrane-bound alpha-helical conformation of MP appeared to be the activating species. 3) MP blocked the ability of Go to increase the affinity of muscarinic receptors for agonist ligands, suggesting that MP and the receptor may compete for a common binding site on Go. 4) MP stimulated steady state GTPase activity at less than 1 microM Mg2+ and stimulated the dissociation of both GDP and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) at less than 1 nM Mg2+. Millimolar Mg2+ blocked the stimulatory effect of MP. Both high and low affinity Mg2+ binding sites are on the alpha subunit. 5) Increasing the amphiphilicity or hydrophobicity of MP enhanced its regulatory activity more than 2-fold and lowered the EC50 more than 10-fold. Several natural amphiphilic peptides also displayed modest stimulatory activity. 6) Benzalkonium chloride competitively antagonized the stimulation of Gi by MP but potently stimulated nucleotide exchange on Go. Because cationic, amphiphilic sequences on the cytoplasmic faces of receptors are required for G protein regulation, these findings suggest that nucleotide exchange on G proteins is regulated by the presentation of multiple cationic structures on the inner face of the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1965319333,"A recombinant beta-galactosidase gene has been expressed in a specific arterial segment in vivo by direct infection with a murine amphotropic retroviral vector or by DNA transfection with the use of liposomes. Several cell types in the vessel wall were transduced, including endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. After retroviral infection, a recombinant reporter gene was expressed for at least 5 months, and no helper virus was detected. Recombinant gene expression achieved by direct retroviral infection or liposome-mediated DNA transfection was limited to the site of infection and was absent from liver, lung, kidney, and spleen. These results demonstrate that site-specific gene expression can be achieved by direct gene transfer in vivo and could be applied to the treatment of such human diseases as atherosclerosis or cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999436383,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are exposed to large quantities of self and nonself antigens. It is not known what fraction of MHC molecules needs to be occupied by antigen to induce a T cell response. A quantitative study of naturally processed antigen indicated that T cells could be activated when only 0.03 percent of the total I-Ed purified from antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was occupied with antigen. B cells and macrophages processed hen egg lysozyme (HEL) with different efficiencies, but similar degrees of occupancy were required for T cell stimulation. Higher occupancy was needed for I-Ed-transfected L cells, possibly reflecting the requirement for other accessory molecules for efficient APC-T cell interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2001612209,The application of isolated pancreatic islet transplantation for treatment of diabetes mellitus has been hampered by the vulnerability of islet allografts to immunologic rejection. Rat islet allografts that were transplanted into the thymus of recipients treated with a single injection of anti-lymphocyte serum survived indefinitely. A state of donor-specific unresponsiveness was achieved that permitted survival of a second donor strain islet allograft transplanted to an extrathymic site. Maturation of T cell precursors in a thymic microenvironment that is harboring foreign alloantigen may induce the selective unresponsiveness. This model provides an approach for pancreatic islet transplantation and a potential strategy for specific modification of the peripheral immune repertoire.
https://openalex.org/W2076776277,"To gain insights into transcription factors defining neuronal identity, we generated transgenic mice carrying a 1.8 kb rat neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter fragment fused to an E. coli lacZ gene. Four of seven transgenic families expressed transgene RNA in the nervous system but not in most other tissues. Histochemical analysis of adult brain from the two lines with highest lacZ mRNA levels showed neuron-specific, pan-neuronal β-galactosidase activity. Developmental RNA and histochemical analyses showed parallel onset of transgene and endogenous NSE gene expression in various neuronal cell types, although the magnitude of NSE mRNA accumulation later in development was not matched by the transgene. These results suggest that cis-acting regulatory elements, subject to neuron-specific control, are located within 1.8 kb upstream from the NSE gene."

https://openalex.org/W1866820856,"Phosphorylation of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase has been shown to enhance subsequent phosphorylation by casein kinase I (Flotow, H., and Roach, P. J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9126-9128). In the present study, synthetic peptides based on the sequences of the four phosphorylated regions in muscle glycogen synthase were used to probe the role of substrate phosphorylation in casein kinase I action. With all four peptides, prior phosphorylation significantly stimulated phosphorylation by casein kinase I. A series of peptides was synthesized based on the NH2-terminal glycogen synthase sequence PLSRTLS7VSS10LPGL, in which phosphorylation at Ser7 is required for modification of Ser10 by casein kinase I. The spacing between the P-Ser and the acceptor Ser was varied to have 1, 2, or 3 intervening residues. The peptide with a 2-residue spacing (-S(P)-X-X-S-) was by far the best casein kinase I substrate. When the P-Ser residue at Ser7 was replaced with P-Thr, the resulting peptide was still a casein kinase I substrate. However, substitution of Asp or Glu residues at Ser7 led to peptides that were not phosphorylated by casein kinase I. Phosphorylation of one of the other peptides showed that Thr could also be the phosphate acceptor. From these results, we propose that there are substrates for casein kinase I for which prior phosphorylation is a critical determinant of protein kinase action. In these instances, an important recognition motif for casein kinase I appears to be -S(P)/T(P)-Xn-S/T- with n = 2 much more effective than n = 1 or n = 3. Thus, casein kinase I may be involved in hierarchal substrate phosphorylation schemes in which its activity is controlled by the phosphorylation state of its substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1536258113,"Western blots of normal human platelets, employing a monoclonal antibody raised against the full-length amyloid precursor protein of Alzheimer's disease (APP695), revealed major bands of 100-110 and 120-130 kDa in both cytosolic, membrane, and released fractions. These species were similar in size to forms seen in brain preparations and in plasma. There was no difference in Western blots of platelet preparations from Alzheimer patients compared with controls. Purified platelet amyloid precursor proteins were sequenced and shown to be amino terminally homogeneous. Immunohistochemistry localized the antigen to the platelet and megakaryocyte and demonstrated weak immunostaining of some lymphocytes. Immunoprecipitation of material released from platelets demonstrated that sedimentable full-length APP with the carboxyl-terminal epitope, and soluble APP lacking the carboxyl-terminal epitope, may exist in the circulation. Western blots and carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal APP radioimmunoassay of material released by platelets in response to stimulation revealed that platelets release APP during degranulation. The function of platelet APP is yet to be determined, but the present studies suggest a role in regulation of the coagulation cascade or in platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2156227047,"The differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by the regulatory factor differentiation inhibiting activity/leukemia inhibitory factor (). Examination of feeder cell-mediated suppression of ES cell differentiation revealed that is produced both as a diffusible protein and in an immobilized form associated with the extracellular matrix. This alternative localization arises from the expression of alternate transcripts that diverge throughout exon 1. The effect of alternate first exon usage is to change the amino terminus of the primary translation product and to direct incorporation of mature, biologically active into the extracellular matrix. The production of a potent regulatory factor in both diffusible and immobilized forms may be an important element of developmental control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1505955094,"The murine adenocarcinoma cell line TA 3 synthesized nitrite from L-arginine upon stimulation with gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not with IFN-gamma, TNF, or LPS added separately. Induction of the NO2(-)-generating activity caused an inhibition of DNA synthesis in TA 3 cells. This inhibition was prevented by the L-arginine analog N omega-nitro-L-arginine, which inhibited under the same conditions nitrite production by TA 3 cells. The TA 3 M2 subclone, selected for enhanced ribonucleotide reductase activity, was found to be less sensitive than the wild phenotype TA 3 WT to the cytostatic activity mediated by the NO2(-)-generating system. Cytosolic preparations from TA 3 M2 cells treated for 24 or 48 h with IFN-gamma, TNF, and LPS exhibited a reduced ribonucleotide reductase activity, compared to untreated control cells. No reduction in ribonucleotide reductase activity was observed when N omega-nitro-L-arginine was added to treated cells. Addition of L-arginine, NADPH, and tetrahydrobiopterin into cytosolic extracts from 24-h treated TA 3 M2 cells triggered the synthesis of metabolic products from the NO2(-)-generating pathway. This resulted in a dramatic inhibition of the residual ribonucleotide reductase activity present in the extracts. The inhibition was reversed by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, another specific inhibitor of the NO2(-)-generating activity. No L-arginine-dependent inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity was observed using extracts from untreated cells that did not express NO2(-)-generating activity. These results demonstrate that, in an acellular preparation, molecules derived from the NO2(-)-generating pathway exert an inhibitory effect on the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme. This negative action might explain the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced in adenocarcinoma cells by the NO2(-)-generating pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1983546572,"The HIV-1 trans-activator Tat increases levels of viral gene expression and replication. The target for Tat is an RNA stem-loop called TAR, located at the 5' end of all viral transcripts. To study the mechanism of action and map functional domains of Tat, we fused Tat to the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2, an RNA binding protein. TAR in the HIV-1 LTR was replaced by the operator, the RNA target of the coat protein. The hybrid Tat-coat protein trans-activated HIV-1 LTRs containing either TAR or operator sequences. Mutations in the operator that weaken binding of the coat protein in vitro led to decreased levels of trans-activation in vivo. Deletions in Tat within the hybrid Tat-coat protein identified activation and RNA binding domains of Tat. These experiments suggest that trans-activation by Tat can occur independently of TAR RNA and DNA binding proteins and that Tat exerts its effects on HIV-1 transcription by directly interacting with the TAR RNA stem-loop."
https://openalex.org/W2022196880,"Fibroblastic 3T3 and endocrine RIN cells were genetically modified by infection with a recombinant retrovirus encoding the form 1 of human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and selection in tyrosine-free medium. These cells were grafted to rats unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine. Both cell types survived implantation into the striatum, expressed TH immunoreactivity, and as assessed by microdialysis 8–9 days after implantation, secreted high amounts of DOPA and/or dopamine into the surrounding host striatum. The modified 3T3 cells secreted large amounts of DOPA that was efficiently decarboxylated to dopamine by the host striatal tissue; the newly synthesized dopamine was stored only to a limited extent in the denervated striatum. The modified RIN cells synthesized dopamine that was stored intracellularly and released in a regulated fashion. The grafted DOPA-secreting cells produced 4–5 times higher extracellular dopamine levels than the dopamine-secreting cells, and they were more efficient in reducing apomorphine-induced rotation. No effect was observed with either cell type on amphetamine-induced turning behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2026495415,"The effects of positively and negatively charged residues on the membrane topology of a model E. coli protein with two transmembrane segments have been studied. We show that addition or removal of as little as a single positively charged lysine residue in one of two critical regions can be sufficient to reverse the transmembrane topology of the molecule from Nout-Cout to Nin-Cin. Negatively charged residues are much less potent and significantly affect the topology only if present in high numbers. Finally, we provide data to suggest that sec-independent and sec-dependent translocation mechanisms differ in their sensitivity to positively charged amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1626958299,"Protein D2 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane is known to facilitate the specific permeation of imipenem (N-formimdoylthienamycin) across this membrane barrier. We have characterized the binding site in the protein D2 channel by studying the competitive inhibition, by various solutes, of imipenem diffusion into the periplasm. We found that basic amino acids, lysine, arginine, histidine, and ornithine, were effective inhibitors. L- and D-lysine were found to be competitive inhibitors with approximate Ki values of 0.6 and 0.3 mM, respectively. Peptides containing L-lysine at the carboxyl terminus, as well as dipeptides containing L-lysine at the amino terminus, were also able to inhibit the transport. Wild type cells transported tripeptide Thr-Ser-Lys into the periplasm three to four times as rapidly as the mutant cells lacking the D2 protein. These results suggest that protein D2 plays a physiologically significant role in the uptake of basic amino acids and peptides containing these amino acids across the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa."
https://openalex.org/W2046586434,"During fruiting body morphogenesis of Myxococcus xanthus, cell movement is required for transmission of C-factor, a short range intercellular signaling protein necessary for sporulation and developmental gene expression. Nonmotile cells fail to sporulate and to express C-factor-dependent genes, but both defects were rescued by a simple manipulation of cell position that oriented the cells in aligned, parallel groups. A similar pattern of aligned cells normally results from coordinated recruitment of wildtype cells into multicellular aggregates, which later form mature fruiting bodies. It is proposed that directed cell movement establishes critical contacts between adjacent cells, which are required for efficient intercellular C-factor transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1543554885,"Novel regulatory proteins for smg p21A and -B, ras p21-like GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) having the same putative effector domain as ras p21s, were purified to near homogeneity from bovine brain cytosol and characterized. These regulatory proteins, designated as GDP dissociation stimulator (GDS) 1 and -2, stimulated the dissociation of both [3H]GDP and [35S] guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) from smg p21s to the same extent. smg p21 GDS1 and -2 also stimulated the binding of [35S]GTP gamma S to the GDP-bound form of smg p21s but not that to the guanine nucleotide-free form. These actions of smg p21 GDS1 and -2 were specific for smg p21s and inactive for other ras p21/ras p21-like G proteins including c-Ha-ras p21, rhoB p20, and smg p25A. Neither smg p21 GDS1 nor -2 stimulated the GTPase activity of smg p21s and by itself showed [35S]GTP gamma S-binding or GTPase activity. smg p21 GDS1 and -2 showed very similar physical and kinetic properties and were indistinguishable by peptide map analysis. The Mr values of smg p21 GDS1 and -2 were estimated to be about 53,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and from the S values, indicating that smg p21 GDS1 and -2 are composed of a single polypeptide without a subunit structure. smg p21 GDS1 and -2 were distinguishable from GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) for the ras and rho proteins, and smg p21B, and GDP dissociation inhibitors for smg p25A and the rho proteins previously identified in bovine brain cytosol. These results indicate that bovine brain contains regulatory proteins for smg p21s that stimulate the dissociation of GDP from and thereby the subsequent binding of GTP to smg p21s in addition to smg p21 GAP. It is likely that the conversion from the GDP-bound inactive form of smg p21s to the GTP-bound active form is regulated by smg p21 GDS and that its reverse reaction is regulated by smg p21 GAP."
https://openalex.org/W1596993093,"The tissue-specific distribution of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (t-PA and u-PA) and their inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was analyzed at mRNA level in five major rat organ tissues. t-PA mRNA was detected in lung, kidney, heart, and liver. u-PA mRNA was detected in kidney and lung. Presence of PA mRNA correlated with the detection of PA activity in extracts of these tissues. PAI-1 mRNA was detected predominantly in heart and lung. Although PAI activity could not be measured directly in tissue extracts, the presence of PAI-1 mRNA correlated with the occurrence of PA·PAI complex in fibrin autography of tissue extracts. Endotoxin injection caused a very large increase in plasma PAI activity. This increase correlated with a marked increase in PAI-1 mRNA in nearly all tissues studied. The increase in PAI-1 mRNA is most pronounced in lung and liver. Endotoxin injection also caused an increased level of t-PA mRNA in heart and kidney, and an increased u-PA mRNA level in kidney. mRNA analysis of freshly isolated and separated subfractionated liver cells showed that the marked increase in PAI-1 mRNA in the liver after endotoxin injection may be due mainly to a strong increase of PAI-1 mRNA in the liver endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1522080250,"Abstract The hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system is under dual control, receiving both stimulatory and inhibitory inputs. Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) transduce signals from cell surface receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase. Hormonal stimulation is propagated via Gs, inhibition by Gi. Persistent (24-h) activation of the stimulatory pathway of adenylyl cyclase by the diterpene forskolin or the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol in S49 mouse lymphoma cells enhanced the effects of somatostatin mediated via the inhibitory pathway of adenylyl cyclase. Stimulating cells with forskolin or isoproterenol for 24 h resulted in a 3-fold increase in the steady-state levels of Gi alpha 2 and a 25% decline in Gs alpha, as quantified by immunoblotting. Within 12 h of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, Gi alpha 2 mRNA levels increased 4-fold, measured by DNA-excess solution hybridization. Gs alpha mRNA levels, in contrast, increased initially (25%), but then declined to 75% of control. In S49 variants that lack functional protein kinase A (kin-), stimulation by isoproterenol failed to alter Gi alpha 2 expression at either the protein or the mRNA levels. A 3-fold increase in relative synthesis rate and no change in the half-life (approximately 80 h) of Gi alpha 2 was observed in response to forskolin stimulation. Although Gs alpha synthesis increased (70%) modestly in response to forskolin stimulation, the half-life of Gs alpha actually decreased from 55 h in naive cells to 34 h in treated cells. Thus, the two G-protein-mediated pathways controlling adenylyl cyclase display cross-regulation. Persistent activation of the stimulatory pathway increases Gi alpha 2 mRNA and expression. Transiently elevated Gs alpha mRNA levels are counterbalanced by a reduction in the half-life of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2089992191,"Arachidonic acid (AA) is a second messenger liberated via receptor activation of phospholipase A2 or diacylglycerol-lipase. We used whole-cell voltage clamp of acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells to investigate the hypothesis that AA modulates Ca2+ channel current (ICa) via activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and generation of free radicals. AA depressed ICa in a dose- and time-dependent manner similar to that previously reported for the action of phorbol esters on ICa. A similar depression was seen with a xanthine-based free radical generating system. The specific PKC inhibitor PKCI (19–36), the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, and the superoxide free radical scavenger SOD each blocked ICa depression by 70%–80%. Complete block of the AA response occurred when SOD was used simultaneously with a PKC inhibitor. These data suggest that PKC and free radicals play a role in AA-induced suppression of ICa."
https://openalex.org/W2025896371,"The (+) single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) of the L-A virus is the species packaged to form new viral particles. Empty L-A viral particles specifically bind viral (+) ssRNA, and a sequence 400 bases from the 3′ end is necessary for this activity. We show that its stem-loop structure, the A residue protruding from the stem, and the loop sequence are all important for the binding, and that this 34 base region is sufficient for the binding. M1, a satellite virus of L-A, has a similar structure on its (+) strand that is likewise sufficient for the binding. Heterologous RNA with the binding sequence from L-A or M1, when expressed in vivo, was packaged in L-A viral particles. Thus, the sites necessary to bind to empty particles are encapsidation signals for the L-A virus. Since the pol domain of the 180 kd minor coat protein appears to be responsible for the binding, this result suggests that the RNA polymerase molecule recognizes the viral genome for packaging."

https://openalex.org/W1502793076,"The regulation of protein kinase C by oleic acid was studied, and parameters that characterize the activation of protein kinase C by oleic acid and distinguish its effects from those of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were delineated. Activation of protein kinase C by sodium oleate required the presence of calcium and showed mild cooperative behavior (Hill number of 1.25) suggesting that Ca(oleate)2 is the active species. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of sodium oleate with substrates indicated that sodium oleate acted to increase the activity of the enzyme without modulating the KM for either MgATP or histone substrates. In this respect, sodium oleate action resembled that of DAG but not PS. However, multiple parameters distinguished the effects of sodium oleate from those of DAG. Unlike DAG, sodium oleate was unable to inhibit phorbol dibutyrate binding to protein kinase C. Sodium oleate also failed to interact with micelle-bound protein kinase C and preferentially activated soluble protein kinase C. The addition of histone caused protein/lipid aggregation in the presence of DAG but not in the presence of oleate. Activation of protein kinase C by sodium oleate or by PS/DAG demonstrated differential susceptibility to the action of inhibitors. Sphingosine and NaCl were more potent in inhibiting activation of protein kinase C by PS/DAG than by sodium oleate. Sodium oleate also expressed PS-like activity in that calcium and oleate acted as cofactors in activation of protein kinase C by DAG. Similar to PS, the ability of oleate to act in synergy with DAG resulted from competitive activation with a decrease in KM(app) of protein kinase C for DAG. Finally, sodium oleate was unable to induce autophosphorylation of protein kinase C. These studies demonstrate that oleate activates protein kinase C by a mechanism that is distinct from PS/DAG but partially overlaps the kinetic effects of both PS and DAG. The significance of these studies is discussed in relation to mechanisms of protein kinase C activation and to the possible physiological relevance of activation of protein kinase C by fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1586395651,"The synthesis of phosphatidylserine and its translocation to the mitochondria were examined in permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells by following the metabolism of a [3H]serine precursor to [3H] phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and [3H]phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). In physiological salt solutions approximating the intracellular ionic composition, both the synthesis of PtdSer and its translocation required ATP. The ATP requirement for PtdSer synthesis could be completely bypassed, and that for translocation could be partially bypassed at Ca2+ concentrations 10(3)-10(4) times the intracellular physiological level (i.e. 1 mM). The ATP-dependent synthesis of PtdSer could be inhibited by chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA, inhibition of Ca2+ sequestration with 2,5-di(tert-butyl)hydroquinone, mobilization of sequestered Ca2+ with ionomycin, and competition for [3H]serine with ethanolamine. The inhibition of the ATP-dependent synthesis of PtdSer by the aforementioned inhibitors provided an efficient method to rapidly arrest the incorporation of [3H]serine into [3H]PtdSer. By pulse-labeling the [3H]PtdSer pool and arresting further synthesis with inhibitors, the translocation of nascent PtdSer could be uncoupled from synthesis. The results of these pulse-labeling-arrest experiments provide unambiguous evidence that PtdSer translocation to the mitochondria is not driven by PtdSer synthesis. The addition of apyrase to ATP-supplemented, permeabilized cells abruptly terminates [3H]serine incorporation into [3H]PtdSer and the decarboxylation of [3H]PtdSer to [3H]PtdEtn, thereby demonstrating that a specific ATP requirement exists for the translocation of nascent PtdSer to the mitochondria in permeabilized cells. The translocation of nascent PtdSer to the mitochondria was unaffected by 45-fold dilution of the standard reaction thus indicating that the translocation intermediate was unlikely to be a freely diffusible complex. The requirements for translocation of nascent phosphatidylserine are different from those for the vesicular movement of proteins insofar as the lipid movement does not require cytosol and is unaffected by the addition of Ca2+, GTP, or GTP gamma S. From these studies, we conclude that: 1) the synthesis and translocation of PtdSer can be readily studied in permeabilized cells, 2) the ATP-dependent synthesis of PtdSer is functionally coupled to the ATP-dependent sequestration of Ca2+ by the endoplasmic reticulum or closely related membranes, 3) PtdSer translocation is independent of its synthesis, and 4) there is a specific requirement for ATP in the translocation of PtdSer to the mitochondria."

This molecule was shown to be extremely cytotoxic for interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor bearing cells in tissue culture (Chaudhary, V. K., Queen, C., Junghans, R. P., Waldmann, T. A., FitzGerald, D. J., and Pastan, I. (1989) Nature 339, 394-397). Here we describe various forms of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 protein in which the order of the variable domains of anti-Tac has been switched and also three different types of peptide linkers have been used. All these proteins were purified to near homogeneity and were found to have similar cytotoxic activities against various human cells expressing the p55 subunit of the IL2 receptor. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was also found to have a very potent suppressive activity against phytohemagglutinin-activated human lymphoblasts and in a human mixed lymphocyte reaction. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 appeared in the blood rapidly in mice after intraperitoneal administration and could be detected in the blood for up to 8 h. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 warrants evaluation as an anti-tumor and immunosuppressive agent in humans."

This study evaluated the role of B cells in the induction of protective T cell immunity to a Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-induced leukemia (FBL). B cell-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced tumor-specific CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses after priming with FBL or a recombinant vaccinia virus containing F-MuLV antigens. Moreover, these mice had diminished T cell responses to the vaccinia viral antigens. Tumor-primed T cells transferred into B cell-deficient mice effectively eradicated disseminated FBL. Thus, B cells appear necessary for efficient priming but not expression of tumor and viral T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1853487016,"The NGFI-A gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein with a predicted molecular mass of congruent to 54 kDa, is rapidly activated in PC12 cells by nerve growth factor (NGF). As a transcription factor, NGFI-A is a potentially important mediator of the cellular response to this growth factor. To characterize this protein, antibodies to four different domains of NGFI-A were raised. Immunogens included a bacterial trpE/NGFI-A fusion protein (A310) and three peptides predicted from the NGFI-A cDNA nucleotide sequence. Three of these antisera recognize two predominant NGFI-A species in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells: a 54-kDa form and a closely spaced doublet at 84 kDa. However, one of these antisera, directed against the last 15 carboxyl terminal residues of NGFI-A, recognizes only the 84-kDa species. Both NGFI-A species are rapidly induced in PC12 cells by NGF, phorbol ester, and the calcium ionophore A23187. Pulse-chase analysis revealed no obvious precursor-product relationship between these two forms and demonstrated that both the 54- and 84-kDa species are short-lived proteins. V8 protease digestion of the 54- and 84-kDa forms resulted in the formation of several small peptides that were common to both species. The digest of each species also contained one large, relatively V8 protease-resistant fragment that was substantially larger in digests of the 84-kDa form. These two fragments contained common epitopes and were derived from the amino-terminal portion of the NGFI-A protein. When NGFI-A was incubated with alkaline phosphatase, the 84-kDa doublet resolved into a single band with slightly increased mobility, indicating that this form is phosphorylated. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that the 84-kDa species are found exclusively in the nucleus, while the 54-kDa form resides solely in the cytoplasm. It therefore appears that the 54-kDa form lacks the signal necessary for nuclear localization and is missing a portion of the carboxyl terminal domain."

(1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 527-542). In the present study we demonstrate that toxin attack on gel-filtered human platelets initiates the assembly of prothrombinase complexes at rates up to 10-fold of controls. Treatment of platelets with 0.1 microgram/ml alpha-toxin resulted in generation of 1.4 units of thrombin/10(8) platelets. A similar rate of thrombin generation was noted when platelets were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. However, the alpha-toxin-induced prothrombinase activity was not due to platelet lysis, since less than 1% of total cellular lactate dehydrogenase was released by this alpha-toxin concentration. Two distinct and dissociable processes contributed to enhanced prothrombinase assembly. First, alpha-toxin promoted the exocytotic release of factor V from alpha-granules, which was accompanied by co-secretion of platelet factor 4. This process was calcium-dependent. Second, toxin-treated platelets exhibited an enhanced capacity to bind external factor V(a), a phenomenon that was not linked to Ca2(+)-dependent factor V secretion. Assembly of prothrombinase complexes via these two mechanisms together accounts for the procoagulant action of S. aureus alpha-toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1529450128,"Previous studies on the topography of the reactions leading to the formation of dolichol-P-P-Glc-NAc2Man9Glc3 have shown that these occur on both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Hirschberg, C. B., and Snider, M. D. (1987) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 56, 63-87). Dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2Man5 has been detected on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane while the subsequent dolichol-oligosaccharide intermediates face the lumen. Less clear is the side of the membrane where dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2 is assembled. We now present evidence strongly suggesting that the active sites of the enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of this latter intermediate are on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In addition, dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2 has also been detected on this side. Incubations of sealed, right side out rat liver endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles with [beta-32P] UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of 5-Br-UMP resulted in the formation of radiolabeled dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc and dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2 under conditions where there was complete inhibition of transport of the nucleotide sugar. In other experiments with the above radiolabeled nucleotide sugar and sealed vesicles, it was demonstrated that EDTA (a membrane-impermeable reagent) inhibited the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase under conditions where transport of the nucleotide sugar into the lumen was unaffected. Finally, sealed vesicles were first incubated with [32P]UDP-GlcNAc and subsequently with UDP-Gal and soluble galactosyltransferase. This resulted in galactosylation of dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2. The above results, together with the previous observations, strongly suggest that all reactions leading to this latter dolichol intermediate occur on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2131549178,"Production of the potent lipid autacoid, platelet-activating factor (PAF), is a stimulated response of the endothelium which has important physiologic consequences including mediating adherence of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. Consequently, an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate PAF synthesis by the endothelium is important. To this end, we investigated the role of G proteins as a component of the signal transduction pathway that couples hormonal stimuli to PAF production. The addition of aluminum fluoride (AlF-4) to endothelial cells resulted in production of PAF with a maximal effect at 20 mM fluoride and within 20-60 min of exposure. Alf-4 also augmented the production of PAF which occurs in response to hormonal agonists. In addition, submaximal concentrations of AlF-4 converted an ineffective hormonal agonist (thrombin in bovine cells) to a maximally effective agonist. The adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells that had been exposed previously to AlF-4 was increased in a manner that paralleled PAF production. PAF production in response to AlF-4 was not consistently affected by pertussis or cholera toxin. Introduction of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) into permeabilized endothelial cells also resulted in PAF production, with reversal by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), consistent with an effect mediated by a G protein. G protein activation with AlF-4 or GTP gamma S resulted in entry of extracellular Ca2+ as determined using 45Ca2+ flux studies and Indo-1 spectrofluorometry. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that G proteins couple hormone-receptor binding to opening of a membrane calcium channel, a key step in the initiation of PAF production in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1501945442,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is composed of three structural domains that are responsible for cell recognition, membrane translocation, and ADP-ribosylation. The deletion of the cell recognition domain (domain Ia) of PE results in a molecule that does not bind to target cells and has low toxicity in mice (Hwang, J., FitzGerald, D.J.P., Adhya, S., and Pastan, I. (1987) Cell 48, 129-136). To determine the specific sequences required for cell binding as well as cell and animal toxicity, a series of domain I mutants was constructed. Using a T7 promoter-based expression system and an OmpA signal sequence, large amounts of the various mutant toxins were secreted into the periplasm from which they were easily purified in milligram quantities. The data indicate that amino acids at positions 246, 247, and 249 have an important role in the toxicity of PE. Conversion of these amino acids to glutamic acid or glycine but not to lysine or deletion of amino acids 241-250 diminishes the toxicity of PE. When combined with a mutation at position 57 a molecule is created that has very low toxicity against cultured cells or in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1571680440,"The biosynthesis of pipecolic acid from L-lysine in the fungal parasite, Rhizoctonia leguminicola has been reinvestigated. Pipecolate is then utilized to form the toxic octahydroindolizine alkaloids, slaframine and swainsonine. Incorporation studies of L-versus D-[U-14C]lysine into R. leguminicola metabolites confirmed earlier findings that L-lysine is the predominant substrate for pipecolate formation and D-lysine for alpha-N-acetyllysine (concerned in lysine catabolism). However [alpha-15N]lysine, not [epsilon-15N]lysine as previously reported, labeled pipecolate. Such findings implied that delta 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate, not delta 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate, was formed from lysine and was the immediate precursor of pipecolate. Evidence from cell-free enzyme systems established the following biosynthetic events: L-lysine A----saccharopine B----delta 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate C----pipecolate. Products of reactions A and C were identified from biological and chemical considerations. Reaction B was carried out by a previously undescribed flavin enzyme termed saccharopine oxidase. The product of reaction B, which reacted with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, was reduced with Na-CNB2H3. Its NMR spectrum was identical with that of deuteriated pipecolate prepared from authentic delta 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate, but not from authentic delta 1-piperideine-2-carboxylate. Reaction B represents a branching of primary lysine metabolism from saccharopine to a secondary pathway leading to pipecolate and to octahydroindolizine alkaloids in R. leguminicola."

https://openalex.org/W2108460292,"The enzymatic methylation of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) gamma-subunit was investigated in brain membranes. Brain membranes were methylated in vitro using [3H-methyl]S-adenosylmethionine, and the G-protein beta gamma-complex was purified using an anti-beta antibody to assay for the protein during purification. The isolated G-protein beta gamma-complex was found to be carboxyl methylated on the gamma-subunit. The methyl group was localized by tryptic digestion to the carboxyl-terminal of the protein. The methylated tryptic peptides contained a modified cysteine and were very hydrophobic, suggesting additional modification by lipidation. The evidence suggests that the COOH-terminal of G-gamma is modified in a manner similar to the processing that occurs with the ras proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1583179252,"Millimolar concentrations of manganese are required for maximal activation of purified galactosyltransferase (lactose synthase, EC 2.4.1.22), the enzyme that catalyzes addition of galactosyl groups to proteins and, in lactose synthesis, to glucose. To examine manganese activation of this enzyme under in vivo conditions, we studied intact, partially purified Golgi membranes from mouse mammary glands. In intact vesicles treated with the divalent cation ionophore, A23187, activation followed Michaelis-Menton kinetics with a Km of 3 microM; maximal activation was achieved below 10 microM manganese. In both detergent-solubilized and leaky vesicles the kinetics of manganese activation were consistent with the presence of two manganese-binding sites with dissociation constants about 40 microM and 20 mM. The difference is consistent with the presence in intact vesicles of an endogenous activator too large to traverse the membrane via A23187; this activator could bind to the low affinity manganese site allowing manganese or another divalent cation such as zinc to activate the enzyme at micromolar concentrations. The Km for UDP-galactose was found to be similar in the vesicular and solubilized preparations at micromolar and millimolar manganese concentrations, respectively, providing additional evidence for this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1608771426,"By using a hemolytic plaque assay to detect release of lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was shown previously to induce secretion of these granule proteins from single adherent neutrophils. Secretion was inhibited by loading neutrophils with calcium chelators, indicating a crucial role of cytosolic free [Ca2+] in the signal transduction mechanism of TNF. In the present study, using a microfluorometer technique to follow changes in the cytosolic free [Ca2+] in single adherent neutrophils, we were not able to detect any TNF-induced [Ca2+] transients. However, these adherent cells exhibited spontaneous oscillations of their cytosolic free [Ca2+], as previously reported (Jaconi, M.E.E., Rivest, R.W., Schlegel, W., Wollheim, C.B., Pittet, D., and Lew, P.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10557-10560). A close correlation was found between a reduced oscillatory activity of cytosolic free [Ca2+] and a reduced ability of TNF to induce degranulation, by reducing the extracellular [Ca2+] or loading the cells with a calcium chelator (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid). In addition, when the cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 h there was a parallel decline in the spontaneous oscillatory activity of cytosolic free [Ca2+] and TNF-induced secretion of lactoferrin. Control experiments showed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced secretion was not affected under the same conditions, indicating that the secretory process per se was not disturbed. We conclude that TNF by itself does not give rise to any changes of the cytosolic free [Ca2+] but that the spontaneous oscillatory activity of cytosolic free [Ca2+] in adherent neutrophils is necessary for TNF-induced degranulation."
https://openalex.org/W1514373528,"X-ray crystallographic diffraction data has been collected for recombinant hexadecameric ribulose-P2 carboxylase from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC6301 expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme has been purified and then crystallized in a number of crystal forms from polyethylene glycol solutions. The best crystals were obtained with enzyme that was first activated with the cofactors CO2 and Mg2+ in the presence of the tight-binding intermediate analogue, 2'-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. One crystal form with plate-like morphology diffracts beyond 2.5 A but has one axis greater than 350 A. A second crystal form that diffracts to similar resolution grows with space group P212121 and unit cell dimensions of a = 223.9 A, b = 111.9 A, and c = 199.7 A. The crystal forms used to collect the diffraction data have been redissolved to determine that the recombinant ribulose-P2 carboxylase L8S8 molecule is indeed composed of equal numbers of large and small subunits and also that a quaternary complex between activated ribulose-P2 carboxylase E.CO2.Mg2+, and the analogue was present in the crystals. Denaturation of the redissolved enzyme in the absence of thiol-reducing agents established that the L-subunits of the L8 core are substantially dimeric, cross-linked by a disulfide bridge. Crystals of spinach ribulose-P2 carboxylase were likewise analyzed to show that dimers of the L-subunit were also predominant. This report identifies a single cysteine residue in the L-subunit that forms a bridge between those L-monomers that compose the four putative functional dimers of the L8 core."
https://openalex.org/W1537989121,"The kringle-2 domain (residues 176-262) of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant peptide, which concentrated in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, was isolated, solubilized, chemically refolded, and purified by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose to apparent homogeneity. [35S]Cysteine-methionine-labeled polypeptide was used to study the interactions of kringle-2 with lysine, fibrin, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The kringle-2 domain bound to lysine-Sepharose and to preformed fibrin with a Kd = 104 +/- 6.2 microM (0.86 +/- 0.012 binding site) and a Kd = 4.2 +/- 1.05 microM (0.80 +/- 0.081 binding site), respectively. Competition experiments and direct binding studies showed that the kringle-2 domain is required for the formation of the ternary t-PA-plasminogen-intact fibrin complex and that the association between the t-PA kringle-2 domain and fibrin does not require plasmin degradation of fibrin and exposure of new COOH-terminal lysine residues. We also observed that kringle-2 forms a complex with highly purified guanidine-activated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, dissociable by 0.2 M epsilon-aminocaproic acid. The kringle-2 polypeptide significantly inhibited tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 interaction. The kringle-2 domain bound to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in a specific and saturable manner with a Kd = 0.51 +/- 0.055 microM (0.35 +/- 0.026 binding site). Therefore, the t-PA kringle-2 domain is important for the interaction of t-PA not only with fibrin, but also with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thus represents a key structure in the regulation of fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1485448138,"Abstract Incubation of a microsomal fraction from murine mastocytoma, with UDP-[1-3H]GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), yielded labeled, N-sulfated polysaccharides, in which most of the incorporated O-sulfate groups were located at C2 of L-iduronic acid and at C6 of D-glucosamine units. Analysis by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography of disaccharides, generated by deaminative cleavage of these polysaccharides, revealed that, in addition, an appreciable portion of the -GlcNSO3-HexA-GlcNSO3- sequences in the intact polymers contained O-sulfated (at C2 or C3) D-glucuronic acid units. Calculations based on such compositional analysis of the N- and O-sulfated biosynthetic product, isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, showed that glucuronosyl 2/3-O-sulfate accounted for approximately 12% of the total incorporated O-sulfate groups. With [35S]PAPS (at a low total PAPS concentration) as an alternative source of label, the sulfated glucuronic acid residues were again detectable, albeit in much smaller amounts (1.8% of the total O-sulfate groups). Incorporation of label from UDP-[5-3H]GlcA was retained by the O-sulfated glucuronic acid units, thus demonstrating that these components had in fact been formed by sulfation of glucuronic acid residues and not by back epimerization of sulfated iduronic acid units. Structural analysis of polysaccharide intermediates at various stages of biosynthetic polymer modification, separated by ion-exchange chromatography, showed O-sulfation of glucuronic and iduronic acid units to appear simultaneously and before the 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1577718336,"The synapsins are a family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins that selectively bind to small synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Using the cDNA encoding rat synapsin IIb, we employed an Escherichia coli expression system to synthesize a variety of fusion proteins containing a truncated protein A linked to different portions of the NH2-terminal region of synapsin II. The recombinant proteins were purified by IgG-Sepharose chromatography and tested in vitro for their ability to bind to purified synaptic vesicles. These experiments identified a region between amino acids 43 and 121 of the amino-terminal portion of synapsin II which binds to synaptic vesicles. Mild trypsinization of synaptic vesicles reduces binding of recombinant proteins to synaptic vesicles, suggesting that the interaction between synapsin II and the vesicles is in part mediated by a synaptic vesicle protein. The 42 NH2-terminal amino acids of synapsin II are not necessary for binding to synaptic vesicles, although this domain contains the phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1577367559,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has an anabolic and a catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase). In vitro, these homologous enzymes catalyze the same reaction (ornithine + carbamoyl phosphate (CP) in equilibrium citrulline + Pi), yet in vivo they function unidirectionally owing to specific kinetic properties. The catabolic OTC-ase cannot promote the anabolic reaction (citrulline formation) in vivo because of a sigmoidal CP saturation curve and a high CP concentration for half-maximal velocity. The structural basis for this kinetic specialization was examined. The catabolic OTCase lost most of its homotropic cooperativity and gained anabolic activity when an amino acid residue near the CP binding site, Glu-106, was replaced by alanine or glycine. In the anabolic OTCase of Escherichia coli the glutamine residue corresponding to Glu-106 was exchanged for glutamate; however, in this case no CP cooperativity was acquired. Thus, in catabolic OTCase, sequence features in addition to Glu-106 are important for sigmoidal CP saturation, and such a sequence was identified in the C-terminal part. By an in vivo gene fusion technique the 9 C-terminal amino acids of catabolic OTCase were replaced by the homologous 8 amino acids from anabolic OTCase of E. coli; the hybrid enzyme had a markedly reduced homotropic cooperativity. This gene fusion method should be generally useful for directed enzyme evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1557839857,"The mechanism of decline in the catalytic activity of intestinal lactase during neonatal maturation has not been defined, but a shift in the lactase subunit synthesis from an active 130-kDa subunit to an inactive 100-kDa species has now been noted in the adult rat (Quan, R., Santiago, N. A., Tsuboi, K. K., and Gray, G. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 15882-15888). The subunit structure, synthesis, intracellular assembly, and subsequent degradation of lactase from the brush-border surface membrane was examined in 15-day-old pre-weaned and 30-day-old post-weaned intact rats. Lactase was labeled intraintestinally with [35S]methionine, isolated from Triton-solubilized membranes with monospecific polyclonal anti-lactase, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The protein-stained gel revealed subunits of 225 and 130 kDa, the latter species predominating in both the pre- and post-weaned state. The distinct adult-type 100-kDa moiety was present in post-weaned animals while only a trace of a slightly larger (approximately 110 kDa) species was observed in pre-weaned animals. Quantitation of radioactivity in newly synthesized lactase revealed an increasing prominence of the 100-kDa species in post-weaned rats (130/100 incorporation ratio: pre-weaned 6.2; post-weaned 3.3). Accumulation of newly labeled lactase in brush-border membranes after intraperitoneal [35S]methionine labeling was similar in both groups at 3 h. Despite these comparable rates of lactase synthesis, assembly and insertion in the pre- and post-weaned state, subsequent removal of the 130-kDa unit was more rapid in post-weaned animals (t1/2 = 11 h; pre-weaned t1/2 = 37 h). In intact rats, the neonatal maturational decline in lactase catalytic activities involves both a shift to production of the inactive 100-kDa subunit and increased membrane surface degradation of the active 130-kDa subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1592761587,"The chimeric toxin IL6-PE40, which is composed of interleukin 6 (IL6) fused to a mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) devoid of its native cell recognition domain, can kill myeloma and hepatoma cells which express high levels of IL6 receptors. To enhance the usefulness of IL6-PE40 on potential target cells, we have attempted to develop more potent IL6-PE derivatives. We have developed nine new IL6-PE derivatives and assessed their cytotoxicity on human myeloma cells. Two of these new forms, IL6-domain II-PE40 and IL6-PE664Glu were more toxic to myeloma cells bearing IL6 receptors than was IL6-PE40. These two chimeric toxins were compared with IL6-PE40 for cytotoxicity toward a variety of tumor cell lines. We found that most tumor cell lines which are sensitive to IL6-PE40 are more sensitive to IL6-domain II-PE40 and IL6-PE664Glu. Cells with as few as 200-600 IL6 receptors/cell could be killed. The specificity of these chimeric toxins was shown through competition with recombinant IL6. Toxicity studies in mice demonstrated that the two new molecules had an LD50 of 10-20 micrograms/mouse. This compares to an IL6-PE40 LD50 of 20 micrograms/mouse. The new IL6-toxins could be detected in the serum up to 8 h after intraperitoneal administration with a peak at 1 h. These data suggest that IL6-domain II-PE40 and IL6-PE664Glu may be more useful than IL6-PE40 in killing IL6 receptor-bearing tumor cells in animals."
https://openalex.org/W1634852129,"The regulatory mechanism of decline in catalytic activity for intestinal lactase (lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, beta-galactosidase) as mammals mature has not been defined. Solubilized intestinal brush-border membranes from adult male rats (greater than 4 months of age, 200-400 g) were examined by high performance liquid Zorbax GF-450 chromatography, subjected to denaturing acrylamide electrophoresis, blotted to nitrocellulose, and identified by specific polyvalent anti-lactase. Three major species were present within the 235-kDa active lactase peak (225, 130, and 100 kDa). The 100-kDa moiety was also prominent in the approximately 300-kDa region of the GF-450 effluent, suggesting it is a catalytically inactive oligomer. In vivo synthesis and assembly of lactase by intraintestinal pulse [( 35S]methionine, 5 min) and chase (15-120 min) revealed rapid (15 min of chase; maximum, 60 min) intracellular synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi fraction of multiple species (64, 100, 130, 175, and 225 kDa). The 64-kDa species disappeared from the intracellular membrane compartment and was not transferred to the brush-border surface. The 175-kDa moiety appeared to be processed to the 225-kDa unit prior to relocation to the surface membrane. By 120 min, the 100-kDa species became the predominant (approximately 60%) radiolabeled unit in both endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi and brush border. In the adult rat, lactase is assembled in multiple molecular forms that are differentially processed: (a) intracellular degradation (64-kDa unit) or (b) transfer to the brush-border surface as catalytically active (225 and 130 kDa) or inactive (100 kDa) species. Although substantial synthesis of lactase proteins prevails, major changes in processing appear to serve as an important regulatory mechanism producing the maturational decline of catalytic activity. The accompanying article (Castillo, R. O., Reisenauer, A. M., Kwong, L. K., Tsuboi, K. K., Quan, R., and Gray, G. M. (1990) J. Biol.

(1982) J. Cell. Physiol. 113, 314-319). Growth of crB in a chemically defined lipid-poor medium is very slow and is enhanced by a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Incorporation of [3H]acetate into total fatty acids is 4-fold lower in crB compared to that in parental Chinese hamster ovary K1 and in contrast to the wild-type cells, crB cells are unable to synthesize either stearate or oleate. In addition, crB cells can not elongate exogenous palmitate, while they are capable of desaturating exogenous stearate. The mutant cells are also pleiotropically defective in the regulation of mRNA levels for the enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. 25-Hydroxycholesterol is a poor regulator of the synthesis and degradation of the rate-limiting enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in crB in comparison to the wild-type Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells. The defect in the elongation of fatty acids is reversed in revertants of crB selected for their ability to grow in lipid-poor medium. Such revertants exhibit normal regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Regulation of reductase activity in crB cells can also be restored by supplementing the culture medium with a mixture of fatty acids that restores normal growth rate. The defective regulation of reductase in crB does not appear to be due to nonspecific adverse effects of fatty acid starvation nor is it due to any gross change in the fatty acid composition of cellular phospholipids. These results strongly suggest a direct relationship between the fatty acid auxotrophy of crB and defective regulation of the enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis."
