https://openalex.org/W3201928650,"MXenes are a growing family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides that are densely stacked into macroscopically layered films and have been considered for applications such as flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. However, the mechanical and electrical reliabilities of titanium carbide MXene films are affected by voids in their structure. We applied sequential bridging of hydrogen and covalent bonding agents to induce the densification of MXene films and removal of the voids, leading to highly compact MXene films. The obtained MXene films show high tensile strength, in combination with high toughness, electrical conductivity, and EMI shielding capability. Our high-performance MXene films are scalable, providing an avenue for assembling other two-dimensional platelets into high-performance films."

Recently, relaxor ferroelectrics characterized by nanodomains have shown great promise as dielectrics with high energy density and high efficiency. We demonstrate substantial enhancements of energy storage properties in relaxor ferroelectric films with a superparaelectric design. The nanodomains are scaled down to polar clusters of several unit cells so that polarization switching hysteresis is nearly eliminated while relatively high polarization is maintained. We achieve an ultrahigh energy density of 152 joules per cubic centimeter with markedly improved efficiency (>90% at an electric field of 3.5 megavolts per centimeter) in superparaelectric samarium-doped bismuth ferrite–barium titanate films. This superparaelectric strategy is generally applicable to optimize dielectric and other related functionalities of relaxor ferroelectrics."
https://openalex.org/W3203337299,"Mitigating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics is perceived as energy intensive and costly. We developed a bottom-up model that represents the life cycle of 90% of global plastics to examine pathways to net-zero emission plastics. Our results show that net-zero emission plastics can be achieved by combining biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization with an effective recycling rate of 70% while saving 34 to 53% of energy. Operational costs for net-zero emission plastics are in the same range as those for linear fossil-based production with carbon capture and storage and could even be substantially reduced. Realizing the full cost-saving potential of 288 billion US dollars requires low-cost supply of biomass and CO2, high-cost supply of oil, and incentivizing large-scale recycling and lowering investment barriers for all technologies that use renewable carbon feedstock."
https://openalex.org/W3198344223,"IscB proteins are putative nucleases encoded in a distinct family of IS200/IS605 transposons and are likely ancestors of the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9, but the functions of IscB and its interactions with any RNA remain uncharacterized. Using evolutionary analysis, RNA sequencing, and biochemical experiments, we reconstructed the evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 systems from IS200/IS605 transposons. We found that IscB uses a single noncoding RNA for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA and can be harnessed for genome editing in human cells. We also demonstrate the RNA-guided nuclease activity of TnpB, another IS200/IS605 transposon-encoded protein and the likely ancestor of Cas12 endonucleases. This work reveals a widespread class of transposon-encoded RNA-guided nucleases, which we name OMEGA (obligate mobile element–guided activity), with strong potential for developing as biotechnologies."
https://openalex.org/W3202125399,"Climate variability in the tropical Pacific affects global climate on a wide range of time scales. On interannual time scales, the tropical Pacific is home to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Decadal variations and changes in the tropical Pacific, referred to here collectively as tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV), also profoundly affect the climate system. Here, we use TPDV to refer to any form of decadal climate variability or change that occurs in the atmosphere, the ocean, and over land within the tropical Pacific. “Decadal,” which we use in a broad sense to encompass multiyear through multidecadal time scales, includes variability about the mean state on decadal time scales, externally forced mean-state changes that unfold on decadal time scales, and decadal variations in the behavior of higher-frequency modes like ENSO."
https://openalex.org/W3203063971,"Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energy-expensive process, and the light available to plants has been proposed to be a primary influencer. We demonstrate that the light-induced soybean TGACG-motif binding factor 3/4 (GmSTF3/4) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (GmFTs), which move from shoots to roots, interdependently induce nodule organogenesis. Rhizobium-activated calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) phosphorylates GmSTF3, triggering GmSTF3–GmFT2a complex formation, which directly activates expression of nodule inception (NIN) and nuclear factor Y (NF-YA1 and NF-YB1). Accordingly, the CCaMK–STF–FT module integrates aboveground light signals with underground symbiotic signaling, ensuring that the host plant informs its roots that the aboveground environment is prepared to sustainably supply the carbohydrate necessary for symbiosis. These results suggest approaches that could enhance the balance of carbon and nitrogen in the biosphere."

We used data from a dense seismic network in Uttarakhand, India, to detect and track a fatal rockslide to mass flow to flood cascade and examine the potential for regional networks to provide early warning for extreme flow events. Detection limits of the 7 February 2021 event depend on the nature of the active process and on the anthropogenic and environmental seismic noise levels at each station. With the existing network, a seismic monitoring system could have detected all event phases from up to 100 kilometers and provided downstream warnings within minutes of event initiation."
https://openalex.org/W3202753301,"The competition between antiferromagnetism and hole motion in two-dimensional Mott insulators lies at the heart of a doping-dependent transition from an anomalous metal to a conventional Fermi liquid. We observe such a crossover in Fermi-Hubbard systems on a cold-atom quantum simulator and reveal the transformation of multipoint correlations between spins and holes upon increasing doping at temperatures around the superexchange energy. Conventional observables, such as spin susceptibility, are furthermore computed from the microscopic snapshots of the system. Starting from a magnetic polaron regime, we find the system evolves into a Fermi liquid featuring incommensurate magnetic fluctuations and fundamentally altered correlations. The crossover is completed for hole dopings around 30%. Our work benchmarks theoretical approaches and discusses possible connections to lower-temperature phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W3203942358,"Facial expressions, and the ability to recognize these expressions, have evolved in humans to communicate information to one another. Face masks are equipment used in healthcare by health professionals to prevent the transmission of airborne infections. As part of the social distancing efforts related to COVID-19, wearing facial masks has been practiced globally. Such practice might influence affective information communication among humans. Previous research suggests that masks disrupt expression recognition of some emotions (e.g., fear, sadness or neutrality) and lower the confidence in their identification. To extend the previous research, in the current study we tested a larger and more diverse sample of individuals and also investigated the effect of masks on perceived intensity of expressions. Moreover, for the first time in the literature we examined these questions using individuals with autistic traits. Specifically, across three experiments using different populations (college students and general population), and the 10-item Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10; lower and higher scorers), we tested the effect of facial masks on facial emotion recognition of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutrality. Results showed that the ability to identify all facial expressions decreased when faces were masked, a finding observed across all three studies, contradicting previous research on fear, sad, and neutral expressions. Participants were also less confident in their judgements for all emotions, supporting previous research; and participants perceived emotions as less expressive in the mask condition compared to the unmasked condition, a finding novel to the literature. An additional novel finding was that participants with higher scores on the AQ-10 were less accurate and less confident overall in facial expression recognition, as well as perceiving expressions as less intense. Our findings reveal that wearing face masks decreases facial expression recognition, confidence in expression identification, as well as the perception of intensity for all expressions, affecting high-scoring AQ-10 individuals more than low-scoring individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3202201721,"Mapping protein interactions driving cancer Cancer is a genetic disease, and much cancer research is focused on identifying carcinogenic mutations and determining how they relate to disease progression. Three papers demonstrate how mutations are processed through networks of protein interactions to promote cancer (see the Perspective by Cheng and Jackson). Swaney et al . focus on head and neck cancer and identify cancer-enriched interactions, demonstrating how point mutant–dependent interactions of PIK3CA, a kinase frequently mutated in human cancers, are predictive of drug response. Kim et al . focus on breast cancer and identify two proteins functionally connected to the tumor-suppressor gene BRCA1 and two proteins that regulate PIK3CA. Zheng et al . developed a statistical model that identifies protein networks that are under mutation pressure across different cancer types, including a complex bringing together PIK3CA with actomyosin proteins. These papers provide a resource that will be helpful in interpreting cancer genomic data. —VV"
https://openalex.org/W3202323137,"Extremely contagious pathogens are a global biosecurity threat because of their high burden of morbidity and mortality, as well as their capacity for fast-moving epidemics that are difficult to quell. Understanding the mechanisms enabling persistence of highly transmissible pathogens in host populations is thus a central problem in disease ecology. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we investigated how highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease viruses persist in the African buffalo, which serves as their wildlife reservoir. We found that viral persistence through transmission among acutely infected hosts alone is unlikely. However, the inclusion of occasional transmission from persistently infected carriers reliably rescues the most infectious viral strain from fade-out. Additional mechanisms such as antigenic shift, loss of immunity, or spillover among host populations may be required for persistence of less transmissible strains."
https://openalex.org/W3204227268,"Background COVID-19 is affecting the entire population of India. Understanding district level correlates of the COVID-19’s infection ratio (IR) is essential for formulating policies and interventions. Objective The present study aims to investigate the district level variation in COVID-19 during March-October 2020. The present study also examines the association between India’s socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and the COVID-19 infection ratio at the district level. Data and methods We used publicly available crowdsourced district-level data on COVID-19 from March 14, 2020, to October 31, 2020. We identified hotspot and cold spot districts for COVID-19 cases and infection ratio. We have also carried out two sets of regression analysis to highlight the district level demographic, socioeconomic, household infrastructure facilities, and health-related correlates of the COVID-19 infection ratio. Results The results showed on October 31, 2020, the IR in India was 42.85 per hundred thousand population, with the highest in Kerala (259.63) and the lowest in Bihar (6.58). About 80 percent infected cases and 61 percent deaths were observed in nine states (Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana). Moran’s- I showed a positive yet poor spatial clustering in the COVID-19 IR over neighboring districts. Our regression analysis demonstrated that percent of 15–59 aged population, district population density, percent of the urban population, district-level testing ratio, and percent of stunted children were significantly and positively associated with the COVID-19 infection ratio. We also found that, with an increasing percentage of literacy, there is a lower infection ratio in Indian districts. Conclusion The COVID-19 infection ratio was found to be more rampant in districts with a higher working-age population, higher population density, a higher urban population, a higher testing ratio, and a higher level of stunted children. The study findings provide crucial information for policy discourse, emphasizing the vulnerability of the highly urbanized and densely populated areas."
https://openalex.org/W3201855939,Objective To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is present in the vagina of women diagnosed with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Study design The study was conducted prospectively in a university affiliated hospital. Forty-one women of reproductive age whose nasopharyngeal PCR test were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and clinically diagnosed with pneumonia were included in the study. Vaginal swabs were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests when the patients were admitted to the inpatient service before pneumonia treatment was initiated. Results Vaginal swab samples of 38 patients were analysed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. None of the vaginal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 does not infect the vagina of women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
https://openalex.org/W3203434630,"Tuta absoluta is one of the most damaging pests of tomato crops worldwide. Damage due to larvae may cause up to 100% loss of tomato production. Use of natural enemies to control the pest, notably predatory mirids such as Nesidiocoris tenuis and Macrolophus pygmaeus , is increasingly being promoted. However, considering the potential damage caused to tomatoes by these omnivorous predators in the absence of T . absoluta , an alternative solution could be required to reduce tomato damage and improve the predators’ performance. The use of companion plants can be an innovative solution to cope with these issues. The present study aimed to determine the influence of companion plants and alternative preys on the predators’ performance in controlling T . absoluta and protecting tomato plants. We evaluated the effect of predators (alone or combined) and a companion plant (sesame ( Sesamum indicum )) on T . absoluta egg predation and crop damage caused by N . tenuis . The influence of an alternative prey ( Ephestia kuehniella eggs) on the spatial distribution of predators was also evaluated by caging them in the prey presence or absence, either on tomato or sesame plants or on both. We found that the presence of sesame did not reduce the efficacy of N . tenuis or M . pygmaeus in consuming T . absoluta eggs; hatched egg proportion decreased when N . tenuis , M . pygmaeus , or both predators were present. More specifically, this proportion was more strongly reduced when both predators were combined. Sesame presence also reduced necrotic rings caused by N . tenuis on tomato plants. Nesidiocoris tenuis preferred sesame over tomato plants (except when food was provided only on the tomato plant) and the upper part of the plants, whereas M . pygmaeus preferred tomato to sesame plants (except when food was provided only on the sesame plant) and had no preference for a plant part. Combination of predators N . tenuis and M . pygmaeus allows for better coverage of cultivated plants in terms of occupation of different plant parts and better regulation of T . absoluta populations. Sesamum indicum is a potential companion plant that can be used to significantly reduce N . tenuis damage to tomatoes."
https://openalex.org/W3203087818,"Global shortages of N95 respirators have led to an urgent need of N95 decontamination and reuse methods that are scientifically validated and available world-wide. Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low-resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple, scalable method to provide controlled humidity and temperature for individual N95 respirators which is easily applicable in low-resource settings. N95 respirators were subjected to moist heat (&gt;50% relative humidity, 65–80°C temperature) for over 30 minutes by placing them in a sealed container immersed in water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3–4.99 μm incense particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges. This method was then repeated at a higher ambient temperature and humidity in Mumbai, using standard utensils commonly found in South Asia. Similar temperature and humidity profiles were achieved with no degradation in filtration efficiencies after 6 cycles. Higher temperatures (&gt;70°C) and longer treatment times (&gt;40 minutes) were obtained by insulating the outer vessel. We also showed that the same method can be applied for the decontamination of surgical masks. This simple yet reliable method can be performed even without electricity access using any heat source to boil water, from open-flame stoves to solar heating, and provides a low-cost route for N95 decontamination globally applicable in resource-constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W3203050577,"Promoting farmland transfer through the farmland rental market is an essential instrument to achieve the scale economy of agricultural production in China. However, past literature on the land reform in China pays more attention to the renting-in household or the renting-out household, respectively, less to both types of households together. Using a large-scale survey of farm households in China, we examine the determinants of participation in the farmland rental market and quantify the impact of the rental market on farmers' income. Findings show household off-farm income, family members' part-time employment, agricultural subsidies, and participation in agricultural cooperatives significantly affect farmers' participation in the farmland rental market. Participation in the farmland rental market significantly increases the income of renting-in households, while it decreases the income of renting-out households, which might result from the temporary lag effect of the land system reform."
https://openalex.org/W3203172962,"Objective To analyze the geographical variation in the provision of health services, namely in demand, patterns of utilization, and effectiveness in the Brazilian Health Regions in four different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, from February 2020 to March 2021. Methods Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Results There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively. Conclusion The Heath Regions in Brazil are highly diverse, showing broad disparities in the capacity to respond to the demands imposed by COVID-19, services provided, use and outcomes."

Taking the express industry as the research object, from strategic management accounting, the study uses edge computing and related analysis tools and compares the financial and non-financial indicators of existing express enterprises. The study also discusses the differences between asset structure allocation and sustainable profitability, and constructs the corresponding analysis framework. The results reveal that SF’s total assets are obviously large and the profit margin increases. While the total assets of other express enterprises are small, and the express revenue drops sharply. Heavy assets can improve the enterprises’ profitability to a certain extent. SF has a good asset management ability. With the support of the capital market, SF’s net asset growth ability has been greatly improved. The edge computing method used has higher local data processing ability, and the analysis framework has higher performance than the big data processing method. The study can provide some research ideas and practical value for the asset structure analysis and profitability evaluation of express enterprises."
https://openalex.org/W3202386849,"Congestive heart failure, a prominent cardiovascular disease results primarily from myocardial infarction or ischemia. Milrinone (MRN), a widely used clinical drug for heart failure, improves myocardial contractility and cardiac function through its inotropic and vasodilatory effects. However, lacking target specificity, it exhibits low bioavailability and lower body retention time. Therefore, in this study, angiotensin II (AT1) peptide conjugated human serum albumin nanoparticles (AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs) have been synthesized for targeted delivery of MRN to the myocardium, overexpressing AT1 receptors under heart failure. The NPs were surface functionalized through a covalent conjugation reaction between HSA and AT1. Nanoparticle size was 215.2±4.7 nm and zeta potential -28.8±2.7 mV and cumulative release of MRN was ~72% over 24 hrs. The intracellular uptake of nanoparticles and cell viability was studied in H9c2 cells treated with AT1-MRN-HSA-NPs vs the control non-targeted drug, MRN Lactate under normal, hypoxic and hypertrophic conditions. The uptake of AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs in H9c2 cells was significantly higher as compared to non-targeted nanoparticles, and the viability of H9c2 cells treated with AT1-MRN-HSA-NPs vs MRN Lactate was 73.4±1.4% vs 44.9±1.4%, respectively. Therefore, AT1-HSA-MRN-NPs are safe for in vivo use and exhibit superior targeting and drug delivery characteristics for treatment of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3204011842,"Background Most universities that re-open in the United States (US) for in-person instruction have implemented the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) guidelines. The value of additional interventions to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. We calculated the cost-effectiveness and cases averted of each intervention in combination with implementing the CDC guidelines. Methods We built a decision-analytic model to examine the cost-effectiveness of interventions to re-open universities. The interventions included implementing the CDC guidelines alone and in combination with 1) a symptom-checking mobile application, 2) university-provided standardized, high filtration masks, 3) thermal cameras for temperature screening, 4) one-time entry (‘gateway’) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and 5) weekly PCR testing. We also modeled a package of interventions (‘package intervention’) that combines the CDC guidelines with using the symptom-checking mobile application, standardized masks, gateway PCR testing, and weekly PCR testing. The direct and indirect costs were calculated in 2020 US dollars. We also provided an online interface that allows the user to change model parameters. Results All interventions averted cases of COVID-19. When the prevalence of actively infectious cases reached 0.1%, providing standardized, high filtration masks saved money and improved health relative to implementing the CDC guidelines alone and in combination with using the symptom-checking mobile application, thermal cameras, and gateway testing. Compared with standardized masks, weekly PCR testing cost $9.27 million (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: cost-saving-$77.36 million)/QALY gained. Compared with weekly PCR testing, the ‘package’ intervention cost $137,877 (95% CrI: $3,108-$19.11 million)/QALY gained. At both a prevalence of 1% and 2%, the ‘package’ intervention saved money and improved health compared to all the other interventions. Conclusions All interventions were effective at averting infection from COVID-19. However, when the prevalence of actively infectious cases in the community was low, only standardized, high filtration masks clearly provided value."
https://openalex.org/W3202791815,"The purpose of this study was to critically examine how people perceive the definitions, differences and similarities of interest and curiosity, and address the subjective boundaries between interest and curiosity. We used a qualitative research approach given the research questions and the goal to develop an in-depth understanding of people’s meaning of interest and curiosity. We used data from a sample of 126 U.S. adults (48.5% male) recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ( M age = 40.7, SD age = 11.7). Semi-structured questions were used and thematic analysis was applied. The results showed two themes relating to differences between curiosity and interest; active/stable feelings and certainty/uncertainty. Curiosity was defined as an active feeling (more specifically a first, fleeting feeling) and a child-like emotion that often involves a strong urge to think actively and differently, whereas interest was described as stable and sustainable feeling, which is characterized as involved engagement and personal preferences (e.g., hobbies). In addition, participants related curiosity to uncertainty, e.g., trying new things and risk-taking behaviour. Certainty, on the other hand, was deemed as an important component in the definition of interest, which helps individuals acquire deep knowledge. Both curiosity and interest were reported to be innate and positive feelings that support motivation and knowledge-seeking during the learning process."
https://openalex.org/W3204218076,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a surge in the use of virtual communication tools for delivering clinical services for many non-urgent medical needs allowing telehealth or telemedicine, to become an almost inevitable part of the patient care. However, most of patients with vascular disease may require face-to-face interaction and are at risk of worse outcomes if not managed in timely manner. Objective We aimed to describe the utilization of telemedicine services in the outpatient vascular surgery clinics in a tertiary hospital. Methods A retrospective analysis of data on all vascular outpatient encounters during 2019 and 2020 was conducted and compared to reflect the pattern of practice prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results The study showed that 61% of the total patient encounters in 2020 were reported through teleconsultation. Females were the majority of patients who sought the virtual vascular care. Consultations for the new cases decreased from 29% to 26% whereas, the follow-up cases increased from 71% to 74% in 2020 (p = 0.001). The number of procedures performed in the vascular outpatient clinics decreased by 46% in 2020 when compared to 2019. This decrease in procedures was more evident in the duration from February 2020 to April 2020 in which the procedures decreased by 97%. The proportion of procedures represented 22.6% of the total encounters in 2019 and 10.5% of the encounters during 2020, (p = 0.001). Conclusions Teleconsultation, along with supporting practice guidelines, can be used to maximize the efficiency of care in vascular surgery patients during the pandemic and beyond. Adoption of the ‘hybrid care’ which combines both virtual and in-person services as an ongoing practice requires evidence obtained through audits and studies on patients and healthcare providers levels. It is essential to establish a clear practice that ensures patient’s needs."
https://openalex.org/W3204251992,"BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor and its loss can result in mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. BAP1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme of the UCH class that has been implicated in various cellular processes like cell growth, cell cycle progression, ferroptosis, DNA damage response and ER metabolic stress response. ASXL proteins activate BAP1 by forming the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex which acts on H2AK119ub1. Besides the ASXL proteins, BAP1 is known to interact with an established set of additional proteins. Here, we identify novel BAP1 interacting proteins in the cytoplasm by expressing GFP-tagged BAP1 in an endogenous BAP1 deficient cell line using affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis. Among these novel interacting proteins are Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) and all subunits of the heptameric coat protein complex I (COPI) that is involved in vesicle formation and protein cargo binding and sorting. We validate that the HAT1 and COPI interactions occur at endogenous levels but find that this interaction with COPI is not mediated through the C-terminal KxKxx cargo sorting signals of the COPI complex."
https://openalex.org/W3204737428,"The aim of the present study is to examine whether in Hot, i.e., affectively charged contexts, or cool, i.e., affectively neutral contexts, inhibitory control capacity increases or decreases under social evaluation in adolescents and adults. In two experiments, adolescents and young adults completed two Stroop -like tasks under either a social evaluation condition or an alone condition. The social evaluation condition comprised the presence of a peer (Experiment 1) or an expert (Experiment 2) playing the role of an evaluator, while under the alone condition, the task was performed alone. In the Cool Stroop task, participants had to refrain from reading color names to identify the ink color in which the words were printed. In the Hot Stroop task, participants had to determine the emotional expression conveyed by faces from the NimStim database while ignoring the emotion word displayed beneath. The results were similar in both experiments. In adolescents, social evaluation by a peer (Experiment 1) or by an expert (Experience 2) facilitated Hot but not cool inhibitory control. In adults, social evaluation had no effect on Hot or cool inhibitory control. The present findings expand our understanding of the favorable influence of socioemotional context on Hot inhibitory control during adolescence in healthy individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3163286018,"Parents play a primary and crucial role in emotional socialisation processes in children where individuals learn the expression, understanding and regulation of emotions. Parenting practices and dimensions of the parent-child relationship have been associated with social and emotional processes in children. As criticism involves negative emotional reactions and emotion regulation, the parent-child relationship is likely to influence an individual’s perception and response to criticism. Hence, the present study investigated the relationship of parental bonding and the perception and response to criticism in three different countries–Singapore, Italy and USA. Adult participants ( n = 444) completed the Parental Bonding Inventory (PBI) and measures of criticism. Parental care, overprotection and country were found to be significant predictors of a tendency to perceive criticism as destructive. Higher levels of parental care predicted a lower tendency to perceive criticism as destructive while higher levels of parental overprotection predicted a higher tendency to perceive criticism as destructive. US American participants were found to have a significantly higher tendency to perceive criticism as destructive compared to Italian and Singaporean participants. The findings align with past research on the role of the parent-child relationship in the socio-emotional development of children as well as providing insight into a specific aspect in social interaction; perception and response to criticism, being affected. Future studies can look to investigate this relationship further in different countries in light of cultural variation in parenting styles and emotion experience, expression and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3201763203,"Scum is formed by the adsorption of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) onto biomass surface in anaerobic digestion of oily substrates. Since scum is a recalcitrant substrate to be digested, it is disposed via landfilling or incineration, which results in biomass washout and a decrease in methane yield. The microbes contributing to scum degradation are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the cardinal microorganisms in anaerobic scum digestion. We pre-incubated a sludge with scum to enrich scum-degrading microbes. Using this sludge, a 1.3-times higher methane conversion rate (73%) and a faster LCFA degradation compared with control sludge were attained. Then, we analyzed the cardinal scum-degrading microbes in this pre-incubated sludge by changing the initial scum-loading rates. Increased 16S rRNA copy numbers for the syntrophic fatty-acid degrader Syntrophomonas and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were observed in scum high-loaded samples. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing indicated that Syntrophomonas was the most abundant genus in all the samples. The amino-acid degrader Aminobacterium and hydrolytic genera such as Defluviitoga and Sporanaerobacter became more dominant as the scum-loading rate increased. Moreover, phylogenic analysis on Syntrophomonas revealed that Syntrophomonas palmitatica , which is capable of degrading LCFAs, related species became more dominant as the scum-loading rate increased. These results indicate that a variety of microorganisms that degrade LCFAs, proteins, and sugars are involved in effective scum degradation."

Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 848 adult residents of the south Gondar zone from January 13 to February 13, 2020. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. We assessed alcohol use disorder (AUD) using the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT). A binary logistic regression model was employed to identify factors associated with AUD.

Being male (AOR = 4.34, 95 CI; 2.800, 6.743), poor social support (AOR = 1.95, 95 CI: 1.098, 3.495), social phobia (AOR = 1.69, 95 CI; 1.117, 2.582), perceived high level of stress (AOR = 2.85, 95 CI; 1.829, 34.469), current cigarette smoking (AOR = 3.06, 95 CI; 1.764, 5.307) and comorbid depression (AOR = 1.81, 95 CI; 1.184, 2.778) were significantly associated with alcohol use disorder. Conclusion The prevalence of alcohol use disorder is high among adult residents of the south Gondar zone and associated with many factors. So, it needs public health attention to decrease the magnitude of alcohol use disorder in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3202864299,"Aucuba japonica Thunb. is an evergreen understory shrub that grows naturally at a mine site. The mine soil contains high concentrations of heavy metals, and A . japonica appears to maintain detoxification mechanisms against heavy metals in the study site’s understory. This study aimed to investigate the heavy metal tolerance mechanisms in A . japonica , considering the possible roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. We conducted fieldwork in summer (canopy-foliation season) and winter (canopy-defoliation season) to measure the heavy metal concentrations in leaves, branches, and roots and analyze possible detoxicants in the roots. The infection rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi were evaluated via microscopic observation, and heavy metal (Zn) localization in A . japonica roots was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Field analysis showed that A . japonica accumulated excessive Zn and produced aucubin and citric acid in the roots in both summer and winter. Zn localization observations clarified that Zn was distributed in thickened epidermal and cortical cell walls, suggesting that the cell walls functioned as Zn deposition sites, reducing Zn toxicity. It was further clarified that Zn was contained within cortical cells, indicating that Zn might be detoxified by aucubin and citric acid. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi within cortical cells adsorbed Zn on fungal cell walls, indicating that these fungi would reduce Zn content within root cells and might alleviate Zn toxicity. Our results indicated that A . japonica would maintain Zn tolerance in both summer and winter via Zn immobilization in the cell walls and production of aucubin and citric acid, and that arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi might play important roles in the Zn tolerance of A . japonica ."
https://openalex.org/W3204573392,"Objective To construct a whole-of-system model to inform strategies that reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Australia. Methods A system dynamics model was developed with a multidisciplinary modelling consortium. The model population comprised Australians aged 40 years and over, and the scope encompassed acute and chronic CVD as well as primary and secondary prevention. Health outcomes were CVD-related deaths and hospitalisations, and economic outcomes were the net benefit from both the healthcare system and societal perspectives. The eight strategies broadly included creating social and physical environments supportive of a healthy lifestyle, increasing the use of preventive treatments, and improving systems response to acute CVD events. The effects of strategies were estimated as relative differences to the business-as-usual between 2019–2039. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis produced uncertainty intervals of interquartile ranges (IQR). Findings The greatest reduction in CVD-related deaths was seen in strategies that improve systems response to acute CVD events (8.9%, IQR: 7.7–10.2%), yet they resulted in an increase in CVD-related hospitalisations due to future recurrent admissions (1.6%, IQR: 0.1–2.3%). This flow-on effect highlighted the importance of addressing underlying CVD risks. On the other hand, strategies targeting the broad environment that supports a healthy lifestyle were effective in reducing both hospitalisations (7.1%; IQR: 5.0–9.5%) and deaths (8.1% reduction; IQR: 7.1–8.9%). They also produced an economic net benefit of AU$43.3 billion (IQR: 37.7–48.7) using a societal perspective, largely driven by productivity gains. Overall, strategic planning to reduce the burden of CVD should consider the varying effects of strategies over time and beyond the health sector."
https://openalex.org/W3202100780,"Background Pakistan has been experiencing intervals of sporadic cases and localized outbreaks in the last two decades. No proper study has been carried out in order to find out the environmental burden of toxigenic V . cholerae as well as how temporal and environmental factors associated in driving cholera across the country. Methods We tested waste water samples from designated national environment surveillance sites in Pakistan with RT-PCR assay. Multistage sampling technique were utilized for samples collection and for effective sample processing Bag-Mediated Filtration system, were employed. Results were analysed by district and month wise to understand the geographic distribution and identify the seasonal pattern of V . cholera detection in Pakistan. Results Between May 2019, and February 2020, we obtained and screened 160 samples in 12 districts across Pakistan. Out of 16 sentinel environmental surveillance sites, 15 sites showed positive results against cholera toxigenic gene with mostly lower CT value (mean, 34±2) and have significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). The highest number of positive samples were collected from Sindh in month of November, then in June it is circulating in different districts of Pakistan including four Provinces respectively. Conclusion V . cholera detection do not follow a clear seasonal pattern. However, the poor sanitation problems or temperature and rainfall may potentially influence the frequency and duration of cholera across the country. Occurrence of toxigenic V . cholerae in the environment samples showed that cholera is endemic, which is an alarming for a potential future cholera outbreaks in the country."
https://openalex.org/W3203352449,"The Eastern Europe and Central Asian (EECA) region has the highest increase in HIV incidence and mortality globally, with suboptimal HIV treatment and prevention. All EECA countries (except Russia) are low and middle-income (LMIC). While LMIC are home to 80% of all older people living with HIV (OPWH), defined as ≥50 years, extant literature observed that newly diagnosed OPWH represent the lowest proportion in EECA relative to all other global regions. We examined HIV diagnoses in OPWH in Ukraine, a country emblematic of the EECA region.We analysed incident HIV diagnoses from 2015-2018 and mortality trends from 2016-2018 for three age groups: 1) 15-24 years; 2) 25-49 years; and 3) ≥50 years. AIDS was defined as CD4<200cells/mL. Mortality was defined as deaths per 1000 patients newly diagnosed with HIV within the same calendar year. Mortality rates were calculated for 2016, 2017, and 2018, compared to age-matched general population rates, and all-cause standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.From 2015-2018, the proportion of OPWH annually diagnosed with HIV increased from 11.2% to 14.9% (p<0.01). At the time of diagnosis, OPWH were also significantly (p<0.01) more likely to have AIDS (43.8%) than those aged 25-49 years (29.5%) and 15-24 years (13.3%). Newly diagnosed OPWH had the same-year mortality ranging from 3 to 8 times higher than age-matched groups in the Ukrainian general population.These findings suggest a reassessment of HIV testing, prevention and treatment strategies in Ukraine is needed to bring OPWH into focus. OPWH are more likely to present with late-stage HIV and have higher mortality rates. Re-designing testing practices is especially crucial since OPWH are absent from targeted testing programs and are increasingly diagnosed as they present with AIDS-defining symptoms. New strategies for linkage and treatment programs should reflect the distinct needs of this target population."
https://openalex.org/W3202384467,"Background In the United States, both cannabis use disorder (CUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased in prevalence. The prevalence, demographics, and costs of CUD and OUD are not well known in heart failure (HF) admissions. This study aimed to use a national database to examine the prevalence, demographics, and costs associated with CUD and OUD in HF. Methods This study used the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2018 to identify all primary HF admissions with and without the co-diagnosis of OUD or CUD using International Classification for Diagnosis, diagnosis codes. Demographics, costs, and trends were examined. Results Between 2008 and 2018, we identified 11,692,995 admissions for HF of which 84,796 (0.8%) had a co-diagnosis of CUD only, and 67,137 (0.6%) had a co-diagnosis of OUD only. The proportion of HF admissions with CUD significantly increased from 0.3% in 2008 to 1.3% in 2018 (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of HF admissions with OUD significantly increased from 0.2% in 2008 to 1.1% in 2018 (p&lt;0.001). Patients admitted with HF and either CUD or OUD were younger, more likely to be Black, and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (p&lt;0.001, all). HF admissions with OUD or CUD had higher median costs compared to HF admissions without associated substance abuse diagnoses ($8,611 vs. $8,337 for CUD HF and $10,019 vs. $8,337 for OUD HF, p&lt;0.001 for both). Conclusions Among discharge records for HF, CUD and OUD are increasing in prevalence, significantly affect underserved populations and are associated with higher costs of stay. Future research is essential to better delineate the cause of these increased costs and create interventions, particularly in underserved populations."
https://openalex.org/W3204069805,"Background Feasibility and safety of ambulance transport between healthcare facilities with medical support exclusively via telemedicine are unknown. Methods This was a retrospective study with a single telemedicine center reference for satellite emergency departments of the same hospital. The study population was all critically ill patients admitted to one of the peripheral units from November 2016 to May 2020 and who needed to be transferred to the main building. Telemedicine-assisted transportation was performed by an emergency specialist. The inclusion criteria included patients above the age of 15 and initial stabilization performed at the emergency department. Unstable, intubated, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and acute stroke patients were excluded. There was a double-check of safety conditions by the nurse and the remote doctor before the ambulance departure. The primary endpoint was the number of telemedicine-guided interventions during transport. Results 2840 patients were enrolled. The population was predominantly male (53.2%) with a median age of 60 years. Sepsis was the most prevalent diagnosis in 28% of patients, followed by acute coronary syndromes (8.5%), arrhythmia (6.7%), venous thromboembolism (6.1%), stroke (6.1%), acute abdomen (3.6%), respiratory distress (3.3%), and heart failure (2.5%). Only 22 (0.8%) patients required telemedicine-assisted support during transport. Administration of oxygen therapy and analgesics were the most common recommendations made by telemedicine emergency physicians. There were no communication problems in the telemedicine-assisted group. Conclusions Telemedicine-assisted ambulance transportation between healthcare facilities of stabilized critically ill patients may be an option instead of an onboard physician. The frequency of clinical support requests by telemedicine is minimal, and most evaluations are of low complexity and easily and safely performed by trained nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3204588521,"Background Integrating additional factors into the TNM staging system is needed for more accurate risk classification and survival prediction for patients with cutaneous melanoma. In the present study, we introduce machine learning as a novel tool that incorporates additional prognostic factors to improve the current TNM staging system. Methods and findings Cancer-specific survival data for cutaneous melanoma with at least a 5 years follow-up were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute and split into the training set (40,781 cases) and validation set (5,390 cases). Five factors were studied: the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), distant metastasis (M), age (A), and sex (S). The Ensemble Algorithm for Clustering Cancer Data (EACCD) was applied to the training set to generate prognostic groups. Utilizing only T, N, and M, a basic prognostic system was built where patients were stratified into 10 prognostic groups with well-separated survival curves, similar to 10 AJCC stages. These 10 groups had a significantly higher accuracy in survival prediction than 10 stages (C-index = 0.7682 vs 0.7643; increase in C-index = 0.0039, 95% CI = (0.0032, 0.0047); p-value = 7.2×10 −23 ). Nevertheless, a positive association remained between the EACCD grouping and the AJCC staging (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.8316; p-value = 4.5×10 −13 ). With additional information from A and S, a more advanced prognostic system was established using the training data that stratified patients into 10 groups and further improved the prediction accuracy (C-index = 0.7865 vs 0.7643; increase in C-index = 0.0222, 95% CI = (0.0191, 0.0254); p-value = 8.8×10 −43 ). Both internal validation using the training set and temporal validation using the validation set showed good stratification and a high predictive accuracy of the prognostic systems. Conclusions The EACCD allows additional factors to be integrated into the TNM to create a prognostic system that improves patient stratification and survival prediction for cutaneous melanoma. This integration separates favorable from unfavorable clinical outcomes for patients and improves both cohort selection for clinical trials and treatment management."
https://openalex.org/W3204836105,"A myriad of emotion perception studies has shown infants’ ability to discriminate different emotional categories, yet there has been little investigation of infants’ perception of cultural differences in emotions. Hence little is known about the extent to which culture-specific emotion information is recognised in the beginning of life. Caucasian Australian infants of 10–12 months participated in a visual-paired comparison task where their preferential looking patterns to three types of infant-directed emotions (anger, happiness, surprise) from two different cultures (Australian, Japanese) were examined. Differences in racial appearances were controlled. Infants exhibited preferential looking to Japanese over Caucasian Australian mothers’ angry and surprised expressions, whereas no difference was observed in trials involving East-Asian Australian mothers. In addition, infants preferred Caucasian Australian mothers’ happy expressions. These findings suggest that 11-month-olds are sensitive to cultural differences in spontaneous infant-directed emotional expressions when they are combined with a difference in racial appearance."
https://openalex.org/W3202585917,"In genomics, optical mapping technology provides long-range contiguity information to improve genome sequence assemblies and detect structural variation. Originally a laborious manual process, Bionano Genomics platforms now offer high-throughput, automated optical mapping based on chips packed with nanochannels through which unwound DNA is guided and the fluorescent DNA backbone and specific restriction sites are recorded. Although the raw image data obtained is of high quality, the processing and assembly software accompanying the platforms is closed source and does not seem to make full use of data, labeling approximately half of the measured signals as unusable. Here we introduce two new software tools, independent of Bionano Genomics software, to extract and process molecules from raw images (OptiScan) and to perform molecule-to-molecule and molecule-to-reference alignments using a novel signal-based approach (OptiMap). We demonstrate that the molecules detected by OptiScan can yield better assemblies, and that the approach taken by OptiMap results in higher use of molecules from the raw data. These tools lay the foundation for a suite of open-source methods to process and analyze high-throughput optical mapping data. The Python implementations of the OptiTools are publicly available through http://www.bif.wur.nl/."
https://openalex.org/W3202785259,"Background Global death rate in children has been declining during the last decades worldwide, especially in high income countries. This has been attributed to several factors, including improved prenatal and perinatal care, immunisations, infection management as well as progress in diagnosis and treatment of most diseases. However, there is certainly room for further progress. The aim of the current study was to describe the changes in death rates and causes of death in Iceland, a high-income country during almost half a century. Methods The Causes of Death Register at The Directorate of Health was used to identify all children under the age of 18 years in Iceland that died during the study period from January 1 st , 1971 until December 31 st , 2018. Using Icelandic national identification numbers, individuals could be identified for further information. Hospital records, laboratory results and post-mortem diagnosis could be accessed if cause of death was unclear. Findings Results showed a distinct decrease in death rates in children during the study period that was continuous over the whole period. This was established for almost all causes of death and in all age groups. This reduction was primarily attributed to a decrease in fatal accidents and fewer deaths due to infections, perinatal or congenital disease as well as malignancies, the reduction in death rates from other causes was less distinct. Childhood suicide rates remained constant. Interpretation Our results are encouraging for further prevention of childhood deaths. In addition, our results emphasise the need to improve measures to detect and treat mental and behavioural disorders leading to childhood suicide."
https://openalex.org/W3203041191,"Purpose The results of surgery in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) are favorable, with a success rate over 70% following resection. An association of HS with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in the temporal lobe is one of the potential causes for poor surgical outcome in MTLE. We aimed to analyzed seizure outcome in a population of MTLE patients and recognize the role of occult FCD in achieving postoperative seizure control. Methods We retrospectively analyzed postoperative outcomes for 82 consecutive adult patients with the syndrome of MTLE due to HS, who had no concomitant lesions within temporal lobe in MRI and who underwent surgical treatment in the years 2005–2016, and correlated factors associated with seizure relapse. Results At the latest follow-up evaluation after surgery, 59 (72%) were free of disabling seizures (Engel Class I) and 48 (58,5%) had an Engel Class Ia. HS associated with FCD in neocortical structures were noted in 33 patients (40%). Analyzes have shown that dual pathology was the most significant negative predictive factor for Engel class I and Engel class Ia outcome. Conclusions The incidence of dual pathology in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy seems to be underestimated. An incomplete epileptogenic zone resection of occult focal temporal dysplasia within temporal lobe is supposed to be the most important negative prognostic factor for seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery in MTLE-HS patients. The study indicates the need to improve diagnostics for other temporal lobe pathologies, despite the typical clinical and radiological picture of MTLE-HS."
https://openalex.org/W3203093791,"Chicks trained to identify a target item in a sagittally-oriented series of identical items show a higher accuracy for the target on the left, rather than that on the right, at test when the series was rotated by 90°. Such bias seems to be due to a right hemispheric dominance in visuospatial tasks. Up to now, the bias was highlighted by looking at accuracy, the measure mostly used in non-human studies to detect spatial numerical association, SNA. In the present study, processing by each hemisphere was assessed by scoring three variables: accuracy, response times and direction of approach. Domestic chicks were tested under monocular vision conditions, as in the avian brain input to each eye is mostly processed by the contralateral hemisphere. Four-day-old chicks learnt to peck at the 4 th element in a sagittal series of 10 identical elements. At test, when facing a series oriented fronto-parallel, birds confined their responses to the visible hemifield, with high accuracy for the 4 th element. The first element in the series was also highly selected, suggesting an anchoring strategy to start the proto-counting at one end of the series. In the left monocular condition, chicks approached the series starting from the left, and in the right monocular condition, they started from the right. Both hemispheres appear to exploit the same strategy, scanning the series from the most lateral element in the clear hemifield. Remarkably, there was no effect in the response times: equal latency was scored for correct or incorrect and for left vs. right responses. Overall, these data indicate that the measures implying a direction of choice, accuracy and direction of approach, and not velocity, i.e., response times, can highlight SNA in this paradigm. We discuss the relevance of the selected measures to unveil SNA."
https://openalex.org/W3203474053,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) aberration is related to high-risk neuroblastomas and is an important therapeutic target. As acquired resistance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors is inevitable, novel anti-ALK drug development is necessary in order to overcome potential drug resistance against ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. In this study, to overcome ALK inhibitor resistance, we examined the growth inhibition effects of newly developed ALK -targeting pyrrole-imidazole polyamide CCC-003, which was designed to directly bind and alkylate DNA within the F1174L-mutated ALK gene. CCC-003 suppressed cell proliferation in ALK -mutated neuroblastoma cells. The expression of total and phosphorylated ALK was downregulated by CCC-003 treatment but not by treatment with a mismatch polyamide without any binding motif within the ALK gene region. CCC-003 preferentially bound to the DNA sequence with the F1174L mutation and significantly suppressed tumor progression in a human neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model. Our data suggest that the specific binding of CCC-003 to mutated DNA within the ALK gene exerts its anti-tumor activity through a mode of action that is distinct from those of other ALK inhibitors. In summary, our current study provides evidence for the potential of pyrrole-imidazole polyamide ALK inhibitor CCC-003 for the treatment of neuroblastoma thus offering a possible solution to the problem of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance."

Without the required legislation and regulations, artisanal miners are responsible for their own health and safety at work. Consequently, understanding the probabilities of self-protection at work by artisanal goldminers is crucial. A cross-sectional survey of 500 artisanal goldminers was conducted to examine the probabilities of personal protective equipment use among artisanal goldminers in Ghana. The data was subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistics. Initial findings showed that personal protective equipment use among artisanal miners was 77.4%. Overall, higher probabilities of personal protective equipment use was observed among artisanal goldminers who work in good health and safety conditions as compared to artisanal miners who work in poor health and safety conditions. Also, personal protective equipment use was more probable among the highly educated artisanal goldminers, miners who regularly go for medical screening and the most experienced miners. Additionally, personal protective equipment use was more probable among artisanal miners who work in non-production departments and miners who work in the medium scale subsector. Inversely, personal protective equipment use was less probable among female artisanal miners and miners who earn more monthly income ($174 and above). To increase self-care and safety consciousness in artisanal mining, there is the need for a national occupational health and safety legislation in Ghana. Also, interventions and health promotion campaigns for better occupational conditions in artisanal mining should target and revise the health and safety related workplace programs and conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3086535767,"In the context of epidemiology, policies for disease control are often devised through a mixture of intuition and brute-force, whereby the set of logically conceivable policies is narrowed down to a small family described by a few parameters, following which linearization or grid search is used to identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme runs the risk of leaving out more complex (and perhaps counter-intuitive) policies for disease control that could tackle the disease more efficiently. In this article, we use techniques from convex optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease policies described by hundreds of parameters. In contrast to past approaches for policy optimization based on control theory, our framework can deal with arbitrary uncertainties on the initial conditions and model parameters controlling the spread of the disease, and stochastic models. In addition, our methods allow for optimization over policies which remain constant over weekly periods, specified by either continuous or discrete (e.g.: lockdown on/off) government measures. We illustrate our approach by minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al . (March, 2020)."

In Sweden, men test for C. trachomatis to a lesser extent than women.To explore factors facilitating and constraining Swedish young men's health care utilization for C. trachomatis detection and treatment.A qualitative situational analysis study including data from 18 semi-structured interviews with men (21-30 years). Data collection took place in Stockholm County during 2018. A situational map was constructed to articulate the positions taken in the data within two continuums of variation representing men's risk perception and strategies to test for C. trachomatis.Based on the informants' risk perception, strategies adopted to test and the role of social support, three different discourses and behaviours towards C. trachomatis testing were identified ranging from a) being indifferent about C. trachomatis -not testing, b) being ambivalent towards testing, to c) being proactive and testing regularly to assure disease free status. Several factors influenced young men's health care utilization for C. trachomatis detection, where the role of health services and the social support emerged as important factors to facilitate C. trachomatis testing for young men. In addition, endorsing traditional masculinity domains such as leaning on self-reliance, beliefs on invulnerability and framing men as more carefree with their sexual health than women delayed or hindered testing.Testing must be promoted among those young men with indifferent or ambivalent discourses. Health systems aiming to increase testing among those at risk should take into consideration the positive role that young men's social support have, especially the level of social support coming from their peers. Additionally, endorsement of traditional masculinity values may delay or hinder testing."
https://openalex.org/W3203080364,"Background Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) is critical to ensuring timely diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants, and treatment in those found to be infected. However estimates of coverage vary considerably, depending on data sources used. We used 4 methods to estimate coverage among a historical cohort of HIV-exposed infants in rural South Africa, between 2010–2016. Methods We estimated the proportion of infants ever tested (methods 1–3) and tested by 7 weeks of age (1–4) as follows: (1) infants born to women identified as HIV-positive in demographic surveillance were linked to those with ≥1 EID result in routine laboratory surveillance; (2) the number of infants with ≥1 EID result in laboratory surveillance divided by the estimated number of HIV-exposed infants, calculated as total live births multiplied by antenatal HIV seroprevalence; (3) the number of infants with ≥1 EID result in routine laboratory surveillance, divided by the number of HIV-exposed infants as estimated by the district health service; (4) from documentation in infants’ Road-to-Health-booklets. Results The proportion ever tested was 43%, 88% and 138% for methods 1–3, and by 7 weeks of age was 25%, 49%, 86% and 46% for methods 1–4 respectively. Conclusions The four methods, applied to a range of routine data sources, resulted in estimates varying considerably, and the true coverage of EID remains unclear. Our findings highlight the importance of developing unique patient identifiers, improving training of healthcare providers using reporting systems, and ensuring the accuracy of healthcare records, to ensure the best possible health outcomes for HIV-exposed infants."

https://openalex.org/W3203199305,"Understanding the responses of different ontogenetic stages to environmental and human disturbance factors is essential for developing efficient conservation strategies for endangered plant species. We examined how three ontogenetic stages of a locally endangered tree species, Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata, responded to environmental factors and human disturbance in Hugumburda dry Afromontane forest in Ethiopia. We counted individual seedlings, saplings and adults of O. europaea in 70 20 × 20 m quadrats over ca. 2.8 ha, and measured biotic (woody species richness, canopy cover, aboveground tree biomass, herbaceous cover), abiotic (soil and topographic variables), and human disturbance factors (logging and tracks). To detect ontogenetic niche shifts, we compared observed vs. simulated locations of trees in the three life stages and how they related to the environmental and human disturbance factors. We found that the population structure of O. europaea showed generally low recruitment, with few seedlings per hectare compared with the abundance of saplings and adults. The probability of finding O. europaea individuals was influenced by biotic (woody species richness) and abiotic (soil depth, slope) environmental conditions and human disturbance (logging intensity), but the direction, strength and shape of the relationships differed between seedling, sapling and adult life stages, indicating ontogenetic niche shifts. All life stages showed a positive relationship with elevation. The observed environmental niches of the different lifestages of O. europaea, and their association with human disturbance levels, should be considered when conservation strategies are developed for this species. Human disturbance in terms of logging decreases the abundance of saplings, but may facilitate emerging seedlings through creation of gaps with improved light conditions. Recruitment is, however, very low in the study area, and seedlings should be protected from browsing to enhance survival. Woody species richness in general should be conserved to optimize conditions also for O. europaea saplings."

Also, this study assessed the measurement and structural invariance of the DB scale across countries. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in Malaysia and Korea. The study sample consisted of 574 Korean participants and 562 Malaysian participants. The mean age of the participants was 19.8 (SD = 1.29) for the Korean sample and 19.8 (SD = 1.22) for the Malaysian sample. Participants were invited to complete the DB scale with the 10-item and two factors (i.e., perceived benefit and perceived barriers). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and invariance test were conducted on the data by using Mplus 8.3. Results The CFA results based on the hypothesised measurement model of two factors and ten items showed sufficient construct validity after adding residual covariance between items within the same factor: CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.970, SRMR = 0.036, RMSEA = 0.036 for the Korea sample, and CFI = 0.964, TLI = 0.949, SRMR = 0.055, RMSEA = 0.066 for the Malay sample. For the Korea sample, the construct reliability was 0.62 and 0.74 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers respectively. For the Malay sample, the construct reliability was 0.75 and 0.77 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers respectively. The findings presented evidence for measurement and structural invariance of the DB scale for the Korea and Malaysia samples. Conclusion The DB scale was a valid and reliable measure for assessing exercise behaviour and for making comparisons between Korean and Malaysian samples."
