https://openalex.org/W2011214089,"The distribution of a myctophid fish and physonect siphonophores observed during dives in the Soucoupe off Baja California closely correlates with scattering layers recorded simultaneously with a 12-kcy/sec echo sounder. These organisms were observed while they were migrating vertically, and at their night and daytime levels. They are capable of rapid, extensive changes in depth."

The subsidies are associated with declining efficiency and labor productivity, as urban transit systems have overcapitalized, simplified fare structures, and extended service into sparse suburban markets. Despite these subsidies, transit has not proved successful in countering the effects on its market of increased automobile ownership and use and of decentralizaton of residences and places of employment."
https://openalex.org/W2059366212,"The radioactivity of aluminum-26 in two cores of Pacific sediments is an order of magnitude higher than was expected, as a result of its production by cosmic-ray interactions in the terrestrial environment. The higher activity can be explained only by postulating influx with extraterrestrial cosmic dust that had been exposed to significant flux of energetic particles capable of producing nuclear interactions. These particles may well be the ""solar"" cosmic rays that are sporadically accelerated by Sun during certain solar flares, since the steady galactic cosmic-ray flux is inadequate. The long-term average flux of low-energy protons in interplanetary space, required to yield the observed rate of influx of aluminum-26, is deduced on the basis of certain assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2089535349,"The mineralogy of shocked mineral and lithic grains in the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary claystone worldwide is most consistent with a bolide impact on a continent. Both the concentrations and sizes of these shocked grains are greatest in the western interior of North America. These data suggest that the Manson impact structure in north-central Iowa is a viable candidate for the K-T boundary impact event. Argon-40-argon-39 age spectrum dating of shocked microcline from the crystalline central uplift of the Manson impact structure indicates that there was severe argon-40 loss at 65.7 +/- 1.0 million years ago, an age that is indistinguishable from that of the K-T boundary, within the limits of analytical precision."
https://openalex.org/W2033014174,A theoretical model to explain the negative polarization of moonlight at small lunar phase angles is developed. The model is based on the polarization of light in the diffraction region bordering the geometric shadow of an opaque dielectric obstacle.
https://openalex.org/W2015308313,Current methods of measuring the potential of water in soil are inadequate. It is proposed to depress the reference free energy of water by a predetermined amount from the standard level of pure free water at atmospheric pressure by use of a solute. The specific free-energy difference of soil water from the depressed reference can be measured as a pressure.
https://openalex.org/W1975881735,"Drumlins are formed in a layer of boulder clay separating a glacier fronm certain types of terrain. Under certain conditions the large particles in the clay form a dilatant system. When flow in the separating layer is interrupted, part of the layer packs into an obstruction and the rest of the material flows around this obstruction, giving it a streamlined form."
https://openalex.org/W1983876618,"The second-order nonlinear differential equation for the rotation of Mercury implies locked-in motion when the period is within the range 2T/3 [1- λ cos 2πt/T ± 2/3 (21λe/2)½ where e is the eccentricity and T is the period of Mercury's orbit, the time t is measured from perihelion, and λ is a measure of the planet's distortion. For values near 2T/3, the instantaneous period oscillates about 2T/3 with period (21λ e/2)-½T."

https://openalex.org/W2017840660,"A hundred years ago physical science received one of the greatest contributions ever made by a single man. This achievement was the establishment of the undulatory theory of light by the Frenchman, Augustin Fresnel. The work of this extraordinary man put the theory of optics on an entirely new foundation and inaugurated a steady evolution of this discipline which continues up to the present time. Beyond this, it had a stimulating and inspiring influence on other branches of physics having no apparent connection with the theory of light. It would be an interesting problem to look back on a century of scientific work and to analyze what concepts have stood the test of a hundred years. However, our present intention is a different one. A retrospective glance at the time of Augustin Fresnel and the scientific atmosphere in which he lived has still another purely human interest. It gives us an opportunity to trace step by step the resistance which a new and revolutionary idea finds in its way and to see how this resistance is gradually overcome. The fate of new concepts defying tradition is always the same: In the beginning they meet with a strong opposition rejecting them sometimes with a cold disdain, sometimes with passionate irritability. Slowly and gradually the new theory obtains a reluctant acceptance. The contemporaries raised in different views finally resign themselves to it and only the following generation is in a position to admire and praise it without inhibitions."
