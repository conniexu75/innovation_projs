https://openalex.org/W3039415311,"Scar tissue size following myocardial infarction is an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes, yet little is known about factors regulating scar size. We demonstrate that collagen V, a minor constituent of heart scars, regulates the size of heart scars after ischemic injury. Depletion of collagen V led to a paradoxical increase in post-infarction scar size with worsening of heart function. A systems genetics approach across 100 in-bred strains of mice demonstrated that collagen V is a critical driver of postinjury heart function. We show that collagen V deficiency alters the mechanical properties of scar tissue, and altered reciprocal feedback between matrix and cells induces expression of mechanosensitive integrins that drive fibroblast activation and increase scar size. Cilengitide, an inhibitor of specific integrins, rescues the phenotype of increased post-injury scarring in collagen-V-deficient mice. These observations demonstrate that collagen V regulates scar size in an integrin-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3039399227,"Mobility restrictions - travel advisories, trade and travel bans, border closures and, in extreme cases, area quarantines or cordons sanitaires - are among the most widely used measures to control infectious diseases. Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), and Ebola (2014). However, they do not always work as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a higher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the high-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions between the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease."

Here, we present a multiplex human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) platform, in which 30 isogenic disease lines are pooled in a single dish and differentiated into prefrontal cortex (PFC) lineages to efficiently test early-developmental hypotheses of autism. We define subgroups of autism mutations that perturb PFC neurogenesis and are correlated to abnormal WNT/βcatenin responses. Class 1 mutations (8 of 27) inhibit while class 2 mutations (5 of 27) enhance PFC neurogenesis. Remarkably, autism patient data reveal that individuals carrying subclass-specific mutations differ clinically in their corresponding language acquisition profiles.

This challenge reflects a broader limitation in studying human disorders, as most experimental models fail to capture the genetic heterogeneity and cell type-specific vulnerability characteristic of complex disease (McClellan and King, 2010McClellan J.

Neuroimaging and neuropathology studies show frequent alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) growth and neurogenesis in autism patients (Courchesne et al., 2007Courchesne E. Pierce K. Schumann C.M.

Med. 2014; 370: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In addition, bioinformatic approaches indicate that autism-associated genes interact with transcriptional networks of the frontal cortex and cerebellum (Willsey et al., 2013Willsey A.J. Sanders S.J.

The early category of genes is associated with transcription and chromatin remodeling, while the later category of genes is associated with synapse development and function. The question of whether a given autism mutation directly perturbs PFC growth and neurogenesis can be studied using traditional animal models. For multi-gene disorders, however, the functional characterization of dozens of genes in animal- or cell-based models remains challenging and is typically restricted to resource-intensive settings such as large-scale consortia (Sweet, 2017Sweet D.J. iPSCs meet GWAS: the NextGen Consortium.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 417-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which provide access to disease-relevant human tissue through high-quality differentiation protocols (Sterneckert et al., 2014Sterneckert J.L. Reinhardt P.

In particular, the advent of facile genome editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 make it theoretically possible to study tens or hundreds of disease-associated mutations. However, the laborious nature of studying individual mutations in hPSCs, concerns about line-to-line variability, and marked cellular heterogeneity remain major stumbling blocks that need to be overcome for the routine study of complex neuropsychiatric disease in hPSCs. Here, we designed an hPSC-based multiplex platform in which multiple disease lines are pooled and differentiated into disease-relevant cell types (Figure 1A). The rationale for this approach, which was pioneered in cancer cell lines (Birsoy et al., 2014Birsoy K. Possemato R. Lorbeer F.K. Bayraktar E.C. Thiru P. Yucel B. Wang T. Chen W.W. Clish C.B.

Tamayo P. et al.High-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), is to simultaneously increase experimental throughput in both the number of genotypes and phenotypes that can be studied while reducing inter-line assay variability. Phenotypes for each line are discerned by measuring changes in the relative allele frequency over time (e.g., growth phenotype; Birsoy et al., 2014Birsoy K. Possemato R. Lorbeer F.K. Bayraktar E.C. Thiru P. Yucel B. Wang T. Chen W.W. Clish C.B. Sabatini D.M. Metabolic determinants of cancer cell sensitivity to glucose limitation and biguanides.Nature. 2014; 508: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) or across physically separated phenotypic cell fractions (e.g., cell state or drug response; Yu et al., 2016Yu C. Mannan A.M. Yvone G.M. Ross K.N. Zhang Y.L. Marton M.A. Taylor B.R. Crenshaw A. Gould J.Z. Tamayo P. et al.High-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Allele frequencies are measured using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) because of its high sensitivity and reproducibility (Hindson et al., 2013Hindson C.M. Chevillet J.R. Briggs H.A. Gallichotte E.N. Ruf I.K. Hindson B.J. Vessella R.L. Tewari M. Absolute quantification by droplet digital PCR versus analog real-time PCR.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1003-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). We reliably determined the genome frequency of a given line after dilution of >1:7,000 (Figure 1B). The multiplex platform was next validated with a physical separation-based assay in which a pool of eight hPSC lines was segregated on the basis of the level of CTNNB1 protein expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure 1C, left panel). As expected, the CTNNB1-knockout line was enriched in the CTNNB1-low fraction, while all seven other lines were enriched in the CTNNB1-high fraction (Figure 1C, right panel). A key feature of the multiplex platform is the ability to model complex, multi-gene disorders in a single experiment. Toward this end, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to construct an isogenic disease library of high-confidence autism mutations from a 46XY founder hPSC line (Figure S1A; Table S1). Frameshift mutations were introduced into the specific exons in which indels have been identified in patients (De Rubeis et al., 2014De Rubeis S. He X. Goldberg A.P. Poultney C.S. Samocha K. Cicek A.E. Kou Y. Liu L. Fromer M. Walker S. et al.DDD StudyHomozygosity Mapping Collaborative for AutismUK10K ConsortiumSynaptic, transcriptional and chromatin genes disrupted in autism.Nature. 2014; 515: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar; Iossifov et al., 2014Iossifov I.

Patterson K.E. et al.The contribution of de novo coding mutations to autism spectrum disorder.Nature. 2014; 515: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). This strategy was designed to phenocopy patient mutations, though it is possible that frameshifts at different places in the same exon can result in different phenotypes. Genes were selected on the basis of a high confidence score in the SFARI Gene Database (gene.sfari.org) and further filtered for genes with early expression during cortical development in vivo (BrainSpan [https://www.brainspan.org/]) and in vitro (Cortecon [van de Leemput et al., 2014van de Leemput J. Boles N.C. Kiehl T.R. Corneo B. Lederman P. Menon V. Lee C. Martinez R.A. Levi B.P. Thompson C.L. et al.CORTECON: a temporal transcriptome analysis of in vitro human cerebral cortex development from human embryonic stem cells.Neuron. 2014; 83: 51-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar]). The resulting library was composed of 27 autism lines and was enriched for genes related to transcription/chromatin remodeling (Parikshak et al., 2013Parikshak N.N. Luo R. Zhang A. Won H. Lowe J.K. Chandran V. Horvath S. Geschwind D.H. Integrative functional genomic analyses implicate specific molecular pathways and circuits in autism.Cell. 2013; 155: 1008-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Although all mutations selected for hPSC engineering were based on mimicking the specific mutations of patients with autistic traits, some of those patients may suffer from broader developmental defects that could also contribute to in vitro disease phenotypes. As a negative control line, we targeted the intron of a gene that is not expressed in neural tissue (UMOD). Two WNT/βcatenin-related positive controls (CTNNB1 and GSK3β) were also included. We established three independent 30-line mixtures by pooling all lines at the pluripotent stage (MIX30A, MIX30B, MIX30C) (Figure S1B). Initial pools were generated from the same isogenic clones so that we could assess the amount of variability introduced by the pooling approach. MIX30 pools retained expression of pluripotency genes (Figure S1C; OCT4+/SSEA+ 89.7% ± 1.1%), and all individual lines were well represented at the pluripotent stage (Figure S1D). Spontaneous TP53 mutations (Merkle et al., 2017Merkle F.T. Ghosh S. Kamitaki N. Mitchell J. Avior Y. Mello C. Kashin S. Mekhoubad S. Ilic D. Charlton M. et al.Human pluripotent stem cells recurrently acquire and expand dominant negative P53 mutations.Nature. 2017; 545: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) were not detected by ddPCR at levels above background in any of the 12 lines examined (Figure S1E) or by Sanger sequencing of the TP53 DNA binding domain (data not shown). With our gene targeting approach, for any one locus, we were largely able to only generate either monoallelic or biallelic frameshift indels, but not both. Thus, while autism patients harbor heterozygous mutations, our library consists of both monoallelic and biallelic mutant lines (Table S1). The efficiency of gene editing in biallelic lines was significantly higher than that in monoallelic lines (p = 0.023) (Figure S1F). This could be due to differences in guide RNA (gRNA) efficiency or to selection against biallelic mutations in monoallelic lines. The efficiency of gRNAs that induced monoallelic versus biallelic changes is not predicted to be different (Figure S1G). Furthermore, genes targeted in monoallelic lines were not more likely to be essential genes or intolerant to gene mutations (Figures S1H and S1I). Allele frequencies were roughly stable at the pluripotent stage, with less than 3-fold average change through seven passages (Figures 1D and 1E). Still, growth differences between lines at the pluripotent stage will eventually cause some lines to lose representation or unduly reduce assay sensitivity. Therefore, we implemented a cryopreservation strategy for maintaining sufficient stocks of the original pools and limited cell expansion of the pools at pluripotent stage to fewer than five passages prior to initiating differentiation. Allele frequencies remained largely unaffected by freeze-thaw cycles (Figure 1F), allowing expansion, quality control, and long-term storage of each of the three pools. Stringent quality control for pluripotent marker expression, genomic integrity, and stable allele frequencies during pluripotency growth and freeze-thaw cycles is particularly essential when confirming suitability of control clones (e.g., UMOD) as those drive overall data quantification. A second key feature of the multiplex platform is that it uses hPSCs, which can differentiate into nearly any human cell type, and thus offers great flexibility with respect to modeling genetic variants in a disease-appropriate cellular context. Because the PFC is a major locus of autism pathology (Willsey et al., 2013Willsey A.J. Sanders S.J. Li M. Dong S. Tebbenkamp A.T. Muhle R.A. Reilly S.K. Lin L. Fertuzinhos S. Miller J.A. et al.Coexpression networks implicate human midfetal deep cortical projection neurons in the pathogenesis of autism.Cell. 2013; 155: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), we devised a strategy using timed exposure to FGF8, a classic organizer of anterior cortical development in vivo (Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001Fukuchi-Shimogori T. Grove E.A. Neocortex patterning by the secreted signaling molecule FGF8.Science. 2001; 294: 1071-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), to pattern cortical progenitors to a PFC-like identity (Figure 2A). By day 18, PFC cultures were composed of near homogeneous neuroepithelial precursors of dorsal telencephalic identity (Figure 2B; Figure S2A) and expressed high levels of the frontal cortex marker SP8 but low levels of the occipital cortex (OCC) marker COUPTF1 (O’Leary et al., 2007O’Leary D.D. Chou S.J. Sahara S. Area patterning of the mammalian cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 252-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B; Figure S2B). The BrainSpan transcriptional atlas (https://www.brainspan.org) was used to define 14 gene transcripts that are differentially expressed between human fetal PFC and OCC at PCW8 (Figure S2C). qRT-PCR analysis revealed a high correlation of PFC versus OCC marker enrichment between in vivo and in vitro derived tissue (Figure 2C; R2 = 0.6191, p = 0.0008). This finding was confirmed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, which showed a strong correlation between in vivo and in vitro expression when examining the top 200 PFC and OCC enriched genes (Figures 2D–2G; Table S2). After establishing regional identity, we next sought to identify specific neurogenic cell types within PFC cultures relevant to autism (Courchesne et al., 2007Courchesne E. Pierce K. Schumann C.M.

Med. 2014; 370: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Neurons (DCX+) are born from multipotent cortical neural stem cells (SOX2+) or from proneural intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs; TBR2+) (Figure S2D). Immunocytochemistry and FACS analysis revealed the presence of all three cell types in our PFC culture system (Figures S2E and S2F). Characterization of neuronal subtype identity revealed the presence of primarily deep layer V and VI cortical projection neurons, with few callosal, upper-layer or subpallial cells (Figure S2G). To test the impact of autism mutations on PFC neurogenesis, we differentiated MIX30 pools into PFC-like tissue (Figures S3A–S3C) and used FACS to isolate bulk (All), neural stem cell (SOX2+), IPC (TBR2+), and neuronal (DCX+) fractions (Figure 3A; Figures S3D and S3E). A pilot study was performed in parallel using pools of 8 lines to determine if the multiplex approach could reliably detect neurogenic phenotypes. Indeed, the GSK3β-positive control line among the pool of 8 lines showed an expected neurogenic phenotype (Figure S3C), in agreement with studies in the mouse (Ahn et al., 2014Ahn J. Jang J. Choi J. Lee J. Oh S.H. Lee J. Yoon K. Kim S. GSK3β, but not GSK3α, inhibits the neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells as a downstream target of mammalian target of rapamycin complex1.Stem Cells Dev. 2014; 23: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Marcus et al., 1998Marcus E.A. Kintner C. Harris W. The role of GSK3beta in regulating neuronal differentiation in Xenopus laevis.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Examination of the MIX30 pools showed robust and comparable efficiencies of neural induction across all autism lines (Figure 3B). However, despite efficient cortical specification, remarkably, 13 of 27 autism lines showed abnormal PFC neurogenesis, as assessed by significant changes in either neuronal production (DCX/SOX2 ratio) or neural stem cell enrichment (SOX2/All ratio) (Figure 3C; Table S3). Eight lines (ANKRD11, ASH1L, ASXL3, CUL3, DEAF1, KDM5B, KMT2C, and RELN) showed neural stem cell enrichment and decreased neuronal output. In addition, 7 of these 8 lines also exhibited increased IPC production (Figure 3D), suggesting a block in cell-cycle exit. An additional 5 lines (CHD8, DYRK1A, GRIN2B, KMT2A, and SUV420H1) showed neural stem cell depletion and increased neuronal output (Figure 3C). Although there was no correlation between early neural growth and PFC growth across MIX30 lines (Figure 3E; p = 0.31), there was a highly significant negative correlation of hits between PFC neurogenesis and PFC growth (Figure 3F; r = −0.792, p = 0.0001). The high hit rate of mutations affecting PFC neurogenesis versus the lack of any hits affecting neural induction (Figure 3G) supports the specificity of autism mutations in perturbing PFC development. Overall, these data illustrate that autism mutations fall into distinct functional subclasses that coordinately dysregulate proliferation and neuronal differentiation and thus nominate PFC neural precursor cells as a convergently dysregulated cell type in autism. We designate mutations that inhibit PFC neurogenesis as class 1 and mutations that lead to precocious PFC neurogenesis as class 2 (Figure 3H). Interestingly, at least five of eight class 1 mutations are known to regulate polycomb signaling, a pathway previously implicated in NSC self-renewal and neurogenic competency (Corley and Kroll, 2015Corley M. Kroll K.L. The roles and regulation of polycomb complexes in neural development.Cell Tissue Res. 2015; 359: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; Testa, 2011Testa G. The time of timing: how polycomb proteins regulate neurogenesis.BioEssays. 2011; 33: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, the PFC neurogenesis phenotypes did not correlate with other biologically unrelated assays, including hPSC growth (Figure S3G), early neural growth (Figure S3H), or cortical patterning (Figure S3I), further demonstrating specificity of the observed results. Interestingly, hPSC growth did correlate with early neural, but not PFC, growth, suggesting that early neural and PFC lineages are driven by distinct developmental programs (Figures S3J and S3K). To validate these findings, we performed a second set of multiplex experiments using a new hPSC pool (MIX32) composed of 13 independently established clones, 13 matched original clones, as well as additional controls (Figure 4A). We aimed to replicate the predominant phenotype of the 13 original clones. PFC neurogenesis phenotypes from the original MIX30 pool were highly correlated to phenotypes of the independent clones in the new MIX32 validation pool (r = 0.797, p = 0.0006) (Figure 4B), confirming that the observed phenotypes are largely due to the effects of introduced CRISPR mutations. Qualitatively, 9 of 13 phenotypes replicated using a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05 for MIX30 phenotypes. However, 11 of 13 lines replicated when the FDR cutoff of MIX30 phenotypes was increased to 0.01 (Figure 4C), as would be expected from increasing statistical stringency. Further testing of the CHD8 independent clone, which did not replicate, using a single-genotype assay ultimately did show an increase in PFC neurogenesis, thus matching the original phenotype (Figure 4D). Pool-specific effects, with partial suppression of phenotypes in either the MIX30 or MIX32 pool, were observed for ADNP, CHD8, and KDM5B lines, which may be due to pool-specific, cell-non-autonomous effects or to effects related to assay sensitivity. To measure the actual off-target rate of multiplex neurogenesis phenotypes, we designed another validation assay using the MIX32 pool. Because the MIX32 pool contains pairs of independently generated mutant lines, established using either identical or independent gRNAs, we could compare mutant pairs within the same pool to remove any pool-specific effect and isolate off-target effects in clones (Figure 4E). Among the 15 pairs of lines in MIX32, the observed validation rate was 8 of 9 for pairs targeted using distinct gRNAs and 5 of 6 for pairs targeted with the same gRNA. Across all clones, the correlation rate for phenotypes was very high (p < 0.0001, r = 0.916) (Figure 4F). The two discordant clone pairs could be due to off-target effects, culture-induced genetic mutations, or simply limitations in the sensitivity of the pooling approach. Importantly, this analysis revealed an off-target effect in a third UMOD control line (UMOD-B). Unlike the original UMOD clone in MIX30, the UMOD-B clone was not subjected to rigorous quality control prior to inclusion in the study. For example, whereas the original UMOD clone consistently proliferated at a lower rate than the GSK3β line across five pools, the UMOD-B clone proliferated at the same rate as the GSK3β line (Figure 4G). This observation highlights the importance of stringent quality control in all hPSC lines but particularly for those serving as internal standards. PFC neurogenesis phenotypes were also validated using single genotype differentiations for six class 1 lines (Figures 4H and 4I; Figures S4A and S4B). Furthermore, studies of"

Development of new antiresorptive therapies calls for a holistic understanding of osteoclast differentiation and function. Although much has been learned about the molecular regulation of osteoclast biology, little is known about the metabolic requirement and bioenergetics during osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that glucose metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the predominant bioenergetic pathway to support osteoclast differentiation. Meanwhile, increased lactate production from glucose, known as aerobic glycolysis when oxygen is abundant, is also critical for osteoclastogenesis. Genetic deletion of Glut1 in osteoclast progenitors reduces aerobic glycolysis without compromising OXPHOS, but nonetheless diminishes osteoclast differentiation in vitro. Glut1 deficiency in the progenitors leads to osteopetrosis due to fewer osteoclasts specifically in the female mice. Thus, Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism through both lactate production and OXPHOS is necessary for normal osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3038914709,"Diabetes is associated with a dramatic mortality rate due to its vascular complications. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes leads to enhanced glycation of erythrocytes and oxidative stress. Even though erythrocytes play a determining role in vascular complications, very little is known about how erythrocyte structure and functionality can be affected by glycation. Our objective was to decipher the impact of glycation on erythrocyte structure, oxidative stress parameters and capacity to interact with cultured human endothelial cells. In vitro glycated erythrocytes were prepared following incubation in the presence of different concentrations of glucose. To get insight into the in vivo relevance of our results, we compared these data to those obtained using red blood cells purified from diabetics or non-diabetics. We measured erythrocyte deformability, susceptibility to hemolysis, reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage accumulation. Altered structures, redox status and oxidative modifications were increased in glycated erythrocytes. These modifications were associated with reduced antioxidant defence mediated by enzymatic activity. Enhanced erythrocyte phagocytosis by endothelial cells was observed when cultured with glycated erythrocytes, which was associated with increased levels of phosphatidylserine-likely as a result of an eryptosis phenomenon triggered by the hyperglycemic treatment. Most types of oxidative damage identified in in vitro glycated erythrocytes were also observed in red blood cells isolated from diabetics. These results bring new insights into the impact of glycation on erythrocyte structure, oxidative damage and their capacity to interact with endothelial cells, with a possible relevance to diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3039684269,"Background Early or timely initiation of antenatal care and regular visits based on the schedule have a tremendous effect on both maternal and fetal health. Despite the paramount benefits of early initiation of ANC within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, women still do not have adequate and equal access to high-quality early antenatal care. Objective To determine the prevalence and factors associated with delayed first ANC booking in Ethiopia. Method A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. All reproductive age women who gave birth in the five years preceding the survey and who had ANC visit for their last child were included in this study. The total weighted sample size analyzed was 4,741. Due to the hierarchical nature of the EDHS data, Multi-level logistic regression model was used to identify the individual and community level factors associated with delayed first ANC booking. Result In this study, the prevalence of delayed first ANC booking was 67.31% [95% CI: 65.96% to 68.63%]. Women with secondary and higher education [Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR) = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.61, 0.99] and [AOR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.44, 0.83] respectively had lower odds of delayed first ANC booking. But woman who were multiparous and grand multiparous [AOR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.01, 1.45] and [AOR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.16, 1.93] respectively, women with the last pregnancy wanted no more [AOR = 1.52; 95%CI: 1.10, 2.09], a woman who was living in the rural area [AOR = 1.66; 95%CI: 1.25, 2.21], and a woman who was living in large central regions and small peripheral regions [AOR = 2.76; 95%CI: 2.20, 3.47] and [AOR = 2.70; 95%CI: 2.12, 3.45] respectively had higher odds of delayed first ANC booking. Conclusion Despite the documented benefits of early antenatal care initiation, late ANC booking is still predominant in Ethiopia as highlighted by this study. Maternal education, parity, wanted the last child, residence and region were significantly associated with delayed first ANC booking. Therefore, taking special attention for these high-risk groups could decrease delayed first ANC booking and this intern decreases maternal and fetal health problems by identifying and intervene early."
https://openalex.org/W3038987585,"This work applies a data-driven coding method for prediction of the COVID-19 spreading profile in any given population that shows an initial phase of epidemic progression. Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before mid April, the end of March and the end of May 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city or region will be less than 0.01%, 0.5% and 0.5%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3040399453,"We developed a deep learning architecture based on Inception V3 to predict visual field using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and evaluated its performance. Two OCT images, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thicknesses, were acquired and combined. A convolutional neural network architecture was constructed to predict visual field using this combined OCT image. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted visual fields was calculated to evaluate the performance. Globally (the entire visual field area), the RMSE for all patients was 4.79 ± 2.56 dB, with 3.27 dB and 5.27 dB for the normal and glaucoma groups, respectively. The RMSE of the macular region (4.40 dB) was higher than that of the peripheral region (4.29 dB) for all subjects. In normal subjects, the RMSE of the macular region (2.45 dB) was significantly lower than that of the peripheral region (3.11 dB), whereas in glaucoma subjects, the RMSE was higher (5.62 dB versus 5.03 dB, respectively). The deep learning method effectively predicted the visual field 24–2 using the combined OCT image. This method may help clinicians determine visual fields, particularly for patients who are unable to undergo a physical visual field exam."
https://openalex.org/W3040562968,"This mixed-methods study examined awareness of and willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among sexually active Black and Latinx adolescents (13-17 years) residing in five cities in the United States with some of the highest burden of HIV. Data are from adolescents who participated in a cross-sectional survey (n = 208) and one-on-one interviews and focus groups (n = 26) conducted from September 2017-August 2019. Approximately 50% of the sample were recruited through community efforts, and the other half through a panel. Logistic regression with covariates including sexual orientation, relationship status, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity were used to assess factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness. For the qualitative data, thematic analysis was used to develop a codebook of a-priori and inductive codes while analytic memos were written to identify key themes. PrEP awareness was reported by 38% of the sample and was associated with Black race (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.27, 0.90) and prior HIV testing (AOR = 3.89, 95% CI = 1.25, 12.08). PrEP willingness (defined as ""definitely would use PrEP"") was reported by 22% of the sample and was associated with higher age, more education, having had condomless sex in the past 6 months (AOR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.56), perceived likelihood of acquiring HIV (AOR = 3.59; 95% CI = 1.06, 12.21), and PrEP awareness (AOR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.89). Qualitative data showed that misconceptions about PrEP persist and PrEP stigma, fear of being punished, provider attitudes and recommendations, and empowerment were related to adolescents' willingness to use PrEP. Study findings reveal important strategies for improving PrEP delivery and scale-up to Black and Latinx adolescents. These strategies include using sociodemographic and health behavior data to target adolescents who may be more or less willing to use PrEP, improving provider communication about PrEP, and creating culturally and developmentally appropriate PrEP education materials that address common misconceptions held by adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3040232805,"Many important areas identified for conservation priorities focus on areas of high species richness, however, it is unclear whether these areas change depending on what aspect of richness is considered (e.g. evolutionary distinctiveness, endemicity, or threatened species). Furthermore, little is known of the extent of spatial congruency between biodiversity measures in the marine realm. Here, we used the distribution maps of all known marine sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) to examine the extent of spatial congruency across the hotspots of three measures of species richness: total number of species, evolutionarily distinct species, and endemic species. We assessed the spatial congruency between hotspots considering all species, as well as on the subset of the threatened species only. We consider three definitions of hotspot (2.5%, 5%, and 10% of cells with the highest numbers of species) and three levels of spatial resolution (1°, 4°, and 8° grid cells). Overall, we found low congruency among all three measures of species richness, with the threatened species comprising a smaller subset of the overall species patterns irrespective of hotspot definition. Areas of congruency at 1° and 5% richest cells contain over half (64%) of all sharks and rays and occurred off the coasts of: (1) Northern Mexico Gulf of California, (2) USA Gulf of Mexico, (3) Ecuador, (4) Uruguay and southern Brazil, (5) South Africa, southern Mozambique, and southern Namibia, (6) Japan, Taiwan, and parts of southern China, and (7) eastern and western Australia. Coarsening resolution increases congruency two-fold for all species but remains relatively low for threatened measures, and geographic locations of congruent areas also change. Finally, for pairwise comparisons of biodiversity measures, evolutionarily distinct species richness had the highest overlap with total species richness regardless of resolution or definition of hotspot. We suggest that focusing conservation attention solely on areas of high total species richness will not necessarily contribute efforts towards species that are most at risk, nor will it protect other important dimensions of species richness."

Four maturity genes E1, E2, E3 and E4 have been molecularly identified and found to play major roles in the control of flowering and maturity of soybean. Here, to further investigate the effect of different allele combinations of E1-E4, we performed Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these four E loci, and genotyped E1-E4 genes across 308 Chinese cultivars with a wide range of maturity groups. In total, twenty-one allele combinations for E1-E4 genes were identified across these Chinese cultivars. Various combinations of mutations at four E loci gave rise to the diversity of flowering and maturity time, which were associated with the adaptation of soybean cultivars to diverse geographic regions and farming systems. In particular, the cultivars with mutations at all four E loci reached flowering and maturity very early, and adapted to high-latitude cold regions. The allele combinations e1-as/e2-ns/e3-tr/E4, E1/e2-ns/E3/E4 and E1/E2/E3/E4 played important roles in the Northeast China, Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) Rivers Valley and South China regions, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W3039033787,"The majority of anti-cancer therapies target the proliferating tumor cells, while the tumor stroma, principally unaffected, survives, and provide a niche for surviving tumor cells. Combining tumor cell and stroma-targeting therapies thus have a potential to improve patient outcome. The neuroblastoma stroma contains cancer-associated fibroblasts expressing microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). mPGES-1-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is known to promote tumor growth through increased proliferation and survival of tumor cells, immune suppression, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance, and we, therefore, hypothesize that mPGES-1 constitutes an interesting stromal target. Here, we aimed to develop a relevant in vitro model to study combination therapies. Co-culturing of neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells in 3D tumor spheroids mimic neuroblastoma tumors with regard to the cyclooxygenase/mPGES-1/PGE2 pathway. Using the spheroid model, we show that the inhibition of fibroblast-derived mPGES-1 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin and vincristine and significantly reduced tumor cell viability and spheroid growth. Cyclic treatment with vincristine in combination with an mPGES-1 inhibitor abrogated cell repopulation. Moreover, inhibition of mPGES-1 potentiated the cytotoxic effect of vincristine on established neuroblastoma allografts in mice. In conclusion, we established a 3D neuroblastoma model, highlighting the potential of combining stromal targeting of mPGES-1 with tumor cell targeting drugs like vincristine."

Twenty-week-old type 2 diabetic rats were randomly divided into the resting control, immediately, 1 hour, or 3 hours after resistance exercise, with or without the pretreatment of 5α-reductase inhibitor. Immediately or 1 hour after exercise, levels of 5α-reductase and DHT as well as phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), TBC1 domain family member 1 (TBC1D1), and protein kinase B (Akt) in muscle were significantly elevated. Phosphorylation of muscle Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) and translocation levels of GLUT4 at 1 and 3 hours after resistance exercise were significantly elevated. Additionally, resistance exercise significantly activated the phosphorylation of muscle mTOR immediately, and at 1 and 3 hours and of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) at 1 and 3 hours. However, pretreatment with the 5α-reductase inhibitor significantly attenuated the exercise-induced activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and Akt/AS160/GLUT4 signaling, but did not affect AMPK/TBC1D1/GLUT4 signaling. These findings suggest that resistance exercise-induced increase in muscle DHT synthesis may contribute to activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K- and Akt/AS160/GLUT4 signaling pathways in type 2 diabetic rats."

Brief exposure to low mT-range pulsing electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) was previously shown to accentuate in vitro myogenesis and mitochondriogenesis by activating a calcium-mitochondrial axis upstream of PGC-1α transcriptional upregulation, recapitulating a genetic response implicated in exercise-induced metabolic adaptations. We compared the effects of analogous PEMF exposure (1.5 mT, 10 min/week), with and without exercise, on systemic metabolism and gut microbiome in four groups of mice: (a) no intervention; (b) PEMF treatment; (c) exercise; (d) exercise and PEMF treatment. The combination of PEMFs and exercise for 6 weeks enhanced running performance and upregulated muscular and adipose Pgc-1α transcript levels, whereas exercise alone was incapable of elevating Pgc-1α levels. The gut microbiome Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio decreased with exercise and PEMF exposure, alone or in combination, which has been associated in published studies with an increase in lean body mass. After 2 months, brief PEMF treatment alone increased Pgc-1α and mitohormetic gene expression and after >4 months PEMF treatment alone enhanced oxidative muscle expression, fatty acid oxidation, and reduced insulin levels. Hence, short-term PEMF treatment was sufficient to instigate PGC-1α-associated transcriptional cascades governing systemic mitohormetic adaptations, whereas longer-term PEMF treatment was capable of inducing related metabolic adaptations independently of exercise."

Anxiety about radiation is still present, and radiation risk perception, particularly with regard to genetic effects, is known to affect mental health. However, roles of other risk factors such as health anxiety and of mindfulness remain to be proved. Here, we examined how radiation risk perception (genetic effects) mediates in health anxiety and psychological distress, and how mindfulness influences those variables. Seven years after the accident, we commissioned a self-reported online survey with 832 participants, 416 each from Fukushima and Tokyo, and modeled the relationship between those variables using Structural Equation Modeling. Health anxiety had a much stronger influence on psychological distress than radiation risk perception. Mindfulness was significantly correlated with both health anxiety and psychological distress, but not with radiation risk perception. The total effects on psychological distress were -0.38 by mindfulness and +0.38 by health anxiety. These results suggest the potential application of mindfulness-based interventions to alleviate health anxiety and psychological distress rather than therapy focused on radiation anxiety. The results underline the effectiveness of community support efforts in Fukushima and highlight the importance of enhancing mindfulness during the chronic phase following a disaster."

We identified such accident severity issues using the public work and police department databases that consisted of 1067 cases of various severity levels occurred on the Malaysian federal roads during 2008 to 2015. These records were used to develop ordered logistic regression model for the accident severity and nine variables were analyzed. The results revealed that the presence of poor horizontal alignment affected the model outcomes. The likelihood of the more serious accident severity due to the poor horizontal alignment was correspondingly about 0.4 times less compared to the absence of such factors. It is established that the present findings may assist the local authorities to take proactive actions to prevent serious road accidents on the road segments possessing the standard horizontal alignment."
https://openalex.org/W3040311039,"Lysyl oxidase-like-1 (LOXL1), a vital crosslinking enzyme in elastin fiber maintenance, is essential for the stability and strength of elastic vessels and tissues. Variants in the LOXL1 locus associate with a dramatic increase in risk of exfoliation syndrome (XFS), a systemic fibrillopathy, which often presents with ocular hypertension and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG). We examined the role of LOXL1 in conventional outflow function, the prime regulator of intraocular pressure (IOP). Using Loxl1-/- , Loxl1+/- , and Loxl1+/+ mice, we observed an inverse relationship between LOXL1 expression and IOP, which worsened with age. Elevated IOP in Loxl1-/- mice was associated with a larger globe, decreased ocular compliance, increased outflow facility, extracellular matrix (ECM) abnormalities, and dilated intrascleral veins, yet, no dilation of arteries or capillaries. Interestingly, in living Loxl1-/- mouse eyes, Schlemm's canal (SC) was less susceptible to collapse when challenged with acute elevations in IOP, suggesting elevated episcleral venous pressure (EVP). Thus, LOXL1 expression is required for normal IOP control, while ablation results in altered ECM repair/homeostasis and conventional outflow physiology. Dilation of SC and distal veins, but not arteries, is consistent with key structural and functional roles for elastin in low-pressure vessels subjected to cyclical mechanical stress."

Although, body weight and length at 24 months of life were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the Cohort A (11.1, 95% CI 10.6 to 11.6 Kg; 85.0 95% CI 83.8 to 86.2 cm) compared with Cohort B (10.4, 95% CI 9.9 to 10.9 Kg; 81.3 95% CI 79.7 to 82.8 cm), body weight and length Z-Score in the first 24 months of life were similar between the two Cohorts. The rate of PN associated complications was very high in both study Cohorts (up to 98% of enrolments). Multivariate analysis showed that length at 24 months was significantly associated with receiving standard PN (cohort A) in the first week of life and on the energy intake in the first week of life. We also found a marginally insignificant association between Cohort A assignment and body weight at 24 months of life (p = 0.060).Energy-enhanced PN in early life has not significant effects on long-term growth in preterm newborns.

Noncanonical Wnt5a is a particularly attractive growth factor in this context; Wnt5a inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy but maintains chondrogenesis. We designed a novel, vertically oriented-collagen scaffold. The effect of Wnt5a on MSCs and chondrocytes and the therapeutic effects of the Wnt5a/oriented-collagen scaffold in terms of osteochondral repair and cartilage integration were evaluated. In vitro, the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes treated with Wnt5a, and the mechanisms thereof, were assessed. mRNA microarray analysis was performed to compare the expression profiles of MSCs before and after Wnt5a treatment. In vivo, full-thickness cylindrical osteochondral defects (4 mm in diameter, 3 mm in depth) were created in the patellar grooves of 24 New Zealand white rabbits and implanted with oriented-collagen scaffolds (n = 8), Wnt5a/oriented-collagen scaffolds (n = 8), or nothing (n = 8). After 6 and 12 weeks, integration and tissue responses were evaluated. The proliferation, migration, chondrogenic differentiation, and extracellular matrix formation of/by MSCs and chondrocytes improved greatly after treatment with Wnt5a. Western blotting showed that the PI3K/AKT/JNK signaling pathway was activated. Microarray analysis revealed that the Wnt5a group exhibited a significant upregulation of the PI3K pathway. Reactome GSEA pathway interaction analysis revealed that such upregulation was associated with collagen and extracellular matrix formation. In vivo, the Wnt5a/oriented-collagen scaffold group exhibited optimal interface integration, cartilage regeneration, and collagenous fiber arrangement, accompanied by significantly increased glycosaminoglycan and collagen accumulations in the zones of regeneration and integration, compared to the other groups. Gene expression analysis showed that the levels of mRNAs encoding genes involved in cartilage formation were significantly increased in the Wnt5a/oriented, collagen scaffold group (all P < .05). Wnt5a promoted the proliferation, migration, and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/JNK signaling pathway. The Wnt5a/oriented-collagen constructs enhanced the structure-specific regeneration of hyaline cartilage in a rabbit model and may be a promising treatment for the repair of human cartilage defects."

This retrospective study aimed to report the mutational status prevalence of these genes, explore their possible associations with clinicopathological features, and build and validate a predictive model. To achieve these objectives, 500 mCRC Mexican patients were screened for clinically relevant mutations in RAS/BRAF genes. Fifty-two percent of these specimens harbored clinically relevant mutations in at least one screened gene. Among these, 86% had a mutation in KRAS, 7% in NRAS, 6% in BRAF, and 2% in both NRAS and BRAF. Only tumor location in the proximal colon exhibited a significant correlation with KRAS and BRAF mutational status (p-value = 0.0414 and 0.0065, respectively). Further t-SNE analyses were made to 191 specimens to reveal patterns among patients with clinical parameters and KRAS mutational status. Then, directed by the results from classical statistical tests and t-SNE analysis, neural network models utilized entity embeddings to learn patterns and build predictive models using a minimal number of trainable parameters. This study could be the first step in the prediction for RAS/BRAF mutational status from tumoral features and could lead the way to a more detailed and more diverse dataset that could benefit from machine learning methods."

While immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D on monocytes have been reported in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, there is limited understanding on monocyte phenotype in healthy individuals with suboptimal vitamin D levels and without any clinical diseases. In this work, we performed label-free, microfluidic isolation of monocytes, and characterized their functional phenotype using flow cytometry and in vitro vascular models in healthy subjects with (n = 7) and without vitamin D deficiency (n = 16). Vitamin D deficient (VitD-Def) subjects (25(OH)D3 level < 26 ng/mL) expressed significant downregulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) on monocytes as compared to controls (P < .0001), and VDR expression was well-associated with serum 25(OH)D3 levels. Increased monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA), a marker for platelet activation, were also observed in VitD-Def subjects (P < .05) which suggests a pro-inflammatory monocyte phenotype. Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, an early-stage atherosclerosis event, was also higher in VitD-Def individuals, and inversely correlated to serum 25(OH)D3 level (P < .05). Taken together, these results indicate the pro-inflammatory state and atherogenic potential of monocytes in VitD-Def healthy subjects, and propound the use of vitamin D supplementation as a prospective immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory therapy in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3039508922,"The importance of randomization in clinical trials has long been acknowledged for avoiding selection bias. Yet, bias concerns re-emerge with selective attrition. This study takes a causal inference perspective in addressing distinct scenarios of missing outcome data (MCAR, MAR and MNAR).This study adopts a causal inference perspective in providing an overview of empirical strategies to estimate the average treatment effect, improve precision of the estimator, and to test whether the underlying identifying assumptions hold. We propose to use Random Forest Lee Bounds (RFLB) to address selective attrition and to obtain more precise average treatment effect intervals.When assuming MCAR or MAR, the often untenable identifying assumptions with respect to causal inference can hardly be verified empirically. Instead, missing outcome data in clinical trials should be considered as potentially non-random unobserved events (i.e. MNAR). Using simulated attrition data, we show how average treatment effect intervals can be tightened considerably using RFLB, by exploiting both continuous and discrete attrition predictor variables.Bounding approaches should be used to acknowledge selective attrition in randomized clinical trials in acknowledging the resulting uncertainty with respect to causal inference. As such, Random Forest Lee Bounds estimates are more informative than point estimates obtained assuming MCAR or MAR."
https://openalex.org/W3040241190,"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been recently shown to be a major obstacle to antiviral immunity by binding to its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1) on specific IFN-γ producing T cells in chronic hepatitis B. Currently, IFN-α is widely used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but its antiviral effect vary greatly and the mechanism is not totally clear. We found that IFN-α/γ induced a marked increase of PD-L1 expression in hepatocytes. Signal and activators of transcription (Stat1) was then identified as a major transcription factor involved in IFN-α/γ-mediated PD-L1 elevation both in vitro and in mice. Blockage of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction by a specific mAb greatly enhanced HBV-specific T cell activity by the gp96 adjuvanted therapeutic vaccine, and promoted HBV clearance in HBV transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate the IFN-α/γ-Stat1-PD-L1 axis plays an important role in mediating T cell hyporesponsiveness and inactivating liver-infiltrating T cells in the hepatic microenvironment. These data raise further potential interest in enhancing the anti-HBV efficacy of IFN-α and therapeutic vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3039000319,"The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.) is one of the major challenges in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) production. Fluopyram, known to be an effective fungicide, is also used for controlling root-knot nematode. However, in China, little information is currently available regarding the efficacy of fluopyram via chemigation against root-knot nematode and its effects on soil properties. For this, the objective of this work was to test mortality of root-knot nematode, functional diversity of soil microbial community, activity of soil enzyme after fluopyram applicated by chemigation. The results of two field experiments revealed that concentration of 60 g·ha-1 fluopyram applied with 200 L·ha-1 irrigation water at 2 L·h-1 flow velocity was the most effective chemigation parameters for controlling eggplant against root-knot nematode. The functional diversity of the soil microbial community was significantly affected by fluopyram. The activities of soil urease and β-glucosidase decreased during the initial stages but recovered at later stages. In brief, fluopyram has advantageous for the efficient control of root-knot nematode with no deleterious effects on soil properties as well as chemigation is positive for application in karst landscape in Guangxi."
https://openalex.org/W3039116891,"The aim of this study is to explore participants' views and experiences of an eHealth phase 3 cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention: Physical Activity Towards Health (PATHway). Sixty participants took part in the PATHway intervention. Debriefs were conducted after the six-month intervention. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed with Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis. Forty-four (71%) debriefs were conducted (n = 34 male, mean (SD) age 61 (10) years). Five key themes were identified: (1) Feedback on the components of the PATHway system, (2) Motivation, (3) Barriers to using PATHway, (4) Enablers to using PATHway, and (5) Post programme reflection. There were a number of subthemes within each theme, for example motivation explores participants motivation to take part in PATHway and participants motivation to sustain engagement with PATHway throughout the intervention period. Participant engagement with the components of the PATHway system was variable. Future research should focus on optimising participant familiarisation with eHealth systems and employ an iterative approach to development and evaluation."

In this study, we systematically optimize versatile measurement parameters (setpoint, z-speed, z-length, pause time, and relative underpressure) to improve the quality of force-distance curves recorded with a FluidFM. Using single bacterial cells (here the gram negative seawater bacterium Paracoccus seriniphilus and the gram positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis), we show that Single Cell Force Spectroscopy experiments with the FluidFM lead to comparable results to a conventional Single Cell Force Spectroscopy approach using polydopamine for chemical fixation of a bacterial cell on a tipless cantilever. Even for the bacterium Lactococcus lactis, which is difficult to immobilze chemically (like seen in an earlier study), immobilization and the measurement of force-distance curves are possible by using the FluidFM technology."
https://openalex.org/W3039919515,"Introduction The impact of living with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) on psychological wellbeing is not well-known. A recent scoping review by the authors found that both depression and anxiety frequently featured in the accounts of those living with the illness. However, less clear were the factors that led to such psychological distress, the impact that the illness had on families and how to best support those living or supporting someone living with the illness. In light of this, the aim of this study was to explore how the illness impacted the lives of both those diagnosed with the illness and those supporting them. Method and results This study adopted a phenomenological approach to understand the subjective experiences of individual participants. A total of 30 individuals took part in Asynchronous Virtual Focus Groups hosted on a Virtual Learning Environment for a four-week period. Chronological narratives of individuals’ lived experiences from diagnosis to post-transplant are presented below. These narratives centred upon individuals’ and families’ experiences of receiving a diagnosis, and adjusting to life post-diagnosis, particularly in regard to their relationships with health professionals and other family members, and in preparing for the possibility of transplant. Discussion The present article provides an in-depth look at how PSC can impact psychological wellbeing, how psychological distress arises and includes advice tailored to individuals, families and health professionals on how to best support each other."
https://openalex.org/W3040178681,"[FeFe] hydrogenases have attracted extensive attention in the field of renewable energy research because of their remarkable efficiency for H2 gas production. H2 formation is catalyzed by a biologically unique hexanuclear iron cofactor denoted the H-cluster. The assembly of this cofactor requires a dedicated maturation machinery including HydF, a multidomain [4Fe4S] cluster protein with GTPase activity. HydF is responsible for harboring and delivering a precatalyst to the apo-hydrogenase, but the details of this process are not well understood. Here, we utilize gas-phase electrophoretic macromolecule analysis to show that a HydF dimer forms a transient interaction complex with the hydrogenase and that the formation of this complex depends on the cofactor content on HydF. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV-visible spectroscopy studies of mutants of HydF show that the isolated iron-sulfur cluster domain retains the capacity for binding the precatalyst in a reversible fashion and is capable of activating apo-hydrogenase in in vitro assays. These results demonstrate the central role of the iron-sulfur cluster domain of HydF in the final stages of H-cluster assembly, i.e. in binding and delivering the precatalyst.

In the case of [FeFe] hydrogenases (HydA), the reaction is catalyzed by a hexanuclear iron complex, the H-cluster. This cofactor is composed of a canonical four-cysteine coordinated FeS cluster ([4Fe4S]H) coupled to a low-valence (Fe2I,I/II,II) diiron site, the [2Fe] subsite. The latter complex is coordinated by carbonyl and cyanide ligands, as well as a bridging dithiolate ligand (adt = −SCH2NHCH2S−). The biosynthesis of the H-cluster is a complex, multistep process, during which the [4Fe-4S]H-cluster is first assembled by the standard house-keeping FeS cluster machinery (3Mulder D.W. Boyd E.S.

Point mutations in the walker-loop of the GTPase domain, as well of the FeS binding cysteine residues, have been shown to impair HydF function and prevent assembly of a functional [FeFe] hydrogenase under in vivo conditions (6King P.W.

The GTP hydrolysis plays a key role in the dissociation of HydF from HydE and HydG, but it does not seem to influence the interaction with HydA (17Shepard E.M. McGlynn S.E. Bueling A.L.

The dimerization domain exhibits a hydrophobic surface that leads to a strong hydrophobic interaction between two copies of the HydF polypeptide, both for the apo-form as well as for the FeS cluster-containing form ([4Fe-4S]-HydF) (18Caserta G.

The third domain contains three conserved cysteines and a glutamate residue responsible for the coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster on HydF. The function of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is still not fully elucidated, but spectroscopic studies of HydF from Thermotoga maritima suggest that it is involved in binding of the precatalyst to HydF. This is further supported by recent single-point-mutation studies of HydF from Thermosipho melanesiensis (14Berggren G. Adamska A. Lambertz C. Simmons T.R. Esselborn J. Atta M. Gambarelli S.

Still, crystallographic support for this model is lacking, and the importance of the different domains for binding the [2Fe] precatalyst and for the HydF–HydA interaction remains unknown. The dependence on efficient coexpression of HydG and HydE for generation of the active form of HydF, i.e. a form carrying the precatalyst, has complicated studies of this protein. However, it was recently shown how this can be circumvented: HydF expressed in the absence of HydE and HydG can be loaded with synthetic analogues of the [2Fe] precatalyst to generate semisynthetic forms of the protein indistinguishable from HydF expressed in the presence of HydE and HydG (14Berggren G.

Whereas these biophysical and crystallographic studies on both “native” and semisynthetic forms have provided an increasingly detailed view of the HydF protein, the mechanism by which it interacts with, and activates, the hydrogenase enzyme is still, to a large extent, unknown. Here, we report on the quaternary structure of the HydF protein and the HydF–HydA interaction complex as a function of metal content in the two proteins, elucidated using primarily gas-phase electrophoretic macromolecule analysis (GEMMA), a technique highly suitable for probing weak protein interaction complexes (24Jonna V.R.

Moreover, the influence of the different domains of HydF is further probed through the preparation of truncated forms of HydF, lacking either the dimerization domain (HydFΔD) or both the dimerization as well the GTPase domain (HydFΔDG) (see the supporting information for amino acid sequences). Both truncated constructs retained the capacity to bind the [2Fe]adt precatalyst, verifying the role of the FeS cluster domain for harboring the diiron complex prior to transfer to apo-HydA. Moreover, neither the GTPase nor the dimerization domain was found to be critical for releasing the precatalyst once bound to HydF, as both HydFΔD and HydFΔDG could activate apo-hydrogenase under in vitro conditions. To monitor the effect of cofactor loading on the quaternary structure of HydF and HydA, as well as their interaction behavior, a series of samples of the two proteins was prepared with varying metal cofactor content. As the maturation proteins are well conserved, we utilized HydF from T. maritima and the HydA1 [FeFe] hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our model proteins (6King P.W. Posewitz M.C.

More specifically, both HydF and HydA1 were expressed and purified under aerobic conditions, and metal-free apo-proteins (apo-HydF and apo-HydA1) were prepared via chelation of residual metal ions under reducing anaerobic conditions.

The size-exclusion chromatography was performed on the apo-proteins on a Superdex-200 column, directly following the demetallization procedure. Samples of apo-HydF featured a peak at 63 ml (P1) together with a larger peak at 70 ml (P2) (Fig. 2A, top). In the case of apo-HydA1, a similar, albeit slightly shifted, chromatogram was observed, displaying a dominant peak (P2) at 75 ml, preceded by a smaller peak at 65 ml (P1) (Fig. 2A, bottom). The corresponding elution fractions were collected and concentrated separately. After buffer exchange, the proteins were measured with wide-scan GEMMA (1 kDa to 10 MDa). The GEMMA spectrum of the P2 fraction of apo-HydA1 exhibits a peak close to 50 kDa (Fig. 2B, spectrum HydA P2), together with an additional minor peak at 100 kDa. The 50-kDa peak corresponds well to a monomeric form of HydA1 (theoretical mass, 49 kDa), in agreement with earlier studies showing that the enzyme is monomeric in solution. In the case of apo-HydF, the P1 fraction exhibits a large peak at ∼200 kDa, together with two other minor peaks at 100 and 300 kDa (Fig. 2B, spectrum HydF P1). The molecular weight of the HydF protein is ≈45 kDa; thus, we assign the peaks to tetrameric, dimeric, and hexameric forms of the HydF protein. We conclude that the first peak (P1) of the size-exclusion chromatogram represents the tetrameric form of apo-HydF. The GEMMA spectrum of the P2 fraction of apo-HydF is more complex. The strongest peak in the spectrum appears around 100 kDa, in agreement with the successful isolation of dimeric apo-HydF (Fig. 2B, spectrum HydF P2). However, significant peaks are also observable at 200 and 300 kDa, suggesting that the dimer form of apo-HydF is unstable on the time scale of the experiment. This conclusion is further supported by time-dependent GEMMA studies. The higher-molecular-weight peaks increased in intensity in the P2 protein samples on a minute time scale, even for apo-HydF samples kept on ice under strict anaerobic conditions (data not shown). The crystal structures of both apo-HydF and [4Fe-4S]-HydF clearly support the dimeric nature of the protein. In addition, both reported structures reveal the formation of a tetrameric, or dimer-of-dimers, structure. In the apo-protein, the dimer-of-dimers is formed via disulfide bridges involving the cysteines in the FeS cluster domain (22Cendron L. Berto P. D'Adamo S. Vallese F. Govoni C. Posewitz M.C. Giacometti G.M. Costantini P. Zanotti G. Crystal structure of HydF scaffold protein provides insights into [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation.J. Biol.

These residues are involved in metal ligation in [4Fe-4S]-HydF, preventing their formation of disulfide bridges. In the latter case, the formation of the dimer-of-dimers is instead potentially a result of crystal packing (18Caserta G. Pecqueur L. Adamska-Venkatesh A. Papini C. Roy S. Artero V. Atta M. Reijerse E. Lubitz W. Fontecave M. Structural and functional characterization of the hydrogenase-maturation HydF protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28553946): 779-78410.1038/nchembio.2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To clarify the influence of the metal cofactors on the quaternary structure of HydF, holo-HydF was assembled in a stepwise fashion, and apo-HydF, [4Fe-4S]-HydF, and holo-HydF each were analyzed by GEMMA. Likewise, apo-HydA1, [4Fe-4S]-HydA1, and holo-HydA1 were prepared and analyzed in parallel assays. As seen in Fig. 3A, HydA1 remained predominantly monomeric regardless of cofactor loading. In the case of HydF, the dimeric form of the protein dominated the mass spectrum, with a substantial fraction of tetrameric forms also discernable in all cases. However, a significant reduction in the higher-molecular-mass species (hexamers and larger) was observed for the metal-loaded forms. These results show that there is no drastic change in the appearance of dimeric and tetrameric forms of HydF as a function of cofactor content. Apart from the FeS cluster binding cysteines, there is one additional cysteine residue present in the protein. However, the latter cysteine is relatively buried in the GTPase domain and unlikely to be involved in interprotein disulfide formation (see Fig. S2 and S3 for predicted Thermotoga maritima HydF [TmHydF] structures). Thus, the observation that a fraction of metal loaded HydF also exists in tetrameric form shows that disulfide formation is not the sole contributor to the formation of the dimer-of-dimer HydF complex. Instead, the tetrameric form of HydF is likely to be attributable to interactions between the dimerization and FeS cluster binding domains of two HydF dimers, as suggested from the XRD data of [4Fe4S]-HydF (18Caserta G. Pecqueur L. Adamska-Venkatesh A. Papini C. Roy S. Artero V. Atta M. Reijerse E. Lubitz W. Fontecave M. Structural and functional characterization of the hydrogenase-maturation HydF protein.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28553946): 779-78410.1038/nchembio.2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This complex could, in turn, promote the formation of interdimer disulfide bridges, providing a strong covalent linkage (22Cendron L. Berto P. D'Adamo S. Vallese F. Govoni C. Posewitz M.C. Giacometti G.M. Costantini P. Zanotti G. Crystal structure of HydF scaffold protein provides insights into [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation.J. Biol.

Still, the formation of multimeric forms can be reduced by introducing the [4Fe4S] and [2Fe]adt cofactors, supporting the notion that they, to a large extent, arise from disulfide formation via the cluster binding cysteine residues. The final stages of H-cluster assembly are initiated with the transfer of the precatalyst from HydF to HydA1. To probe the structure and stability of the expected interaction complex between the two proteins, mixtures of HydF and HydA1 were prepared and analyzed by GEMMA. More specifically, apo-HydA1, [4Fe-4S]-HydA1, or holo-HydA1 was mixed with apo-HydF, [4Fe-4S]-HydF, or holo-HydF, and the masses of the resulting interaction complexes were recorded. A distinct peak was observed at ≈150 kDa when HydA1 was mixed with either [4Fe-4S]-HydF or holo-HydF (Fig. 4, middle and top spectra, and Fig. S4). This peak most likely is attributable to an interaction complex consisting of a HydF dimer and a monomeric HydA1 protein (HydF2HydA1). In addition, peaks attributable to monomeric HydA1, as well as dimeric and tetrameric HydF, were clearly visible in all spectra. Similar trends were observed when either apo-HydA1 (Fig. 4A) or [4Fe-4S]-HydA1 (Fig. 4B) were present. Interestingly, the interaction peak at 150 kDa changed in response to the cofactor content of HydF. In the presence of metal-loaded HydF, i.e. either [4Fe4S]-HydF or Holo-HydF, the peak at 150 kDa was clearly observable, whereas the larger oligomeric forms of HydF could not be discerned (Fig. 4, top and middle spectra). Mixtures of apo-HydF and HydA1, on the other hand, resulted in complicated spectra (Fig. 4, bottom, and Fig. S4), and only traces of a feature attributable to a HydF2–HydA1 interaction could be discerned. Instead, the latter spectra mainly displayed peaks arising from monomeric HydA1 and dimeric HydF. Moreover, additional peaks attributable to the tetrameric form of HydF, as well as larger HydF protein complexes, were clearly visible in the spectra, in agreement with studies of the apo-HydF protein in isolation (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W3039672140,"The objective of this analysis was to evaluate and report on the economic impact of implementing an integrated, quality, and operational improvement program on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care from acute through post-acute care settings. This initiative was established in a cohort of 12 hospitals in Alabama and sought to address COPD readmission through improved workflows pertaining to early diagnosis, efficient care transitions, and patient visibility across the entire care episode. Implementation of the initiative was influenced by lean principles, particularly cross-functional agreement of workflows to improve COPD care delivery and outcomes. A budget impact model was developed to calculate cost savings directly from objective data collected during this initiative. The model estimated payer annual savings over 5 years. Patients were classified for analysis based on whether or not they received noninvasive ventilation. Scenario analyses calculated savings for payers covering different COPD cohort sizes. The base case revealed annual per patient savings of $11,263 for patients treated through the quality improvement program versus traditional care. The model projected cumulative savings of $52 million over a 5-year period. Clinical incorporation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) resulted in $20,535 annual savings per patient and projected $91 million over 5 years. We conclude that an integrated management program for COPD patients across the care continuum is associated with substantial cost savings and significantly reduced hospital readmissions."
https://openalex.org/W3040260704,"Lepidodactylus lugubris is a parthenogenetic gecko which has been increasingly expanding its range during the last century. This invasive species has been reported from multiple tropical and subtropical countries in five continents, most of which were colonized in recent times. In order to understand how the realized niche of the species was affected by this dramatic geographic range expansion, we reconstructed the history of the geographic range expansion. We built models of the realized niche of the species at different points in time during the invasion process. This was achieved through the implementation of modern hypervolume construction methods, based on the Hutchinson’s niche concept. The models were then compared to detect possible realized climatic niche expansion over time. Furthermore, we investigated possible pathways used by the species to spread. A progressive expansion of the realized niche was identified. As the species spread into new areas, we observed a tendency to colonize regions with warmer temperatures and higher precipitation rates. Finally, we found evidence for cargo shipping being the major pathway through which the species expands its range. Further studies on this topic should aim to investigate the role of biological interactions, and how they shape the distribution of L. lugubris on a global scale. A deeper understanding of this kind of processes will help us tackle the issue of invasive species, which has become a major challenge in conservation biology."

Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have shown as regulation factors of numerous biological processes. In this study, we identified that Lnc00462717 was upregulated in glioma endothelial cells (GECs), and that knockdown of Lnc00462717 significantly increased the BTB permeability. Both bioinformatics and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) results revealed that Lnc00462717 interacts with polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTBP1). Moreover, overexpression of PTBP1 significantly reversed the increase in BTB permeability caused by siLnc00462717. Furthermore, the binding sites between miR-186 and PTBP1 as well as between miR-186 and 3'UTR of Occludin mRNA were confirmed by RIP and luciferase assays, respectively. And the interaction of Lnc00462717 and PTBP1 significantly facilitated the binding of PTBP1 to 3'UTR of Occludin mRNA and then blocked the miR-186-5p-induced downregulation of Occludin. In addition, we identified that knockdown of Lnc00462717 or overexpression of miR-186-5p increased the accumulation of doxorubicin (Dox) in brain glioma via the ultrafast liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system (UFLC–MS/MS system) and decreased the intracranial glioma volume in BALB/c nude mice. Taken together, these results show a novel molecular pathway in BTB that may provide a potential innovative strategy for glioma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3038731828,"Hydrologic models such as the USEPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) are commonly used to assess the design and performance of green infrastructure (GI). To accurately represent GI performance models used in design need to be able to address both the hydrology/hydraulics of the catchment and the GI unsaturated (vadose) zone hydrology. While hydrologic models, such as SWMM, address the need for catchment hydrology/hydraulics, they often simplify the unsaturated zone hydrology. This paper presents a methodology utilizing existing components of SWMM to represent unsaturated zone hydrology in an accessible format that does not require adjustments to the SWMM source code. The methodology simulated the unsaturated soil water movement by considering flow caused by differences of soil matric head and flow caused by gravity between soil layers with finite depth/length. The flow flux related to the soil matric head is a function of soil water diffusivity (D) and the soil moisture gradient, where D can be represented by a pump curve in SWMM. The flow flux related to gravity was controlled by unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) only and was also simulated by a pump. The methodology was compared to another variably saturated model, HYDRUS, with theoretical soils (with single layers of sand, loam, silt, and clay, as well as dual-layer scenarios). Field data was used to compare the methodology to HYDRUS and the SWMM LID (Low Impact Development) module. In all comparisons the presented methodology and HYDRUS delivered similar results for the vadose zone response to a storm event, while the LID module of SWMM exhibited slower water movement. The results showed that under natural conditions, the approximation of the presented methodology yielded satisfactory results to simulate flow through the unsaturated vadose zone."
https://openalex.org/W3039284291,"In the absence of a ⩒o2-work-rate plateau, debate continues regarding the best way to verify that the peak ⩒o2 achieved during incremental exercise (⩒o2peak) is the “true ⩒o2max.” Oft-used “secondary criteria” have been questioned in conjunction with the contention that a severe-intensity constant-work-rate “verification bout” should be considered the “gold standard.” The purpose of this study was to compare the ⩒o2peak during ramp incremental cycling (RAMP-INC) by a heterogeneous (with respect to body composition and sex) cohort of sedentary individuals with the ⩒o2peak during severe-intensity constant-work-rate cycling (CWR) performed after RAMP-INC at the highest work rate achieved. A secondary purpose was to determine the degree to which traditional and newly-proposed age-dependent secondary criteria (RER, HR) identified RAMP-INC which CWR confirmed were characterized by a submaximal ⩒o2peak. Thirty-five healthy male (n = 19: 33.4 ± 6.3 yrs) and female (26.8 ± 3.6 yrs) sedentary participants performed RAMP-INC followed by CWR. The ⩒o2peak values from the two tests were correlated (r = 0.96; p < 0.01; mean CV = 24%); however, ⩒o2peak for CWR was significantly greater (29.6 ± 7.2 v. 28.6 ± 6.8 mL∙min-1∙kg-1; p < 0.01) with a mean bias of 0.98 mL∙min-1∙kg-1 (z = -2.9, p < 0.01). Both traditional and newly-proposed criterion values for RER were achieved during RAMP-INC by 33 of 35 participants (including 21 of 23 who registered a higher ⩒o2peak on CWR). The traditional HR criterion value was achieved on only seven tests (three of which were confirmed to be characterized by a submaximal ⩒o2peak) while use of less stringent newly-proposed criteria resulted in acceptance of an additional seven tests of which five were confirmed to be submaximal. Severe-intensity CWR to limit of tolerance indicates that RAMP-INC underestimates ⩒o2max in sedentary individuals and both traditional and newly-proposed secondary criteria are ineffective for identifying such tests."
https://openalex.org/W3039445134,"In this study, an image-analysis-based method is proposed to estimate the length and width of plant leaves, some of which have concave tips and petiole insertions. Here, kiwifruit leaves are used. Using the proposed method, orthophotographs of the leaves were obtained through image segmentation and image correction. The coordinates of the pixels along the edge of the kiwifruit leaf were then extracted. Finally, the leaf length was determined based on the sum of the number of pixels between the leaf tip and petiole insertion, and the leaf width was calculated based on the sum of the number of pixels for the widest region of the leaf. The experimental results were evaluated by analyzing the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and accuracy. The maximum MAE and RMSE for the three examined cultivars are 0.281 and 0.366 cm, respectively. The analysis also showed that the proposed method outperforms other prevalent approaches, achieving high accuracy rates of 98.88% and 98.83% for the length and width of kiwifruit leaves, respectively. The low MAE and RMSE and high accuracy prove the capability of the proposed method with regard to calculating the length and width of such leaves. In addition, the proposed method can be extended to other plants whose leaf shape is comparable to that of a kiwifruit leaf."

""Hands-on"" training on CrAg testing and lumbar puncture was included. A 14-point pre and post-test assessment instrument was designed to capture the impact of the training and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted.A total of 761 HCPs were trained. 519 HCPs completed the pre-test evaluation while 470 (90.6%) took part in the post-test evaluation. Post-training, HCPs were significantly more likely to respond correctly to all 14 assessment items, with the mean percentage score rising to 91.0% from a pre-training value of 60.0%. FGDs revealed that many of the HCPs were not aware of the CrAg screening and pre-emptive treatment recommendations in Nigerian guidelines, and reported not having seen or managed a case of CM. Also, they highlighted challenges with routine CrAg screening due to a lack of access to CD4 testing, CrAg test kits, antifungal drugs, as well as the need for similar trainings across all tiers of care in Nigeria.Training significantly improved HCPs' understanding of Nigerian policy on CrAg screening, CM diagnosis and best management practices.

https://openalex.org/W3039010191,"GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) mediate fast synaptic inhibition and are trafficked to functionally diverse synapses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABAARs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABAARs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABAAR binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABAAR clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABAAR accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition. The MS data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange, with the data set identifier PXD019597."
https://openalex.org/W3040549334,"Schistosomiasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by the trematode blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. The prodigious egg output of females is the main cause of the disease in definitive hosts, while the female worm relies on continuous pairing with the male worm to fuel the growth and maturation of the reproductive organs and egg production. Prohibitin, which contains the functionally interdependent PHB1 and PHB2 subunits in human and some other species, has been proposed to participate in the cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation in mammals. However, little is known about the function of PHB homolog in the growth and reproductive development of schistosomes. Here, we reported the Phb1 gene that was structurally and evolutionarily conserved in Schistosoma japonicum when compared with that of other species from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. Real-time PCR detected that SjPhb1 was highly transcribed in the vitellaria of female worms. SjPhb1 knockdown achieved through the dsRNA-mediated RNAi in vivo resulted in retarded growth, decreased pairing, and fecundity in adult worms, as well as attenuated pathogenicity or virulence of worms to their hosts. Cell proliferation and apoptosis examination found decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in SjPhb1 dsRNA-treated worms. Therefore, our study provides the first characterization of S. japonicum PHB1 and reveals its fundamental role in the regulation of growth and development of S. japonicum by specific dsRNA-mediated RNAi in vivo. Our findings prompt for a promising molecular of schistosomes that can be targeted to effectively retard the growth and development of the schistosomes."

All participants were examined for retinal structure using OCTA to assess VD and Spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) to assess ganglion cell complex (GCC) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness. Retinal sensitivity was tested with MP and standard automatic perimetry (SAP).The VD in moderate/severe POAG was lower than that in mild POAG and healthy control in the macular superficial vascular plexus (SVP) (38.7±6.3% vs. 42.9±5.2%, 49.7±2.6% respectively, P<0.001) and peripapillary radial peripapillary capillaries (pRPC) (36.4±5.7% vs. 43.6±6.6%, 49.1±2.4% respectively, P<0.001). The Pearson's correlations between function-structure parameters were strongest with MP average sensitivity threshold and SVP VD in the area of whole macula (r = 0.68); followed by SAP mean deviation (MD) and pRNFL thickness (r = 0.63); SAP MD and pRPC VD (r = 0.59) and MP average threshold and GCC thickness (r = 0.54). We found the AUROCs for discriminating between glaucomatous and healthy eyes were highest for structural parameters as follows: pRNFL (0.94), macular SVP whole (0.92), pRPC (0.92) and GCC (0.91). Pairwise comparison of the above parameters showed no difference (P>0.05).The relationship between microvascular damage in the macular SVP whole and the decrease of MP average sensitivity threshold is stronger than the pRNFL thickness measurements and SAP parameters. OCTA and MP techniques are valuable methods that allow clinically monitor structural and functional changes in glaucomatous eyes."

We excluded 91 people, and a total of 309 participants were eligible for analysis. The statistical methods used in this study were one-way ANOVA and the Chi-square test, Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression model.In total, 309 participants (98 males and 211 females) aged 50 to 74 (62.05 ± 6.21) years without a CVD history were enrolled in this study. The walking speed gradually decreased from the low CVD risk group to the high CVD risk group (p < 0.05). A significant inverse association between walking speed and CVD risk was confirmed with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of-0.143 (p < 0.05) in middle-aged people, but this significant inverse association was not shown in elderly people. The multivariate logistic regression model for predicting CVD risk and walking speed with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.127 (95% CI = 0.021-0.771) in middle-aged people with adjustment for sex, age, waist circumference (WC), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05).Our study clearly shows that slow walking speed is associated with an increased risk of CVD in middle-aged people rather than in elderly people."

Logistic regression analysis was used for determining demographic factors and comorbidities associated with severe pneumonia. These factors were assigned integer points to create a scoring system to identify children at high risk for severe pneumonia.Among 6,356 CYP with newly diagnosed severe CP, 2,135 (33.59%) had severe pneumonia. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that seven independent predictive factors, namely age <3 years, male sex, and comorbidities of pressure ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, seizures, and perinatal complications. A nomogram was devised by employing these seven significant predictive factors. The prediction model presented favorable discrimination performance.The nomogram revealed that age, male sex, history of pressure ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, seizures, and perinatal complications were potential risk factors for severe pneumonia among CYP with severe CP."
https://openalex.org/W3038609138,"Recent literature has indicated altered motor control in individuals with non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). These individuals present variations in back muscular activity and center of mass (CoM) oscillations. The aim of this study is to explore the possibility of quantitatively measuring these differences using standard parameters with electronic devices. Twenty individuals with NSLBP and 20 healthy controls, matched by sex and age, performed a total of three trials under three different conditions for 90 seconds each. These conditions were standing on firm ground with eyes open, with eyes closed and standing on unstable foam with eyes open. Balance data was acquired via a Kistler force platform and muscular activity was measured by electromyography derived bilaterally from the erector spinae. Afterwards, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire on their current mood, pain rating, well-being, disability and physical activity. Descriptive data from the questionnaire showed an average acute pain score of 2.6 and an average pain score of 5.1 for the prior six weeks in the NSLBP group, while the control group reported an acute pain of 0.1 and an average pain of 0.5. For wellbeing, differences were found only for the physical scale. Average disability was low for the NSLBP group. No differences in physical activity were found among groups. A repeated measures ANOVA did not show significant differences between groups for any parameter. There was also no main effect for the standing conditions and no interaction between group and condition. Simultaneously measuring biomechanical and neuromuscular parameters, allowed for a fine grain approach to understanding motor control in individuals with NSLBP. This study did not find differences as described in the literature, and suggests further examination of factors involved in pain and control processes to better understand implications of NSLBP and possible avenues for support."
https://openalex.org/W3039593221,"This study aimed to characterize oligofructose-induced laminitis in zebu cattle and comparatively evaluate four different diagnostic methods for laminitis. A total of 29 rumen-cannulated Nelore heifers, weighing 474.5 ± 58.5 kg were used. Laminitis was experimentally induced by intraruminal administration of 0.765 g/kg oligofructose twice daily for three consecutive days, followed by a single dose of 10.71 g/kg oligofructose on the fourth day. The animals were evaluated before administration of the highest dose of oligofructose (basal) and every six hours for up to 24 hours (6, 12, 18, 24 hours) and thereafter, every 12 hours for up to 72 hours (36, 48, 60, 72 hours) post-induction. The following diagnostic methods were used: hoof pain sensitivity test (hoof-testing), locomotion scoring, hoof infrared thermography, and force platform. Diagnosis of laminitis was confirmed after two positive responses to hoof pressure testing. Using a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, we defined the appropriate cut-off for infrared thermography and force plate as 30 °C and < 24%, respectively. From the 29 heifers, 27 developed laminitis (93.1%) which occurred between 24 h to 72 h in the digits from two limbs, with more frequent sensitivity in the lateral digits. Locomotion analysis detected twenty-eight heifers with laminitis and showed that a greater (P = 0.006) number of animals had lameness in two limbs (n = 13; 56%). Using hoof-testing as gold standard for the diagnosis of laminitis the locomotion score displayed 100% sensitivity, 97% specificity and 98% accuracy; infrared thermography showed 96% sensitivity, 63% specificity, and 75% accuracy whilst force plate had 76% sensitivity, 82% specificity and 79% accuracy. This suggests that, for the diagnosis of laminitis in cattle, pain evaluation is more efficient. Considering the difficult to evaluate pain sensitivity in Nelore animals, filmed locomotion score, infrared thermography and force plate methods can be indicated for non-invasive lameness detection in beef farms."
https://openalex.org/W3040039079,"Systems biology aims at holistically understanding the complexity of biological systems. In particular, nowadays with the broad availability of gene expression measurements, systems biology challenges the deciphering of the genetic cell machinery from them. In order to help researchers, reverse engineer the genetic cell machinery from these noisy datasets, interactive exploratory clustering methods, pipelines and gene clustering tools have to be specifically developed. Prior methods/tools for time series data, however, do not have the following four major ingredients in analytic and methodological view point: (i) principled time-series feature extraction methods, (ii) variety of manifold learning methods for capturing high-level view of the dataset, (iii) high-end automatic structure extraction, and (iv) friendliness to the biological user community. With a view to meet the requirements, we present AGCT (A Geometric Clustering Tool), a software package used to unravel the complex architecture of large-scale, non-necessarily synchronized time-series gene expression data. AGCT capture signals on exhaustive wavelet expansions of the data, which are then embedded on a low-dimensional non-linear map using manifold learning algorithms, where geometric proximity captures potential interactions. Post-processing techniques, including hard and soft information geometric clustering algorithms, facilitate the summarizing of the complete map as a smaller number of principal factors which can then be formally identified using embedded statistical inference techniques. Three-dimension interactive visualization and scenario recording over the processing helps to reproduce data analysis results without additional time. Analysis of the whole-cell Yeast Metabolic Cycle (YMC) moreover, Yeast Cell Cycle (YCC) datasets demonstrate AGCT's ability to accurately dissect all stages of metabolism and the cell cycle progression, independently of the time course and the number of patterns related to the signal. Analysis of Pentachlorophenol iduced dataset demonstrat how AGCT dissects data to identify two networks: Interferon signaling and NRF2-signaling networks."
https://openalex.org/W3038733373,"An innovative approach to a non-destructive lock mechanism examination by means of X-ray computed tomography (CT) was involved in a careful opening of a locked 19th century chest missing the key, as an interdisciplinary cooperation with the restorers. In regard of the exploration and conservation of such locked objects, their opening is important to the restorers. However, the opening may be complicated, if not impossible, without damaging the object when the key is missing. Moreover, the historical locks might be equipped with protective mechanisms. Despite the exceeding dimensions and the weight of the steel chest, a CT analysis was performed, which enabled a detailed exploration of the lock based on a system of levers and bolts handled by a single key, located in a case on the inside of the chest lid, including the dimensions essential for manufacturing of a new key copy. Moreover, two secret protective mechanisms were revealed, as well as all the damages of the object."
https://openalex.org/W3038848016,"As a new class of cancer therapeutic agents, oncolytic viruses (OVs) have gained much attention not only due to their ability to selectively replicate in and lyse tumor cells, but also for their potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses. As a result, there is an increasing need for in vitro modeling systems capable of recapitulating the 3D physiological tumor microenvironment. Here, we investigated the potential of our recently developed microphysiological system (MPS), featuring a vessel-like channel to reflect the in vivo tumor microenvironment and serving as culture spaces for 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs). The MCTSs consist of cancer A549 cells, stromal MRC5 cells, endothelial HUVECs, as well as the extracellular matrix. 3D MCTSs residing in the MPS were infected with oncolytic VSV expressing GFP (oVSV-GFP). Post-infection, GFP signal intensity increased only in A549 cells of the MPS. On the other hand, HUVECs were susceptible to virus infection under 2D culture and IFN-β secretion was quite delayed in HUVECs. These results thus demonstrate that OV antitumoral characteristics can be readily monitored in the MPS and that its behavior therein somewhat differs compared to its activity in 2D system. In conclusion, we present the first application of the MPS, an in vitro model that was developed to better reflect in vivo conditions. Its various advantages suggest the 3D MCTS-integrated MPS can serve as a first line monitoring system to validate oncolytic virus efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3040192453,"The antibacterial efficacy of the tetracycline antibiotics has been greatly reduced by the development of resistance, hence a decline in their clinical use. The hok/sok locus is a type I toxin/antitoxin plasmid stability element, often associated with multi-drug resistance plasmids, especially ESBL-encoding plasmids. It enhances host cell survivability and pathogenicity in stressful growth conditions, and increases bacterial tolerance to β-lactam antibiotics. The hok/sok locus forms dsRNA by RNA:RNA interactions between the toxin encoding mRNA and antitoxin non-coding RNA, and doxycycline has been reported to bind dsRNA structures and inhibit their cleavage/processing by the dsRNase, RNase III. This study investigated the antibacterial activities of doxycycline in hok/sok host bacteria cells, the effects on hok/sok-induced changes in growth and the mechanism(s) involved. Diverse strains of E. coli were transformed with hok/sok plasmids and assessed for doxycycline susceptibility and growth changes. The results show that the hok/sok locus increases bacterial susceptibility to doxycycline, which is more apparent in strains with more pronounced hok/sok-induced growth effects. The increased doxycycline susceptibility occurs despite β-lactam resistance imparted by hok/sok. Doxycycline was found to induce bacterial death in a manner phenotypically characteristic of Hok toxin expression, suggesting that it inhibits the toxin/antitoxin dsRNA degradation, leading to Hok toxin expression and cell death. In this way, doxycycline could counteract the multi-drug resistance plasmid maintenance/propagation, persistence and pathogenicity mechanisms associated with the hok/sok locus, which could potentially help in efforts to mitigate the rise of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3039142424,"Background Recent studies have uncovered a peculiar finding: that the strength and dimensionality of depression symptoms’ inter-relationships vary systematically across study samples with different average levels of depression severity. Our aim was to examine whether this phenomenon is driven by the proportion of non-affected subjects in the sample. Methods Cross-sectional data from the “Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors” was analyzed. Self-reported depression symptoms were assessed via the Major Depressive Inventory. Symptom data were analyzed via polychoric correlations, principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Mokken scale analysis, and network analysis. Analyses were carried out across 22 subsamples containing increasingly higher proportions of non-depressed participants. Results were examined as a function of the proportion of non-depressed participants. Results A strong influence of the proportion of non-depressed participants was uncovered: the higher the proportion, the stronger the symptom correlations, higher their tendency towards unidimensionality, better their scalability, and higher the network edge strengths. Comparing the depressed sample with the general population sample, the average symptom correlation increased from 0.29 to 0.51; variance explained by the first eigenvalue increased from 0.36 to 0.56; fit measures from confirmatory one-factor analysis increased from 0.81 to 0.97; the H coefficient of scalability increased from 0.26 to 0.48; and the median network edge increased from 0.00 to 0.07. Conclusions Results of psychometric analyses vary substantially as a function of the proportion of non-depressed participants in the sample being studied. This provides a possible explanation for the lack of reproducibility of previous psychometric studies."
https://openalex.org/W3039460182,"Here we aimed for the first time to analyse whether opposite hatching patterns associated or not to high incubation temperature from day 13 to hatching interferes with the thermal preference and response of broilers to heat stress throughout the rearing period. Fertile eggs from 56-week-old broiler breeders (Cobb-500®) were used in a completely randomized trial with a 2x2 factorial arrangement (Short-Long and Long-Short hatching patterns: short time interval between internal and external pipping followed by long time interval between external pipping and hatching, and long time interval between internal and external pipping followed by short time interval between external pipping and hatching, respectively; and control and high incubation temperatures: 37.5°C and 39°C from the 13rd day, respectively). Thermal manipulation from day 13 was chosen because it is known endocrine axes are already established at this time. At hatching, male chicks were reared in climatical chamber with 16 boxes, maintained at the temperature recommended for this strain, with 4 replicates of 18 chicks per treatment. Broilers with Long-Short hatching pattern and from eggs incubation at 37.5°C preferred the lowest ambient temperature at all analyzed ages, whereas broilers with Short-Long hatching pattern and from eggs incubated at 39°C preferred the highest temperatures from 21 days of age. Heat-exposed broilers showed increased respiratory frequency in all ages analyzed, which should have to contributed to maintainance of their rectal (body) temperature. The hatching patterns did not influence the feed intake, but broilers with Short-Long hatching pattern had better feed conversion, weight gain, and body weight. High incubation temperature reduced the feed consumption, as well as the weight gain and body weight by worsening the feed conversion. The results of this study reveal that hatching patterns associated or not to high incubation temperature influence the broiler thermal preference and heat response throughout the rearing period. Chicks with Long-Short and Short-Long hatching patterns should be reared separately, although this is not practical within a hatcher."
