https://openalex.org/W2141709306,"The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,160(3) particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2138559331,"Trust pervades human societies. Trust is indispensable in friendship, love, families and organizations, and plays a key role in economic exchange and politics. In the absence of trust among trading partners, market transactions break down. In the absence of trust in a country's institutions and leaders, political legitimacy breaks down. Much recent evidence indicates that trust contributes to economic, political and social success. Little is known, however, about the biological basis of trust among humans. Here we show that intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide that plays a key role in social attachment and affiliation in non-human mammals, causes a substantial increase in trust among humans, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social interactions. We also show that the effect of oxytocin on trust is not due to a general increase in the readiness to bear risks. On the contrary, oxytocin specifically affects an individual's willingness to accept social risks arising through interpersonal interactions. These results concur with animal research suggesting an essential role for oxytocin as a biological basis of prosocial approach behaviour."

These molecules were then converted into alkanes by dehydration/hydrogenation over bifunctional catalysts that contained acid and metal sites in a four-phase reactor, in which the aqueous organic reactant becomes more hydrophobic and a hexadecane alkane stream removes hydrophobic species from the catalyst before they go on further to form coke. These liquid alkanes are of the appropriate molecular weight to be used as transportation fuel components, and they contain 90% of the energy of the carbohydrate and H 2 feeds."
https://openalex.org/W2060573689,"Self-assembly is an effective strategy for the creation of periodic structures at the nanoscale. However, because microelectronic devices use free-form design principles, the insertion point of self-assembling materials into existing nanomanufacturing processes is unclear. We directed ternary blends of diblock copolymers and homopolymers that naturally form periodic arrays to assemble into nonregular device-oriented structures on chemically nanopatterned substrates. Redistribution of homopolymer facilitates the defect-free assembly in locations where the domain dimensions deviate substantially from those formed in the bulk. The ability to pattern nonregular structures using self-assembling materials creates new opportunities for nanoscale manufacturing."

A widespread decline in lake abundance and area has occurred since 1973, despite slight precipitation increases to the region. The spatial pattern of lake disappearance suggests (i) that thaw and ""breaching"" of permafrost is driving the observed losses, by enabling rapid lake draining into the subsurface; and (ii) a conceptual model in which high-latitude warming of permafrost triggers an initial but transitory phase of lake and wetland expansion, followed by their widespread disappearance."
https://openalex.org/W2061699947,"Human γδ T cells are considered to play a vital role in protective immunity through cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity. We report that cells expressing the Vγ2Vδ2 + –T cell receptor (Vδ2 + T cells) also display principal characteristics of professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. Thus, when activated, these cells efficiently processed and displayed antigens and provided co-stimulatory signals sufficient for strong induction of naïve αβ T cell proliferation and differentiation. We suggest that, upon microbial activation, Vδ2 + T cells participate in the induction of adaptive immune responses and that these cells may be a useful tool in vaccine development and immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2158707059,"In prion and Alzheimer's diseases, the roles played by amyloid versus nonamyloid deposits in brain damage remain unresolved. In scrapie-infected transgenic mice expressing prion protein (PrP) lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor, abnormal protease-resistant PrPres was deposited as amyloid plaques, rather than the usual nonamyloid form of PrPres. Although PrPres amyloid plaques induced brain damage reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, clinical manifestations were minimal. In contrast, combined expression of anchorless and wild-type PrP produced accelerated clinical scrapie. Thus, the PrP GPI anchor may play a role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2158025896,"As a treatment for dyslipidemia, oral doses of 1–3 grams of nicotinic acid per day lower serum triglycerides, raise high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce mortality from coronary heart disease (Tavintharan, S., and Kashyap, M. L. (2001) Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 3, 74–82). These benefits likely result from the ability of nicotinic acid to inhibit lipolysis in adipocytes and thereby reduce serum non-esterified fatty acid levels (Carlson, L. A. (1963) Acta Med. Scand. 173, 719–722). In mice, nicotinic acid inhibits lipolysis via PUMA-G, a Gi/o-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in adipocytes and activated macrophages (Tunaru, S., Kero, J., Schaub, A., Wufka, C., Blaukat, A., Pfeffer, K., and Offermanns, S. (2003) Nat. Med. 9, 352–355). The human ortholog HM74a is also a nicotinic acid receptor and likely has a similar role in anti-lipolysis. Endogenous levels of nicotinic acid are too low to significantly impact receptor activity, hence the natural ligands(s) of HM74a/PUMA-G remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the fatty acid-derived ketone body (d)-β-hydroxybutyrate ((d)-β-OHB) specifically activates PUMA-G/HM74a at concentrations observed in serum during fasting. Like nicotinic acid, (d)-β-OHB inhibits mouse adipocyte lipolysis in a PUMA-G-dependent manner and is thus the first endogenous ligand described for this orphan receptor. These findings suggests a homeostatic mechanism for surviving starvation in which (d)-β-OHB negatively regulates its own production, thereby preventing ketoacidosis and promoting efficient use of fat stores.

Ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate (AcAc), 1The abbreviations used are: AcAc, acetoacetate; (d)-β-OHB, (d)-β-hydroxybutyrate; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: AcAc, acetoacetate; (d)-β-OHB, (d)-β-hydroxybutyrate; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).and (d)-β-OHB) are produced in the liver from acetyl-CoA derived from β-oxidation of fatty acids (7Laffel L. Diabetes/Metabolism Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 412-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AcAc and (d)-β-OHB are small water-soluble carboxylic acids that are important energy sources for the brain and other tissues during prolonged fasting (10Cahill G.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, the serum concentration of (d)-β-OHB is typically ∼50 μm after a meal, rises to ∼0.2–0.4 mm after an overnight fast, reaches ∼1–2 mm after 2–3 days of fasting, and plateaus at ∼6–8 mm upon prolonged starvation (7Laffel L.

The fact that these effects are similar to those of nicotinic acid and that both β-OHB and nicotinic acid are small carboxylic acids led us to investigate whether ketone bodies are HM74a agonists. Materials—With the exception of Acifran and lithium (dl)-β-OHB, all compounds tested were from Sigma. Acifran was synthesized by chemists at Arena Pharmaceuticals, and lithium (dl)-β-OHB was made by titrating free (dl)-β-OHB acid (Sigma) with LiOH by chemists at Merck. [35S]GTPγS (1160 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences, and [5,6-3H]nicotinic acid (50 Ci/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Molecular Cloning—HM74a and HM74 were cloned by PCR using human genomic DNA as a template and the following primers, GCTGGAGCATTCACTAGGCGAG (sense for HM74a), AGATCCTGGTTCTTGGTGACAATG (antisense for HM74a), GGAGAATTCACTAGGCGAGGCGCTCCATC (sense for HM74), and GGAGGATCCAGGAAACCTTAGGCCGAGTCC (antisense for HM74). PUMA-G was cloned using mouse genomic DNA as template, the sense primer AGATCCACTCATGAGCAAGTCAGACC, and the antisense primer CCTTCTTGTCATAGTAACTTAACGAG. For the generation of stable cell lines, 5 × 106 CHO-K1 cells were transfected with 12 μg of plasmid DNA (pCDNA3.1, Invitrogen) containing either HM74a, HM74, or PUMA-G expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter. Two days after transfection, the growth medium was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 to select for antibiotic-resistant cells. Clonal CHO-K1 cell lines that stably express HM74, HM74a, or PUMA-G were selected based on the ability of nicotinic acid (HM74a and PUMA-G) or S711589 (an Arena HM74-specific agonist; data not shown) to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production. Calcium Mobilization—CHO-K1 cells expressing an NFAT-β-lactamase reporter and the promiscuous Gα subunit Gqi5 (kind gift of K. Sullivan, Merck Research Laboratories) were stably transfected with either empty vector (pCDNA3.1, Invitrogen) or vector expressing PUMA-G, HM74a, or HM74. Cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 384-well culture plates and grown overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm MEM non-essential amino acids solution, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin B, 0.5 mg/ml zeocin, and 1 mg/ml geneticin (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and loaded with calcium-sensitive dye by incubating with an equal volume of Molecular Devices calcium assay kit loading buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Calcium response in the fluorometric imaging plate reader assay was measured according to the directions from Molecular Devices. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Membranes from untransfected CHO-K1 cells or cells stably expressing PUMA-G, HM74a, or HM74 (20 μg/assay) were diluted in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) in Wallac Scintistrip plates and preincubated with test compounds diluted in assay buffer containing 40 μm GDP (final [GDP] was 10 μm) for ∼10 min before addition of [35S]GTPγS to 0.3 nm. To measure the agonist activity of free acids, rather than sodium salts (Table I), the HEPES concentration was increased to 60 mm; this increase had no effect on the EC50 of nicotinic acid (data not shown). Binding was allowed to proceed for 1 h before centrifuging the plates at 4000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature and subsequent counting in a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. Non-linear regression analysis of the binding curves was performed in GraphPad Prism version 4.Table ILigand-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes from CHO cells expressing PUMA-G, HM74α, or HM74CompoundEC50PUMA-GHM74aHM74μmNicotinic acid0.04 ± 0.0030.10 ± 0.005>100aSome compounds displayed activity at the highest concentration tested but not over a full dose response from which an EC50 could be determined.

After 4 h at room temperature, reactions were filtered through Packard Unifilter GF/C plates using a Packard Harvester and washed eight times with 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 250 μm unlabeled nicotinic acid. Competitive binding assays were performed in the presence of 50 nm [3H]nicotinic acid. In Vitro Lipolysis—Isolation of mouse primary epididymal adipocytes and in vitro determination of NEFA release was performed according to the method of Rodbell as adapted by Tunaru et al. (3Tunaru S.

To ask whether β-OHB is a ligand for HM74a, we used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that stably express the chimeric G-protein α subunit Gqi5 (18Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and harbor either a control vector or vectors that expresses either HM74a or its paralog HM74, which is 95% identical at the amino acid level to HM74a but has ∼1000-fold less affinity for nicotinic acid (4Wise A. Foord S.M. Fraser N.J. Barnes A.A. Elshourbagy N. Eilert M. Ignar D.M. Murdock P.R. Steplewski K. Green A. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Szekeres P.G. Hassall D.G. Marshall F.H. Wilson S. Pike N.B. J. Biol.

Use of Gqi5 allows the normally Gi/o-coupled HM74 and HM74a to signal via the Gq pathway leading to Ca+2 mobilization. Nicotinic acid elicited Ca+2 mobilization only in cells expressing HM74a (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Acifran, an agonist on both HM74 and HM74a (4Wise A. Foord S.M. Fraser N.J. Barnes A.A. Elshourbagy N. Eilert M. Ignar D.M. Murdock P.R. Steplewski K. Green A. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Szekeres P.G. Hassall D.G. Marshall F.H. Wilson S. Pike N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9869-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), elicited a response from both receptors demonstrating that HM74 was functional and could be used as a specificity control in this assay. Given that ketone bodies can reach millimolar concentrations in serum, we tested these compounds at 15 mm. Both (d)- and (l)-β-OHB, but not acetoacetate or free acetone, elicited a Ca+2 response in cells expressing HM74a but not HM74. Whereas the d-isomer of β-OHB is the sole form encountered in high concentrations physiologically (7Laffel L. Diabetes/Metabolism Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 412-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both d- and l-isomers have been shown to inhibit lipolysis in vitro (17Metz S.H. Lopes-Cardozo M. van den Bergh S.G. FEBS Lett. 1974; 47: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), consistent with the results shown here. Similar results were observed for cells expressing murine PUMA-G (data not shown). Next, we determined the half-maximal concentration (EC50) of β-OHB required to stimulate receptor-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange on Gα using a [35S]GTPγS binding assay with membranes prepared from untransfected CHO cells or CHO cells stably expressing either mouse PUMA-G, human HM74a, or HM74 (Fig. 1B and Table I). Nicotinic acid stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding only in membranes from cells expressing HM74a (EC50 104 ± 5 nm) or the mouse ortholog PUMA-G (EC50 = 43 ± 3 nm), whereas Acifran was active on all three receptors (EC50 = 1127 ± 59 nm for HM74a, 358 ± 30 nm for PUMA-G, and 7039 ± 598 nm for HM74). Racemic (dl)-β-OHB also showed some degree of activity on all receptors; however, it was more potent on HM74a (EC50 = 0.8 ± 0.06 mm) and its ortholog PUMA-G (EC50 = 0.7 ± 0.04 mm) than on HM74. The EC50 for the l-enantiomer was ∼2-fold higher than that of the physiologically relevant d-enantiomer (Table I). Both the sodium and lithium salts of β-OHB were active, indicating that the anion is the active component. Moreover, sodium salts of other small monocarboxylic acids with similar pKa values to β-OHB (α-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) were not significantly active in this assay (Table I). At high concentrations, lithium acetoacetate, but not acetone or lithium chloride, elicited [35S]GTPγS binding to all three receptors but not to membranes from untransfected cells, suggesting that acetoacetate is a weak agonist of these receptors. Short-chain fatty acids were recently identified as ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR41, which is, like HM74a/PUMA-G, expressed in adipocytes (19Le Poul E. Loison C. Struyf S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Given their similarity to β-OHB, we determined whether small fatty acids are ligands for HM74a/PUMA-G. Indeed, a structure-activity relationship was observed for fatty acids of varying chain length (Table I), with pentanoic (C5) and hexanoic (C6) acids being the most active on HM74a (C5, EC50 = 402 ± 51 μm; C6, EC50 = 451 ± 91 μm) and PUMA-G (C5, EC50 = 166 ± 33 μm; C6, EC50 = 133 ± 15 μm). HM74 has affinity for slightly longer chain length fatty acids, with a peak of activity centered on octanoic acid (C8, EC50 = 73 ± 12 μm; Table I). However, it is unlikely that these small fatty acids reach sufficient concentrations in serum to activate these receptors (19Le Poul E. Loison C. Struyf S. Springael J.Y. Lannoy V. Decobecq M.E.

Consistent with this, while both HM74a/PUMA-G and GPR41 have similar chain length preferences, the latter receptor has at least 10-fold higher affinity for these acids (Table I and Ref. 20Xiong Y. Miyamoto N. Shibata K. Valasek M.A. Motoike T. Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We note as well that in another study racemic (dl)-β-OHB was not a GPR41 agonist at concentrations up to 10 mm (20Xiong Y. Miyamoto N. Shibata K. Valasek M.A. Motoike T. Kedzierski R.M. Yanagisawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Similarly, another study found “l-OH-butyrate” (the exact molecular structure of which was not described) to be only a very weak (EC50 ∼5 mm) ligand of human GPR41 and GPR43, another receptor for short-chain fatty acids expressed predominantly in leukocytes (19Le Poul E.

We employed an equilibrium [3H]nicotinic acid binding competition assay to ask whether nicotinic acid and β-OHB compete for the same binding site on the receptor. [3H]Nicotinic acid bound specifically and saturably to membranes from cells expressing HM74a, but not HM74 (data not shown), with a calculated Kd of 105 ± 9 nm (data not shown), a value in good agreement with published results (3Tunaru S.

Homologous competition with unlabeled nicotinic acid yielded a Ki of 130 ± 14 nm, similar to the observed Kd (Fig. 1C). As in the [35S]GTPγS binding assay, AcAc displayed low apparent affinity for HM74a, but (dl)-β-OHB bound the receptor with physiologically relevant affinity (Ki = 0.7 ± 0.06 mm; Fig. 1C). Similar results were observed for PUMA-G (Ki = 0.7 mm ± 0.1 mm; data not shown). Taken together, these data show that (d)-β-OHB is a HM74a/PUMA-G agonist and that the serum concentrations of this ketone body observed as early as 2–3 days into a fast in humans (7Laffel L. Diabetes/Metabolism Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 412-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fukao T. Lopaschuk G.D. Mitchell G.A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 2004; 70: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) will result in significant receptor occupancy and activity. Previous studies with isolated adipocytes from knock-out mice demonstrated that PUMA-G mediates the anti-lipolytic effect of nicotinic acid (3Tunaru S. Kero J. Schaub A. Wufka C. Blaukat A. Pfeffer K. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar); we performed analogous experiments with (d)-β-OHB. Both nicotinic acid and sodium (d)-β-OHB suppressed free fatty acid efflux from isoproterenol-stimulated primary adipocytes from wild-type mice, the latter at concentrations consistent with the affinity determined previously (approximate EC50 for (d)-β-OHB-mediated lipolysis inhibition ∼2 mm, Fig. 2A). This suppression was PUMA-G-mediated, as nicotinic acid and (d)-β-OHB were without significant effect in adipocytes from PUMA-G knock-out mice (Fig. 2B). Adipocytes from PUMA-G knock-out mice were not merely refractory to lipolysis inhibition per se, as ADP inhibited fatty acid efflux equally well in wild-type and knock-out cells (Fig. 2B). The adenosine analogue phenylisopropyladenosine also inhibited lipolysis equally well in wild-type and knock-out cells (data not shown). We note that the rate of both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was routinely lower in adipocytes from knock-out mice compared with those from wild-type animals (Fig. 2B; compare “No stimulation” and “Iso”). It is unlikely that this difference is due to a deficiency of lipid in the knockout adipocytes, as wild-type and knock-out cells had approximately the same overall size as determined by microscopy (data not shown), and wild-type and knock-out mice had the same overall fat mass as determined by NMR spectroscopy. 2D. Marsh, unpublished observations. In this work we have shown that the ketone body (d)-β-OHB specifically binds to and activates the adipocyte-expressed GPCRs HM74a/PUMA-G with an affinity that is well within the range of serum concentrations observed for this metabolite after ∼2–3 days of starvation in humans and ∼1–2 days in mice (7Laffel L. Diabetes/Metabolism Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 412-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cahill G.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of (d)-β-OHB is, like nicotinic acid, anti-lipolytic (1Tavintharan S. Kashyap M.L. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2001; 3: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Carlson L.A. Acta Med. Scand. 1963; 173: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Pike N.B. Wise A. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2004; 5: 271-275PubMed Google Scholar). (d)-β-OHB is thus the first endogenous ligand described for the orphan receptor PUMA-G. During starvation, the rate of hepatic ketone body synthesis is at least partially limited by the rate of adipocyte lipolysis (7Laffel L. Diabetes/Metabolism Res. Rev. 1999; 15: 412-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That (d)-β-OHB is itself anti-lipolytic suggests a homeostatic negative feedback mechanism in which this metabolite regulates its own production by decreasing the serum level of fatty acid precursors available for hepatic ketogenesis. Indeed, in a study of the serum NEFA-lowering effect of β-OHB infused into humans, Senior and Loridan (9Senior B. Loridan L. Nature. 1968; 219: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) proposed that during starvation ketone bodies exert “a fine regulatory adjustment” of their own synthesis by inhibiting adipocyte lipolysis. Such a mechanism would potentially conserve fat stores during extended starvation and attenuate excessive formation of ketoacids from unrestrained lipolysis and ketogenesis. This model implies that PUMA-G knock-out mice would experience higher rates of lipolysis and ketogenesis during a fast, as (d)-β-OHB does not inhibit lipolysis in the absence of this receptor. In preliminary experiments, we have not observed significant reproducible differences between wild-type and PUMA-G knock-out animals in rate of body fat depletion or serum levels of NEFA or (d)-β-OHB during 24 and 48 h of fasting. 3D. Marsh, M. Reitman, and A. Taggart, unpublished observations. However, we note that adipocytes from knock-out animals are refractory to stimulation with isoproterenol (Fig. 2B), perhaps suggesting a fundamental difference in lipolysis regulation in the knock-out cells that may compensate for lack of PUMA-G. Studies with inducible knock-outs of PUMA-G in adult animals may shed light on this question.

In particular, movement of the body, by bouncing on every second versus every third beat of an ambiguous auditory rhythm pattern, influences whether that auditory rhythm pattern is encoded in duple form (a march) or in triple form (a waltz). Visual information is not necessary for the effect, indicating that it likely reflects a strong, early-developing interaction between auditory and vestibular information in the human nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2058788882,"SUMO-1 (for small ubiquitin-related modifier) belongs to the ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein family. SUMO conjugation occurs on specific lysine residues within protein targets, regulating pathways involved in differentiation, apoptosis, the cell cycle and responses to stress by altering protein function through changes in activity or cellular localization or by protecting substrates from ubiquitination. Ub/Ubl conjugation occurs in sequential steps and requires the concerted action of E2 conjugating proteins and E3 ligases. In addition to being a SUMO E3, the nucleoporin Nup358/RanBP2 localizes SUMO-conjugated RanGAP1 to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex by means of interactions in a complex that also includes Ubc9, the SUMO E2 conjugating protein. Here we describe the 3.0-A crystal structure of a four-protein complex of Ubc9, a Nup358/RanBP2 E3 ligase domain (IR1-M) and SUMO-1 conjugated to the carboxy-terminal domain of RanGAP1. Structural insights, combined with biochemical and kinetic data obtained with additional substrates, support a model in which Nup358/RanBP2 acts as an E3 by binding both SUMO and Ubc9 to position the SUMO-E2-thioester in an optimal orientation to enhance conjugation."

The signal is complex, with a vertical structure that varies widely by ocean; it cannot be explained by natural internal climate variability or solar and volcanic forcing, but is well simulated by two anthropogenically forced climate models. We conclude that it is of human origin, a conclusion robust to observational sampling and model differences. Changes in advection combine with surface forcing to give the overall warming pattern. The implications of this study suggest that society needs to seriously consider model predictions of future climate change."

The film is a wide-gap insulator, although the overall stoichiometry of the film is not Al 2 O 3 but Al 10 O 13 .

Chitinase's Little Helper Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 31PreviewMore than one billion tons of chitin are produced by insects, fungi, and marine organisms every year. Despite this abundant production, chitin does not accumulate in most ecosystems, indicating that the carbohydrate polymer is somehow degraded. Many aquatic and terrestrial microorganisms contain chitinases, which are responsible for breaking down chitin. For example, the Gram-negative soil bacterium Serratia marcescens produces three chitinases, ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC. In addition to these chitinases, S. Full-Text PDF Open Access Each year more than one billion tons of chitin, a linear polymer of β(1–4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is produced in the biosphere, mainly by insects, fungi, crustaceans, and other marine organisms (1.Gooday G.W. Adv. Microb. Ecol. 1990; 11: 387-430Crossref Google Scholar). Like cellulose, chitin is an abundant insoluble linear polymer with considerable mechanical and chemical strength. Three crystalline forms of chitin have been described in terms of the arrangement of the chitin chains: α-chitin (chains run anti-parallel), β-chitin (chains run parallel), and γ-chitin (mixed parallel/antiparallel chains). Despite its resilience, insolubility, and abundant production, chitin does not accumulate in most ecosystems, suggesting that nature has developed efficient processes for chitin degradation. Chitin is degraded by chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) that belong to families 18 and 19 of the glycoside hydrolases (Refs. 2.Henrissat B. Biochem.

For example, the Gram-negative soil bacterium Serratia marcescens, known as one of the most effective microbial chitin degraders (4.Monreal J. Reese E.T. Can. J. Microbiol. 1969; 15: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), produces three family 18 chitinases, ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC (5.Fuchs R.L. Mcpherson S.A. Drahos D.J. Appl. Environ.

Such domains are often referred to as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; CBP, chitin-binding protein. and have been classified in the CAZY data base (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). In addition to being important for biomass turnover, chitin degradation is essential in a variety of biological processes. For example, plants are known to produce chitinases in response to attack by chitin-containing fungi (15.Kasprzewska A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2003; 8: 809-824PubMed Google Scholar), whereas some non-pathogenic fungi such as Trichoderma species are considered as “biocontrol” agents because of their ability to inhibit other, chitin-containing, fungi (16.Harman G.E. Howell C.R. Viterbo A. Chet I. Lorito M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). While chitin-containing organisms may be inhibited by exogenous chitinolytic activity, they do need some endogenous chitin turnover as part of morphological and developmental processes (17.Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum needs family 18 chitinases to cross the chitinous peritrophic matrix of the mosquito host (18.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.A. Brameld K.A. Xu B. Hayward R. Fidock D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14061-14066Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Analogous processes are thought to occur in other protozoan parasites, e.g. Leishmania (19.Schlein Y. Jacobson R.L. Messer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9944-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A final example concerns insect viruses, which produce chitinases to disintegrate the peritrophic matrix of their target organism, thereby increasing virus infectiousness (20.Hawtin R.E. Zarkowska T. Arnold K. Thomas C.J. Gooday G.W. King L.A. Kuzio J.A. Possee R.D. Virology. 1997; 238: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition to three chitinases, S. marcescens secretes a 18.8-kDa protein, CBP21, when grown on chitin (21.Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to CBM family 33 and is known to bind to β-chitin (21.Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N.

Schrempf H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Homologues also occur in insect viruses (named GP37 or fusolin proteins in baculoviruses and entomopoxviruses, respectively; see Ref. 28.Dall D. Luque T. O'Reilly D.

Currently, the precise biological function of CBP21-like microbial and virus proteins is not clear, but it has been hypothesized that they may play a role in microbial attachment to chitin or to enhance substrate availability by disruption of crystalline chitin (25.Schnellmann J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have also been suggested to work at least in part by disrupting substrate structure, but experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis is scarce. In contrast to the majority of the CBMs, which use solvent exposed aromatic residues to interact with substrates, CBP21 lacks an aromatic surface region (22.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Riemen A.H. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11313-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the mode of CBP21 substrate binding is not known. Here, we show that binding of CBP21 to chitin leads to disruption of the crystalline substrate structure and to a dramatic increase in chitinase efficiency. We show that CBP21 exerts this effect through specific polar interactions, which are not only important for binding, but also for alteration of the substrate structure. The implications of these findings for microbial chitin degradation and the potential roles of CBP21-like proteins in insect viruses are discussed. Apart from providing new insights into natural chitin degradation, the results also indicate ways to improve already established methods in e.g. plant disease control, which are based on the action of chitinolytic enzymes.

Scanning Electron Microscopy—A 0.1 mg/ml β-chitin (France Chitin, Marseille) suspension in 50 μm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, was preincubated for 48 h at 37 °C in Eppendorf tubes with either 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml CBP21, applied onto an object glass (10 mm; 25 μl drops), and dried at 37 °C to fix the sample. The object glasses containing the samples were glued onto scanning electron microscopy aluminum studs with carbon tape and sputter-coated with gold-palladium. Scanning was performed in a JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope at 5 kV. Chitin Degradation Assays—Determination of chitinolytic activity was done using β-chitin from a squid pen (France Chitin), α-chitin isolated from shrimp shells (Hov-Bio, Tromsø, Norway), or crab shells (Sigma) or microparticulate β-chitin (Seikagaku Corp.) as substrate. Standard reaction mixtures contained varying concentrations of chitinase and CBP21, 0.1 mg/ml purified bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml chitin powder (unless stated otherwise), in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for up to 2 weeks. No agitation was used since the insoluble substrate easily adheres to the dry inner walls of the Eppendorf tubes, which would affect the substrate concentration. At time points ranging from 2 to 400 h, 60 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 60 μl of 70% acetonitrile, to stop the reaction. Before taking samples, reaction mixtures were resuspended by gentle pipetting to leave the chitin concentration unaltered. All reactions were run in triplicate and all samples were stored at -20 °C until further analysis. Samples were analyzed by isocratic high performance liquid chromatography using an Amide-80 column (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA), coupled to a Gilson Unipoint high performance liquid chromatography system (Gilson). The liquid phase consisted of 70% acetonitrile, with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. 20-μl samples were injected using a Gilson 123 autoinjector. Eluted oligosaccharides were monitored by recording absorption at 210 nm. Chromatograms were collected and analyzed using the Gilson Unipoint software (Gilson). Since in all cases (GlcNAc)2 represented more than 95% of the total amount of degradation products on a molar basis, only (GlcNAc)2 peaks were subject for data analysis and used for quantification of the extent of chitin degradation. A standard solution containing 0.25 mm (GlcNAc)2 was analyzed at the start, in the middle, and at the end of each series of samples, and the resulting average value (displaying standard deviations of less than 3%) was used for calibration. Scanning Electron Microscopy of β-Chitin Fragments—Fig. 1 shows scanning electron micrographs of untreated and CBP21-treated β-chitin particles. The edges and surfaces of the untreated particles are discrete in shape, with smooth surfaces (Fig. 1, A, B, E, and F). In contrast, the edges and surfaces of the CBP21-treated particles showed an amorphous and porous character (Fig. 1, C and G), along with areas of disassembled chitin fibrils (Fig. 1, D and H). Degradation of β-Chitin with Different Chitinases—Degradation of β-chitin with the family 18 chitinases ChiA, ChiB, or ChiC showed biphasic kinetics, with an initial fast linear phase, followed by a slower, hyperbolic phase (Fig. 2, A–C). Initial degradation rates were determined by linear regression, whereas the hyperbolic second phase only allowed end point analysis as a rate descriptor (Table I). In the absence of CBP21 ChiA and ChiC had similar activities toward chitin, both in terms of initial rate and the time needed to fully degrade the substrate (tfull), whereas ChiB displayed a ∼3-fold slower initial rate and never managed to fully digest the substrate (Fig. 2, Table I). The addition of CBP21 had only minor effects on the initial rates but large effects on the slower second phase (that is, on tfull). For ChiA and ChiC tfull decreased ∼7-fold, whereas for ChiB addition of CBP21 led to complete degradation of the substrate, albeit still at a slower rate than in the case of ChiA and ChiC (Table I).Table IInitial rates (calculated for the first four time points: 2, 4, 6, and 8 h) and reaction end points (tfull)for the degradation of β -chitin with 0.2 μm ChiA, ChiB, or ChiC, in the absence or presence of CBP21 The R-square values from the linear regression analyses are indicated in brackets.

Fig. 2 shows that addition of CBP21 increased reaction rates to levels comparable to those observed in reactions where the CBP21 was present from t = 0. In an additional control experiment with ChiB, CBP21 was added after 216 h, which led to full degradation of the substrate (Fig. 2B). Control reactions containing CBP21 without enzyme did not yield detectable amounts of soluble chitooligosaccharides. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CBP21 facilitates the degradation of β-chitin by family 18 chitinases in a non-enzymatic manner. To investigate whether the effects of CBP21 on the efficiency of family 18 chitinases from S. marcescens were due to specific enzyme-CBP21 interactions, we also conducted experiments with ChiG, a family 19 chitinase from S. coelicolor. The results (Fig. 2D) show that CBP21 increased ChiG efficiency, suggesting that CBP21 has a general effect on substrate availability and does not act through specific interactions with particular enzymes. Dose-response studies of the effect of CBP21 on ChiC efficiency showed that ChiC displays maximum degradation rates at CBP21 concentrations ≥ 50 nm, regardless of the enzyme concentration (Fig. 3). Thus, the beneficial effect of CBP21 does not seem to be caused by a stoichiometric interaction with the enzyme. β-Chitin Degradation Using Combinations of ChiA, -B, and -C and CBP21—It is generally assumed that ChiA and ChiB are exochitinases, while ChiC is an endochitinase (8.Suzuki K.

In agreement with previous experiments, Fig. 4 shows that the three S. marcescens chitinases act synergistically on β-chitin too. In all cases, CBP21 increased the degradation efficiency. The highest efficiency was obtained when combining all three enzymes in the presence of CBP21. Hydrolysis of β-Chitin with ChiC in the Presence of CBP21 Mutants—Combination of the structure of CBP21 with a multiple sequence alignment of bacterial CBPs has previously revealed conserved surface residues, whose mutation to alanine decreased chitin affinity 3–8-fold (Ref. 22.Vaaje-Kolstad G.

These mutants, as well as two control CBP21 variants with wild type binding characteristics (A152R and Q161A (22.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Riemen A.H. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol.

Experiments with a CBP21 concentration of 50 nm, which gives maximum effects on ChiC efficiency in the case of wild type CBP21 (Fig. 3), showed that CBP21 mutants Y54A, E55A, E60A, H114A, and D182A had lost their functionality, while the N185A, A152R, and Q161A mutants showed wild type-like functionality (Fig. 6). The deleterious effects of the Y54A, E55A, and H114A mutations on CBP21 function were only slightly negated by increasing the CBP21 concentration as much as 100-fold (results not shown; E60A and D182A were not tested).Fig. 6Degradation of β-chitin by ChiC in the presence of CBP21 mutants.

Experiments similar to the ones described above showed that addition of CBP21 at concentrations up to as high as 5 μm did not affect of the efficiency of ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC toward these substrates (results not shown). The present results show that CBP21 from S. marcescens interferes with the crystalline structure of β-chitin (Fig. 1), which leads to increased enzymatic turnover of the substrate, regardless of which chitinase(s) is/are present (Figs. 2 and 4). The results also show that this effect of CBP21 is not due to formation of specific stoichiometric CBP21-chitinase complexes but rather to a more general effect of CBP21 on substrate availability (Figs. 2 and 3). More than 5 decades ago, it was proposed that degradation of insoluble cellulose was governed by two consecutive phases, an initial non-hydrolytic phase making the substrate accessible for hydrolytic enzymes, followed by the actual hydrolysis phase (42.Reese E.T. Siu R.G.H. Levinson H.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 59: 485-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the period of time following this postulation, two groups have shown that, indeed, the isolated auxiliary CBMs of two cellulases can disrupt the structure of crystalline cellulose (34.Gao P.J. Chen G.J. Wang T.H. Zhang Y.S. Liu J. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2001; 33: 13-18PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Din N. Gilkes N.R. Tekant B. Miller R.C. Warren A.J. Kilburn D.G. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 1096-1099Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In 1994 Din et al. (36.Din N. Damude H.G. Gilkes N.R. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11383-11387Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that the auxiliary CBM of CenA, an endoglucanase from Cellulomonas fimi, increases the substrate availability for the catalytic domain, thus increasing the efficiency of CenA. While chitinases such as ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC also contain auxiliary CBMs, most microorganisms containing chitinase genes also contain a gene encoding for a homologue of CBP21, that is, a non-catalytic chitin-binding protein. Although these proteins have been hypothesized to assist chitinases in chitin degradation, possibly by disrupting chitin (25.Schnellmann J. Zeltins A. Blaak H. Schrempf H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), this has so far not been shown experimentally. ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC differ in their efficiency toward β-chitin (Fig. 1) and other chitin forms, 3G. Vaaje-Kolstad, S. J. Horn, and V. G. H. Eijsink, unpublished observations. which may in part be due to the fact that these enzymes have different types of auxiliary CBMs (ChiA contains a fibronectin type III-like CBM, ChiB contains a family 5 CBM, and ChiC contains a family 12 and an fibronectin type III-like CBM; see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/ for family classification). In all cases though, CBP21 had beneficial effects on enzyme efficiency. The most dramatic effects were observed with ChiB and the family 19 chitinase ChiG (a chitinase without auxilliary CBMs), for which the presence of CBP21 was essential to obtain full substrate conversion. The degradation of β-chitin appeared biphasic, indicating the presence of two substrate forms with different degrees of accessibility. Addition of CBP21 hardly affected the fast first phase of degradation, while it had large effects on the slow second phase. It is conceivable that the fast phase represents degradation of easily accessible amorphous regions in the substrate, while the slow, CBP21-sensitive phase is likely to represent degradation of more recalcitrant crystalline regions. CBMs from cellulases or chitinases with known structures all have binding surfaces containing several aromatic residues, often tryptophans. Remarkably the structure of CBP21 showed that the surface of CBP21 is devoid of such an extended aromatic binding surface but contains a surface patch of largely hydrophilic residues that are conserved (Fig. 5; note that this patch does contain the only aromatic residue on the CBP21 surface, Tyr54). It had already been shown that individual mutation of these conserved residues reduces affinity for chitin 3–8-fold (22.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Riemen A.H. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11313-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Here, we show that five out of six mutants with reduced affinity for chitin have a strongly reduced ability to promote chitinase activity (Fig. 6). Strikingly, while these mutants only showed a 3–8-fold reduction in binding affinity (22.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Riemen A.H. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11313-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), their functionality could not be fully restored by increasing the CBP concentration by as much as 100-fold. Thus, the effects of individual mutations on chitin binding are modest compared with the effects on the ability to increase substrate accessibility and turnover. Interestingly, the opposite situation was also observed: the N185A mutant showed a 5-fold reduction in chitin affinity (22.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Riemen A.H. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11313-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) but was still capable of stimulating chitin turnover (Fig. 6). While Asn185 may seem to be important for binding only, the other five mutated residues are apparently involved in specific disruptive interactions with the chitin substrate. It is tempting to speculate that the hydrophilic residues engage in a series of specific hydrogen bonds with the chitin chains and that this could disrupt interchain hydrogen bonding networks. It is also conceivable that such networks specify the substrate specificity of the CBP (strictly β-chitin in the case of CBP21), since, for example, the surfaces of α-chitin and β-chitin differ in terms of the accessibility and spacing of groups that may engage in hydrogen bonds (in β-chitin the chains are packed more “loosely” than in α-chitin, and β-chitin has a higher water content (43.Saito Y. Kumagai H. Wada M. Kuga S. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44.Saito Y. Okano T. Gaill F. Chanzy H. Putaux J.L. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2000; 28: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). It should be noted that there are homologues of CBP21 (e.g. CHB1 from Streptomyces olivaoceviridis, which is 46% identical in sequence) that bind strictly to α-chitin (25.Schnellmann J. Zeltins A. Blaak H. Schrempf H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cbp21 gene is located 1.5 kb downstream of the chiB gene in S. marcescens, and the CBP21 protein is produced along with ChiB and the other two chitinases, ChiA and ChiC (21.Suzuki K. Suzuki M. Taiyoji M. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 45.Watanabe T. Kimura K. Sumiya T. Nikaidou N. Suzuki K. Suzuki M.

Biochem. 2001; 65: 338-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the efficiency of β-chitin degradation was optimal in the presence of all three enzymes and CBP21. Thus, in addition to three chitinases with apparent different roles and capabilities, CBP21 is essential for efficient β-chitin degradation by S. marcescens. Interestingly, S. marcescens grows fast with β-chitin as the sole carbon source, while growth on α-chitin is slow and never yields dense cultures. 4G. Vaaje-Kolstad, unpublished observations. This is in accordance with the substrate specificity of CBP21. Because chitinases degrade structural components in e.g. fungi, insects, and nematodes, they have numerous (potential) applications. For example, it has been shown that transgenic plants expressing heterologous chitinases show increased resistance toward certain plant pathogenic fungi (47.Broglie K. Chet I. Holliday M. Cressman R.

Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that applications of chitinases, e.g. in plague control, may in some cases be improved by not only using the enzyme(s) but also a protein such as CBP21. The fact that homologues of the cbp21 gene seem to occur in many chitinase-producing microorganisms indicates that the use of CBP21-homologues to improve chitin turnover is a strategy commonly employed in nature. We could not detect homologues of CBP21 in Plasmodium and Leishmania which both depend on chitinases during their life cycles (18.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.A. Brameld K.A. Xu B. Hayward R.

Interestingly, the genomes of insect viruses contain chitinase genes as well as genes encoding homologues of CBP21, called GP37 or fusolin (20.Hawtin R.E. Zarkowska T. Arnold K. Thomas C.J.

It has been shown that the liquefaction of larvae of Autographa californica by a baculovirus depends on the virus-encoded chitinase (20.Hawtin R.E. Zarkowska T. Arnold K. Thomas C.J. Gooday G.W. King L.A. Kuzio J.A. Possee R.D. Virology. 1997; 238: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mitsuhashi and Miyamoto (52.Mitsuhashi W. Miyamoto K. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2003; 82: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have suggested that a GP37/fusolin protein is involved in perforation of the peritrophic matrix of silkworm larvae upon viral infection. Additionally, Mitsuhashi et al. (29.Mitsuhashi W. Furuta Y. Sato M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1998; 71: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that fusolin increases the infectiousness of a silkworm baculovirus up to 10,000-fold when fed to silkworm larvae prior to infection. Based on the results presented above, it is tempting to speculate that GP37/fusolin proteins in insect viruses contribute to infectivity by facilitating chitinase action.

Ribonuclease (RNase) III family enzymes are expressed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are involved in the processing, maturation, and degradation of a wide variety of RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), 1The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; nt, nucleotide(s); dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RBD, RNA binding domain; dsRBD, double-stranded RNA binding domain; R-rich, arginine-rich; pri-miRNA, primary microRNA transcript; pre-miRNA, precursor microRNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and small interfering RNAs (1Lamontagne B.

These RNases generate RNA products that feature an imperfect or perfect duplex with an ∼2-nucleotide (nt) 3′ overhang at the site of cleavage. This characteristic staggered 3′ end structure results from the independent cleavage of the two RNA strands by the two catalytic sites located within a single double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) processing center formed by two RNase III domains. These RNase III domains may derive from two proteins, as seen with bacterial RNase III, or from a single protein, as seen with Dicer and Drosha (3Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E. Filipowicz W. Cell. 2004; 118: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 4Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The RNase III family can be divided into four subclasses (1Lamontagne B. Larose S. Boulanger J. Abou Elela S. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2001; 3: 71-78PubMed Google Scholar). Class 1 consists of bacterial enzymes with a minimal RNase III domain and a single dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD). Class 2 consists of fungal enzymes such as Rnt1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and PacI in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which contain an extra N-terminal region with no recognizable motifs. Class 3 consists of the Drosha orthologs found in animals. These proteins have two RNase III domains and one dsRBD in the C-terminal half and a proline-rich domain and an argininerich (R-rich) domain in the N-terminal half of the protein. Class 4 RNase III enzymes consist of the Dicer homologs expressed in S. pombe, plants, and animals. Their C-terminal half appears similar to Drosha, but the N-terminal half features different domain structures. How these RNase III enzymes select and cleave their RNA substrates has been the subject of several studies. Escherichia coli RNase III, a class 1 enzyme, targets a broad spectrum of RNAs, apparently regulated only by RNA antideterminants, i.e. certain sequences arranged in base pairs at defined positions along a helical substrate are disfavored (5Zhang K. Nicholson A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13437-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Human Dicer, a class 4 enzyme, preferentially recognizes a 2-nt 3′ overhang on a dsRNA and then cuts ∼20 nt away to generate a short RNA duplex (3Zhang H. Kolb F.A. Jaskiewicz L. Westhof E.

Rnt1p, a class 2 enzyme, shows the highest specificity, as it selects for a NGNN (N, any nucleotide) tetraloop and cleaves 14–16 bp into the stem of the flanking RNA hairpin (8Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Nagel R. Ares Jr., M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another class 2 enzyme, PacI, however, does not have such stringent requirements (10Lamontagne B. Abou Elela S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2231-2241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Notably, although the enzymes mentioned above show clearly distinct substrate specificities, they are all capable of processing a blunt-ended dsRNA substrate effectively in vitro. The class 3 RNase III Drosha forms a complex with a protein partner, termed DGCR8 in humans and Pasha in flies and worms, that catalyzes the cleavage of long primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to produce the ∼60-nt hairpin RNAs termed precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) (4Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar, 11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S.

Nature. 2004; 432: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Pre-miRNAs are further processed by Dicer to yield mature, ∼22-nt-long miRNAs. miRNAs are abundant, endogenous, noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in multicellular organisms (14Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29863) Google Scholar). Because Drosha produces pre-miRNAs that then serve as substrates for Dicer and because Dicer primarily uses the terminal structure of the pre-miRNA hairpin created by Drosha cleavage to determine where it will subsequently cut, pri-miRNA cleavage by Drosha imparts much of the specificity of miRNA processing in animal cells. It has been demonstrated that for a pri-miRNA to be efficiently processed by Drosha the targeted hairpin must consist of a large terminal loop of ≥10 nt and a stem region somewhat longer than the one present in the final pre-miRNA (11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar, 15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R.

In all of the previously reported experiments that analyzed Drosha activities in vitro and miRNA expression in transfected cells, the miRNA-containing hairpin was always embedded within a longer transcript and thus surrounded by extra RNA sequences derived either from its endogenous flanking genomic sequence or from the expression vector used (4Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar, 11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S.

Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). One of these studies shows that, when transcribed from an RNA polymerase III promoter in transfected cells, at least 40 nt of additional sequence on each side of a pre-miRNA structure is required for efficient miRNA production (18Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). Some of the flanking nucleotides likely formed the short stem extension beyond the pre-miRNA stem that is known to be essential for pri-miRNA processing (11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar, 15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R.

Y.). 2003; 9: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), but what role the rest of these extra sequences play remains unclear. Do they provide specific RNA sequences or structures that enhance processing, or does this simply represent a requirement for flanking single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)? Furthermore, little is known about how Drosha interacts with the various structural elements required for efficient pri-miRNA processing. To address these questions, we have analyzed how various flanking RNA sequences affect pri-miRNA hairpin recognition and cleavage by Drosha. Plasmid Construction—pGEX-4T-1-Drosha RBD encodes part of the Drosha protein extending from leucine 1254 to its C terminus and was made by amplifying the relevant DNA fragment with primers 5′-CTGGAATTCATGTTGAATCAGGATTGGAAT-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCGAGTTATTTCTTGATGTCTTCAGT-3′, digesting the PCR product with EcoRI and XhoI, and inserting it into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. pGEX-4T-1-Drosha R-rich encodes the sequence from proline 216 to leucine 333 of Drosha and was similarly made by PCR subcloning using primers 5′-GCGAATTCCCCAGTGAGAGAAGGTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGAGCTAATTCTGGTGTGCATCC-3′. pGEX-4T-1-DGCR8 2XRBD encodes a DGCR8 protein fragment extending from glutamic acid 502 to the C terminus and was made by amplifying a DNA fragment from a FLAG-DGCR8 expression plasmid (a gift of Dr. R. Shiekhattar) with primers 5′-GCGAATTCGAGTTTGTTATTAACCCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GAGGTCGACGTTAACTCACACGTCCACGGTGCACA-3′, digesting the DNA with EcoRI and SalI, and cloning into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. Preparation of Recombinant Drosha—Human 293T cells were transfected with pCK-Drosha-FLAG, which expresses C-terminally FLAG-tagged human Drosha (11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). Two days later, cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40) and mixed with anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for ∼1 h. Beads were washed four times with the same lysis buffer and once with reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol). Proteins were then eluted by incubating the beads with reaction buffer containing 150 ng/μl 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) at 4 °C for ∼30 min. Aliquoted supernatants were stored at –80 °C. Enzymatic Assays—Drosha processing experiments were performed in the reaction buffer mentioned above supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm MgCl2, and ∼0.5 unit/μl RNasin (Promega). Purified Drosha was mixed with ∼104 cpm (∼0.1 ng) of a 32P-labeled RNA substrate and incubated at 37 °C for 60–90 min. Reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× loading buffer (98% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated at 95 °C for ∼10 min, resolved on a 10% denaturing gel, and analyzed by autoradiography and/or on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). 5′-32P-Labeled ϕX174 HinfI DNA markers (Promega) were used as size standards. All RNA substrates were tested at least twice. DNA templates for RNA probes were prepared by PCR using T7 promoter-added primers. RNA probes were transcribed in vitro (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. For some of the probes, full-length RNAs were gel-isolated prior to use. To prepare the circular primary miR-31 substrate, the linear, labeled transcript was first synthesized as described above, dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science), purified, phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of ATP, and then treated with T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Products were separated on a 10% denaturing gel and RNAs isolated from gel slices. Partial alkaline hydrolysis of RNA was performed by incubating the RNA in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.0, along with 20 μg of yeast tRNA, at 95 °C for 6 min; the RNAs were then precipitated with ethanol. miRNA Expression from a Plasmid in Transfected Cells—DNA spanning the precursor miR-31 sequence was amplified from human genomic DNA (Clontech), digested with HindIII and XhoI, and then cloned into a modified pSuper vector (15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The constructs were then co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a control short hairpin RNA, specific for green fluorescent protein, into 293T cells; RNA was isolated 2 days later and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 16Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). RNA Binding to Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Proteins—A DNA template for ssRNA substrate transcription was prepared by PCR amplification of a 43-bp multiple cloning site fragment derived from pCMV (17Zeng Y. Wagner E.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1327-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The DNA template for precursor miR-30a transcription was prepared by annealing and extending the two oligonucleotides 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTAAACATCCTCGACTGGAAGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCAAACATCCGACTGAAAGCCCATCTGTGGCTTCACAGCTTC CAGTCGAGG-3′ (the putative precursor miR-30a loop region is underlined). The DNA template for precursor miR-30a L5 transcription was prepared by annealing and extending the two oligonucleotides 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTAAACATCCTCGACTGGAAGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGCAAACATCCGACTGAAGCCAGATTAGCTTCCAGTCGAGG-3′ (the putative loop region is underlined). The DNA template for precursor miR-30 L5+10 transcription was prepared by the same procedure using the two oligonucleotides 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTAAACATCCTCGACTGGAAGCT-3′ and 5′-ACCACCTAACGCGGCAAACATCCGACTGAAAGCCAGATTAGCTTCCAGTCGAGG-3′ (the putative loop region is underlined, and the 10 nt 3′ extension is italicized). Other DNA templates and RNA probes were synthesized as described above. For protein purification, DH5α cells transformed with pGEX-4T-1 or one of its derivatives was induced and lysed, and GST proteins were bound to glutathione beads (Amersham) as described previously (19Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The beads were washed three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 m LiCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by one wash with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100); and the beads were then incubated with ∼90 μl of binding buffer containing 40 units of RNasin, 10 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and various 32P-labeled RNA substrates (∼104 cpm of each) at 4 °C for ∼25 min. Beads were afterward washed four times with binding buffer. RNA was then eluted with 100 μl of 1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, and 30 μg of yeast tRNA, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Bound RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. In a parallel experiment, proteins bound to glutathione beads were analyzed directly by electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining to confirm that the relevant proteins were indeed purified. All of the experiments were performed at least two times with identical results. Drosha-mediated Cleavage of pri-miRNAs in Vitro Requires Flanking ssRNA—We prepared FLAG epitope-tagged Drosha enzyme by transfecting human 293T cells with the plasmid pCK-Drosha-FLAG (11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar), purifying proteins with FLAG-agarose, and then eluting the immunoprecipitate with 3× FLAG peptide. The immunoprecipitate contained Drosha-FLAG and presumably also endogenous DGCR8 (4Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). For RNA substrates, we prepared transcripts encoding three human miRNAs, miR-31, miR-223, and miR-30a (miR-30 for short). 32P-Labeled RNA substrates, including various flanking sequences beyond the precursor miRNA hairpin, were mixed with the Drosha immunoprecipitate and tested for the generation of the ∼60-nt pre-miRNA intermediate (marked by asterisks in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Figs. 1, 2, 3 list all of the natural or near natural pri-miRNA variants tested along with their predicted secondary structures and also show some of the representative autoradiographs. RNA substrates were named according to the numbers of extra nucleotides 5′ and 3′ to the predicted pre-miRNA cleavage product, e.g. miR-31(13+16) denotes a miR-31 variant with 13 nt flanking the 5′ end and 16 nt flanking the 3′ end of the predicted precursor miR-31 hairpin (Fig. 1). The RNA located outside of a pre-miRNA hairpin can be tentatively demarcated into two distinct components: one is the essential stem extension located immediately adjacent to the pre-miRNA hairpin, and the other is the extra RNA at the ends that presumably forms ssRNA extensions. Importantly, we found that these predicted ssRNA flanking sequences greatly facilitated Drosha cleavage.Fig. 2Drosha processing of miR-223 transcripts in vitro.

The hairpin symbol represents premiRNA. Three RNA substrates, i.e. 13+16, 7+5, and (6)+7+5+(11) (substrates a, b, and c) were subjected to in vitro processing by Drosha, as shown on the right. Size of DNA markers is shown to the left of the autoradiograph, and the asterisk indicates the pre-miRNA band. B, the native primary miR-223 (24+21) overhangs were likewise replaced to make (8)+16+15+(6). Labels are the same as in A. Cleavage percentage was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the pre-miRNA band (marked by an asterisk) divided by that of the remaining full-length substrate and corrected for cytosine contents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Size requirement for the 3′ overhang of the primary miR-223 transcript. Six RNA substrates (a–f) containing a 6-nt natural 3′ overhang, no overhang, 6, 9, or 3 nt of an arbitrary 3′ ssRNA overhang (underlined), or extensions at both the 5′ and 3′ sides were examined for Drosha processing in vitro.

Cleavage efficiencies were calculated and labeled the same as in Fig. 4B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 presents the results using primary miR-31 variants. The miR-31(13+16) substrate was processed efficiently by Drosha, generating largely precursor miR-31 (Fig. 1, lane 2) and very few processing intermediates (indicated by arrowheads). Judged from their characteristic sizes, these intermediates were RNAs cut by Drosha at the authentic 5′ or 3′ cleavage site but not at both. Such products have been reported previously (4Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). These singly cut RNAs likely represent dead-end products in vitro because they lack an essential feature required for de novo processing (i.e. a stem extension beyond the Drosha cleavage sites; see below). When isolated from gels and treated with Drosha again, they were indeed totally resistant to cleavage (data not shown). Eliminating part of the 5′ flanking ssRNA, as in miR-31(7+16), led to the accumulation of singly cut intermediates (Fig. 1, lane 6). Further deletion of part of the 3′ ssRNA extension, as in miR-31(7+10) or miR-31(7+7), led to a further reduction in precursor miR-31 production (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). When deletions were made even closer to the precursor miR-31 region, e.g. in miR-31(4+10) or (4+7), Drosha processing became undetectable (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). Very similar results were also obtained for miR-223 (Fig. 2) and miR-30 (Fig. 3). For example, compared with miR-223(29+21), the 3′ ssRNA-shortened substrates miR-223(29+15) and miR-223(29+12) were much less efficiently cleaved by Drosha in vitro. Blunt-ended RNA hairpins, such as miR-31(7+5) (Fig. 1), miR-223(16+15) (Figs. 2 and 5, and see below), and miR-30(11+9) (Fig. 3, lane 2), were cleaved very poorly or not at all. In general, the longer the native flanking sequence the miRNA retained on both sides, the better substrate the RNA was for Drosha processing in vitro. However, flanking ssRNA at the 3′ end did appear to be more critical than the one at the 5′ end. Thus, miR-223(16+21) was a better Drosha substrate than miR-223(24+15), although neither was as good as miR-223(24+21) (Fig. 2). Finally, and consistent with previous reports (11Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (4026) Google Scholar, 15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 16Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), a stem extension beyond the pre-miRNA hairpin, within the longer pri-miRNA, was always essential, although the exact length requirement varied among the three miRNAs tested. miR-223 apparently requires the longest extension, as miR-223(13+30) and miR-223(13+21) were hardly processed by Drosha (Fig. 2). In contrast, miR-31(7+16) and miR-31(7+10) were still reasonable Drosha substrates (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7), whereas further shortening of the stem extension to make miR-31(4+10) or miR-31(4+7) abolished cleavage (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). Flanking ssRNA Sequences Function in a Largely Sequence-independent Manner in Vitro—Figs. 1, 2, 3 show secondary structure predictions for miRNA hairpins based on MFOLD. The actual RNA folding details at the top of the hairpin and at the base of the stem and the conformations of the flanking RNAs might be dynamic and/or different from the RNA structures proposed here. For example, some residues from the 5′ ssRNA extension could potentially form hydrogen bonds with those from the 3′ side. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that Drosha preferred flanking RNA sequences that did not fold into a helical conformation. We performed several experiments to test this idea, and these results are shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6. In Fig. 4A, when the predicted 6-nt 5′ ssRNA extension and 11-nt 3′ extension in the natural but truncated miR-31(13+16) substrate were replaced by arbitrary sequences, the new RNA, called (6)+7+5+(11), was still effectively cleaved by Drosha in vitro (compare lane 2 and lane 6). miR-223 is another example (Fig. 4B). Here, the artificial (8)+16+15+(6) variant was cleaved at an efficiency close to that of the natural miR-223(24+21) substrate. To examine flanking sequence requirements in more detail, we turned to miR-223(16+21) (Fig. 5). This RNA is predicted to form a simple structure containing a 6-nt 3′ ssRNA overhang, and in vitro processing by Drosha was weaker than seen with miR-223(24+21) but still readily detectable (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lane 12). Deleting the 6-nt 3′ overhang eliminated detectable Drosha processing (Fig. 5, lane 4), which was rescued by adding back 6 nt (lane 6) or 9 nt (lane 8) but not 3 nt (lane 10) of an arbitrary ssRNA sequence. This rescue was not simply due to larger RNA size because introducing a 6-nt 5′ extension that is predicted to form a 6-bp stem with the arbitrary 6-nt 3′ extension abolished processing (data not shown). Furthermore, when an artificial hairpin was appended to the 6-nt 3′ extension to make 16+15+(6+D), the new RNA was processed less efficiently than the parental 16+15+(6) RNA (Fig. 6, compare lane 4 with lane 2), whereas an identically sized RNA substrate lacking the predicted hairpin structure, 16+15+(6+S), was processed more efficiently (Fig. 6, lane 6). From these results, we concluded that flanking ssRNA sequences strongly enhance Drosha cleavage of pri-miRNA hairpins but that the particular sequence of the ssRNA extensions was not critical as long as the flanking ssRNA sequences were of sufficient length (>3 nt) and adopted a largely single-stranded structure. Free RNA Ends Are Not Required for Drosha Processing—If Drosha first recognizes an unpaired 5′ end and/or 3′ end and then scans along the RNA for a suitable stem-loop structure, such a mechanism could explain why a ssRNA extension is required. To test this scenario, we chose a primary miR-31 substrate that was larger than the ones examined above and contained an ∼85-nt sequence flanking each side of the mature precursor miR-31. The linear RNA was a good substrate for Drosha processing in vitro (Fig. 7B, lane 2) and was properly processed when transcribed in transfected cells (15Zeng Y. Yi R. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We prepared its closed, circular version as described under ‘Materials and Methods‘(Fig. 7A, lane 2). The identity of the circular RNA was confirmed by partial alkaline hydrolysis as this treatment collapsed it to a position corresponding to the linear RNA and yielded a smear below it (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 3 and 6). Drosha cleaved this circular RNA efficiently to generate precursor miR-31 and the predicted single by-product (Fig. 7B, lane 5). Thus, free RNA ends are not necessary for Drosha processing of pri-miRNA hairpins in vitro. miRNA Expression in Cells Requires ssRNA Sequences Flanking the pri-miRNA Hairpin—We next asked whether RNA variants that were good substrates for Drosha cleavage in vitro were also good substrates for processing to a"

The functional similarity between the NS2B/NS3 proteases from the four genetically and antigenically distinct serotypes was addressed by characterizing the differences in their substrate specificity using tetrapeptide and octapeptide libraries in a positional scanning format, each containing 130,321 substrates. The proteases from different serotypes were shown to be functionally homologous based on the similarity of their substrate cleavage preferences. A strong preference for basic amino acid residues (Arg/Lys) at the P1 positions was observed, whereas the preferences for the P2-4 sites were in the order of Arg > Thr > Gln/Asn/Lys for P2, Lys > Arg > Asn for P3, and Nle > Leu > Lys > Xaa for P4. The prime site substrate specificity was for small and polar amino acids in P1′ and P3′. In contrast, the P2′ and P4′ substrate positions showed minimal activity. The influence of the P2 and P3 amino acids on ground state binding and the P4 position for transition state stabilization was identified through single substrate kinetics with optimal and suboptimal substrate sequences. The specificities observed for dengue NS2B/NS3 have features in common with the physiological cleavage sites in the dengue polyprotein; however, all sites reveal previously unrecognized suboptimal sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2062280374,"The recent discovery of a hyper-metal-poor (HMP) star, with a metallicity Fe/H smaller than 1/100,000 of the solar ratio, together with one earlier HMP star, has raised a challenging question whether these HMP stars are the actual first-generation, low-mass stars of the universe. We argue that these HMP stars are second-generation stars formed from gases that were chemically enriched by the first-generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars and the similarities and differences between them. We can reproduce these abundance features with core-collapse ""faint"" supernova models that include extensive matter mixing and fallback during explosions."

The BMP-7 prodomain and BMP-7 complex, but not the separated growth factor dimer, interact with N-terminal regions of fibrillin-1. This interaction may target the BMP-7 complex to fibrillin microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. Immunolocalization of BMP-7 in tissues like the kidney capsule and skin reveals co-localization with fibrillin. However, BMP-7 immunolocalization in other tissues known to be active sites for BMP-7 signaling is not apparent, suggesting that immunolocalization of BMP-7 in certain tissues represents specific extracellular storage sites. These studies suggest that the prodomains of TGFβ-like growth factors are important for positioning and concentrating growth factors in the extracellular matrix. In addition, they raise the possibility that prodomains of other TGFβ-like growth factors interact with fibrillins and/or LTBPs and are also targeted to the extracellular matrix.

BMP-7 (bone morphogenetic protein-7), also known as OP-1 (osteogenic protein-1), is a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; LAP, latency associated peptide; LTBP, latent TGFβ-binding protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; rF, recombinant fibrillin; rL, recombinant LTBP-1. superfamily. Ectopic bone formation can be induced by either purified preparations of authentic BMP-7 from bovine bone (1Sampath T.K. Coughlin J.E. Whetstone R.M. Banach D. Corbett C. Ridge R.J. Ozkaynak E.

However, the role of BMP-7 in developing tissues is not restricted to bone formation. BMP-7 is widely expressed during development, performing functions in skeletal muscle, nerves, blood vessels, cartilage, and perichondrium (3Lyons K.M. Hogan B.L. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1995; 50: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments in mice have demonstrated that BMP-7 is crucial for normal development of the kidney, eye, and autopod (4Dudley A.T. Lyons K.M. Robertson E.J.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Members of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors share amino acid sequence similarities in the C-terminal active growth factor domains of these proteins. Crystal structures of these domains from TGFβ (6Schlunegger M.P. Grutter M.G. Nature. 1992; 358: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and BMP-7 (7Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) demonstrated the structural similarities between these growth factors and predicted structural similarities between other superfamily members. However, less is known about the structure and function of the prodomains of TGFβ superfamily members. The prototype member of the superfamily, TGFβ, is synthesized as a molecule containing a large N-terminal prodomain and a C-terminal growth factor domain. During the secretory process, two growth factor domains fold into a disulfide-linked dimer. Subsequently, proteolytic processing occurs at a furin-type consensus sequence. However, the cleaved propeptides remain noncovalently associated with the growth factor dimer and confer latency to the growth factor (8Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M. Ranchalis J.E.

The secreted complex containing the active growth factor dimer noncovalently associated with its cleaved propeptides is called the small latent complex. Significant structural rearrangements have been shown to occur when the prodomain (called β1-latency associated peptide or β1-LAP) complexes with TGFβ (11McMahon G.A. Dignam J.D. Gentry L.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-Mc-Court M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, latency may result either from LAP blocking the interaction of TGFβ with its receptors or from LAP inducing a conformational change in TGFβ such that it no longer interacts with its receptors (12De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. Zwaagstra J. Tsang M. O'Connor-Mc-Court M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29632-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, β1-LAP is disulfide-linked to a much larger binding protein, which does not itself confer latency to TGFβ (13Kanzaki T. Olofsson A. Moren A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Miyazono K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This large protein, called LTBP-1 (latent TGFβ-binding protein-1), facilitates the secretion of the small latent complex (14Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and it targets the small latent complex to the extracellular matrix (15Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A specific modular domain with eight cysteine residues (8-Cys domain) in LTBP-1 becomes disulfide-bonded to β1-LAP during the secretory process (16Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Gleizes P.E. Beavis R.C. Mazzieri R. Shen B. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This complex of LTBP-1·β1-LAP·TGFβ is called the large latent complex. In contrast to the homologies identified between the active growth factor domains, the N-terminal prodomains of TGFβ superfamily members appear to be dissimilar. Some of these regions, like the prodomain of TGFβ, contain cysteine residues, whereas others, like the BMP-7 prodomain, are devoid of cysteines. It is not known whether the BMP-7 prodomain functions like TGFβ1-LAP. In the studies reported here, we provide extensive biochemical characterization of the BMP-7 complex, comparing it with TGFβ. Furthermore, we investigate whether the prodomain of BMP-7 interacts with fibrillin-1, a protein highly homologous to LTBP-1, and whether the prodomain targets the BMP-7 complex to extracellular fibrillin microfibrils. Production of Recombinant BMP-7—cDNA encoding human BMP-7 (GenBank™ accession NM_001719) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA from the osteosarcoma cell line MG63 (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The 5′ primer introduced an NheI restriction site and 6 histidine residues in tandem, whereas a 3′ NotI site was added to the downstream primer. The cDNA was cloned into NheI/NotI-digested pCEP-SP vector (19Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which was then digested with HindIII and NotI. This fragment was cloned into an HindIII/NotI pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) so that the final construct contained the BM40 signal peptide derived from the pCEP-SP vector, a 6-histidine tag, and the entire human BMP-7 coding sequence starting from the predicted endogenous signal peptide cleavage site. The BMP-7-pcDNA3.1(+) vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. After 2 days, cells were selected by addition of the antibiotic G418 (500 μg/ml) to the culture medium, DMEM, with 10% fetal calf serum. Resistant clones were picked and analyzed for protein expression. The proteins present in 1 ml of serum-free medium were precipitated by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.1% Triton X-100 and analyzed using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for the His tag and for the BMP-7 growth factor domain (both from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used to identify recombinant BMP-7. Clones expressing substantial amounts of BMP-7 were identified using Coomassie Blue-stained gels. These highly expressing cell lines were then expanded to triple-layer flasks for serum-free medium collection. Purification of BMP-7—N-terminal histidine-tagged BMP-7 was purified from serum-free medium by chelating chromatography followed by molecular sieve chromatography. Two liters of serum-free media were concentrated to 50 ml using an Amicon concentrator with a YM-10 membrane, dialyzed against 1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and applied to a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with 0.2 m cobalt chloride. The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and absorbance was continuously monitored at 280 nm. Bound material was eluted with 0.25 m imidazole in the phosphate buffer. BMP-7 containing fractions from the chelating column were concentrated (Centriplus-10, Amicon, Billerica, MA) and applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue, and those containing BMP-7 were pooled and concentrated to <0.25 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Samples were gas phase-hydrolyzed using 300 μl of 6 n HCl, 2% phenol at 110 °C for 22 h, and the hydrolysates were analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer using sodium citrate buffers. In some cases, concentrations were estimated using the micro BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Determination of Molecular Mass by Laser Light Scattering—To determine precisely the molecular weight of the BMP-7 complex, quasielastic laser light scattering was measured (Dawn Eos, Wyatt Technology Corp.) as recombinant BMP-7 was chromatographed using a Superose 12 gel filtration column. The intensity of scattered light was simultaneously detected at 18 different angles. The molecular weight of the sample was then calculated using the Astra software provided with the instrument. Pulse-Chase Analysis of BMP-7—1 × 107 293 cells, stably transfected with BMP-7, were seeded in 100-mm plates and grown for 2 days to reach confluency. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 6 ml of cysteine/methionine-free DMEM containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]Cys/Met cell labeling mixture (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) was added to each plate. Following 1 h of labeling, the medium was removed (time point = 0); the cell layer was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and non-radioactive DMEM was added. The medium was harvested at 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after labeling, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. One ml of medium was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to autoradiograph film at -80 °C. Rotary Shadowing and Electron Microscopy—Purified BMP-7 complex (100 μg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.2 m NH4HCO3 or 0.1 m acetic acid. The isolated growth factor and propeptide domains (∼100 μg/ml each) were dialyzed against 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Each sample was diluted to 70% glycerol, then sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and rotary-shadowed with Pt-C using a Balzers BAE 250 vacuum evaporator. Photomicrographs were taken using a Philips EM410 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The circumference of the molecules was measured from photomicrographs, enlarged 150,000 times, using a digitizing tablet and quantitated using Bioquant imaging software. Circular Dichroism Analyses—Purified samples of the BMP-7 prodomain, the growth factor dimer, and the prodomain-growth factor complex (0.5-1.0 mg/ml) were dialyzed extensively against 5 mm HClO4. The concentration of each sample was determined in triplicate by amino acid analysis. Each sample was analyzed in the far-UV range (260-180 nm) at 24 °C by a Jasco J-500 spectropolarimeter interfaced to a computer, using a quartz cell with a path length of 100 μm. Spectra were smoothed, and buffer base lines were subtracted. The secondary structure was estimated using the variable selection method with an initial set of 33 basis spectra. To estimate the secondary structure of the prodomain when it is associated with the growth factor domain, the difference between the normalized spectra of the prodomain/growth factor complex and the growth factor (GF) dimer was obtained, using a calculation that accounted for the different number of amino acids (aa): prodomain = (complex × 412 aa - GF × 139 aa)/273 aa. This difference spectrum of the prodomain in the complex was then solved and compared with the spectrum of the separated propeptide. Production and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies to BMP-7—BALB/cJ mice were immunized with purified BMP-7 complex, and monoclonal antibodies were generated as we have described previously (20Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Medium from hybridomas was screened by ELISA, using either the separated prodomain or growth factor domain of BMP-7 as the coated substrate (5 μg/ml). Selected hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and then expanded and grown in DMEM containing IgG-free fetal calf serum. Antibodies were purified and concentrated by protein-G affinity chromatography. Two monoclonal antibodies, mAb 2 and mAb 33, were generated that were specific for the prodomain, and one, mAb 6, was specific for the growth factor domain. To test whether mAb 6 cross-reacted with other BMPs, 1 μg/ml recombinant BMP-2, -4, -5, -6, and -7 (R & D Systems) was coated onto ELISA plates, and titered concentrations of mAb 6 were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected using a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, visualized after addition of substrate (100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) to each well. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on an Emax® microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). ELISA Binding Assays—Recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides rF11, rF6, rF23, rF31, rF18 and rF45 and recombinant LTBP-1 polypeptides rL1-N, rL1-M, and rL1-C were used as soluble ligands. These polypeptides have been characterized previously (19Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol.

BMP-7 complex, separated propeptide chains, or separated growth factor dimers were used to coat ELISA wells. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. ELISA wells were coated with BMP-7 peptides or bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 0.1 or 0.2 μm and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed (three times for 5 min) with TBS/Tween 20 (0.25%) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS for at least 2 h. After washing, the soluble ligands of fibrillin-1 or LTBP-1 peptides (titrated in a buffer of 2% milk in TBS) were added at the indicated concentrations and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed again. Primary antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb 15, 26, and 201; anti-His (R & D Systems)) were diluted to 5 or 10 μg/ml, and rabbit polyclonal sera (pAb 9543, pAb 39, and pAb 6164) were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000-2000 in buffer. After washing, secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase (Sigma) were added at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After final washes, the peroxidase substrate, tetramethylbenzidine, was added, and absorbance was read at 450 nm on an Emax® microplate reader. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (23Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2740-2749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For double labeling experiments, mAb 6 or mAb 2 (1:100 dilutions of a 1 mg/ml solution) was incubated first on sections for 3 h at room temperature, followed by a 2-h incubation of pAb 9543 or pAb 8162. Secondary antibodies (Alexa488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa546 goat anti-rabbit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:250 and applied together for 1 h. Sections were coverslipped with Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting medium (Alexa) and viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with Axiovision software. Recombinant Expression of Human BMP-7—Full-length human BMP-7 was recombinantly expressed in human 293 cells. The expression construct consisted of the BM-40 signal peptide, a 6-histidine tag, and the coding sequence of BMP-7 3′ to the predicted signal cleavage site (Fig. 1A). Recombinant BMP-7 was secreted into the medium, and high expression of the recombinant protein was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of serum-free medium proteins (Fig. 1B). Bands were clearly present in the medium of BMP-7 transfected cells that corresponded to the predicted electrophoretic mobilities of the prodomain (∼31,600 Da in samples both with and without disulfide bond reducing agent) and the processed growth factor dimer (∼31,400 Da without reducing agent; ∼15,700 Da with reducing agent). N-terminal sequencing of the growth factor band confirmed that processing had occurred at the RXXR furin consensus cleavage site. Potent growth factor activity of recombinant BMP-7 was confirmed using a cell differentiation assay (induction of alkaline phosphatase in ATDC5 cells) (24Nakamura K. Shirai T. Morishita S. Uchida S. Saeki-Miura K. Makishima F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Purification and Stability of the BMP-7 Complex—6-Histidine-tagged recombinant BMP-7 was purified from serum-free medium by cobalt chelating chromatography. Aliquots of the starting sample, flow-through, and elution fractions were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining. As expected, histidine-tagged propeptides bound to the chelating column and were eluted. Co-elution of the untagged processed growth factor dimer with the tagged propeptide suggested a noncovalent association of prodomain and processed growth factor. Molecular sieve chromatography was used to purify further the recombinant BMP-7. Representative fractions from these purification steps are shown in Fig. 1C. Free propeptide chains or free growth factor molecules were not detected by Western blotting at any stage during the purification. Approximately 0.5 mg of BMP-7 complex was purified from 1 liter of serum-free medium. To determine the molecular mass of the purified recombinant BMP-7, molecular sieve chromatography in combination with laser light scattering was used (Fig. 2). The mass of the eluting BMP-7 was 95,000 Da (±6,500 Da). The predicted molecular mass of a complex composed of two propeptides and a growth factor dimer is ∼94,600 Da. There are four sites of potential N-linked glycosylation, and one of these (N372) has been shown to be glycosylated, contributing between 3,000 and 9,000 Da to the total molecular mass of the processed growth factor dimer (2Sampath T.K. Maliakal J.C. Hauschka P.V. Jones W.K. Sasak H. Tucker R.F. White K.H. Coughlin J.E. Tucker M.M. Pang R.H. Corbett C. Ozkaynak E. Oppermann H. Rueger D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20352-20362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, equilibrium ultracentrifugation was used to determine the molecular weight of the recombinant BMP-7. Results yielded an average molecular mass of 89,500 Da ± 5,000 Da (data not shown). Based on co-elution during chelating chromatography and calculation of molecular mass by laser light scattering and by equilibrium ultracentrifugation, we concluded that recombinant BMP-7 forms a complex consisting of two propeptides noncovalently associated with a processed growth factor dimer. A pulse-chase assay was performed in order to investigate the stability of the recombinant BMP-7 complex (Fig. 3). BMP-7 transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine-methionine for 1 h and then chased for periods of time up to 24 h with non-radioactive medium. The BMP-7 growth factor domain contains 7 cysteines and 3 methionines, whereas the prodomain contains 7 methionines and no cysteine residues. By 2 h of chase, pulse-labeled BMP-7 was fully secreted. The apparent total amounts and relative ratio of prodomain to growth factor domain between 2 and 24 h of chase remained constant, indicating that the BMP-7 complex is stable over this time period. A band corresponding to the full-length unprocessed monomer was maximally secreted by 2 h and then was either degraded or processed extracellularly. Dissociation of the BMP-7 Complex—Complete dissociation of the BMP-7 complex was accomplished using phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 8 m urea, and 20 mm octylglucopyranoside (Fig. 4). When BMP-7 complex was applied to a chelating column in this buffer, the processed growth factor dimer was present in the unbound flow-through fractions (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5), whereas the histidine-tagged propeptide chains were bound to the column (lane 3). Unprocessed BMP-7 monomers containing the histidine tag were also bound to the column (Fig. 4, lane 6). When either 8 m urea in chelating column buffer or 20 mm octylglucopyranoside in column buffer was used separately, small amounts of growth factor were still detected in the bound material by Western blotting (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). Approximately 200 μg of separated propeptide chains and 100 μg of processed growth factor dimer were obtained from 1 liter of serum-free medium. Treatment with acidic pH also dissociated the BMP-7 complex. Samples of purified BMP-7 were dialyzed into 0.2 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, or 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 2.5, and then analyzed by rotary shadowing electron microscopy. In ammonium bicarbonate, the BMP-7 complex was visualized as a globular structure with a mean circumference of ∼46 nm (Fig. 5A). The BMP-7 complex treated with acetic acid revealed globules with a significantly smaller mean circumference of ∼37 nm (Fig. 5B). In addition, the distribution of measurements of the complex treated with acid was more heterogeneous (Fig. 5B) than the distribution of measurements of the complex in ammonium bicarbonate (Fig. 5A). Further comparison of the distribution of measurements of the complex treated with acid with measurements obtained from rotary-shadowed images of the separated growth factor dimer (mean circumference ∼ 28 nm, Fig. 5C) and separated propeptide chains (mean circumference ∼ 34 nm, Fig. 5D) suggested that in acetic acid the BMP-7 complex was dissociated into its constituent components. However, these results cannot exclude a conformational change of an associated complex in acid. The distributions of measurements of the rotary-shadowed BMP-7 complex (Fig. 5A) and of the separated growth factor (Fig. 5C) were predominantly unimodal. In contrast, the rotary-shadowing data for the separated propeptide chains revealed a more heterogeneous distribution of sizes (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the dissociation of the propeptide chains from the growth factor dimer results in conformational changes in the propeptide. Therefore, secondary structures of the BMP-7 complex, the separated propeptide chains, and the separated growth factor dimer were determined by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 6 and Table I).Table IPercent secondary structure of BMP-7 complex, propeptide, and growth factor dimerSample nameα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnOtherBMP7 complex18311931Propeptide21312028Propeptide (calculated)20351729Growth factor12292237Growth factoraData were recalculated from the crystal structure for 139 residues, Protein Data Bank code 1bmp (7).1431a Data were recalculated from the crystal structure for 139 residues, Protein Data Bank code 1bmp (7Griffith D.L.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of spectra by the variable selection method indicated that the BMP-7 complex contained 18% α-helix, 31% β-sheet, 19% β-turn, and 31% “other” structure. The separated growth factor contained 12% α-helix, 29% β-sheet, 22% β-turn, and 37% “other” structure, a composition of primarily β-structure. When the percentages of helix and β-strand found by x-ray crystallography (7Griffith D.L. Keck P.C. Sampath T.K. Rueger D.C. Carlson W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were recalculated for 139 residues (the full-length of the processed growth factor), the values were very similar to those obtained by CD spectroscopy (Table I). The propeptide contained 21% α-helix, 31% β-sheet, 20% β-turn, and 28% other structure. The secondary structure of the propeptide domain as a component of the complex was also determined theoretically by subtracting the normalized spectra for the growth factor from that of the complex (Fig. 6B). The difference spectra showed an increase in the amount of β-sheet (from 31 to 35%) and a decrease in β-turn structure (from 20 to 17%) (Table I). All together, these data suggest that the propeptide chain undergoes a conformational change when the BMP-7 complex is dissociated. The BMP-7 Prodomain Targets BMP-7 to Fibrillin Microfibrils—In order to determine whether the BMP-7 complex is targeted to the extracellular matrix through interactions between the prodomain and extracellular matrix components, we tested whether BMP-7 binds to fibrillins and/or LTBP by using ELISA binding assays. Recombinant fibrillin-1 and LTBP-1 polypeptides used in these assays are depicted in Fig. 7A. A specific region of fibrillin-1, contained in the recombinant N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (rF11), was found to bind to the BMP-7 complex and to the separated propeptide chains but not to the separated growth factor dimer (Fig. 7B). In these assays, the recombinant C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (rF6) as well as smaller recombinant peptides like rF31 did not bind to BMP-7 (Fig. 7C and data not shown). When subdomains of rF11 were tested, rF23 and rF18 interacted with BMP-7 propeptide chains but not with the same high affinity displayed by rF11 (Fig. 7C). LTBP-1 recombinant peptides spanning the whole molecule were tested, and these did not"

https://openalex.org/W2038793921,"Brown dwarfs are intermediate in mass between normal stars and planets. Their mass is so low (less than 70 Jupiter masses) that a brown dwarf's core is too cool to ignite hydrogen, hence they are sometimes called ‘failed stars’. The birth of a normal star is accompanied by both accretion and expulsion of matter. There is growing evidence for small accretion disks around brown dwarfs, so the question arises: do brown dwarfs have outflows too? Whelan et al. show that they do, and that their outflows are miniature versions of those produced by T Tauri stars (precursors to stars like the Sun). This suggests that the outflow phenomenon is universal: it accompanies not only the formation of stars and brown dwarfs but perhaps even planets. The birth of stars involves not only accretion but also, counter-intuitively, the expulsion of matter in the form of highly supersonic outflows1,2. Although this phenomenon has been seen in young stars, a fundamental question is whether it also occurs among newborn brown dwarfs: these are the so-called ‘failed stars’, with masses between stars and planets, that never manage to reach temperatures high enough for normal hydrogen fusion to occur3. Recently, evidence for accretion in young brown dwarfs has mounted4,5,6, and their spectra show lines that are suggestive of outflows7,8,9. Here we report spectro-astrometric data that spatially resolve an outflow from a brown dwarf. The outflow's characteristics appear similar to, but on a smaller scale than, outflows from normal young stars. This result suggests that the outflow mechanism is universal, and perhaps relevant even to the formation of planets."
https://openalex.org/W2029957965,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a metallophosphoesterase participating in osteoclast-mediated bone turnover. Activation of TRAP is associated with the redox state of the di-iron metal center as well as with limited proteolytic cleavage in an exposed loop domain. The cysteine proteinases cathepsin B, L, K, and S as well as the matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, -13, and -14 are expressed by osteoclasts and/or other bone cells and have been implicated in the turnover of bone and cartilage. To identify proteases that could act as activators of TRAP in bone, we report here that cathepsins K and L, in contrast to the matrix metalloproteinases, efficiently cleaved and activated recombinant TRAP in vitro. Activation of TRAP by cathepsin K/L was because of increases in catalytic activity, substrate affinity, and sensitivity to reductants. Processing by cathepsin K occurred sequentially by an initial excision of the loop peptide Gly143–Gly160 followed by the removal of a Val161–Ala162 dipeptide at the N terminus of the C-terminal 16-kDa TRAP subunit. Cathepsin L initially released a shorter Gln151–Gly160 peptide and completed processing at Ser145 or Gly143 at the C terminus of the N-terminal 23-kDa TRAP subunit and at Arg163 at the N terminus of the C-terminal 16-kDa TRAP subunit. Mutation of Ser145 to Ala partly mimicked the effect of proteolysis on catalytic activity, identifying Ser145 as well as Asp146 (Funhoff, E. G., Ljusberg, J., Wang, Y., Andersson, G., and Averill, B. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 11614–11622) as repressive amino acids of the loop region to maintain the TRAP enzyme in a catalytically latent state. The C-terminal sequence of TRAP isolated from rat bone was consistent with cathepsin K-mediated processing in vivo. Moreover, cathepsin K, but not cathepsin L, co-localized with TRAP in osteoclast-resorptive compartments, supporting a role for cathepsin K in the extracellular processing of monomeric TRAP in the resorption lacuna.

In order to better understand the structural basis for proteolytic activation of mammalian PAPs, we also aimed to define the proteolytic cleavage sites for cathepsin L and K in the repressive loop domain. Finally, the in situ distribution of the cathepsins K and L was compared with that of TRAP in osteoclasts and resorptive subcompartments to address the potential physiological relevance of the in vitro observations. Proteases were supplied from the following sources: cathepsin L (human liver) and cathepsin S from Calbiochem; cathepsin B and MMP-2 from Anawa Trading SA, (Wangen/Zurich, Switzerland); MMP-9l, Roche Applied Science; MMP-13 and MMP-14, Invitek (Berlin, Germany).

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using 5′–3′ MORPH site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Primer used for specific mutation of S145A was 5′-GCTGTGTGGCAATGCAGACGACTTTGTCAG-3′, for Q151A was 5′-GACGACTTTGTCAGCGCGCAGCCTGAAATGCCC-3′, and for Q152A was 5′-GACTTTGTCAGCCAGGCGCCTGAAATGCCCCGAG-3′. The underlined bases indicate changes compared with the wild-type sequence. The primer employed for mutagenesis was phosphorylated by T4 kinase according to the manufacturer's instruction. The recTRAP cDNA mutants were verified by DNA sequence analyses (Cybergene AB, Novum Research Park, Huddinge, Sweden). Construction of Baculovirus Expression Vectors and Recombinant Baculovirus—Wild-type or mutant rat TRAP cDNAs were cloned into baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC1 using the EcoRI site in the donor plasmid. The correct orientation was determined by PstI cleavage and further confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pFASTBAC1 donor vectors containing wild-type or mutant TRAPs were transformed into DH10Bac cells for homologous recombination with bacmid. Recombinant bacmids were selected on Luria agar plates containing antibiotics (50 μg/ml kanamycin, 7 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline), 100 μg/ml Bluo-gel (halogenated indolyl-β-galactoside), and 40 μg/ml isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and confirmed by PCR. Virus Amplification—Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were cultured in SF900 II SFM medium and transfected with purified bacmids using the transfection reagent Cellfectin (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were kept and incubated at 27 °C for 3 days. The medium, which constitutes the scale up-1 virus stock, was harvested and stored at 4 °C. This scale up-1 virus stock was used to infect a 25-cm2 flask seeded with 1 × 106 cells, and the culture was incubated at 27 °C for 5 days. The supernatant constitutes the scale up-2. The recombinant virus stock scale up-2 was amplified once more by infection of 100 ml of Sf9 cells seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml with 3 ml of scale up-2, and after 5 days, high titer virus stock (108 pfu/ml) was harvested. The high titer stock virus was used in protein production. Protein Expression and Purification—Purification of rat bone TRAP and recTRAP expression in Sf9 cells, purification, and protein determination were carried out as described previously (55.Wang Y.

Small Scale Proteolytic Cleavage of TRAP—Proteolytic activation of TRAP was performed with the following proteases and incubation conditions: cathepsin K, L, and B and recTRAP, 7 ng/μl, 4 mol of protease/mol of TRAP, 50 mm NaAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5, 2 mm DTT; cathepsin S, recTRAP, 7 ng/μl, 4 mol of cathepsin S/mol of TRAP, 50 mm NaAc, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.5, 2 mm DTT. All proteases were prereduced in 2 mm DTT for 7 min before the addition to the incubation solution, and the protease digestions were performed at 37 °C for 2 h. For MMP-2 and MMP-9, recTRAP, 10 ng/μl, or collagen type IV, 100 ng/μl, as control was incubated with MMP-2, 10 ng/μl (0.6 mol of MMP-2/mol of TRAP), or MMP-9, 20 ng/μl, 4 microunits/μl (0.9 mol of MMP-9/mol of TRAP), at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm HgCl2, pH 7.2. For MMP-13 and MMP-14, recTRAP, 10 ng/μl, were incubated with MMP-13, 11.3 ng/μl, 5.7 microunits/μl (2 mol of MMP-13/mol of TRAP), or MMP-14, 11.8 ng/μl, 1.7 microunits/μl (2 mol of MMP-14/mol of TRAP) at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.5. Large Scale Cathepsin K, Cathepsin L, and Trypsin Cleavage of TRAP Prior to FPLC Separation—recTRAP was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with cathepsin L or cathepsin K with the final concentrations: recTRAP 50 ng/μl; 0.04, 0.2, 0.28, and 1.0 mol of protease/mol of TRAP; 50 mm NaAc, 1 mm EDTA, pH 5.5, 2 mm DTT. recTRAP was digested with trypsin at the final concentrations: recTRAP 35 ng/μl; 0.04, 0.2, 1.0 mol of trypsin/mol of TRAP; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, at room temperature for 45 min. All proteolytic digestions were stopped with the proteinase inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science). Phosphatase activity was assayed in 96-well plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) with pNPP as substrate in 150 μl of incubation medium, pH 5.8, with final concentrations as follows: 10 mm pNPP, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 0.1 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 0.1 m NaAc, 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm disodium tartrate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The p-nitrophenol liberated after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C was converted to p-nitrophenolate by addition of 100 μl of 0.3 m NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm (ϵ = 18.9 mm-1 cm-1) with a Spectramax 250 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). 1 unit of TRAP activity corresponds to 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol formed per min. Kinetic experiments were performed with p-NPP concentrations varying from 0.2 to 50 mm Km, and Vmax values were calculated by regression analysis of Lineweaver-Burk plots using the Origin software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). pH optimum was determined in 0.1 m NaAc with pH values ranging from pH 4.0 to 6.7. Sensitivity to reduction was performed with concentrations of sodium ascorbate ranging from 0.5 to 100 mm. SDS-PAGE was run under reducing conditions essentially as described by Laemmli, and proteins were electroblotted to immuno-PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). General procedure for all membranes was as follows. To minimize nonspecific binding, immunoblots were preincubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in 1% Tween 20 in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min each in TBST (TBS + 0.05% Tween 20) before incubation with secondary antibody, washed, and developed. Probing and development was as follows. Immunostaining of TRAP was performed with rabbit anti-recTRAP antiserum (diluted ×100) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (diluted ×500). Development was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl phosphate p-toluidine salt (Bio-Rad). Separation of proteolytic TRAP fragments was performed according to the methods described previously (56.Igarashi Y. Lee M.Y. Matsuzaki S. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2001; 757: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using an ΔKTApurifier™ 10 FPLC system at 4 °C with a heparin column (flow rate 2 ml/min) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.005% Triton X-100 (w/v). TRAP was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.005% Triton X-100 (w/v) (12.5 column volumes) and collected in 0.75-ml fractions. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—Samples in solution were applied to a Procise HT sequencer (Applied Biosystems) for Edman degradation. C-terminal Sequence Analysis—The sample was treated with phenylisocyanate to block the N terminus and the ϵ-amino group of lysines. The sample was thereafter mounted in the reaction cartridge of a Procise C sequencer instrument (Applied Biosystems). The sequencer was operated essentially according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, after initial activation of the C terminus with acetic anhydride, the sample was treated with tetrabutylammonium thiocyanate to form the thiohydantoin cyclic structure. Subsequently, this derivative was S-alkylated by bromomethylnaphthalene to yield an alkylated thiohydantoin derivative that is cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by reverse phase (C18) chromatography (detection at 257 nm). This was repeated with exclusion of the acetic anhydride activation step used in the initial cycle only. For testing, myoglobin was used to check the instrument performance, and alkylated thiohydantoin amino acid standards were always run before analysis of sample cycles. At least three cycles were performed for N- and C-terminal sequencing. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—For RT-PCR, the long bones from 3-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were immersed in liquid nitrogen immediately after dissection and stored at -70 °C. Total RNA was extracted using ToTALLY RNA™, total RNA isolation kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). After extraction, the RNA was treated with 5 units of DNase I (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed with 5 μg of total RNA and 200 units of Superscript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C, using (dT)12–18 as primer (Invitrogen), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In negative controls, reverse transcriptase was excluded from the reaction mixture. PCR amplifications of cathepsin L and cathepsin K were performed on aliquots of cDNA corresponding to 160 ng of total RNA using 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 1× Q-solution according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cathepsin L primers were 5′-ACCATGACCCCTTTACTCCTCC-3′ (bases 75–96) and 5′-AAGCCCAGCAAGAACCACAC-3′ (reverse to bases 498 to 479), positions calculated from rat cathepsin L cDNA, available at GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank, accession number NM_013156, corresponding to a product of 424 bp. The cathepsin K primers were 5′-ACGAGAAAGCCCTGAAGAGAGC-3′ (position 734–755) and 5′-TCCGAGCCAAGAGAACATAGCC-3′ (reverse to position 979–958) calculated from rat cathepsin K cDNA available at GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank, accession number AF010306, corresponding to a product of 246 bp. PCR amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from 80 ng of cDNA was performed as above (with the exception of Q-solution) to ensure equal loading of cDNA in the samples, using primers 5′-CTGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGG-3′ and 5′-ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTC-3′ corresponding to positions 735–754 and reverse to position 1048–1029 in the GAPDH cDNA sequence (57.Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), generating a band of 314 bp. The cDNA was amplified in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, cathepsin L and cathepsin K at 56 °C, GAPDH 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. Aliquots corresponding to 20 ng of cDNA of cathepsin L and K and 10 ng of cDNA of GAPDH were removed at cycles 20, 25, 30, and 35. PCR products corresponding to 6 ng of cDNA from cathepsin L and K and 2 ng from GAPDH were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.15 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Real Time qPCR— Real time qPCR was carried out for rat cathepsin K and L and GAPDH, each sample run on three occasions, using the SYBR® green chemistry. Primers were as follows: cathepsin K forward 5′-GTTGTATGTATAACGCCACGGC-3′ (300 nm) corresponding to bp 699–720 and reverse 5′-CTTTCTCGTTCCCCACAGGA-3′ (300 nm) corresponding to bp 756–774 in NM_031560.2 available at PubMed with annealing temperature 57 °C, and for cathepsin L forward 5′-ACATGAGAATGATCCAGCTACACA-3′ (900 nm) corresponding to bp 241–264 and reverse 5′-CATGTCACCGAAGGCGTTCA-3′ (30"

Almost all other retrotranslocation substrates are modified by the attachment of polyubiquitin chains and moved into the cytosol by the ubiquitin-interacting p97 ATPase complex. The cholera toxin A1 chain, however, can induce toxicity in the absence of ubiquitination, and the motive force that drives retrotranslocation is not known. Here, we use adenovirus expressing dominant-negative mutants of p97 to test whether p97 is required for toxin action. We find that cholera toxin still functions with only a small decrease in potency in cells that cannot retrotranslocate other substrates at all. These results suggest that p97 does not provide the primary driving force for extracting the A1 chain from the endoplasmic reticulum, a finding that is consistent with a requirement for polyubiquitination in p97 function.

Cholera toxin (CT) 1The abbreviations used are: CT, cholera toxin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; WT, wild type; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; KA, p97 ATP binding mutant K542A; QQ, p97 ATP hydrolysis mutant E305Q/E578Q; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Isc, short circuit current. enters host cells by co-opting two fundamental aspects of cell function that reverse membrane and protein transport in the secretory pathway. First, the toxin binds to a membrane lipid that carries it retrograde from plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Fujinaga Y. Wolf A.A. Rodigherio C. Wheeler H. Tsai B. Allen L. Jobling M.G. Rapoport T. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4783-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After arrival in the ER, a fragment of CT, the A1 chain, then enters the cytosol by hijacking the cellular machinery for degradation of terminally misfolded proteins (2Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trend Biol. Chem. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 3Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Such proteins are recognized by ER luminal chaperones, transported to the cytosol, and degraded by the proteasome. This pathway is termed retrotranslocation, or ERAD for ER-associated protein degradation. Unlike misfolded proteins, the A1 chain escapes degradation by the proteasome (4Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and induces toxicity by activating adenylyl cyclase. CT is a member of the AB5 family of toxins, where the A subunit couples non-covalently with a homopentameric B subunit. The B subunit of CT is responsible for binding to ganglioside GM1 in the cell membrane, and this complex carries the A subunit into the ER (1Fujinaga Y. Wolf A.A. Rodigherio C. Wheeler H. Tsai B. Allen L. Jobling M.G. Rapoport T. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4783-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The A subunit has two domains, a compact N-terminal A1 chain that contains the enzymatic activity of the toxin and an extended C-terminal A2 chain that tethers the A and B subunits together. The A1 and A2 chains are linked by a flexible peptide loop containing a serine-protease cleavage site subtended by a single disulfide bond. Cleavage at this site occurs after secretion from the Vibrio, and this is required for toxicity. There is a small change in the conformation of the toxin caused by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide loop linking the A1 and A2 chains that renders the A1 chain susceptible to attack by the ER luminal chaperone protein-disulfide isomerase. In its reduced form, protein-disulfide isomerase binds, unfolds, and dissociates the A1 chain from the remainder of the holotoxin (i.e. the A2 chain and B subunit) (3Tsai B. Rodighiero C. Lencer W.I. Rapoport T. Cell. 2001; 104: 937-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Upon oxidation, protein-disulfide isomerase releases the A1 chain, presumably still in its unfolded conformation, to the retrotranslocation machinery. The A1 chain may cross the ER membrane by passing through the sec61 complex to the cytosol (5Schmitz A. Herrgen H. Winkeler A. Herzog V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Almost all other retrotranslocation substrates are modified by the attachment of polyubiquitin chains and moved into the cytosol by the ubiquitin-interacting p97 ATPase complex. The polyubiquitin chains are recognized by both p97 and its cofactor Ufd1, and this is required for p97 to pull the polyubiquitinated protein into the cytosol (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 8Flierman D. Ye Y. Dai M. Chau V. Rapoport T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34774-34782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The CT A1 chain, however, does not require polyubiquitination to induce toxicity (4Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and how it crosses the ER to enter the cytosol remains a mystery. In this paper, we test whether p97 provides the driving force for retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain. We use adenovirus expressing WT and dominant-negative forms of p97 to infect two cell lines that are sensitive to CT. One cell line is established as a model for retrotranslocation of MHC Class I heavy chain that requires the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 9Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), and the other is an established model for CT entry into host cells (1Fujinaga Y. Wolf A.A. Rodigherio C. Wheeler H. Tsai B. Allen L. Jobling M.G. Rapoport T. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4783-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our data show that the cytosolic ATPase p97 cannot provide the primary driving force for CT retrotranslocation across the ER, a finding that is consistent with the need for polyubiquitination in p97 function. Materials—CT was from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA) or prepared in house (4Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). GM1 was from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA), doxycycline was from Sigma, and antibodies were from Qiagen (RGS-His), Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (ubiquitin), Research Diagnostic (mouse monoclonal p97), and Molecular Probes (goat anti-mouse Alexa 568). Cell Culture—T84, US11-, and U373-MG astrocytoma cells were cultured as described previously (1Fujinaga Y. Wolf A.A. Rodigherio C. Wheeler H. Tsai B. Allen L. Jobling M.G. Rapoport T. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4783-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Adenovirus—Tetracycline-regulated adenoviral p97 constructs were created as described (10Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification that the tetracycline-regulated (tet-off) plasmid pAdtet (11Henkel J.R. Apodaca G. Altschuler Y. Hardy S. Weisz O.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2477-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used for virus construction. His-tagged WT, KA (ATP-binding mutant K524A) and QQ (ATP-hydrolysis mutant E305Q/E578Q) p97 (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pAdtet by PCR amplification using the primers p97S (5′-CAACTAGCATGCATGAGAGGATCGCATCACC-3′, SphI site underlined, start codon bolded) and p97AS (5′-GTACTAGTTAGCCATACAGGTCATCGT-3′, SpeI site underlined, stop codon bolded), followed by digestion with SphI and SpeI and ligation into pAdtet. All constructs were verified by sequencing the subcloned insert. Recombinant adenovirus was created by co-transfecting HEK293 Cre8 cells with the pAdtet-derived plasmid and Psi5 adenoviral DNA (10Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After three rounds of harvesting virus and reinfecting Cre8 cells, virus stocks were produced by a large scale infection of HEK293 cells and virus purification using CsCl-gradients. Cells were co-infected (see below) with equal amounts of p97 and tet-transactivator tTA adenovirus. Optimal amounts of virus for uniform p97 expression while minimizing virus dose were determined empirically for each construct and batch of virus. Viral Infections—U373-MG/US11 cells were trypsinized and infected in suspension before plating at original density ∼16 h prior to experiments. 10 μm GM1 was added during the infection where indicated. For infection of T84 monolayers, 0.33 cm2 Transwell inserts (Corning) were washed twice in CaCl2 and MgCl2-free Hanks' buffered salt solution, incubated for 2 h in CaCl2 and MgCl2-free Hanks' buffered salt solution with 2.5 mm EDTA to open tight junctions and then transferred to medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Adenovirus was added to the apical compartment and cells were incubated for 18 h prior to analysis. To suppress p97 expression, 1 ng/ml doxycycline was added to the culture medium where indicated. Analysis of COS Cells for the Unfolded Protein Response—COS cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with the plasmid pCAX-F-XBP1ΔDBD-venus (14Iwawaki T. Akai R. Kohno K. Miura M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) 15 h later. Cells were then infected with adenovirus expressing either wild type p97 or p97 defective in ATP hydrolysis 8 h after transfection. Cells were stained with DAPI 16 h after infection and were visualized by immunofluorescent microscope. MHC Heavy Chain Degradation—US11-expressing U373-MG cells were infected as described above and assayed for MHC Class I heavy chain degradation exactly as described (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Specifically, infected cells were trypsin-treated and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine and methionine for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were then labeled with 27.5 μCi of [35S]methionine/1.0 × 106 cells for 5 min before an excessive amount of non-radiolabeled methionine and cysteine was added. Aliquots of cells were taken at the indicated time points and were solubilized in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride plus protease inhibitor cocktails. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with heavy chain antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by a phosphorimaging device. Immunostaining/Microscopy—Cells on coverslips or Transwell filters were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, blocked in 10% normal goat serum, and incubated in primary (1 μg/ml RGS-His, Qiagen) and secondary (5 mg/ml goat anti-mouse Alexa 568) antibodies in 10% normal goat serum. cAMP and Electrophysiology—Adenovirus-infected astrocytoma and US11 cells were studied for cAMP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cells cultured in 96-well plates following the directions of the manufacturer (Direct Biotrak EIA kit, Amersham Biosciences). To correct for the effect of mutant p97 on adenylyl cyclase activity, cAMP responses were normalized to the forskolin response. Confluent T84 monolayers were studied for short circuit current (Isc) as described (1Fujinaga Y. Wolf A.A. Rodigherio C. Wheeler H. Tsai B. Allen L. Jobling M.G. Rapoport T. Holmes R.K. Lencer W.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4783-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and Isc responses were calibrated to baseline (B) and maximal levels (M) induced using forskolin (10 μm) and the formula ((X - B)/(M - B)) × 100. Adenovirus Encoding Dominant-negative p97 Inhibits Retrotranslocation of MHC Class I Heavy Chain—We first constructed adenovirus containing cDNA for WT and two dominant-negative p97 variants that are defective in their ATPase activity (KA and QQ mutants) (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). All forms of p97 were His-tagged and placed under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter. To test for expression of WT p97 and the KA and QQ mutants, we used U373-MG astrocytoma cells that stably express the cytomegalovirus protein US11 (US11 cells) (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 9Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). US11 constitutively induces the retrotranslocation and degradation of MHC class I heavy chains in a reaction dependent on the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Conditions were established for adenoviral infection that resulted in uniform and highly efficient expression of WT and mutant p97 as assessed by immunofluorescence using antibodies for the His-epitope (Fig. 1A). US11 cells not infected with adenovirus did not stain. Immunoblots of whole cell lysates using antibodies for p97 and for the His-epitope show that the recombinant p97 proteins were expressed at equal levels and that their expression was fully inhibited by pretreatment with doxycycline (Fig. 1B, upper and middle panels). Based on the band densities of the immunoblot, we estimate the expression levels of virally encoded His-tagged p97 (WT or mutant forms) to be more than 3-fold higher than endogenous p97. We next tested for a dominant-negative effect of the KA and QQ mutants. Expression of KA and QQ mutant p97 in US11 cells induces an increase in high molecular weight polyubiquitinated proteins as detected by immunoblot of total cell lysates using antibodies against ubiquitin (Fig. 1B, lower panel, compare lanes 5 and 7 with 1 and 2). This is reversed by treatment with doxycycline (compare lanes 5 and 7 with 6 and 8). Expression of WT p97 has no effect (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the KA and QQ mutant viruses result in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, in agreement with the known role of p97 in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12Wojcik C. Yano M. DeMartino G.N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To test for inhibition of the retrotranslocation pathway, we examined the unfolded protein response, which is elicited when misfolded proteins cannot be exported from the ER (13Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We used COS cells transiently transfected with the plasmid pCAX-F-XBP1ΔDBD-venus to express green fluorescent protein upon induction of unfolded protein response (14Iwawaki T. Akai R. Kohno K. Miura M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Infection with WT p97 virus causes little expression of GFP as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells infected with KA and QQ mutant virus display strong green fluorescent protein fluorescence and vacuolization of the ER. These results are consistent with previous studies (12Wojcik C. Yano M. DeMartino G.N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 15Dalal S. Rosser M.F. Cyr D.M. Hanson P.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and show that mutant p97 induces the unfolded protein response in US11 cells. To test more directly for a dominant-negative effect on retrotranslocation, we examined the degradation rate of MHC Class I heavy chain. US11 cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 0, 5, or 10 min. The MHC Class I heavy chain was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. In US11 cells not infected with adenovirus or in cells overexpressing WT p97, the MHC Class I heavy chain is rapidly degraded with little heavy chain detected after 5 or 10 min of chase (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 with 2 and 3 and 4 with 5 and 6). In contrast, overexpression of the KA or QQ p97 mutants completely inhibits degradation of the heavy chain (lanes 7-12), and degradation is fully rescued by pretreatment with doxycycline (lanes 13-15). These results are quantified for up to 3 independent experiments in the associated graph. Thus, the KA and QQ p97 mutants inhibit retrotranslocation of MHC Class I heavy chain in US11 cells. p97 Mutants Have a Small Effect on CT Function—We next tested for a role of p97 in the retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain by assessing adenylyl cyclase activity in US11 cells after CT treatment. Initial studies showed that CT induced only a small cAMP response in US11 cells (Fig. 2A, column 2). This is likely explained by low levels of the toxin receptor GM1, because toxicity is strongly increased by the addition of exogenous GM1 (Fig. 2A, compare column 3 with columns 1 and 2). Under these conditions, toxicity is completely inhibited by treatment with brefeldin A, which blocks vesicular traffic from plasma membrane to ER, and no response is obtained using the CT mutant G33D that cannot bind GM1 (Fig. 2A, compare columns 4 and 5 with column 3), consistent with all previous studies on toxin action (2Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trend Biol. Chem. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All future studies of CT action on US11 cells were carried out with addition of GM1. We next found that US11 cells exhibit the same cAMP response to CT as the parent astrocytoma cell line not expressing US11 (Fig. 2B). Thus expression of US11 does not have an effect on retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain. Because our assay for retrotranslocation of the A1 chain depends on the activity of adenylyl cyclase, we next examined the effect of p97 on the cAMP response to the diterpene forskolin. Forskolin is cell-permeant and rapidly activates adenylyl cyclase by directly binding to the enzyme. Forskolin treatment caused a large increase in intracellular cAMP in US11 cells not virally infected or in cells overexpressing WT p97 (30-50-fold greater than baseline, Fig. 2C). Forskolin also induced the activation of adenylyl cyclase in US11 cells expressing the KA and QQ p97 mutants, but the maximal response was lower (only 10-fold greater than baseline). Pretreatment with doxycycline rescued the cAMP response to forskolin in these cells (Fig. 2C, compare column 5 with 6 and column 7 with 8). These results show that dominant-negative inhibition of p97 in US11 cells affects the endogenous function of adenylyl cyclase. To control for this confounding variable, all subsequent experiments using cAMP to assay for retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain were conducted with a one point calibration for adenylyl cyclase activity. In uninfected US11 cells or in cells expressing WT p97, CT (10 nm) induced a strong cAMP response (Fig. 2D, columns 1-4). Similarly, in cells expressing the dominant-negative KA and QQ mutant p97, CT also induced toxicity. These studies were performed side-by-side with our studies on MHC Class I heavy chain retrotranslocation (Fig. 1D) and demonstrated that the A1 chain reaches the cytosol in conditions where p97 function is greatly impaired. However, the cAMP response induced by CT in cells expressing mutant p97 was not always as strong as the maximal response induced by forskolin (Fig. 2D, columns 5-8). Also, the dose response to CT in cells expressing the KA mutant showed a slight reduction in potency (Fig. 2E). Thus, even though the A1 chain clearly retrotranslocates to the cytosol in cells expressing mutant p97, there appears to be a small effect on CT action. This small effect, however, could be indirect or nonspecific, as it contrasts starkly with the complete dependence on p97 function for retrotranslocation of MHC Class I heavy chain (compare Fig. 2, D and E with Fig. 1D). Studies on p97 in Intestinal T84 Cells—We next examined the effect of p97 on CT entry into the human intestinal T84 cell line. In T84 cells, retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain induces the cAMP-dependent secretion of Cl- ions. This can be measured in real time as an increase in Isc using standard methods of electrophysiology. Conditions were established for viral infection in well differentiated T84 cell monolayers so that the monolayers uniformly expressed equal amounts of WT p97 and the KA and QQ mutants as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A, top panels) and by immunoblot of total cell lysates using antibodies for p97 and the His-epitope (Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Expression of the p97 transgene was fully inhibited by treatment of the monolayers with doxycycline (Fig. 3, A, lower panels, and B, lanes 4, 6, and 8). We estimate that the ratios of recombinant to endogenous p97 expression levels in T84 cell monolayers are >2:1 for infection with each of the adenovirus constructs. To test for a dominant-negative effect of mutant p97 expression in T84 cells, we measured the content of polyubiquitinated proteins in total cell lysates as described for US11 cells. Unlike US11 cells, there is a background of polyubiquitinated proteins in T84 cells not infected with adenovirus or expressing the WT p97 (Fig. 3B). Even so, the expression of KA and QQ mutant p97 caused a clear increase in polyubiquitinated proteins, and this was completely reversed by treatment with doxycycline (Fig. 3B, lower panel compare lanes 5 with 6 and 7 with 8). Thus, in T84 cells, the KA and QQ p97 mutants inhibit p97 function in the proteasome pathway. Unexpectedly, we also found that the KA and QQ mutants increased the Isc in resting T84 cell monolayers, and this was completely reversed by treatment with doxycycline (Fig. 3C). We do not yet understand how p97 may act on the regulation of ion transport in T84 cells. Nonetheless, these results show further evidence for inhibition of p97 function in T84 cells by the KA and QQ mutant viruses. To test whether retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain in T84 cells depends on p97, we examined the time course of CT-induced Cl- secretion (Fig. 3D). All studies on T84 cells were controlled by a two-point calibration (see “Experimental Procedures”). The raw data and normalized time courses for CT-induced Cl- secretion for three doses of toxin are shown (Fig. 3D, top and lower panels). Monolayers not infected with virus or those infected WT or mutant p97 virus exhibit the same time course and maximal Cl- secretory response to CT. Identical results are obtained at all doses of toxin examined (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, inhibition of p97 function in T84 cells has no detectable effect on CT action or retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain. In this paper, we showed that the CT A1 chain still reaches the cytosol in US11 cells that cannot retrotranslocate the MHC Class I heavy chain at all. We also found that the intestinal T84 cell line responds normally to CT under conditions where p97 function is greatly impaired. These results suggest that the cytosolic AAA-ATPase p97 cannot provide the primary driving force for retrotranslocation of the CT A1 chain. Because the A1 chain does not require polyubiquitination to reach the cytosol (4Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is possible that our results define a general rule for retrotranslocation via the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 pathway. So far, in yeast and mammalian cells, all retrotranslocation substrates that depend on the p97 pathway are also modified by polyubiquitin (16Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and the modification is required for transport (18Tsai B. Rapoport T. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). There is one other example, the yeast pre-pro α-factor, that like the CT A1 chain does not require modification by polyubiquitin for retrotranslocation (18Tsai B. Rapoport T. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This substrate may also reach the cytosol in the absence of p97 (19Lee R.J. Liu C.W. Harty C. McCracken A.A. Latterich M. Romisch K. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Brodsky J.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because both the A1 chain and the pre-pro α-factor behave in the same way, we propose that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex may operate only for retrotranslocation substrates that are modified by polyubiquitin. A recent study published during the writing of this manuscript examined the role of p97 on the toxicity of a number of different toxins, including CT (20Abujarour R.J. Dalal S. Hanson P.I. Draper R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, the authors report only small effects of a dominant-negative p97 mutant on CT toxicity, which our experiments suggest might even be caused indirectly by inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Nevertheless, the authors interpret their results differently, i.e. that p97 is required for the retrotranslocation of CT. However, we feel that this conclusion is not warranted, because we found complete inhibition of another retrotranslocation substrate under the same condition where CT retrotranslocation is only marginally affected. The conclusions by Abujarour et al. (20Abujarour R.J. Dalal S. Hanson P.I. Draper R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are also based on the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments that show a physical association between p97 and the A1 chain in the lysates of toxin-exposed cells. However, the co-immunoprecipitation studies are not conclusive. The complex formed between p97 and the CT A1 chain might be nonspecific because very high concentrations of toxin were used or be representative of an interaction unrelated to retrotranslocation, perhaps caused by p97 function as a general chaperone for abnormal proteins in the cytosol. So how does the A1 chain cross the ER membrane? One possibility is that the A1 chain may ratchet or pull itself out of the ER because it can rapidly and spontaneously refold as it emerges into the cytosol (4Rodighiero C. Tsai B. Rapoport T.A. Lencer W.I. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the ATPases in the 19 S proteasome may pull the A1 chain from the ER as has been proposed for the pre-pro α-factor in yeast (19Lee R.J. Liu C.W. Harty C. McCracken A.A. Latterich M. Romisch K. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Brodsky J.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Much remains to be learned, and the next most informative steps may be to model the retrotranslocation reaction of the toxins in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2088378332,"The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is an evolutionarily conserved peripheral membrane oligomeric protein complex that is involved in intra-Golgi protein trafficking. The COG complex is composed of eight subunits that are located in two lobes; Lobe A contains COG1–4, and Lobe B is composed of COG5–8. Both in vivo and in vitro protein-protein interaction techniques were applied to characterize interactions between individual COG subunits. In vitro assays revealed binary interactions between Cog2p and Cog3p, Cog2p and Cog4p, and Cog6p and Cog8p and a strong interaction between Cog5p and Cog7p. The two-hybrid assay confirmed these findings and revealed that Cog1p interacted with subunits from both lobes of the complex. Antibodies to COG subunits were utilized to determine the protein levels and membrane association of COG subunits in yeast Δcog1–8 mutants. As a result, we created a model of the protein-protein interactions within the yeast COG complex and proposed that Cog1p is a bridging subunit between the two COG lobes. In support of this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that Cog1p is required for the stable association between two COG subcomplexes."

The p85 regulatory subunit stabilizes and inhibits the p110 catalytic subunit. The minimal fragment of p85 capable of regulating p110 is the N-terminal SH2 domain linked to the coiled-coil iSH2 domain (referred to as p85ni). We have previously proposed that the conformationally rigid iSH2 domain tethers p110 to p85, facilitating regulatory interactions between p110 and the p85 nSH2 domain. In an oncogenic mutant of murine p85, truncation at residue 571 leads to constitutively increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, which has been proposed to result from either loss of an inhibitory Ser-608 autophosphorylation site or altered interactions with cellular regulatory factors. We have examined this mutant (referred to as p65) in vitro and find that p65 binds but does not inhibit p110, leading to constitutive p110 activity. This activated phenotype is observed with recombinant proteins in the absence of cellular factors. Importantly, this effect is also produced by truncating p85ni at residue 571. Thus, the phenotype is not because of loss of the Ser-608 inhibitory autophosphorylation site, which is not present in p85ni. To determine the structural basis for the phenotype of p65, we used a broadly applicable spin label/NMR approach to define the positioning of the nSH2 domain relative to the iSH2 domain. We found that one face of the nSH2 domain packs against the 581–593 region of the iSH2 domain. The loss of this interaction in the truncated p65 would remove the orienting constraints on the nSH2 domain, leading to a loss of p110 regulation by the nSH2. Based on these findings, we propose a general model for oncogenic mutants of p85 and p110 in which disruption of nSH2-p110 regulatory contacts leads to constitutive p110 activity. p85/p110 phosphoinositide 3-kinases regulate multiple cell functions and are frequently mutated in human cancer.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases are classified by their preferred substrates and their mode of regulation (1Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Class IA PI3-kinases, which are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, are heterodimers consisting of an SH2 domain-containing regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, p55α, p50α, or p55γ) and a catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, or p110Δ). Class IA PI3-kinases are obligate heterodimers in vivo, because the p110 catalytic subunits are labile at 37 °C and are unstable as monomers (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of a p110 catalytic subunit with p85 (or the shorter isoforms) maintains the enzyme in a low activity state, as the regulatory subunit inhibits p110 (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent activation of p85/p110 involves a translocation of the normally cytosolic enzyme to a membrane as well as an increase in the specific activity of the dimer. The best understood mechanism for these two events is the high affinity binding of the two SH2 domains in p85 to phosphorylated YXXM motifs in receptor tyrosine kinases or their substrates (4Cantley L.C.

The activity of p85/p110 dimers is also increased by binding of activated Rac or Cdc42 to the BCR homology domain in the regulatory subunit or by binding of activated Ras to the catalytic subunit (6Zheng Y.

Mutations in the 3-phosphoinositide phosphatase PTEN are frequently found in human tumors (9Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), as is overexpression of the p110 catalytic subunits of p85/p110 (Class IA) PI3-kinases (10Shayesteh L.

These overexpressed p110 subunits are presumably active by virtue of excess free p85 that exists in many cells types (11Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Brachmann S.M. Tseng Y.H. Cantley L.C. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mutational hotspots in p110α have also been described in human colon cancer (12Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H. Gazdar A. Powell S.M. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Science. 2004; 304: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar), and these mutants show increased PI3-kinase activity in vitro (13Kang S. Bader A.G. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In addition, a deletion mutant of the p85 regulatory subunit has been discovered in human ovarian and colon cancer (14Philp A.J. Campbell I.G. Leet C. Vincan E. Rockman S.P. Whitehead R.H. Thomas R.J. Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar). This deletion maps to a region of p85 adjacent to an inhibitory serine autophosphorylation site (Ser-608) (15Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that loss of autophosphorylation at this inhibitory site might contribute to oncogenesis (16Foukas L.C. Beeton C.A. Jensen J. Phillips W.A. Shepherd P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, Jimenez et al. (17Jimenez C. Jones D.R.

Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) described a transforming mutant of murine p85 in which residues 572–724 of p85 are replaced by a non-catalytic fragment from the Eph tyrosine kinase. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of PI3-kinase. A truncated p85-(1–571) mutant (referred to as p65) also leads to constitutive increases in PI3-kinase activity in transfected cells, suggesting that the fragment from Eph does not contribute to activation. The phenotype of the p65 mutant has led to a proposal that the deleted residues 572–724, which contain the end of iSH2 and the C-terminal SH2 domain, comprise an inhibitory domain whose removal leads to a loss of interactions with cellular inhibitors (18Chan T.O.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that the constitutively activated phenotype of the truncated p65 is due to the fact that p65/p110 dimers can be activated by GTP-Ras in the absence of SH2 domain occupancy, whereas Ras activation of wild-type p85/p110 requires SH2 domain occupancy (19Jimenez C. Hernandez C. Pimentel B. Carrera A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41556-41562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the increased PI3-kinase activity caused by the p65 oncogenic mutant would be that truncation at residue 572 disrupts the native positioning of the nSH2 domain so that it can no longer regulate p110 activity. We have previously shown that the minimal regulatory fragment of p85 is the N-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) linked to the inter-SH2 domain (iSH2) (20Yu J.H. Wjasow C. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The iSH2 domain is a rigid 100 Å antiparallel coiled-coil (21Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B.

Mondino A. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7677-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, iSH2 binding has no effect on p110 activity. In contrast, the nSH2-iSH2 fragment (hereafter referred to as p85ni) inhibits p110 and mediates phosphopeptide-induced activation of the p85ni/p110 dimer (20Yu J.H. Wjasow C. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Importantly, phosphopeptide binding to the SH2 domain of p85ni has no effect on the conformation of the iSH2 domain (21Dhand R. Hara K. Hiles I. Bax B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Fry M.J. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 22Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given (a) the conformational rigidity of the iSH2 domain and (b) the fact the p110 is inhibited by p85ni but not by the iSH2 domain alone, we have proposed a model in which the iSH2 domain serves as a rigid tether linking p85 and p110 and facilitates a second, regulatory interaction between the nSH2 and p110. Phosphopeptide activation of p85/p110 would involve a change in or disruption of this inhibitory nSH2-p110 contact. To test whether the activating effects of the p65 truncation could be due to intrinsic changes in the regulation of p110 activity by the nSH2 domain rather than loss of inhibitory inputs from Ser-608 or cellular factors, we have examined the effects of wild-type versus truncated p85 and p85ni on p110 activity. Interestingly, we found that truncated mutants of both p85 and p85ni bind p110 but do not inhibit p110. These data provide a simple explanation for the activated phenotype of p65, in which the truncated molecule stabilizes p110 in its high activity state. To understand, at a structural level, how truncation of p85 could affect nSH2-mediated inhibition of p110, we determined the binding interface between the nSH2 and iSH2. In an approach that should have general application in the structurally challenging task of measuring interdomain positions in multidomain proteins and complexes, site-specific spin labeling was combined with heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to measure a network of distances between the nSH2 domain and the region of the iSH2 domain affected by the p65 truncation. We found that residues 581–593 of the iSH2 domain were in close contact with the nSH2 domain, which folds down over this region of the iSH2 domain. Both the functional and the structural results suggest that the distal end of the iSH2 domain is critical for maintaining the nSH2 domain in a defined, inhibitory conformation relative to p110. Mutagenesis and Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and Analysis of p85-p110 Binding—Human p85 mutants were produced by standard 4-primer PCR techniques. All mutants were confirmed by sequencing. Human p85α or fragments were expressed as GST fusions as previously described. GST-p85α and GST-p65 (residues 1–571) were used directly, whereas GST was removed from p85ni (residues 320–600) and p85ni(572stop) (residues 320–571) by cleavage with thrombin and absorption on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). All proteins were >95% pure by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. All fragments were tested for p110α binding and inhibition as previously described (22Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the binding studies, tracer amounts of Myc-p110α were incubated with excess immobilized GST-p85 or mutants thereof, washed, and assayed by anti-Myc blotting. Recombinant Myc-tagged p110α was produced in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells or transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells as previously described (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide activation of p85/p110 dimers by a YXXM phosphopeptide derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor was as previously described (20Yu J.H. Wjasow C. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Isotopic and Nitroxide Spin Labeling of Recombinant p85 Fragments—Uniformly 15N- or 2H13C15N-labeled p85ni was bacterially expressed in minimal medium supplemented with either 15NH4Cl alone or 2H2O, 2H13C-glucose, and 15NH4Cl for isotopic incorporation. Purified 15N-labeled p85 fragments containing single cysteine residues at various positions were labeled with 3-maleimido-proxyl (Aldrich) dissolved in Me2SO at a molar ratio of 1:20 and a final Me2SO concentration of 0.5%. The samples were rotated at room temperature for 5 h, dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and concentrated in Centriprep concentrators (Amicon, Bedford, MA). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—The NMR samples contained 0.5–2.0 mm p85ni in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100 at pH 7.4. All NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and NMRView (28Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). The nSH2 backbone resonances were assigned using three-dimensional TROSY-based HNCO/HN(CA)CO and HNCACB/HN(CO)CACB data sets (29Yang D.M. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) from a 2H13C15N-labeled p85ni sample collected at 27 °C on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer at the New York Structure Center. The interdomain paramagnetic relaxation effects in spin-labeled, uniformly 15N-labeled p85ni samples were analyzed using 600 MHz 1H15N TROSY spectra (30Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar) of both the oxidized and 3 mm phenylhydrazine-reduced samples. The intensities of all assigned nSH2 resonances were measured in the reduced and oxidized samples and used with the τc value of 17 ns calculated from {1H}15N relaxation data to define broad distance constraint ranges of (i) <14 Å, (ii) >20 Å, or (iii) ambiguous and therefore not included as a constraint, as described (31Battiste J.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2000; 36: 5355-5365Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). For the structure calculations using XPLOR-NIH (32Schweiters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar), the known structures of the nSH2 (33Booker G.W. Gout I. Downing A.K. Driscoll P.C. Boyd J. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1993; 73: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and a recent crystal structure of the iSH2 2N. Miled, Y. Yang, O. Perisic, M. Zvelebil, J. M. Backer, and R. Williams, submitted for publication. were treated as rigid bodies connected by the unconstrained linking residues 424–434; varying the length of the unconstrained segment by 5 residues in either direction had no effect on the calculated structures. A random set of 100 starting orientations was generated by high temperature torsion angle dynamics equilibration at 7,500 K. A rigid body simulated annealing protocol, in which the distance constraints were phased in over the course of a second equilibration at 5,000 K and maintained during cooling to 50 K, was then used to calculate a family of structural models that satisfied all distance constraints to within 0.5 Å from all 100 starting structures. The rigid body constraints were then removed, and the final structures were energy minimized to optimize side chain packing. Only those relaxed structures that still satisfied the spin-label distance constraints were retained for analysis. Truncated p85-(1–571) Binds but Does Not Inhibit p110 —To directly examine the effect of the oncogenic truncation of p85 (17Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodríguez-Viciana P. Gonzalez-García A. Leonardo E. Wennström S. Von Kobbe C. Toran J.L. Borlado L.R. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Diez E. Marcos M.A.R. Downward J. Martinez C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) on the activity of p110, we produced recombinant GST-p85 in both wild-type and truncated p65 forms and tested their ability to regulate p110. As previously shown, full-length GST-p85 bound and inhibited p110 (Fig. 1, A and B), and the activity of GST-p85-p110 dimers was increased by a phosphotyrosine peptide derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Fig. 1C). In contrast, p65 bound to p110 but had no effect on its activity, and the activity of p65/p110 dimers was not altered by phosphopeptide (Fig. 1, A–C). Thus, p65 binds but does not inhibit p110, providing a simple explanation for its activated phenotype when expressed in cells. The constitutively active phenotype of p65 (17Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodríguez-Viciana P. Gonzalez-García A. Leonardo E. Wennström S. Von Kobbe C. Toran J.L. Borlado L.R. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Diez E. Marcos M.A.R. Downward J. Martinez C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and a Δ582–605 mutant of human p85 (14Philp A.J. Campbell I.G. Leet C. Vincan E. Rockman S.P. Whitehead R.H. Thomas R.J. Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar) have been attributed to a loss of inhibitory input from the distal iSH2 domain and the cSH2 domain (18Chan T.O. Rodeck U. Chan A.M. Kimmelman A.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Panayotou G. Tsichlis P.N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or the loss or disruption of the inhibitory Ser-608 phosphorylation site (16Foukas L.C. Beeton C.A. Jensen J. Phillips W.A. Shepherd P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test these possibilities, we compared the regulation of p110 by p85ni versus p85ni(572stop), which terminates at the p65 truncation site. Importantly, we find that p85ni inhibits p110, whereas the truncated p85ni(572stop) binds p110 but has no effect on p110 activity (Fig. 1, D and E). These data show that the 572 truncation leads to a loss of p110 inhibition within the context of either intact p85 or p85ni. Thus, the effect of the truncation cannot be because of the loss of the cSH2 domain or the Ser-608 phosphorylation site, as these are not present in p85ni. Instead, these data suggest that the loss of residues 571–600 in the iSH2 domain might lead to a disruption of the native nSH2 domain orientation, such that it no longer forms an inhibitory contact with p110. Mapping the Interactions between the nSH2 and iSH2 Domains—Although inhibition of p110 by p85ni requires residues 572–600 (Fig. 1E), these residues are not sufficient to inhibit p110, as we have previously shown that an iSH2-cSH2 construct binds but does not inhibit p110 (34Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Wu H. Gerfen G.J. Backer J.M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory function of residues 572–600 only occurs in constructs containing the nSH2 domain. We therefore decided to map contacts between the nSH2 domain and the proximal and distal ends of the iSH2 domain by measuring the paramagnetic relaxation effects from site-specific spin labels in the iSH2 domain on assigned amide proton NMR resonances in the nSH2 domain. Backbone amide proton and nitrogen resonances of the nSH2 domain were assigned from triple resonance three-dimensional TROSY spectra of perdeuterated, 13C15N-labeled wild-type p85ni. Based on our modeling and EPR studies (22Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a recent crystal structure of the iSH2 domain,2 we produced mutants of p85ni containing single cysteine residues at residues 448 and 449 near the N-linker region that joins the nSH2 and iSH2 domains and at residues 575, 582, 584, 591, and 596 in the region whose deletion causes a loss of p110 inhibition (Fig. 1). None of the point mutations affected binding or inhibition of p110 (data not shown). 15N-labeled samples of each single cysteine mutant were labeled with 3-maleimido-PROXYL. For each mutant, 1H15N TROSY spectra were acquired for both the paramagnetic sample and a control in which the nitroxide spin label was chemically reduced to its diamagnetic form. Paramagnetic relaxation from an introduced nitroxide spin label leads to distance-dependent broadening (Fig. 2, top panel) and hence a conveniently measured reduction in cross-peak intensity for amide protons within 20 Å of the nitroxide radical (31Battiste J.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2000; 36: 5355-5365Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Of the spin-labeled sites, the most extensive relaxation effects were observed for position 584, and moderate effects were observed for positions 448, 582, and 591 (Fig. 2, lower panel). Few effects were seen for positions 449, 575, and 596 (data not shown). Using the naming convention of Nolte et al. (35Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the relaxation effects from the spin labels were concentrated on one face of the nSH2 domain, including the N and C termini, the AA and AB loops, strand D/D′, the EF loop, and the far end of the BG loop through strand G (at some distance from the region of the BG loop involved in phosphopeptide binding (35Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). These data define a face of the nSH2 domain that packs against the C-terminal helices of the iSH2 domain near residue 584. To visualize the interactions between the nSH2 and iSH2 domains, the paramagnetic relaxation effects were used to position the known structure of the nSH2 domain (35Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Schlessinger J. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 364-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Booker G.W. Breeze A.L. Downing A.K. Panayotou G. Gout I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15570-15581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Weber T. Schaffhausen B. Liu Y. Gunther U.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15860-15869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with respect to the newly solved structure of the iSH2 domain.2 The paramagnetic relaxation effects were converted into broad distance restraint ranges, and the nSH2 and iSH2 domains were treated as rigid bodies. A typical simulated annealing protocol was used to derive structural models consistent with the restraints. A single family of models with root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms of 1.6 Å (Fig. 3A) was found that satisfied all restraints. On viewing a representative structural model (Fig. 3B) it is apparent that the nSH2 domain only interacts with the C-terminal helices of the iSH2 coiled-coil. Residues 329–333 and 403–410 of the nSH2 domain pack against the exposed face of the C-terminal iSH2 helix-turn-helix extending from residue 581–593; the phosphopeptide-binding site of the nSH2 domain is oriented away from the nSH2-iSH2 contact. The interdomain contact observed here is likely to be important in maintaining the relative orientations of the nSH2 and iSH2 domains. The p85 and p55 subunits of Class IA PI3-kinases are inhibitors of the p110 subunit, maintaining it in a low activity state (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many protein kinases are regulated by association with inhibitory subunits. In protein kinase A, activation involves the cAMP-stimulated dissociation of the inhibitory regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunit (39Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For Class IA PI3-kinases, however, the two subunits cannot dissociate, as p110 monomers are unstable (3Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of p110 is caused by an allosteric mechanism involving the direct binding of an activator to p110 (in the case of GTP-Ras) (40Downward J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to p85 (in the case of receptor tyrosine kinases or their substrates) (5Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the latter case, conformational changes initiated by the occupancy of the p85 SH2 domains are transmitted to p110 through alterations in inhibitory contacts at the p110-p85 interface. We have recently proposed a model of p85 regulation of p110 in which the primary contact between p85 and p110 is a conformationally rigid interface involving the N terminus of p110 and helices 1 and 2 of the iSH2 domain (34Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Wu H. Gerfen G.J. Backer J.M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This primary binding site facilitates a secondary interaction between the nSH2 and p110 that is required for inhibition of p110 (22Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The inhibitory interface is presumably modified or abolished when phosphopeptides occupy the nSH2 domain. This model is supported by the fact that the nSH2 domain is specifically required for inhibition of p110 (20Yu J.H. Wjasow C. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30199-30203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Wu H. Gerfen G.J. Backer J.M. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that we and others have been unable to detect significant conformational change within the iSH2 domain upon phosphopeptide binding to the SH2 domains (22Fu Z. Aronoff-Spencer E. Backer J.M. Gerfen G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3275-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26O'Brien R. Rugman P. Renzoni D. Layton M. Handa R.

Biophys. 2004; 432: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To probe for structural interactions between residues 571–600 and the nSH2 domain, we used a novel approach for positioning two structurally characterized domains that combines site-specific spin labeling with NMR spectroscopy to define a network of distances between the two domains. By acquiring distance constraints from multiple spin-labeled sites, structural models for the interactions of the two can be calculated by restrained rigid body dynamics methods. The use of paramagnetic relaxation effects has a long history in NMR for deriving distance information within a protein or domain (41Dwek R.A. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (N.M.R.) in Biochemistry. Oxford University Press, London1973Google Scholar) and for examining the interactions of ligands with macromolecules (Refs. 31Battiste J.L. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 2000; 36: 5355-5365Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 42Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar and references therein). However, these methods have not been used for the experimentally challenging but biologically important question of interdomain contacts and orientations in regulatory proteins and complexes. Although structures of isolated domains have been readily solved by either crystallography or NMR, direct crystal or solution structures of these often weakly interacting multidomain systems are much more difficult to obtain. Of the other solution approaches to independent domain interactions (42Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), residual dipolar couplings (43Fischer M.W. Losonczi J.A. Weaver J.L. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9013-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and the orientational dependence of 15N relaxation (44Fushman D. Xu R. Cowburn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10225-10230Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) identify the relative orientation between domains (but not contacts), whereas cross-saturation (45Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and chemical shift mapping (46Chen Y. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Fairbrother W.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) identify which surfaces interact (but not their disposition with respect to each other). The spin label approach used in the present study requires chemical shift assignment of only one of the two domains and provides a network of interdomain distances that yields both relative orientation and a structural view of the interaction. Because many individual regulatory or targeting domains have now been studied by NMR, this approach should be readily applicable to other multidomain interactions. Here this method provides an important new element to our model, the identification of an interface between one face of the nSH2 domain and residues 581–593 of the iSH2 domain. These contacts are likely to be important for establishing the relative orientations of the two domains and for maintaining the nSH2 domain in its inhibitory orientation relative to p110. It is interesting to consider mutations of p85 found in human and murine cancer in the light of our structural data. These mutants include the p65 truncation (17Jimenez C. Jones D.R. Rodríguez-Viciana P. Gonzalez-García A. Leonardo E. Wennström S. Von Kobbe C. Toran J.L. Borlado L.R. Calvo V. Copin S.G. Albar J.P. Gaspar M.L. Diez E. Marcos M.A.R. Downward J. Martinez C. Mérida I. Carrera A.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the replacement of residues 582–605 with a single Ile, found in human colon and ovarian cancer (14Philp A.J. Campbell I.G. Leet C. Vincan E. Rockman S.P. Whitehead R.H. Thomas R.J. Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the activated phenotype of these mutations is due to altered interactions with cellular regulatory proteins (18Chan T.O. Rodeck U. Chan A.M. Kimmelman A.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Panayotou G. Tsichlis P.N. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Jimenez C. Hernandez C. Pimentel B. Carrera A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41556-41562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, we have clearly shown that the effects of the p65 truncation can be detected in vitro with recombinant proteins. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the activating phenotype of p85 mutations could be due to a loss of inhibition from the Ser-608 autophosphorylation site (14Philp A.J. Campbell I.G. Leet C. Vincan E. Rockman S.P. Whitehead R.H. Thomas R.J. Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar, 16Foukas L.C. Beeton C.A. Jensen J. Phillips W.A. Shepherd P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 966-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that the activating effect of the p65 truncation is still observed within the context of the p85ni, which does not contain Ser-608. Thus, although Ser-608 may be an important regulatory site for p85/p110 in vivo, removal of the 572–600 region of p85 leads to a constitutively active (i.e. non-inhibited) p110 in vitro, independently of effects from Ser-608. In contrast to these previous studies, our work provides a structural explanation for the phenotype of oncogenic p85 mutants. The truncation of p85 or p85ni at residue 571 would eliminate residues 581–593, the region of close nSH2-iSH2 contacts. The 582–605 deletions described in human cancer (14Philp A.J. Campbell I.G. Leet C. Vincan E. Rockman S.P. Whitehead R.H. Thomas R.J. Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar) would be predicted to have a similar effect. Our structural modeling suggests that these mutations would significantly disrupt nSH2-iSH2 interactions, causing a shift of the nSH2 domain away from its normal orientation. In both cases, it is likely that the loss of nSH2-iSH2 contacts would disrupt regulatory contacts between the nSH2 domain and p110, leading to a constitutively active phenotype. Although the sites of nSH2-p110 contact have not yet been defined, a mutational hotspot has been identified in the helical domain of human p110α in human colon cancer (12Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H. Gazdar A. Powell S.M. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Science. 2004; 304: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure of the iSH2 domain complexed with the N terminus of p110, combined with the previously solved structure of the p110γ catalytic domain (47Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), has allowed the modeling of the intact p85-p110 dimer.2 In this model, the nSH2 domain is in contact with the helical domain of p110. Consistent with this model, we have found that “hot spot” helical domain mutants of p110 (E542K, Q546K, E545K) bind to p85ni, but are not inhibited by p85ni.2 These data suggest that helical domain p110 mutations lead to a disruption of a regulatory interface with the nSH2 domain of p85. Such mutations would be mechanistically analogous to the effect of the p65 truncation, which also disrupts nSH2-mediated regulation of p110 (Fig. 4). Thus, we propose that oncogenic mutations of both p85 and p110 may share a similar mechanism of action, loss of inhibition of p110 by p85. Although our data are consistent with this model of p110 regulation, we have not directly demonstrated that removal of residues 572–600 leads to a change in nSH2-p110 interactions. It is possible that both the nSH2 domain and residues 572–600 form independent inhibitory contacts with p110, neither of which is sufficient for inhibition. In this alternative model, given the close contacts between the nSH2 domain and residues 583–592, phosphopeptide binding to the nSH2 domain could lead to conformational changes affecting the interactions of both regions with p110. Footprinting studies to definitively map the sites of nSH2-p110 contact and their modulation by phosphopeptides are in progress. Carrera and co-workers (19Jimenez C. Hernandez C. Pimentel B. Carrera A.C. J. Biol.

Our data are consistent with this finding, which suggests that truncation of p85 at residue 572 mimics activation by phosphopeptide. This is because in p65 the absence of inhibitory nSH2-p110 contacts mimics the loss/alteration of inhibitory contacts that occurs upon phosphopeptide binding to p85/p110. The finding that phosphopeptide binding is not required for Ras activation of p65 does not mean that residues 572–600 are involved in interactions with Ras but rather that Ras preferentially interacts with disinhibited (or in the case of p65, non-inhibited) p110. These data increase the physiological importance of the nSH2-mediated regulation of p110, because they suggest that phosphopeptide-mediated disinhibition is a prerequisite for additional activation by Ras. In summary, inhibition of p110 specifically requires the nSH2 domain. Using a combined spin label/NMR methodology, we have shown that inhibition of p110 requires that the nSH2 domain be properly positioned by contacts with the 581–593 region of the iSH2 domain. Deletion of this region in oncogenic mutants of p85 leads to a loss of p110 inhibition. Our data provide a simple mechanism for the activating effects of oncogenic p85 mutants and suggest a general model for oncogenic mutants of p85 and p110.

Yet the mapping of temporal events in mitochondria subsequent to Ca2+ sequestration is incomplete. By isolating mitochondria from primary cultures, we discovered that glutamate treatment of cortical neurons for 10 min caused 44% inhibition of ADP-stimulated respiration, whereas the maximal rate of electron transport (uncoupler-stimulated respiration) was inhibited by ∼10%. The Ca2+ load in mitochondria from glutamate-treated neurons was estimated to be 167 ± 19 nmol/mg protein. The glutamate-induced Ca2+ load was less than the maximal Ca2+ uptake capacity of the mitochondria determined in vitro (363 ± 35 nmol/mg protein). Comparatively, mitochondria isolated from cerebellar granule cells demonstrated a higher Ca2+ uptake capacity (686 ± 71 nmol/mg protein) than the cortical mitochondria, and the glutamate-induced load of Ca2+ was a smaller percentage of the maximal Ca2+ uptake capacity. Thus, this study indicated that Ca2+-induced impairment of mitochondrial ATP production is an early event in the excitotoxic cascade that may contribute to decreased cellular ATP and loss of ionic homeostasis that precede commitment to neuronal death.

Glutamate excitotoxicity underlies neuronal loss in ischemic and traumatic brain injury (1Choi D.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and also likely contributes to dysfunction in chronic forms of neurodegeneration. In particular, the evidence for involvement of excitotoxicity in Huntington disease has been significantly strengthened by recent studies (for a review see Ref. 2Bezprozvanny I. Hayden M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is well established that glutamate-induced neuronal death depends on entry of extracellular Ca2+ as a result of activation of the NMDA 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; HBSS, HEPES-buffered salt solution; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. subtype of glutamate receptors (3Choi D.W.

The description of ensuing events in various types of cultured neurons is extensive (5Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and includes an initial transient increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, followed by a loss in ionic homeostasis (also termed delayed Ca2+ deregulation) (4Tymianski M. Charlton M.P. Carlen P.L. Tator C.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2085-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initial increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ is associated with mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and slight mitochondrial depolarization followed by profound depolarization concurrent with the loss of ionic homeostasis. Other early events may include the release of apoptogenic cytochrome c and generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (5Nicholls D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 149-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 6Khodorov B.I. Membr. Cell Biol. 2000; 14: 149-162PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krieger C. Duchen M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As well, excitotoxic death in cultured neurons is preceded by a significant decline in cellular ATP (8Tsuji K. Nakamura Y. Ogata T. Shibata T. Kataoka K. Brain Res. 1994; 662: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Recent imaging studies of cultured neurons have demonstrated that mitochondrial Ca2+ loading is in large part responsible for induction of cell death following exposure to glutamate (9Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 10Stout A.K. Raphael H.M. Kanterewicz B.I. Klann E. Reynolds I.J. Nat.

Res. 2001; 63: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), yet the nature of the Ca2+-induced mitochondrial injury remains controversial. An alternative approach to the elucidation of these mechanisms has been the study of mitochondria isolated from the brains of rodents exposed to excitotoxic stimuli. An inherent problem in such studies with brain mitochondria lies in the heterogeneity of these preparations that contain the organelles from both neuronal and glial cells (13Lai J.C. Clark J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14Nicholls D.G. Proteins, Transmitters, and Synapses. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1994: 3-14Google Scholar). Furthermore, frequently used isolation methods employing gradient centrifugation enrich the preparations in mitochondria from cell bodies, yet the excitotoxic events occur mostly within nerve terminals that are lost in the preparation as synaptosomal fractions. The use of digitonin to avoid the loss of synaptosomal mitochondria (15Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 16Andreyev A.Y. Fahy B. Fiskum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) has been questioned recently (17Brustovetsky N. Jemmerson R. Dubinsky J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 332: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have taken the approach of isolating mitochondria from relatively pure neuronal cultures exposed to glutamate to allow these problems to be overcome. We investigated the early bioenergetic consequences of exposure to glutamate by isolating mitochondria from primary neuronal cultures exposed to glutamate for 10 min, prior to a commitment to neuronal death. By doing so, we avoid studying potential secondary effects of the cell death process that may affect mitochondrial function. Estimation of the extent of glutamate-induced Ca2+ loading enabled us to test the effects of Ca2+ at concentrations that mimic the glutamate stimulus. Additionally, Ca2+ uptake capacities and susceptibility of mitochondria to the permeability transition were assessed. Our novel finding, which has not been revealed by other current approaches, is that mitochondria of neurons exposed to high levels of glutamate sustain significant Ca2+-induced injury to oxidative phosphorylation, and this injury occurs prior to any commitment to cell death. Preparation of Cortical Neurons—Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats. The cerebral cortices were collected and triturated gently (3–4 times) in ice-cold Hibernate E medium (Brain Bits, Southern Illinois University, School of Medicine) plus 1× B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After the tissue settled, the Hibernate E medium was aspirated, and the tissue was triturated for 1 min in 0.1% trypsin in a Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with glucose (1.5 mm), after which trypsin was inactivated by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml). The mixture was transferred into Hibernate E medium containing 20 units/ml DNase (Promega) in 0.2× reaction buffer (Promega), and the cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 1.5 min. The supernatant was quickly aspirated, and the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of Neurobasal (E) medium (Invitrogen) plus glutamate (0.4 μg/ml), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), 1× B27 supplement, and 5 mm sodium pyruvate. Once in suspension, the cells were diluted into 30 ml of the same medium without pyruvate (initial plating medium), and the number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm plates at a concentration of 750,000 cells per ml in a volume of 10 ml per plate and kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For measurements of cellular ATP and cytoplasmic Ca2+, cells were plated on Biocoat poly-d-lysine-coated black 96-well plates (BD Biosciences) at 50,000 cells per well. After 4–6 days in vitro, the initial plating medium was diluted with an equal volume of maintenance medium of the same composition lacking glutamate and l-glutamine and supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX-1 (Invitrogen). Cultures were fed every 3–4 days with fresh medium. All experiments were performed with cultures that were 13–15 days in vitro. These cultures were 91–95% neuronal, as estimated by immunocytochemical staining according to the manufacturer's protocols with anti-neuronal nuclei (Chemicon, mAB377) or anti-neurofilament 200 kDa (Calbiochem, IF06L). Measurement of Viability of Cortical Neurons Treated with Glutamate—Cell viability was measured in neurons cultured in 96-well plates using a cytotoxicity detection kit (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science). Data are expressed as percent cell death based upon measurement of LDH activity that was cell-associated versus that which was released to the medium. Cells were treated in HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS, containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 0.9 mm MgSO4) with 100 μm glutamate plus 10 μm glycine with or without pretreatment with 10 μm of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Control cultures were exposed to HBSS without glutamate or glycine. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of maintenance medium was added (supplemented with glutamate plus glycine and/or MK-801 to maintain constant concentration of these effectors). The cells were then placed back in the incubator for 24 h prior to measurement of viability. Alternatively, at the addition of the maintenance medium, 2× (20 μm) MK-801 was included to block NMDA receptor activity. Measurement of Neuronal Ca2+—Cytoplasmic Ca2+ was measured in neurons cultured in the 96-well plates using magfluo-4, a cell permeant low affinity Ca2+ dye (Molecular Probes). A stock solution of magfluo-4 (1 mg/ml) was prepared on the day of the experiment in Me2SO and then diluted in HBSS to a final concentration of 4 μm. The culture medium was carefully aspirated, and cells were loaded with the dye (100 μl of a 4 μm solution per well) for 25 min in the incubator. The loading buffer was then replaced with dye-free HBSS, and the plates were assayed in a fluorescent plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices) at 488 (excitation) and 525 nm (emission). Measurement of Neuronal ATP—The level of neuronal ATP was determined by using a CellTiter-Glo™ luminescent assay kit (Promega). Cells cultured in 96-well plates were treated with glutamate for varying lengths of time (from 10 to 40 min). Control cells were exposed to HBSS without glutamate and glycine for 10 min. At the end of the treatment, CellTiter-Glo™ reagent was added, and the plates were placed on a shaker for 5 min. In some experiments, the glutamate-containing medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated in Ca2+-free HBSS (containing 100 μm EGTA) for 3–6 min prior to the addition of CellTiter-Glo™ reagent. Luminescence was measured in a PolarStar plate reader (BMG). ATP levels are expressed as fmol/cell based upon an ATP standard curve, and data are corrected for background luminescent signal. Each set of data was collected from multiple replicate wells (n = 12) and plotted as mean ± S.E. Preparation of Cerebellar Granule Cells—Granule cells were prepared as described previously (18Courtney M.J. Lambert J.J. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3873-3879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from 7-day-old postnatal Wistar rats. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm plates at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per ml in a volume of ∼9 ml per plate. Cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts (Invitrogen) plus 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (HyClone), 25 mm KCl, 30 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). After 24 h, 10 mm cytosine arabinose was added to inhibit non-neuronal cell proliferation. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and were used after 7–8 days in vitro. Isolation of Mitochondria from Control and Glutamate-treated Neuronal Cultures—A method for isolation of functional mitochondria from primary neuronal cultures has been described previously (19Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protocols. 1998; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We used a modified protocol for rapid preparation of neuronal mitochondria suitable for assessment of bioenergetic parameters and the Ca2+ content. The culture medium was aspirated, and cells (cortical neurons or cerebellar granule cells) were exposed to 100 μm glutamate and 10 μm glycine in HBSS. Control cells were exposed to HBSS without glutamate and glycine. After glutamate addition, cells were returned to the incubator for 10 min. Next, the plates were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm EGTA. Cells were rapidly scraped in 1 ml (per plate) of ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and were then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (10 passes with a loose pestle and 10 passes with a tight pestle). Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1060 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The pellet was resuspended in the isolation buffer and centrifuged at 1060 × g for 5 min. The first and second supernatants were pooled together and centrifuged at 14,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the isolation buffer lacking EGTA and albumin and centrifuged at 14,600 × g for 10 min. All isolation steps were performed on ice. The protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Typically, 10–15 plates of cells were used for one mitochondrial preparation. Note that mitochondria were isolated in the absence of digitonin that is commonly used for disruption of the cholesterol-rich synaptosomal membranes to release mitochondria entrapped in synaptosomes (15Rosenthal R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our mitochondrial preparations from cultured neurons appear to be relatively free of synaptosomes as evidenced by the lack of an effect of digitonin on the maximal rate of respiration in the presence of succinate and rotenone (data not shown). Succinate is a mitochondrial substrate that is poorly permeable to the plasma membrane. Measurements of Mitochondrial Respiration, Membrane Potential, and Ca2+ in Isolated Neuronal Mitochondria—Simultaneous measurements of mitochondrial respiration (O2 consumption), Ca2+ fluxes, membrane potential, and optical density of the mitochondrial suspension were conducted in a custom-constructed thermostatically controlled chamber (B. Krasnikov, Burke Medical Research Institute, NY). Membrane potential (Δψ) was monitored by distribution of tetraphenylphosphonium (2 μm) with a tetraphenylphosphonium-selective electrode (20Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Extramitochondrial Ca2+ was monitored with a Selectophore I membrane (Fluka)-based Ca2+-selective electrode. A Clark-type electrode (Diamond General) was used to measure oxygen consumption. In addition, measurements of optical density at 660 nm by means of a light-emitting diode and photodetector permitted changes in mitochondrial volume to be followed. This parameter was also used to confirm consistency of protein concentrations between experimental runs. Digital data acquisition using a DynaRes 16 board and WorkBench software (Strawberry Tree) permitted simultaneous recording of all four parameters as well as plots of their first derivatives in real time. The first derivatives were used for quantification of respiration and Ca2+ uptake rates. For respiration measurements, mitochondria were incubated at 25 °C in a basal saline medium (125 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, and 2 mm phosphate) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 and either complex I-linked substrates (a mixture of 5 mm glutamate and 5 mm malate) or a complex II substrate (5 mm succinate in the presence of 2 μm rotenone). Protein concentrations were 1–1.5 mg/ml for cortical mitochondria and 0.7–1.3 mg/ml for cerebellar mitochondria. State 3 (phosphorylating) respiration was initiated by addition of 200 μm ADP, after which state 4 (resting) respiration was induced by addition of 100 μm atractyloside, an inhibitor of the ADP/ATP antiporter. Finally, to measure uncoupler-stimulated respiration (state 3u), sequential additions of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (20–50 nm) were made until the respiration rate reached maximum. The acceptor control ratio was determined as the ratio of state 3 to state 4 respiration. The experiments were completed within 2–3 h after the isolation procedure. Mitochondrial Ca2+ content was determined in the same basal medium (above) supplemented with glutamate and malate. Protein concentrations were in the same range as for the respiration measurements. After 2–3 min of incubation to allow for uptake of contaminating Ca2+ from the medium, mitochondrial Ca2+ was released into the medium by addition of FCCP (0.5 μm) followed 5 min later by the addition of the pore-forming peptide alamethicin (40 μg/ml) to ensure complete Ca2+ release. In some experiments, A23187 (1.2 μm), a Ca2+ ionophore, was also used to release sequestered Ca2+. The amount of Ca2+ released from mitochondria was calculated based upon calibration of the Ca2+ electrode performed at the end of each experimental day by additions of known concentrations of CaCl2 to the medium. EGTA (1 mm) was then added to chelate free Ca2+ in the medium. According to the Nernst equation, the voltage changes on the electrode are linearly related to the logarithm of Ca2+ concentration values in the medium. The concentration of contaminating Ca2+ in the medium was also experimentally determined. It was defined as an independent variable in the regression analysis shown in Equation 1, ΔV=a+b×log([Ca2+]+[Ca2+]0)(Eq. 1) where a and b are regression parameters expressed in relative units, and [Ca2+]0 is the concentration of contaminating Ca2+. R2 values for all calibration curves were no less than 0.995. The best fit parameters were used to calculate Ca2+ concentrations from the voltage changes in the experimental runs. The mitochondrial Ca2+ load was determined as the difference in Ca2+ concentration after addition of the Ca2+-releasing agent (FCCP or alamethicin) minus the contaminating Ca2+ in the medium and was normalized to mitochondrial protein concentration. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity was measured in the same medium as that used for mitochondrial Ca2+ content determination. Energized mitochondria were pulsed with successive additions of Ca2+ (30–50 μm) every 2–3 min. The increasing Ca2+ load caused a successive decline in the membrane potential and Ca2+ uptake rates. Maximal Ca2+ uptake capacity was defined as an amount of Ca2+ (per mg of protein) required to decrease the Ca2+ uptake rate by >90%. Note that because of the duration of the experimental run (25–40 min), most of these measurements were performed in an open chamber to avoid anoxia. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and n indicates the number of independent experiments. Each mitochondrial preparation was obtained from a separate neuronal harvest (or neuronal preparation). Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Tukey test was performed using SigmaStat. Where differences are noted, analysis of variance detected significant variance at p < 0.001, and pairwise comparisons are indicated in the figure legends. Materials—Unless indicated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Measurements of Cytoplasmic Ca2+ in Cortical Cultures— Mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation has been well established in different excitotoxicity models (21Peng T.I. Greenamyre J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 974-980PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nicholls D. Budd S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 23Wang G.J. Thayer S.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Alano C.C. Beutner G. Dirksen R.T. Gross R.A. Sheu S.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An intact cell study utilizing a dye with low affinity to Ca2+ has demonstrated that a significant fraction of accumulated Ca2+ is retained within the mitochondria during brief glutamate exposures until FCCP is added to induce Ca2+ efflux (25Brocard J.B. Tassetto M. Reynolds I.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 793-805Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on this approach, we performed measurements of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in situ with our cortical cultures to demonstrate that the conditions of glutamate treatment used in our model produces results consistent with literature data. Fig. 1 depicts results of a representative experiment in which cortical neurons were challenged with various concentrations of glutamate (in the presence of 10 μm glycine) for 10 min followed by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA and subsequent addition of FCCP. The responses to glutamate at concentrations between 30 and 300 μm were similar, and the pattern is typified by an initial peak in cytoplasmic Ca2+ that is followed relatively rapidly in these cultures by a more sustained and profound rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to 100 μm glutamate appeared to be maximal with regard to cytoplasmic Ca2+ and FCCP-induced release of Ca2+, as noted previously by others (25Brocard J.B. Tassetto M. Reynolds I.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 793-805Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar); therefore, we chose to probe in greater depth the bioenergetic changes occurring at this 10-min time point of glutamate exposure. Effect of Glutamate Treatment on Cellular ATP—As shown in Fig. 2, 10 min of glutamate exposure results in a significant drop in the ATP level (Fig. 2A). Longer exposures to glutamate (up to 40 min) did not further decrease the content of ATP. Partial ATP depletion could be a direct consequence of acute activation of ATP-requiring efforts by the cell to re-establish ionic homeostasis during glutamate stimulation, and/or the ATP loss could result from impairment of cellular ATP production. To test whether ATP could be readily recovered if the glutamate and Ca2+ challenge were halted, cells were exposed to glutamate for 10 min followed by incubation of the cells in a glutamate- and Ca2+-free buffer. Under these conditions, cytoplasmic Ca2+ fairly rapidly returns to a steady state level (see Fig. 1 described above); however, ATP did not recover within this time frame. This result suggests that the compromise in cellular ATP levels reflects a compromise in the ability of the cell to produce ATP at a normal rate. Effect of Glutamate Treatment on Neuronal Viability—We next tested the effects of glutamate exposure on the viability of the cortical cultures. By using LDH release as a method of assessing plasma membrane permeability, we found that 24 h of continuous exposure of these cultures to 100 μm glutamate resulted in a significant loss in viability that was inhibited by 10 μm of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (Fig. 3). Even though ionic homeostasis appears to be lost and mitochondrial Ca2+ loading is maximal after 10 min of glutamate exposure (Fig. 1), if this treatment is halted by addition of MK-801 for the ensuing 24 h, the injury is no longer sufficient to induce LDH release substantially above control levels (Fig. 3), at least at this time point. Therefore, cellular events leading up to the 10 min time point may be critical to initiation of the cell death pathway, but these events have not resulted in commitment of the cells to acute cell death. Quantitative Estimation of Ca2+ in Mitochondria from Control and Glutamate-treated Neurons—The ability of mitochondria in glutamate-treated cells to release accumulated Ca2+ in response to FCCP argues against pervasive induction of a permeability transition in the mitochondrial population, as this would prevent retention of mitochondrial Ca2+. As shown on Fig. 4A, trace b, addition of FCCP to mitochondria from glutamate-treated cells caused a rapid release of a significant amount of Ca2+ presumably via reversal of the Ca2+ uniporter as a result of depolarization of the membrane (26Jurkowitz M.S. Geisbuhler T. Jung D.W. Brierley G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This FCCP-induced release is relatively slow and was still progressing at a significant rate 5 min after the uncoupler addition (Fig. 4A, trace c; note that the y scale is logarithmic). Therefore, we used a pore-forming peptide alamethicin to quickly attain complete release (Fig. 4A, trace c). Quantitative estimation of mitochondrial Ca2+ (performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that the total Ca2+ released in response to FCCP and alamethicin reached 167 ± 19 nmol/mg protein (n = 8). In the 5-min time frame, FCCP-released about half of the total Ca2+ (86 ± 14 nmol/mg protein, n = 8). More importantly, the amount of Ca2+ released from mitochondria isolated from untreated cells was very low (1.9 ± 0.8 nmol/mg protein, n = 5; Fig. 4A, trace b). Note that the amount of contaminating Ca2+ taken up into mitochondria from the incubation medium (2.5 ± 1.6 nmol/mg protein, n = 13) was subtracted from the amount of Ca2+ released into the medium. We do not exclude the possibility that a fraction of damaged mitochondria could be lost during preparation, but there was no apparent difference in the yields of mitochondria isolated from control and glutamate-treated cells. As well, we cannot exclude the possibility that a subfraction of mitochondria may have undergone the permeability transition and released their accumulated Ca2+ prior to isolation. Both of these possibilities would result in an underestimation of the quantities of retained Ca2+. Although it is possible that mitochondrial Ca2+ could be lost during isolation, the standard conditions for preparation of mitochondria, such as low temperature, the presence of EGTA, and the absence of Na+ in the isolation buffers, minimize changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ during the isolation procedure. This statement is supported by direct Ca2+ measurements in Ca2+-loaded brain mitochondria after prolonged incubation under conditions that mimic our isolation procedure (27Zaidan E. Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because alamethicin is nonselective, and endoplasmic reticulum is a persistent contaminant of mitochondrial preparations, we performed additional experiments to confirm that the released Ca2+ was primarily of mitochondrial origin. Pretreatment of intact cortical neurons for 15 min prior to glutamate addition with 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, did not affect Ca2+ release in response to FCCP and alamethicin (Fig. 4B, traces a versus b). This observation suggests that the Ca2+ released by alamethicin is primarily mitochondrial. Determination of Ca2+ Uptake Capacity in Mitochondria from Cortical Neurons—As discussed above, the results of Fig. 1 imply that the mitochondrial Ca2+ load is saturated under our standard conditions (100 μm glutamate and 10 min of treatment). At a low level of glutamate, the mitochondrial Ca2+ load appears to be limited by Ca2+ availability as indicated by a near basal steady state level of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 1, trace e). In contrast, one might presume that unde"

Although a β2-L119Q mutation strongly reduced the affinity of all three α-conotoxins, β2-F117A, β2-V109A, and β2-V109G mutations selectively enhanced the binding of MII and GID. An increased activity of α-conotoxins GID and MII was also observed when the β2-F117A mutant was combined with the α4 instead of the α3 subunit. Investigation of A10L-PnIA indicated that high affinity binding to β2-F117A, β2-V109A, and β2-V109G mutants was conferred by amino acids with a long side chain in position 10 (PnIA numbering).

Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein. comprise a large family of ion channels formed by the heteropentameric assembly of homologous subunits. α-Conotoxins, small disulfide-rich peptides isolated from the venom of predatory cone snails, potently and selectively block nAChRs (1McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). They act as competitive antagonists at the ACh binding site, which is formed at the interface between neighboring subunits. These α-conotoxins can distinguish between muscle and neuronal nAChRs subtypes and even between different binding sites within the same receptor. As a result, they are widely used as pharmacological tools for the subtype differentiation of nAChRs in native tissues (2Nicke A. Wonnacott S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2305-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The 4/7 (4 residues in loop 1 and 7 in loop 2) α-conotoxins are of particular interest given their ability to discriminate between diverse neuronal α-β nAChR subunit combinations. For example, MII was found to be selective for the α3 and especially the α6 subunit containing nAChRs (3Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J.

MII, PnIA, and GID share an identical backbone structure common to all 4/7 α-conotoxins investigated (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J.

Therefore, their specific selectivities are thought to arise from their different amino acid side chains. As a consequence, understanding the molecular determinants of their interaction with the receptor may help in the design of optimized pharmacological tools for the nAChRs with novel or improved selectivities. However, the lack of detailed information on the three-dimensional structure of the α-conotoxin binding site has hampered such projects. The acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) crystal structure solved by Sixma and colleagues (12Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar) recently provided a template to create homology models of the ligand binding domain of receptor members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels family. Homology models of the ligand binding domain of α7, α3β2, α3β4, and α4β2 nAChR subtypes are already providing useful insights into ligand-receptor interactions at the molecular level (13Le Novere N. Grutter T. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 14Schapira M. Abagyan R. Totrov M. BMC Struct.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 319-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our previous docking simulations of α-conotoxins ImI and PnIB on an α7 nAChR homology model revealed that these two peptides target a small cleft forming one of two possible entrances to the ACh binding site (17Dutertre S. Nicke A. Tyndall J.D. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We could also identify an equivalent cleft on an α3β2 model as the likely region of the α3β2 nAChR targeted by these peptides. Upon examination of this model, it was apparent that the β2 subunit contributed more than the α subunit to the formation of this cleft, suggesting an important role of β-residues for binding and/or selectivity. In this study, we mutated three residues in the β2 subunit residues located in this cleft to characterize the contribution of the β subunit to α-conotoxin binding. Each of these mutants influenced the binding of α-conotoxins MII, GID, and PnIA. Additionally, molecular surface analysis revealed striking shape complementarity between the highly conserved N-terminal half of the 4/7 α-conotoxins structure and the cleft. Finally, docking experiments showed that both MII and PnIA bind deep into the α3β2 nAChR cleft, explaining at the molecular level the experimental results obtained from mutagenesis studies. Based on these results, we propose that the conserved cleft above the β9β10 hairpin is the binding site for 4/7 α-conotoxins active at α7, α3β2, and α4β2 nAChRs and that the differences in the cleft residues provide the determinants directing α-conotoxin selectivity. Materials—cDNAs encoding neuronal nAChRs were provided by J. Patrick (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pNKS2 (18Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene. 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MII, PnIA, and GID were gifts from J. T. Blanchfield (School of Pharmacy, The University of Queensland, Australia), G. Hopping and M. Loughnan (Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Australia), respectively, and were synthesized as described previously (9Nicke A. Loughnan M.L. Millard E.L.

Homology Modeling—The FASTA format of the α3 and β2 rat sequences were retrieved from the ligand-gated ion channel data base (pasteur.fr/recherche/banques/LGIC/). Their extracellular ligand-binding domains were aligned with the AChBP sequence as described previously (21Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A homology model of the α3β2 nAChR subtype was built on a Silicon Graphics Octane R12000 work station using the MODELLER program (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10635) Google Scholar). The AChBP structure (1I9B) was loaded in the INSIGHT II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) environment and used as a template. Three models were built with a high “optimize level.” The two options “optimize loop models” and “loop optimize level” were set to 3 and high, respectively. User disulfide was selected to assign the disulfide bonds as in AChBP except for the missing vicinal disulfide in the β2 subunit. The model with the lowest root mean square deviation compared with AChBP was refined further and used for these studies. Steepest descent energy minimizations were applied using the AMBER force field and DISCOVER program implemented in Insight II. Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of the β2 nAChR subunit cDNA was achieved using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used to generate the mutants were from Proligo (Lismore, Australia). All mutations were confirmed by cDNA sequencing. Electrophysiological Recordings—cRNA was synthesized from linearized plasmids with SP6 RNA polymerase using the mMessageMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from Nasco International (Fort Atkinson, WI) or Firma Kähler (Hamburg, Germany). X. laevis oocytes were prepared as described previously (6Quik M. Polonskaya Y. Kulak J.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5494-5500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and injected with 50-nl aliquots of cRNA (0.5 μg/μl). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed in oocytes 1-10 days after cRNA injection at a holding potential of -70 mV. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with 3 m KCl. Resistances were below 1 megohm. Membrane currents were recorded using a Turbo Tec-10CX or a Turbo Tec 05X Amplifier (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany) filtered at 200 Hz and digitized at 400 Hz. Version 8.53 Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) or Cell-Works software were used. The perfusion medium was automatically switched between ND96 with or without agonist (100 μm ACh) using a custom-made magnetic valve system. A fast and reproducible solution exchange (<300 ms) for agonist application was achieved using a 50-μl funnel-shaped oocyte chamber combined with a fast solution flow (∼150 μl/s) fed through a custom-made manifold mounted immediately above the oocyte. ACh pulses were applied for 2 s at 4-min intervals. After each application, the cell was superfused for 1 min with agonist-free solution, and the flow was then stopped for 3 min. Peptide was mixed from a 10-fold stock into the static bath when responses to three consecutive agonist applications differed by less than 10%. Addition of toxin directly to the recording chamber conserved material and avoided adhesion of the toxin to tubing surfaces. To obtain estimates of potency, dose-response curves were fit to the data by the equation % response = 100/{1 + ([toxin]/IC50)nH} using Prism software (GraphPad version 3.0 for Macintosh, San Diego, CA). To obtain estimates of toxin dissociation rates, agonist responses were measured at 2-min intervals under constant superfusion, and after stabilization of responses, oocytes were incubated with toxin in a static bath for 1 min. To obtain estimates of the toxin association rate, oocytes were continuously superfused with solution containing the indicated toxin concentration and ACh pulses were applied in 1- or 2-min intervals. Association and dissociation curves were fit to the data by the equations % response = (100 - plateau) × e-K × time + plateau and % response = span (1 - e-K × time) + plateau, respectively. Docking Experiments—Docking simulations of α-conotoxins were carried out as described in Dutertre et al. (17Dutertre S. Nicke A. Tyndall J.D. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, MII and PnIA structures were retrieved from the protein data bank (Protein Data Bank codes 1MII and 1PEN, respectively) and docked onto an α3β2 homology model using the program GOLD, version 1.2 (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, UK). One NMR/crystal structure was chosen for each α-conotoxin, as GOLD treats ligands as flexible molecules with side chain orientations optimized during calculations. As conotoxins are competitive antagonists, the active site radius was set at 20 Å from Trp-147 to ensure the analysis focused on residues around the ACh binding site. From the 100 docked structures obtained for each conotoxin, the selection of the final docked structure was based on a low scoring function determined in GOLD (23Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5464) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling Identifies Val-109, Phe-117, and Leu-119 in the β2 nAChR Subunit as Likely Residues Interacting with α-Conotoxins MII and PnIA—We previously identified two cavities at opposite sides of the β9/10 hairpin (C-loop of an α subunit) on the surface of the nAChR, one large and easily accessible and one small and narrow, from which the ACh binding site could be reached (21Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To differentiate between these two cavities and avoid confusion, we propose the use of “cavity” to refer to the larger one (below the β9β10 hairpin, close to the cell membrane), and “cleft” to refer to the smaller one (above the β9β10 hairpin). The cavity has recently been confirmed to represent the binding site used by the large snake neurotoxins to block the nAChR (24Bourne Y. Talley T.T. Hansen S.B. Taylor P. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar), whereas the cleft represents the likely region targeted by α-conotoxins (17Dutertre S. Nicke A. Tyndall J.D. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Docking simulations with ImI and PnIB structures on an α7 nAChR model revealed overlapping but different binding sites for α-conotoxins and snake toxins (17Dutertre S. Nicke A. Tyndall J.D. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both α-conotoxins block the receptor by targeting a small cleft above the β9/10 hairpin that is also blocked by the small peptide antagonist toxin waglerin (25Molles B.E. Tsigelny I. Nguyen P.D. Gao S.X. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7895-7906Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the non-peptidic antagonist d-tubocurarine (26Gao F. Bern N. Little A. Wang H.L. Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Taylor P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Concerning the α3β2 nAChR, only one residue (β2-Thr-57) weakly affecting 4/7 conotoxin binding has been identified on the β2 subunit compared with four on the α3 subunit (27Everhart D. Reiller E. Mirzoian A. McIntosh J.M. Malhotra A. Luetje C.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 664-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Harvey S.C. McIntosh J.M. Cartier G.E. Maddox F.N. Luetje C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β2-Thr-57 is located above the β9β10 hairpin, forming part of the cleft in α3β2 together with three other residues, Val-109, Phe-117, and Leu-119. A potentially important role for additional residues in the β subunit is suggested from binding kinetic studies where exchange of the β2 subunit by the β4 subunit (in combination with α3 or α6 subunits) strongly reduced the off-rate constants of PIA (29Dowell C. Olivera B.M. Garrett J.E. Staheli S.T. Watkins M. Kuryatov A. Yoshikami D. Lindstrom J.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8445-8452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, BuIA showed much slower dissociation if α2, α3, α4, or α6 subunits are combined with β4 instead of β2 (30Azam L. Dowell C. Watkins M. Stitzel J.A. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 80-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify additional determinants in the β subunit that contribute to the binding and selectivity of 4/7 α-conotoxins, we mutated Leu-119, which appears deep in the cleft, as well as Phe-117 and Val-109, which form part of the wall of the cleft (Fig. 1). Residue Leu-119 Is Generally Important for α-Conotoxin Binding—A leucine in position β2-119 lies at the bottom of the cleft and is conserved in neuronal β4 and α7 nAChR subunits as well as in the muscle δ, γ, and ϵ nAChR subunits. Thus, a leucine is present at this location in all non-α subunits (and the (-) face of the α7 nAChR) for which highly active α-conotoxins have been identified. Indeed, no potent α-conotoxin has been found for the α9 and α10 subunits, which have a negatively charged aspartic acid at this position. In combination with the docking studies, this suggests that the hydrophobic environment created by β2-Leu-119 and the corresponding leucine residues in other subunits plays an important role in the high affinity interaction with α-conotoxins. To test the hypothesis that Leu-119 is generally important for α-conotoxin binding, the activity of three different α-conotoxins that bind with high affinity to the α3β2 nAChRs was tested on the hydrophilic α3β2-L119Q mutant. The α3β2/α6β2-selective α-conotoxin MII as well as the α3β2/α7-selective α-conotoxins PnIA and GID had a strongly reduced activity (Fig. 2, A-C), with 40-fold (PnIA), 165-fold (GID), and 300-fold (MII) higher IC50 values at this mutant α3β2 receptor (Table I). This is the strongest effect described thus far for a non-α subunit mutant affecting α-conotoxin binding. Based on its position at the bottom of the cleft and the fact that the activity of all three conotoxins was reduced by at least 40-fold upon introduction of a similar length hydrophilic residue (Gln), Leu-119 may play an important stabilizing role for the interaction with α-conotoxins, allowing them to bind deep into the nAChR cleft.Table IIC50 values and 95% confidence interval for α-conotoxins on wild type and mutant nAChR combinationsα-ConotoxinsIC50Hill slopenmMIIα3β26.08(4.87-7.61)b95% confidence interval values are shown in parentheses.1.38(0.94-1.83)α3β2F117A4.66(3.59-6.05)1.04(0.80-1.27)α3β2V109A3.98(3.58-4.43)1.22(1.10-1.33)α3β2V109G4.61(3.70-5.75)1.29(1.01-1.56)α3β2L119Q1,810(1,380-2,380)0.99(0.73-1.25)GIDα3β25.09(4.17-6.22)1.60(1.11-2.10)α3β2F117A3.52(2.81-4.42)1.29(0.90-1.68)α3β2V109A4.91(4.39-5.48)1.52(1.26-1.78)α3β2V109G3.72(3.27-4.22)1.45(1.18-1.71)α3β2L119Q839.20(752.8-935.5)0.90(0.79-1.01)PnIAα3β27.74(6.79-8.81)0.85(0.74-0.97)α3β2F117A7.81(6.71-9.08)0.93(0.79-1.07)α3β2V109A10.12(7.11-14.43)1.06(0.64-1.47)α3β2V109G34.39(26.47-44.68)0.86(0.60-1.12)α3β2L119Q295.80(177.3-493.6)0.88(0.54-1.23)[A10L]PnIAα3β255.23(50.69-60.18)1.09(0.95-1.23)α3β2F117A3.99(3.14-5.06)1.03(0.75-1.31)α3β2V109A3.00(2.73-3.31)1.19(1.04-1.33)α3β2V109G2.40(1.95-2.96)1.36(0.97-1.75)MIIα4β2548.40(400.6-750.7)0.97(0.69-1.25)α4β2F117A45.46(31.38-65.84)1.10(0.72-1.49)GIDα4β2390.00(340.9-446.1)1.31(1.09-1.54)α4β2F117A58.73(44.52-77.48)1.35(0.83-1.87)PnIAα4β2≫1000NDaND, not determined.α4β2F117A≫1000NDα4β2V109A≫1000NDα4β2V109G≫1000ND[A10L]PnIAα4β2≫1000NDα4β2F117A≫1000NDα4β2V109A≫1000NDα4β2V109G131.60(101.4-170.9)1.07(0.78-1.36)a ND, not determined.b 95% confidence interval values are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab In addition to the four cysteines, which are involved in two disulfide bonds and are mostly buried within the peptide core, only serine and proline residues are common to all three α-conotoxins. Because mutation of Ser-4 in MII did not affect potency (31Everhart D. Cartier G.E. Malhotra A. Gomes A.V. McIntosh J.M. Luetje C.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2732-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we suspect that Leu-119 might interact with the α-conotoxin backbone or the conserved proline found in 4/7 α-conotoxins (third residue of loop 1). However, this possibility is difficult to test by double mutant cycle analysis because alteration of the conserved cysteine or proline residues in the conotoxin alters the peptide backbone conformation. Alanine Exchange of Val-109 and Phe-17 Specifically Enhances Binding of MII and GID—In our model of the β2 subunit, residues Val-109 and Phe-117 lie adjacent to each other on two neighboring antiparallel β-strands and above the Leu-119 residue, potentially forming the walls of the α-conotoxin binding cleft (Fig. 1). By mutating the residues into the smaller alanine, we expected to weaken the interaction with α-conotoxins. Unexpectedly, both the F117A and V109A mutations produced IC50 values for MII, GID, and PnIA little different from those at the wild type receptor, suggesting that Phe-117 and Val-109 do not have close interactions with the α-conotoxins (Fig. 2, A-C, Table I). The same effect was observed for V109G (except for PnIA, where a slight decrease in affinity was observed). However, the off-rates of MII were affected by all three mutations (Table II), resulting in a very slowly reversible block by MII (Fig. 3A). A similar effect on the binding was observed with GID (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the off-rates of PnIA appeared to be hardly affected by the mutations (Fig. 3C). The finding that alanine exchange of Val-109 or Phe-117 decreased the off-rate constants of MII and GID without an obvious change in the IC50 value implied that a similar reduction in on-rate had occurred to balance the off-rate change or that the IC50 value had not been determined accurately because of the short 3-min preincubation times. To obtain a more accurate estimate of the potency, on-rates of MII binding to the wild type and F117A mutant were compared. As expected, the F117A mutant displayed a much slower on-rate for MII compared with its on-rate at the wild type receptor (Fig. 4A). Calculated on- and off-rates for MII at the α3β2F117A mutant produced a Ki value of 0.69 nm (Fig. 4B), ∼ 10-fold lower than the experimentally determined IC50 value (Fig. 2A, Table I). Unfortunately, the long incubation times necessary to determine the real IC50 values at the α3β2F117A and Val-109 mutants were not practical because of run-up/down effects on nAChR current seen in oocytes and the large amounts of toxin needed for superfusion. Therefore, to complement the IC50 value determinations, we compared off-rates as a measure of toxin affinity that is independent of toxin concentration or preincubation time. Because not only the off-rate constants but also the on-rate constant of GID and MII on the Val-109 and Phe-117 mutants were decreased, we propose that these residues comprise part of a short access path or an intermediate binding state that α-conotoxins transition past before reaching (or leaving) their high affinity bound state.Table IIOff-rate constants of α-conotoxins at wild type and mutant nAChR combinationsα-Conotoxinskoffmin−1MIIα3β20.07(0.04-0.1)b95% confidence interval values are shown by numbers in parentheses.α3β2F117ANDaND, not detectable.(8.9 ± 0.7% recovery in 20 min)α3β2V109AND(11.4 ± 2.6% recovery in 20 min)α3β2V109GND(14.1 ± 2.5% recovery in 20 min)GIDα3β20.19(0.15-0.22)α3β2F117AND(15.2 ± 3.0% recovery in 20 min)α3β2V109A0.09(0.06-0.12)α3β2V109G0.03(0.01-0.05)PnIAα3β2ND(100% recovery in 2 min)α3β2F117AND(100% recovery in 4 min)α3β2V109AND(100% recovery in 4 min)α3β2V109GND(100% recovery in 2 min)[A10L]PnIAα3β2ND(100% recovery in 2 min)α3β2F117A0.09(0.07-0.11)α3β2V109A0.12(0.09-0.15)α3β2V109GND(13.2 ± 3.3% recovery in 20 min)a ND, not detectable.b 95% confidence interval values are shown by numbers in parentheses.

However, it cannot be excluded that this is a secondary effect because of an alteration in the conformation of the α subunit induced by the mutation in the β subunit. To address this aspect, we investigated whether these β2 effects were preserved in combination with a different α subunit. Both MII and GID showed nanomolar activity at the α4β2 nAChR subtype, whereas no activity was observed for PnIA at concentration up to 1 μm. When the α4 subunit was combined with the β2-F117A mutation, both GID and MII showed an ∼10-fold increase in activity (Fig. 5A) that was likewise paralleled by a clearly decreased off-rate (results not shown). This further indicates that the binding modes of MII and GID within the binding pocket are conserved across the α4β2 and α3β2 receptor interfaces and that the β subunit contributes directly to α-conotoxin potency. Whereas the overall higher IC50 values at the α4β2 combination suggest that the contribution of the α4 subunit to conotoxin binding is smaller than that of the α3 subunit, the inactivity of PnIA could also be explained by a residue in PnIA that prevents an interaction with the α4 subunit. The Length of the Side Chains in Position 10 of the α-Conotoxins Determines the Strength of the Interaction with the Val-109 and Phe-117 Mutants—Sequence comparison of PnIA with MII and GID (Fig. 6) shows that there are 7 residues in PnIA (Leu-5, Pro-7, Ala-7, Ala-10, Pro-13, Asp-14, and"

They are either secreted extracellularly or bound to plasma membrane. Membrane type MMPs and stromelysin-3 (ST3) are activated intracellularly through a furin-dependent process (4Pei D. Weiss S.J.

The other MMPs are secreted as inactive proenzymes, which are activated upon the removal of the propeptide through various mechanisms (6van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mature (i.e. activated) MMPs are capable of cleaving, at least in vitro, ECM components with distinct but overlapping substrate specificity (2Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York2004Google Scholar, 9Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ECM is a complex structure made of numerous proteinaceous and other components (10Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed.

It serves as the structural scaffold to hold cells together in various organs or tissues. It can also influence cell fate and behavior through direct interactions with cells or indirect effects on cellular function by regulating cell-cell interactions and controlling the availability of various factors such as growth factors present in the ECM (12Mott J.D.

MMPs are expected to exert their effects on cells, at least in part, through their ability to remodel the ECM by cleaving specific ECM components. In addition, a number of studies suggest that MMPs can also cleave non-ECM proteins (2Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.

MMPs are expressed in a number of developmental and pathological processes (14Lochter A. Bissell M.J. APMIS. 1999; 107: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Vu T.H. Werb Z.

Animal studies with natural and synthetic MMP inhibitors have provided supporting evidence for the involvement of MMPs in tumor invasion (16Nelson A.R. Fingleton B.M. Rothenberg M.L. Matrisian L.M.

In addition, MMPs, including ST3, have more recently been implicated to regulate tumor initiation and growth (16Nelson A.R. Fingleton B.M. Rothenberg M.L. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). For example, mice lacking membrane type 1 MMP, although apparently normal at birth, develop a number of severe defects including dwarfism, craniofacial dysmorphism, impaired endochondral ossification, and angiogenesis and die within several weeks (23Zhou Z. Apte S.S. Soininen R. Cao R. Baaklini G.Y. rauser R.W. Wang J. Cao Y. Tryggvason K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 24Holmbeck K.

On the other hand, mice lacking any one of other MMPs, including ST3, often show little or weak phenotypes (21Masson R. Lefebvre O. Noel A. Fahime M.E. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Kebers F. LeMeur M. Dierich A. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 25Stickens D. Behonick D.J. Ortega N. Heyer B. Hartenstein B. Yu Y.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). This is probably due to redundancy in the activity of MMP genes in development. In addition, the importance of MMPs in development may vary in different organs for a given MMP, although it may be expressed in many organs. This would result in MMP knock-out animals that appear normal but have defects in certain organs/tissues. For example, mice lacking MMP13 (collagenase 3) have abnormal skeletal growth plate development (25Stickens D. Behonick D.J. Ortega N. Heyer B. Hartenstein B. Yu Y. Fosang A.J. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Werb Z. Development. 2004; 131: 5883-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and mice lacking MMP2 (gelatinase A) or MMP3 (stromelysin-1) have altered mammary gland branching morphogenesis (26Wiseman B.S. Sternlicht M.D. Lund L.R. Alexander C.M. Mott J.D. Bissell M.J. Soloway P. Itohara S. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, a proper model system is highly beneficial for studying the function of MMPs in development in vivo. We have been using amphibian metamorphosis as a model to study the role of MMPs in postembryonic organogenesis in vertebrates. Postembryonic development is difficult to study in mammals due to an inability to manipulate the uterus-enclosed embryos. Amphibian metamorphosis involves changes in essentially all tissues/organs of the tadpole as it changes into a frog and has been used for nearly a century as a model for studying postembryonic organ remodeling and development (28Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Although different tissues/organs undergo drastically different changes, such as total resorption and de novo development, all changes are controlled by thyroid hormone (T3), and they can be easily manipulated by simply controlling the availability of T3 to the tadpoles or even in vitro cultures of tadpole organs (28Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of MMPs have been shown to be activated by T3 during metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis and Rana catesbeiana (28Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 29Jung J.-C. Leco K.J. Edwards D.R. Fini M.E. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 223: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In particular, the expression of the Xenopus ST3 but not several other MMPs correlates tightly with larval or tadpole cell death (apoptosis) in different organs (30Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Berry D.L. Rose C.S. Remo B.F. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our own studies focus on the function of ST3 during intestinal metamorphosis in X. laevis. The tadpole intestine is a simple tubular organ consisting predominantly of a single layer of larval epithelial cells surrounded by a sparse layer of connective tissue (except in the single epithelial fold, the typhlosole) and thin layers of muscles (33Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 205-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During metamorphosis, the larval epithelial cells are induced by T3 to die through apoptosis, and concurrently, the undifferentiated adult epithelial cells and cells of the connective tissue and muscles proliferate extensively (28Shi Y.-B. Amphibian Metamorphosis: From Morphology to Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 33Shi Y.-B. Ishizuya-Oka A. Curr. Topics Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 205-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toward the end of metamorphosis, the adult epithelial cells differentiate to form a multiply folded adult epithelium surrounded by elaborate connective tissue and muscles. During this process, the expression of Xenopus ST3 is spatially and temporally correlated with not only larval epithelial cell death but also the remodeling of the basal lamina, the ECM that separates the epithelium and the connective tissue (32Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Ishizuya-Oka A. Li Q. Amano T. Damjanovski S. Ueda S. Shi Y.-B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ST3 is likely to influence cell behavior during intestinal metamorphosis by directly or indirectly modifying the ECM. To investigate whether ST3 can remodel the ECM and influence cell fate in vivo, we have adapted the restriction enzyme-mediated transgenesis (35Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to overexpress ST3 in X. laevis. Our initial studies showed that overexpression of ST3 in embryos leads to embryonic lethality, thus preventing the analysis of ST3 function in postembryonic development (36Damjanovski S. Amano T. Li Q. Pei D. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we generated transgenic animals expressing wild type ST3 or a catalytically inactive mutant under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter. We show that precocious expression of wild type but not mutant ST3 leads to ECM degradation and larval epithelial cell death in the intestine, consistent with a role of ST3 in ECM remodeling as a mechanism of T3-induced apoptosis during intestinal metamorphosis. Animals and Transgenesis—Wild type tadpoles were purchased from Xenopus I, Inc. (Dexter, MI), and, when indicated, stage 54 premetamorphic tadpoles at a density of 2 tadpoles/liter were treated with 5 nm T3 for 3 days. Adult wild type X. laevis were purchased from Nasco. Transgenesis was carried out as described (35Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Damjanovski S. Amano T. Li Q. Pei D. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals were generated by using a double promoter construct containing the γ-crystalline promoter driving the expression of GFP3, a different version of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that contains a number of amino acid substitutions (38Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. Ryan K. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Gurdon J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 3719-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and heat shock-inducible promoter driving either the wild type or catalytically inactive ST3 fused to GFP (pCGHSwG or pCGHSmG, respectively) (36Damjanovski S.

Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The latter construct, pCGHSmG, was generated by excising the coding region for the inactive mutant ST3 from the CSmG construct (36Damjanovski S. Amano T. Li Q. Pei D. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with AgeI digestion and inserting it into AgeI-digested pCGHSwG, replacing the ST3 coding region. When indicated, the F0 transgenic animals (i.e. those generated directly from the transgenesis procedure) were reared to adulthood. Male F0 transgenic animals were sacrificed to obtain the sperm to generate F1 transgenic animals as described (39Buchholz D.R. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 67: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Wild type and transgenic tadpoles at the indicated stages were heat-shocked at 33 °C for 30 min twice with a 30-min space at 18 °C (37Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod.

The wild type and transgenic tadpoles were reared and treated with heat shock together in a single container. When needed, the transgenic animals were identified under a UV dissecting microscope with a Chroma filter set for GFP expression in the eyes. Tadpoles were photographed by using an RT Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) attached to the dissecting microscope. Intestine Histology and TUNEL Assay—Wild type and transgenic tadpoles at the indicated stages were heat-shocked to induce transgene expression. Tissue fragments were isolated from the anterior part of the small intestine, rinsed in 0.6× phosphate-buffered saline to remove food contamination, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.6× phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The fixed specimens were then infiltrated in 0.5 m sucrose in 0.6× phosphate-buffered saline for 2–3 h and embedded in OCT cryogenic embedding medium (Electron Microscopy Science). Cross-sections were cut at 6 μm and placed on Fisher Probe-On charged slides and dried on a slide warmer at 37 °C for 2 h or overnight prior to use. The sections were hydrated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and stained with methyl green-pyronin Y (Muto, Tokyo, Japan) for histologic observation (41Ishizuya-Oka A. Ueda S. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A TUNEL assay on tissue sections was performed as previously described (32Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Four days after the initial heat shock treatment, the wild type and transgenic tadpoles were sacrificed and dissected as described above. The anterior part of intestines were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed in 0.2 m sucrose in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.5), and postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. They were then stained en bloc with uranyl acetate and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate and examined with a JEOL 200CX electron microscope. In Situ Hybridization—A partial cDNA encoding Xenopus ST3 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with mRNA extracted from Xenopus intestine at stage 61 with the primers 5′-TGGGACAAGACAAACCTGACGTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGAGATAGAAGAATGCTGCAGGC-3′ (reverse). The RT-PCR product was cloned into pCR IITOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. To synthesize an antisense RNA probe, this plasmid was linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization of sections was performed as described (42Matsuda H. Yokoyama H. Endo T. Tamura K. Ide H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Northern Blot—Total RNA from wild type and transgenic embryos or tadpole tissues was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization or RT-PCR. Northern blot hybridization was done as previously described with a 32P-labeled ST3 probe (43Patterton D. Hayes W.P. Shi Y.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed by using Superscript One-Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen) from 0.1 μg of total RNA as described (44Buchholz D.R. Hsia V.S.-C. Fu L. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6750-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). RT-PCR for the transgene was done with the primers 5′-GGT ATC CTC ACC TGA TCA GTC AAG-3′ (in the ST3 coding region) and 5′-CTT CAG CAC GTG TCT TGT AGT TCC-3′ (in the GFP coding region). Other primers used were 5′-CAT CTT CTT CAA GGA CGA CGG G-3′ and 5′-AGT TGC ACG CCG CCG TCT TCG-3′ for GFP3 and 5′-CGA AGG TTA TGT ACA GGA AAG AAC T-3′ and 5′-TTC CAT CTT CAA TGT TGT GTC TAA-3′ for the GFP originating from pS65T-C1 (Clontech) and fused to the ST3 gene at its C terminus (37Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All RT-PCRs included an internal control amplifying a fragment of ribosome protein L8 (rpL8) with primers 5′-CGT GGT GCT CCT CTT GCC AAG-3′ and 5′-GAC GAC CAG TAC GAC GAG CAG-3′ (45Shi Y.-B. Liang V. C.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The RNA for RT-PCR was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) to remove any DNA contamination and repurified with TRIzol reagent before RT-PCR (Invitrogen). RT-PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels, visualized with ethidium bromide staining under UV lights, and photographed with an Eastman Kodak Co. imaging system (Gel Logic 100 Imaging System). When indicated, quantitative RT-PCR was also carried out to quantify the gene expression levels. In brief, 100 ng of total RNA each was reverse transcribed in 20 μl of the reaction system according to the manufacturer's instructions for the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems), and 4 μl of each cDNA was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis with primers and probes (Table I) synthesized through Assay-by-Design (Applied Biosystems). Mixed total RNA isolated from tadpoles of all stages encompassing the entire metamorphosing period was reverse transcribed at a higher concentration (1 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of the reaction system) to serve as standard samples to produce a standard curve for the quantitative PCR analysis, where the cDNA was diluted at series of 1:2 or 1:3 and covered the whole range of the tested samples. All of the quantitative PCRs were carried out with a quantitative PCR machine (Model 7000 Sequence Detection System; Applied Biosystems). A set of primer/probe specific for rpL8 was used as a control for RNA input of each sample, and the expression level of the gene of interest within each sample was normalized to that of rpL8.Table IPrimer/probe sets for quantitative RT-PCR The primer/probe set for the endogenous ST3 had the forward primer located in the 5′-untranslated region; the primer/probe set for the transgenic ST3 fused to GFP (ST3-GFP) had the reverse primer in the GFP region; the primer/probe set for both the endogenous ST3 and transgenic ST3-GFP had the primers and probes all in the ST3 coding region.Targeted geneForward primerReverse primerProbeST35′-CACTTGTAGCCATTGTATCACACTCA-3′5′-GCCATGATCTTTCTGAGGCTTTTC-3′5′-ATGCATTCTCACAAGCTGT-3′ST3-GFP5′-GTCAAGCAAGCTCTACATTTGTTAATTCA-3′5′-ATTGGGACAACTCCAGTGAAAAGT-3′5′-TCGCCACCATGGGTAAA-3′ST3/ST3-GFP5′-GTGGTCGAAATCGTCAGAAACG-3′5′-CGGATGATCTTGTACGTCAGGTT-3′5′-ACGCTGGGACAAGACA-3′RpL85′-AGAAGGTCATCTCATCTGCAAACAG-3′5′-CAATACGACCACCTCCAGCAA-3′5′-CAACCCCAACAATAGCT-3′IFABP5′-AAGGTTGACAGAAGTGAAAACTATGAGAA-3′5′-CCATCTTGCTGGATTATGACCTTCA-3′5′-CTTCCGTTTCACTATATTTAC-3′Gel A5′-GACGATGATGAGCTTTGGACACTA-3′5′-GAACTCTCCATCTGCATTACCATACTT-3′5′-ACAACTTGGCCTTCTCC-3′TIMP25′-GGAGATCGCTGGAAAGAAGGAATAT-3′5′-GCACGATGAAGTCACACAGGATTA-3′5′-ATGCATCTTTCCATCACCATC-3′ Open table in a new tab Our earlier studies showed that transgenic expression of ST3, but not a catalytically inactive mutant ST3 (ST3m), with GFP fused at the carboxyl terminus, under control of the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus promoter led to lethality of X. laevis embryos or early stage tadpoles (36Damjanovski S. Amano T. Li Q. Pei D. Shi Y.-B. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To overcome this embryonic lethal phenotype, we developed a double promoter construct to express the ST3 fusion proteins under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter as well as GFP3, a different version of GFP that contains a number of amino acid substitutions (38Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. Ryan K. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Gurdon J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 3719-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), under control of the lens-specific γ-crystalline promoter (Fig. 1A) (37Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To verify the independent function of the two promoters in transgenic animals, ST3-GFP transgenic tadpoles at premetamorphic stage 54 were treated with heat shock. RNA was isolated from the intestine and head, which included the eyes where γ-crystalline promoter functions, and was subjected to RT-PCR analysis by using primer sets specific for GFP (present in the ST3-GFP), ST3-GFP (i.e. one primer in ST3 and another in GFP coding region), or GFP3 (driven by the γ-crystalline promoter) (Fig. 1B). The results showed that GFP3 was expressed in the head of transgenic tadpoles (Fig. 1B, lane 4) but not in the head of wilt type animals or the intestine of any tadpoles (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). In contrast, ST3-GFP and the GFP moiety of ST3-GFP were expressed in both the head and intestine of heat-shocked transgenic but not wild type tadpoles. These results indicated that the two promoters were regulated independently and that the ST3-GFP transgene was expressed only upon heat shock but ubiquitously. Therefore, identification of transgenic animals could be accomplished subsequently by simply looking for GFP expression in the animal eyes. This allowed us to keep the wild type and transgenic animals together to avoid variation in treatment and rearing conditions between the two groups. When wild type and transgenic animals were reared in the absence of heat shock treatment, they developed normally through metamorphosis and into adulthood without detectible ST3-GFP expression (data not shown). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1B, heat shock treatment of both transgenic and wild type F0 tadpoles (i.e. the animals generated directly from the transgenesis procedure) led to ST3-GFP expression only in the transgenic animals, with ubiquitous expression similar to that found in the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven ST3 transgenic animals based on GFP fluorescence of the fusion protein (37Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (also see below). (It should be pointed out that the restriction enzyme-mediated transgenic methods produces animals that are germ line-transgenic, although individual F0 animals are probably different genetically due to variations in the insertion site and transgene copy number (35Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Northern blot analysis of the wild type and transgenic animals confirmed that the ST3 transgene mRNA of the expected size was induced within 1 day of heat shock treatment in the transgenic but not wild type animals (Fig. 2A). To quantitatively compare the transgenic ST3 expression upon heat shock with endogenous ST3 expression, we used a quantitative PCR primer/probe sets specific for transgenic ST3-GFP, endogenous ST3, or both (Fig. 2B). Quantitative PCR was carried out on intestine RNA isolated from premetamorphic (stage 54) wild type and ST3-GFP transgenic tadpoles treated with or without heat shock for the indicated number of days (during the experimental period, the animals remained at premetamorphic stages, between stages 54 and 56, with few changes morphol"

The dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton required for internalization is driven by bacterial manipulation of host signaling pathways, including activation of the Rho family GTPase Rac1 and subsequent activation of the Arp2/3 complex. However, the mechanisms linking these two events remain poorly understood. Rac1 is thought to promote activation of the Arp2/3 complex through its interaction with suppressor of cAMP receptor/WASP family verprolin-homologous (SCAR/WAVE) family proteins, but this interaction is apparently indirect. Two different Rac1 effectors have been shown to bind WAVE2: IRSp53, the SH3 domain of which binds the WAVE2 proline-rich domain, and PIR121/Sra-1, which forms a pentameric complex containing WAVE, Abi1, Nap1, and HSPC300. However, the extent to which each of these complexes contributes to Arp2/3 complex activation in the context of Salmonella infection is unclear. Here, we show that WAVE2 is necessary for efficient invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella typhimurium. We found that although Salmonella infection strongly promotes the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, IRSp53 is not necessary for bacterial internalization. In contrast, disruption of the PIR121/Nap1/Abi1/WAVE2/HSPC300 complex potently inhibits bacterial uptake. These results indicate that WAVE2 is an important component in signaling pathways leading to Salmonella invasion. Although infection leads to the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, it is the association of WAVE2 with the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex that regulates bacterial internalization.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most common causes of food-borne infectious gastroenteritis in humans. Although intestinal epithelial cells are not inherently phagocytic, Salmonella species have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to induce their own internalization into host cells. Contact with apical microvilli activates a type III secretion system encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1), through which bacterial effector proteins are injected into the host cell cytoplasm (1Collazo C.M. Galan J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Hueck C.J. Hantman M.J. Bajaj V. Johnston C. Lee C.A. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The combined action of multiple effector proteins leads to rapid, localized microvillar disassembly followed by the appearance of large, actin-rich membrane protrusions surrounding the bacteria, which eventually engulf them and complete the internalization process (3Finlay B.B. Ruschkowski S. Dedhar A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Francis C.L. Starnbach M.N. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Small GTPases of the Rho family are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in eukaryotic cells (5Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3861) Google Scholar). Several SPI-1 effectors can directly modulate Rho GTPase activity; SopE and SopE2 function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which activate Cdc42 and Rac1 by catalyzing the exchange of GTP for GDP (6Hardt W.D. Chen L.M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galan J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 7Stenderm S. Friebel A. Linder S. Rohde M. Mirold S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2341-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, SptP serves as a GTPase-activating protein to down-regulate the activity of Cdc42 and Rac1, presumably to terminate the internalization process (9Fu Y. Galan J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although enterocytes are among the physiological targets of Salmonella, most of our understanding of the cellular basis of Salmonella invasion has been derived from studies using non-polarized epithelioid or fibroblastic cell lines. We have shown that in contrast to non-polarized cell lines, in which Cdc42 plays a prominent role (10Chen L.-M. Hobbie S. Galan G.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), apical invasion of polarized epithelia by Salmonella specifically requires Rac1 (11Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.-S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the notion that host cell signaling pathways utilized by bacterial pathogens may differ between non-polarized cells and polarized epithelia. Several other effectors promote bacterial internalization by directly modulating actin filament dynamics. SipC, a component of the translocation pore, both nucleates filament assembly and bundles assembled filaments (12Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4926-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), while SipA, a secreted protein, stabilizes filaments by inhibiting their depolymerization (13Zhou D. Mooseker M.S. Galan J.E. Science. 1999; 283: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Zhou D. Mooseker M.S. Galan J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2004; 13: 497-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, these activities result in the formation of unbranched filaments, not the highly branched actin networks characteristic of phagocytic pseudopodia. Such branching is usually facilitated by the Arp2/3 complex, which promotes new filament growth from the sides of existing actin filaments. We have previously shown that the Arp2/3 complex is recruited to sites of bacterial invasion and is functionally indispensable to Salmonella entry in polarized epithelial cells (16Criss A.K. Casanova J.E. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2885-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The activity of the Arp2/3 complex is robustly stimulated by proteins of the WASP 1The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein; WAVE, WASP family verprolin-homologous; N-WASP, neural WASP; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; VCA, verprolin homologous domain, cofilin-homologous domain, and acidic domain; VPH, verprolin homologous./WAVE family (17Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian WASP/WAVE family consists of five members, WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein), N-WASP, and three WAVE isoforms (WAVE1-3). Of these, N-WASP and WAVE2 are ubiquitously expressed. WASP and N-WASP are preferentially activated by Cdc42, the binding of which relieves an autoinhibited conformation and promotes the formation of filopodia. In contrast, WAVEs are preferentially activated by Rac1 and are necessary for the production of Rac1-induced lamellipodia (18Higgs H.D. Pollard T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 19Rohatgi R. Ho H. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 20Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, WAVEs do not bind Rac1 directly, and their mode of activation has been the subject of some controversy. One model is that Rac1 binds to an accessory protein, IRSp53, which then binds WAVE2 to form an active, trimolecular complex (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that WAVE2 exists at steady state as part of a large complex containing four other proteins, Nap1 (Nck-associated protein 1), PIR121/Sra-1, Abi1, and HSPC300 (22Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), that is recruited to the membrane through an interaction between PIR121/Sra-1 and Rac1 (23Steffen A. Rottner K. Ehinger J. Innocenti M. Scita G. Wehland J. Stradal T.E.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate a requirement for WAVE2 in the apical invasion of polarized epithelial cells by Salmonella typhimurium. We show that Salmonella-induced Rac1 activation promotes the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex but that IRSp53 is not necessary for bacterial internalization. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Abi1 dramatically impairs bacterial uptake, suggesting that the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex is essential for activation of WAVE2 downstream of Rac1 during Salmonella invasion. Cell Culture—The T23 subclone of strain II MDCK cells, which stably express the tetracycline-repressible transactivator, has been described previously (25Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Transfectants were additionally maintained in 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) to repress expression of the transgene. This low concentration of antibiotics had no detectable effects on either the growth or the invasiveness of Salmonella. To establish polarized monolayers, cells were seeded on Transwell filter supports (Costar) coated with rat tail collagen (Upstate Biotechnology). 48-72 h later, cells were gently washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and replaced in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking doxycycline to induce transgene expression. Monolayers were used 24 h after doxycycline washout. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics in a 37 °C CO2 incubator. Bacterial Strains—The wild-type S. typhimurium strain SL1344 and its isogenic derivative VV341, which is rendered entry-deficient by deletion of the hilA locus, have been described previously (2Hueck C.J. Hantman M.J. Bajaj V. Johnston C. Lee C.A. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Invasive bacteria were generated by growth under O2-limited conditions as originally described (26Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, bacteria were in a late logarithmic phase of growth, corresponding regularly to 5-7 × 108 colony-forming units/ml. For each experiment, colony-forming units were determined by plating serial dilutions of the overnight culture on MacConkey agar (Difco). DNA Constructs and Antibodies—The human WAVE2 and IRSp53 constructs were a generous gift of L. M. Machesky (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK). The WAVE2ΔVPH, ΔVCA and IRSp53ΔSH3 mutants were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To generate tetracycline-responsive cell lines, WAVE2 and its mutants were subcloned into the vector pTRE2 (Clontech), whereas IRSp53 and IRSp53ΔSH3 were subcloned into a similar vector, pAdTet. These constructs were then transfected into T23 MDCK cells, and stable, inducible cell lines were selected. The mouse monoclonal anti-Abi1 antibody and the rabbit polyclonal anti-WAVE2 antibody were as described (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was obtained from Covance. The mouse monoclonal anti-IRSp53/58 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal anti-N-WASP antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal anti-actin antibody was obtained from Cytoskeleton. Rhodamine-phalloidin and Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin were obtained from Molecular Probes. Invasion Assay—Quantitation of bacterial internalization by the gentamicin resistance invasion assay was essentially as described (11Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.-S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization is expressed as a percentage of the initial bacterial inoculum; an index of internalization is defined relative to the percentage of the inoculum internalized by control cells maintained in the presence of 20 ng/ml doxycycline or transfected with a scrambled siRNA duplex (this value is set equal to 1). Bacterial attachment was determined by lysing the infected cells and quantifying colony-forming units/ml without gentamicin treatment. Data represent the means of three independent filters per experiment, and each experiment was performed at least three times. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Monolayers of T23 MDCK cells co-expressing Myc-tagged WAVE2 and HA-tagged IRSp53 were infected apically at a multiplicity of infection = 100 with S. typhimurium strain SL1344 or VV341 for 30 min. Cells were washed with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain). Lysates were incubated with an anti-Myc antibody (9E10) for 30 min and then immunoprecipitated with protein-G-Sepharose. Proteins were separated on gradient gels (4-15%; Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose. HA-IRSp53 was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Covance), and Myc-WAVE2 was detected with 9E10. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were infected with wild-type S. typhimurium SL1344 for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline-normal goat serum as follows: anti-Salmonella LPS (1:500), anti-WAVE2 (1:200) (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B.

RNA Interference—siRNA duplexes directed against the sequence 5′-GAAAGAUAAUCCAAAUCGA-3′ of WAVE2, 5′-ACACUUGUAUGAAGAUGUA-3′ of IRSp53, and 5′-CUGCAGUAGUCAGUAUAA-3′ of Abi1 were synthesized by Dharmacon. RNA duplexes were introduced into MDCK cells by electroporation using an Amaxa nucleofection device (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells mixed with 1.5 μg of RNA were electroporated, and 2 × 105 cells were plated on each 6.5-mm-diameter Transwell filter. Invasion assays and immunoblotting were performed 72 h after nucleofection. The pAV-Abi1-siRNA construct has been described previously (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Knock-down of Abi1 in HeLa cells was performed by transient transfection using the same plasmid and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). WAVE2 Functions in Apical Salmonella Invasion—To determine whether WAVE2 regulates Arp2/3 complex activation at apical invasion sites, we first examined the localization of endogenous WAVE2 during Salmonella entry in polarized monolayers of the epithelial cell line MDCK. Cells cultured on permeable filter supports were infected apically with wild-type S. typhimurium (strain SL1344) for 20 min as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then WAVE2 localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy. As reported previously, invading bacteria can be recognized by the presence of a ring of filamentous actin that accumulates at the invasion site, which indicates the formation of a phagocytic cup (Fig. 1A). Immunolabeling of infected cells revealed that endogenous WAVE2 colocalized extensively with filamentous actin at sites of bacterial internalization (Fig. 1A). Quantitation of invasion foci (n = 50) revealed that 94% of the sites containing both bacteria and a ring of filamentous actin also contained endogenous WAVE2. To test the role of WAVE2 in bacterial invasion, we used two different approaches. In the first, we generated stable MDCK cell lines inducibly expressing either wild-type WAVE2 or two different dominant interfering WAVE2 mutants under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promotor (25Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Inducible expression is necessary to allow the cells to form a polarized epithelial monolayer without interference from the mutant WAVE2. The C-terminal VCA domain of WAVE2 (Fig. 1B) is required for Arp2/3 activation. The V (verprolin-homologous) domain binds monomeric actin, and its deletion (WAVE2ΔVPH) has been shown to inhibit Arp2/3 function (20Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The C (cofilin-homologous) domain and the A (acidic) domain mediate binding to the Arp2/3 complex. Because we were concerned that the C and A domains might sequester the Arp2/3 complex, we generated an additional mutant lacking the entire C-terminal VCA domain (WAVE2ΔVCA). Each of these mutants is presumably capable of interacting with upstream binding partners but cannot activate the Arp2/3 complex. We then used these cell lines to examine the invasion efficiency of wild-type S. typhimurium, using a standard gentamicin resistance assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” (11Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.-S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of wild-type WAVE2 led to a small but reproducible enhancement of bacterial internalization, relative to the same cells cultured in the presence of doxycycline (which suppresses transgene expression). In contrast, expression of either the WAVE2ΔVPH or the WAVE2ΔVCA mutant inhibited apical Salmonella invasion by ∼50% (p < 0.05). Importantly, the expression of these proteins did not significantly alter bacterial adherence to the apical cell surface (Fig. 1D), verifying that the defect in bacterial invasion was due to impaired internalization rather than bacterial attachment. To confirm that the observed impairment of Salmonella internalization was directly due to WAVE2 inhibition and not a secondary effect of WAVE2 mutant expression, we used RNA interference to knock down endogenous WAVE2 expression in polarized MDCK cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, transfection of cells with an siRNA duplex specific for canine WAVE2 resulted in a 60% reduction in WAVE2 expression, relative to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA duplex. The knockdown was specific as expression of the related protein N-WASP was un-affected. Knockdown of WAVE2 largely inhibited the formation of membrane ruffles in response to Salmonella infection (see supplemental data, Fig. S1). Quantitation of Salmonella uptake in these cells revealed that, in agreement with the dominant negative inhibition described above, selective knockdown of WAVE2 expression also reduced internalization by ∼50% (p < 0.01). Taken together, these data suggest that efficient apical Salmonella invasion requires functional WAVE2. Salmonella Invasion Stimulates the Formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 Complex—Previous reports have shown that binding of GTP-Rac1 to the N terminus of IRSp53 promotes the formation of a Rac1/IRSp53/WAVE2 complex and that this interaction is necessary for membrane ruffling induced by an active Rac1 mutant (Rac1G12V) (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Localization of endogenous IRSp53 in Salmonella-infected MDCK monolayers revealed that, like WAVE2, IRSp53 becomes concentrated at sites of bacterial internalization (Fig. 2A). Eighty-eight percent of invasion foci exhibited strong immunolabeling for endogenous IRSp53. To determine whether apical Salmonella infection induces the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, we measured the extent of this interaction using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. For this purpose, an HA-tagged wild-type IRSp53 construct was transiently transfected into MDCK cells expressing Myc-tagged wild-type WAVE2 to achieve co-expression of the two proteins. Following apical infection with either wild-type S. typhimurium (SL1344) or an invasion-deficient (hilAΔ) mutant strain (VV341), WAVE2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with an antibody against the HA tag to detect co-precipitated IRSp53. Fig. 2B shows that, although a small amount of interacting IRSp53 can be detected at steady state, apical exposure to wild-type S. typhimurium for 30 min potently enhanced the binding between IRSp53 and WAVE2. In contrast, infection with the invasion-defective hilAΔ strain did not significantly change the levels of co-precipitated IRSp53, indicating that expression of the bacterial invasion machinery is necessary to induce this interaction. These results suggest that the interaction of IRSp53 and WAVE2 is strongly enhanced by Salmonella-induced activation of Rac1. IRSp53 Is Not Necessary for Apical Uptake of Salmonella—To determine whether the interaction between IRSp53 and WAVE2 is required for Salmonella entry, we generated stable MDCK cell lines inducibly expressing either wild-type IRSp53 or an IRSp53 mutant lacking the SH3 domain, which cannot bind to the proline-rich domain of WAVE2 (Fig. 3A). As reported previously (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), we found that this mutant fails to bind WAVE2, although it retains the ability to bind Rac1 (see supplemental data Fig. S2, and data not shown). Apical Salmonella invasion was then measured in these two cell lines as described above. Surprisingly, expression of neither wild-type IRSp53 nor the IRSp53ΔSH3 mutant significantly affected bacterial uptake when compared with controls maintained in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 3B). To further confirm this observation, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous IRSp53. We found that depletion of IRSp53 did not impair the formation of membrane ruffles in response to Salmonella invasion and that WAVE2 was still recruited to the sites of infection (Fig. 3C and supplemental data Fig. S1). Moreover, invasion assays indicated that knockdown of IRSp53 in MDCK cells also had no effect on Salmonella invasion efficiency (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that although Salmonella invasion potently stimulates the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, this interaction is not required for bacterial internalization. A Role for the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 Complex in Salmonella Internalization—In addition to its interaction with IRSp53, WAVE2 has recently been reported to exist as part of a pentameric complex also containing the proteins Abi1, Nap1, PIR121/Sra-1, and HSPC300 (22Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 23Steffen A. Rottner K. Ehinger J. Innocenti M. Scita G. Wehland J. Stradal T.E.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this context, PIR121/Sra-1 serves as the Rac1-binding subunit of the complex. Several of these proteins have been shown to modulate actin remodeling by regulating the stability and localization of WAVE in Dictyostelium, Drosophila, and mammalian cells (23Steffen A. Rottner K. Ehinger J. Innocenti M. Scita G. Wehland J. Stradal T.E.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Blagg S.L. Stewart M. Sambles C. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1480-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Kanda P. Craig G. Domingues V. Baum B. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1867-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To determine whether this complex is recruited to sites of bacterial invasion, we examined the localization of endogenous Abi1 in MDCK cells during Salmonella infection. Like WAVE2 and IRSp53, Abi1 was also observed in a concentrated ring surrounding invading bacteria at the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 4). Of 50 invasion foci examined, 86% contained endogenous Abi1. Because most of the Abi1 in cells has been shown to exist in a stable complex with Nap1, PIR121/Sra-1, HSPC300, and WAVE2 (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), this observation suggests that WAVE2 recruitment to invasion foci may occur in the context of this large protein complex. To confirm a role for the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex in the Salmonella internalization process, we used RNA interference to inhibit Abi1 synthesis in polarized MDCK monolayers. If it is the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex that recruits WAVE2 to the sites of Salmonella invasion, knocking down one of the complex components should abolish WAVE2 localization to the phagocytic cups. Indeed, very few bacteria-induced ruffles were observed in cells in which Abi1 level was reduced, and WAVE2 did not appear to be concentrated at the invasion sites (Fig. 5A and supplemental data Fig. S1). Not surprisingly, Salmonella internalization efficiency was impaired in those Abi1 knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, an 85% reduction of Abi1 expression led to an ∼50% (p < 0.01) reduction in apical Salmonella uptake, similar to that observed by knockdown of endogenous WAVE2. A more complete reduction in Abi1 levels could be achieved in non-polarized HeLa cells by transfecting with an siRNA-expressing plasmid (Fig. 5C) (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Quantitation of bacterial entry in these cells revealed that internalization was impaired by ∼80% (p < 0.01) when compared with control cells transfected with an empty siRNA vector. However, as reported by others (23Steffen A. Rottner K. Ehinger J. Innocenti M. Scita G. Wehland J. Stradal T.E.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we found that reduced Abi1 expression results in a corresponding down-regulation of WAVE2, presumably due to destabilization of the WAVE2/Abi1/PIR121/Nap1/HSPC300 complex (Fig. 5B). In three separate experiments, we observed an average 41% reduction in the levels of WAVE2 when Abi1 was knocked down. Therefore, to rule out the possibility that impaired bacterial invasion is simply due to the reduced level of WAVE2, we restored WAVE2 expression in Abi1 knockdown MDCK cells by co-expression of Myc-tagged human WAVE2. Fig. 5B demonstrates that WAVE2 expression was restored to endogenous levels in these cells despite the reduced levels of Abi1. However, restoration of WAVE2 expression did not rescue Salmonella internalization in Abi1 knockdown cells, suggesting that Abi1 is indispensable for WAVE2-mediated bacterial invasion. Taken together, our results suggest that, although Salmonella infection induces the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, it is the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex that directly mediates the actin reorganization required for apical Salmonella infection. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton within host cells is a prerequisite for Salmonella entry. The current study defines a signaling pathway triggered by apical Salmonella infection in which Rac1 promotes recruitment of the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex to sites of bacterial attachment, in which it activates the Arp2/3 complex. This leads to rapid actin reorganization culminating in bacterial internalization (Fig. 6). We have determined that functional WAVE2 is important for bacterial entry at the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. Moreover, although apical Salmonella invasion robustly stimulates the interaction between IRSp53 and WAVE2, which has been shown to enhance WAVE2 activity in other cell types (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), this interaction appears to be dispensable for bacterial uptake. Importantly, we show that the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex is also recruited to sites of bacterial invasion and that efficient Salmonella internalization requires the presence of Abi1. Together, these findings indicate that Salmonella utilize the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex, rather than a complex of WAVE2 with IRSp53, to stabilize and recruit WAVE2 during the invasion process. Upon contact with the plasma membrane, Salmonella secrete a panel of effector proteins into the host cell cytosol via the SPI-1-encoded type III secretion system, which not only promote the activation of Rac1 but also directly modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Although the translocon component SipC can nucleate actin filament assembly at sites of bacterial attachment and the secreted effector SipA stabilizes assembled filaments, the combined action of these proteins results in the formation of long unbranched filaments in vitro (12Hayward R.D. Koronakis V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4926-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extension of membrane ruffles as observed during Salmonella entry typically requires the assembly of highly branched, dendritic actin networks, the formation of which is mediated by the Arp2/3 complex (4Francis C.L. Starnbach M.N. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that WAVE2 plays an essential role in activation of the Arp2/3 complex during apical Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells. A similar role for WASP has been demonstrated in macrophages during both FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (29Lorenzi R. Brickell P.M. Katz D.R. Kinnon C. Thrasher A.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2043-2946Crossref Google Scholar) and the invasin-mediated internalization of Yersinia enterocolitica (30Wiedemann A. Linder S. Grassl G. Albert M. Autenrieth I. Aepfelbacher M. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, WAVE2 is not the only Arp2/3-activating protein that functions in Salmonella internalization. Unsworth et al. (31Unsworth K.E. Way M. McNiven M. Machesky L. Holden D.W. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1041-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that both N-WASP and WAVE participate in S. typhimurium invasion of non-polarized HeLa cells, in which Cdc42 plays a critical role in bacterial internalization. Our previous observation that Cdc42 is not activated during apical infection of epithelial cells by Salmonella (11Criss A.K. Ahlgren D.M. Jou T.-S. McCormick B.A. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1331-1341PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that N-WASP may not function in the epithelial context. However, since N-WASP can be activated by WASP-interacting SH3 protein independently of Cdc42 (32Fukuoka M. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Fukami K. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it remains possible that N-WASP could have a role in apical invasion. This hypothesis remains to be tested. Although it is well accepted that WASP and N-WASP become activated in response to direct binding of Cdc42, the mechanisms by which Rac1 promotes activation of WAVEs remain controversial. Miki et al. (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) reported that IRSp53 bound WAVE2 in a Rac1-dependent manner and that this interaction enhanced the ability of WAVE2 to activate the Arp2/3 complex. However, multiple groups have subsequently shown that both WAVE1 (22Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and WAVE2 (23Steffen A. Rottner K. Ehinger J. Innocenti M. Scita G. Wehland J. Stradal T.E.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) exist primarily as complexes with PIR121/Sra-1, Nap1, Abi1, and HSPC300. In the case of WAVE1, its association with this complex has been reported to inhibit its ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex. Binding of either GTP-bound Rac1 or Nck resulted in dissociation of WAVE1 as an active subcomplex with HSPC300 (22Eden S. Rohatgi R. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 2002; 418: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies on WAVE2 have suggested that Rac1 activation does not induce complex disassembly; instead, the entire complex is recruited to the membrane surface, where active Rac1 is located. Moreover, in vitro assays indicate that WAVE2 retains full activity even in the context of the intact complex and that this activity is not further enhanced by the addition of Rac1 (24Innocenti M. Zucconi A. Disanza A. Frittoli E. Areces L.B. Steffen A. Stradal T.E.B. Fiore P.P.D. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These recent results all favor the view that activated Rac1, through the Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex, recruits WAVE2 to the sites in which actin remodeling will occur. In the context of Salmonella infection, we hypothesize that local activation of Rac1, facilitated by the bacterially encoded guanine nucleotide exchange factors SopE/SopE2, promotes the recruitment of the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex to sites of bacterial attachment. Activation of the Arp2/3 complex by WAVE2 would then lead to the formation of the protrusive lamellipodial extensions that characterize Salmonella invasion. Our observation that restoration of WAVE2 expression did not rescue bacterial entry in cells in which Abi1 expression was knocked down further demonstrates that WAVE2 cannot localize properly under these conditions and is therefore not functional. Although it is clear from our results that Rac1 activation also leads to the formation of an IRSp53/WAVE2 complex, this interaction does not appear to be critical to bacterial internalization. A mutant form of IRSp53 lacking the SH3 domain, which fails to bind WAVE2 (21Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), had no effect on Salmonella invasiveness. One possible interpretation of this result is that, in the context of Salmonella infection, the WAVE2/Abi1/Nap1/PIR121/HSPC300 complex is sufficient to activate Arp2/3 and does not require additional input from the IRSp53/WAVE2 complex. Alternatively, it is possible that some additional essential function normally supplied by IRSp53 is filled by one or more bacterial effector proteins. Further investigation will be required to resolve this issue. We thank Laura Machesky (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) for WAVE2 and IRSp53 constructs.

https://openalex.org/W1963635656,"Members of the RIC-3 gene family are effectors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in vertebrates and invertebrates. In Caenorhabditis elegans RIC-3 is needed for functional expression of multiple nAChRs, including the DEG-3/DES-2 nAChR. Effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3/DES-2 functional expression are found in vivo and following heterologous expression in Xenopus leavis oocytes. We now show that in X. leavis oocytes RIC-3 also affects the kinetics and agonist affinity properties of the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor. Because these effects are mimicked by increasing the ratio of DEG-3 subunits within DEG-3/DES-2 receptors, this suggests that RIC-3 may preferentially promote maturation of DEG-3-rich receptors. Indeed, effects of RIC-3 on functional expression of DEG-3/DES-2 positively correlate with the DEG-3 to DES-2 ratio. All RIC-3 family members have two transmembrane domains followed by one or two coiled-coil domains. Here we show that the effects of RIC-3 on functional expression and on receptor properties are mediated by the transmembrane domains and do not require the coiled-coil domains. In agreement with this, mammals express a RIC-3 transcript lacking the coiled-coil domain that is capable of promoting DEG-3/DES-2 functional expression. Last, we show that RIC-3 affects DEG-3 quantity, suggesting stabilization of receptors or receptor intermediates by RIC-3. Together our results suggest that subunit-specific interactions of RIC-3 with nAChR subunits, mediated by the transmembrane domains, are sufficient for the effects of RIC-3 on nAChR quantity and quality.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; hric3, human RIC-3 homolog; TM, transmembrane; CC, coiled-coil; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are ligand-gated ion channels expressed in many tissues and organisms. These channels are pentamers, usually heteromers. Subunits of the nAChRs belong to one gene family, having four transmembrane domains, a large N-terminal extracellular loop, and an intracellular loop in between transmembrane domains III and IV (1Numa S. Noda M. Takahashi H. Tanabe T. Toyosato M. Furutani Y. Kikyotani S. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 48: 57-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biogenesis of functional nAChRs requires folding of each subunit and assembly into pentamers having the appropriate stoichiometry and arrangement. Subunits are also modified by glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Folding, assembly, and most post-translational modifications occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and are a prerequisite for endoplasmic reticulum exit, which is followed by trafficking through the Golgi apparatus to the surface membrane (2Merlie J.P. Lindstrom J. Cell. 1983; 34: 747-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 3Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The complex and time-consuming process leading to functional expression of nAChRs is likely to require activity of multiple proteins. One such protein is RIC-3. Work on the Caenorhabditis elegans ric-3 suggests that it affects nAChR maturation within the endoplasmic reticulum (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism enabling the effects of RIC-3 on nAChR maturation is still unknown. Mutations in the C. elegans ric-3 lead to reduced activity of multiple nAChRs, resulting in defective cholinergic signaling (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The RIC-3 gene belongs to a conserved family (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Members of this family, when co-expressed with nAChRs, have significant effects on functional surface expression of these receptors. RIC-3 family members are predicted to encode two membrane-spanning domains followed by one or two coiled-coil domains, but the contributions of these domains to RIC-3 function are still unknown. The ability of RIC-3 to interact with multiple divergent nAChRs is demonstrated by its effects on their expression. However, effects of these interactions are divergent, as RIC-3 enhances functional expression of some receptors (C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 and mammalian α7 nAChRs) while reducing or eliminating the expression of others (mammalian α4β2 and α3β4 nAChRs) (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Here we used heterologous expression of RIC-3 in Xenopus leavis oocytes to analyze its effects on the C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 nAChR. Previously we have shown that RIC-3 is required for normal activity and localization of this receptor in vivo (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have also shown that expression of RIC-3 in X. leavis oocytes with the DEG-3 and the DES-2 subunits, both necessary subunits for DEG-3/DES-2 receptor function (7Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15492-15495Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), enhances functional expression of the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M.

We now show that in addition to these quantitative effects on functional surface expression, RIC-3 also affects receptor properties. We show that these effects are similar to the effects of having a high DEG-3 to DES-2 ratio, and we provide evidence for a link between subunit stoichiometry and the effects of RIC-3. Both quantitative and qualitative changes in DEG-3/DES-2 activity are obtained when a truncated (118 amino acid) “transmembrane domain” RIC-3 protein is expressed, demonstrating that the coiled-coil domains are not needed for RIC-3 function in Xenopus oocytes. A naturally occurring transcript encoding for a similar transmembrane domain isoform is found in mammals (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and has similar effects on DEG-3/DES-2 functional expression. Last, we show that RIC-3 expression leads to an increase in the quantity of DEG-3, suggesting that interaction with RIC-3 stabilizes nAChRs or nAChR maturation intermediates. Overall, this analysis suggests that interactions between the RIC-3 transmembrane domains and nAChRs (or nAChR intermediates) stabilize these proteins, thereby altering the maturation process in a subunit-specific manner. Heterologous Expression and Electrophysiology—DEG-3-, DES-2-, RIC-3-, and hRIC3-expressing clones were described previously (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E.

In vitro transcribed and capped cRNAs were injected at final concentrations of 0.1-0.2 μg/μl for DEG-3 and DES-2 (unless otherwise stated), 0.04-0.1 μg/μl for RIC-3 and RIC-3 derivatives, and 0.01 μg/μl for hric3 and its transmembrane domain isoform. For the stoichiometry experiments, the total RNA was kept constant (0.4 μg/μl). Injections and recordings were done as described in Ref. 7Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The effects of co-expressing RIC-3, hRIC3, or their derivatives on DEG-3/DES-2 receptor-mediated whole cell current amplitudes were assayed between the first and third days following injections. Data Analysis—Data analysis was done using Origin versions 5.0 and 7.1. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. (N = number of frogs, n = number of oocytes). Significance was examined using the paired t test, unless stated otherwise. In Figs. 2, 5, and 7, p values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for multivariable analysis; results are considered significant when p < 0.01. To reduce noise due to variability in expression levels between different experiments, in Figs. 5 and 7 we normalized the current amplitudes in each experiment to the average response for oocytes expressing only DEG-3 and DES-2. For dose-response analysis, the current amplitudes were normalized to the amplitude elicited upon application of 3 mm choline/each oocyte.Fig. 5Effects of RIC-3 deletion mutations on DEG-3/DES-2 current amplitudes and kinetics.A, representative traces from oocytes expressing DEG-3/DES-2, DEG-3/DES-2 + RIC-3, DEG-3/DES-2 + minimal RIC-3, DEG-3/DES-2 + transmembrane domain RIC-3 (RIC-3 TM), and DEG-3/DES-2 + coiled-coiled domain RIC-3 (RIC-3 CC) elicited by 3.2 mm choline.

Desensitization efficacy was calculated as follows: D = (peak amplitude-steady state amplitude)/peak amplitude. Construction of RIC-3 Derivatives—To tag RIC-3 with GFP we amplified the GFP fragment from plasmid pGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Clontech) using primers GCTAGCGCTACCGGTCGACACCATGGTGAGCAAG and GATCAGTTATCTAGATCCGGTGG. This fragment was digested with SalI and inserted into the SalI site in RIC-3 (directly after the first coiled-coil domain). To generate the minimal RIC-3 construct (RIC-3 minimal), a fragment containing the conserved regions of RIC-3 was amplified using the primer GCATATGGATCCATGGGTGGAATATCAGGATGGAAGC and a primer for the GFP sequence. This fragment was digested by BamHI and SalI and inserted into a RIC-3-GFP construct in which the non-conserved C-terminal domain was deleted using EcoRI digestion followed by self ligation. The transmembrane domain derivative (RIC-3 TM) was generated by amplification of the transmembrane domain region using primers GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG and CATGGTGTCGACCTTTCCTTTTGATTTAAACAGCG followed by digestion with BamHI and SalI and ligation into the minimal derivative construct in place of the longer BamHI-SalI fragment that contains the entire conserved regions. A similar manipulation was done to clone the first coiled-coil domain (RIC-3 CC) following amplification using GTATACGCTGTTTGGATCCATGGGAAAG and TGGTACCAGATCAAGCTTGCTC. The transmembrane domain isoform of hRIC3 was amplified from image clone 4296897 by using primers ATTGCCATATTAAAGCTTCATTGATGT and CACCGTGAGCAGAATTCATGGCGTACTCC and cloned into pGEMH19 following digestion with HindIII and EcoRI. Myc-tagged DES-2 was generated by adding a 6 × myc sequence upstream of the DES-2 stop codon in pGEMH19. This tag had no effect on DEG-3/DES-2 channel properties or on the effects of RIC-3 except for eliminating the effect of RIC-3 on DEG-3 quantity as seen in Western analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Oocytes were homogenized by repetitive pipetting in 50 μl/oocytes of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm EDTA) with Complete Mini, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) (1 tablet/7 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer). After 30 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new chilled tube to which GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 2 μg/μl was added and incubated on ice for 90 min with occasional inversion. The mix was centrifuged at 4 °C and the supernatant incubated with 50 μl of protein G beads (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. This mix was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was analyzed following the addition of equal volume of sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol), while the pellet was gently washed three times with co-immunoprecipitation buffer and resuspended with 25 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against c-Myc (Covance Research Products). Western Blot Analysis—Oocytes were homogenized by repetitive pipetting in 25 μl/oocytes of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) with Complete Mini, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) (1 tablet/7 ml of buffer). After 30 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted, and equal volume of sample buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol) was added. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against DEG-3. The quantity of the DEG-3 subunit was determined by densitometric analysis using Bio-Rad Fluor-S multi-imager on scanned radiogram. For the analysis described in Fig. 8 we normalized the observed density to the density of a control sample of DEG-3 to reduce variability resulting from different exposures of the radiogram. This normalization was not done for analysis of the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3 in the absence of DES-2; instead, the ratio is given for pairs of samples from the same experiments (same frog and same Western blot), and significance was examined using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. RIC-3 Expression Affects DEG-3/DES-2 Receptor Kinetics and Affinity—We have previously shown that expressing DEG-3 and DES-2 nAChR subunits in X. leavis oocytes also expressing RIC-3 led to a reproducible increase in agonist-dependent whole cell currents (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Careful analysis of currents elicited by choline, the preferred agonist of the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor (8Yassin L. Gillo B. Kahan T. Halevi S. Eshel M. Treinin M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in such oocytes shows an additional effect on current kinetics (Fig. 1A). Quantification of this effect (Fig. 1, B and C) shows increased desensitization efficiency, a result of reduced decay constants and steady state currents. To identify additional effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3/DES-2 properties we obtained dose-response curves for the response of DEG-3/DES-2 to choline in the presence and absence of RIC-3 co-expression. This analysis (Fig. 1D) shows a leftward shift in the DEG-3/DES-2 dose-response curve in the presence of RIC-3 and suggests the presence of two populations of DEG-3/DES-2 receptors differing in their affinity for choline (EC50 0.6 ± 0.64 mm for the high affinity population and 1.6 ± 0.08 mm for low affinity population). In oocytes expressing RIC-3 the fraction of high affinity receptors (EC50 of 0.84 ± 0.24 mm relative to 1.86 ± 0.49 mm for low affinity receptors) increased from 0.05 ± 0.12 to 0.68 ± 0.39. Changes in receptor properties, such as kinetics and affinity, may result from interactions of RIC-3 with functional DEG-3/DES-2 receptors on the membrane or from preferential maturation or stabilization of desensitization-efficient and high affinity DEG-3/DES-2 receptors by RIC-3. Our data from C. elegans showing no RIC-3 in neuromuscular junctions, the site of functional nAChRs whose expression requires RIC-3, argue against the first possibility (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Work by others on α4β2 nAChRs suggested that the presence of populations of receptors having different affinities for the agonist is a result of changes in subunit stoichiometry (9Zwart R. Vijverberg H.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1124-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Nelson M.E. Kuryatov A. Choi C.H. Zhou Y. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To examine whether the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor is capable of forming receptors having different stoichiometries and whether altering receptor stoichiometry mimics the effects of RIC-3 co-expression, we manipulated the ratio of DEG-3 to DES-2 cRNAs injected into oocytes. Such manipulations affect both current kinetics and agonist affinity of the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor (Fig. 2). Because DEG-3 or DES-2 when expressed alone do not form functional channels (7Treinin M. Gillo B. Liebman L. Chalfie M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15492-15495Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we attribute the effects of this manipulation to changes in DEG-3/DES-2 channel stoichiometry and use it as evidence for the ability of DEG-3 and DES-2 to assemble into different receptor subtypes having different stoichiometries. Moreover, increasing the ratio of DEG-3 to DES-2 mimics the effects of RIC-3 co-expression, leading to an increase in the desensitization efficiency (Fig. 2) and in the representation of high affinity receptors (0.38 ± 0.24 of the receptors have an EC50 of 0.68 ± 0.11 mm, whereas EC50 of low affinity receptors is 1.78 ± 0.12 mm). Thus it is possible that RIC-3 expression preferentially promotes functional expression of DEG-3-rich receptors having higher desensitization efficiency and higher affinity for choline. To further examine the relationship between subunit stoichiometry and the effects of RIC-3 we combined the two manipulations. This analysis shows that effects of RIC-3 on whole cell current amplitude are affected by subunit ratio and positively correlate with DEG-3 ratio (Fig. 3). Such results support the suggestion that RIC-3 preferentially promotes maturation of receptors having a high DEG-3 to DES-2 ratio. The Coiled-coil Domains Are Not Required for RIC-3 Activity in Oocytes—To better understand how RIC-3 affects nAChR expression we sought to dissect the roles of the different RIC-3 domains. Structural predictions based on the sequence of the C. elegans ric-3 suggest that RIC-3 is composed of an N-terminal cytosolic domain, two transmembrane domains separated by a proline-rich spacer, and a cytosolic C-terminal domain having two coiled-coil domains (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similar analysis of other members of the ric-3 gene family shows conservation of the transmembrane domains, proline-rich spacer, and the first coiled-coil domain (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To examine the role of each of these domains in RIC-3 function we started by deleting the non-conserved N- and C-terminal domains, thus producing a 184-amino acid “Minimal RIC-3” (Fig. 4). This protein reproduced both the quantitative and qualitative effects of the full-length RIC-3, demonstrating that the non-conserved domains are not required for RIC-3 function in oocytes (Fig. 5). To further dissect the structure of RIC-3 we created two smaller fragments of RIC-3, a transmembrane domain fragment (TM) and a coiled-coil domain fragment (CC) (Fig. 4). Expression of each fragment with the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor shows that the transmembrane domain fragment, but not the coiled-coil domain fragment, is sufficient for eliciting the effects of RIC-3 on the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor (Fig. 5; both deletion mutants express a stable protein as seen by Western analysis; results not shown). Effects of this truncated RIC-3 TM protein on whole cell current amplitude are comparable with the effects of the full-length RIC-3. This truncated protein also produces similar effects on DEG-3/DES-2 current kinetics. Last, the truncated RIC-3 interacts with the DEG-3/DES-2 nAChR, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 6). Thus the conserved first coiled-coil domain is not required for interaction between RIC-3 and nAChRs or for the resulting effects on nAChR activity in oocytes.Fig. 6Interactions between RIC-3 mutants and the DEG-3/DES-2 nAChR. RIC-3 was tagged with GFP, and DES-2 was tagged by 6 × myc. GFP antibodies were used to precipitate RIC-3, and both the supernatant (top panel) and the precipitate (bottom panel) were examined for the presence of DES-2 using antibodies to Myc. Analysis of non-injected oocytes (control, lane 1), oocytes expressing DEG-3 and DES-2 (lane 2), oocytes expressing DEG-3, DES-2, and full-length RIC-3 (lane 3), oocytes expressing DEG-3, DES-2, and RIC-3 minimal (lane 4), oocytes expressing DEG-3, DES-2, and RIC-3 TM (lane 5), oocytes expressing DEG-3, DES-2 and RIC-3 CC (lane 6), and oocytes expressing RIC-3 minimal only (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of available human ric-3 (hric3) cDNAs has identified a number of putative hric3 isoforms. Among these, one isoform, AY326436, is similar to our RIC-3 TM deletion mutant in encoding for the transmembrane domain region alone (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the function of this alternative hric3 transcript is unclear, and it may be a product of aberrant RNA processing, it is interesting to note that mice also express a similar transcript, AK038724. Mice appear to express a more limited repertoire of ric-3 transcripts, and thus conservation of this transmembrane domain transcript is indicative of a functional role for the resulting protein. To examine this function we expressed the human transmembrane domain isoform in oocytes. As shown for the C. elegans RIC-3 deletion mutant, expression of this human transmembrane domain RIC-3 protein also increases whole cell current amplitude in oocytes expressing the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor (Fig. 7). However, unlike the C. elegans transmembrane domain protein that we engineered and whose effects are indistinguishable from the effects of the full-length version, effects of the human RIC-3 isoform are smaller relative to those of the full-length human RIC-3. Expression of RIC-3 Affects DEG-3 Protein Quantity—Our analysis of the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3/DES-2 properties suggests that it alters the outcome of the assembly process, leading to preferential expression of DEG-3-rich receptors. Such effects could be a result of RIC-3 directly affecting the assembly process. Another possibility is that RIC-3 functions through stabilization of receptors or receptor assembly intermediates in a subunit-specific way. To examine whether RIC-3 is capable of stabilizing nAChR subunits we examined its effects on the DEG-3 subunit. Western analysis of oocytes expressing the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor with and without RIC-3 co-expression reproducibly showed increased DEG-3 signal in the presence of RIC-3. Quantification of this effect shows a 2-fold increase in total DEG-3 quantity in the presence of RIC-3 (Fig. 8). As effects of RIC-3 are probably post-translational (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), this suggests an effect on stability of the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor or of DEG-3/DES-2 receptor maturation intermediates. To examine whether DES-2 co-expression is required for the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3 quantity, we examined the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3 quantity in oocytes not expressing DES-2. This analysis shows a significant 1.49 ± 0.49-fold difference in the quantity of DEG-3 (N = 8, n = 160). This result demonstrates that the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3 quantity do not require DES-2. Thus, the stabilizing effects of RIC-3 do not require formation of a functional receptor. However, we cannot rule out an interaction of RIC-3 with non-functional DEG-3 pentamers. Effects of RIC-3 on untagged (wild-type) DEG-3 quantity are reproducible, and similar effects on receptor quantity were seen when human RIC-3 was expressed with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 (5HT3) receptors (11Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22502-22507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These effects, however, are not a prerequisite for the effects of RIC-3 on functional expression, as effects of RIC-3 on functional expression are seen in the absence of effects on subunit quantity in oocytes expressing DEG-3 and Myc-tagged DES-2 (results not shown) and in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing α7 receptors (12Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The absence of the stabilizing effects of RIC-3 in these experiments is compatible with the idea that RIC-3 interacts with and stabilizes only a small subset of receptors/receptor intermediates. The fraction of this subset relative to the total receptor subunits may differ between experiments and may depend on expression levels and stability of the nAChR subunits used. When this fraction is smaller, the stabilizing effects of RIC-3 may be masked. Unfortunately, the fact that Myc-tagging DES-2 interferes with the effects of RIC-3 on DEG-3 quantity and the absence of antibodies directed to DES-2 made it impossible to examine the effects of RIC-3 on the stability of the DES-2 subunit. The C. elegans RIC-3 is required for normal functional expression of multiple nAChRs in vivo (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the human RIC-3 homolog is required for functional expression of α7 receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (12Williams M.E. Burton B. Urrutia A. Shcherbatko A. Chavez-Noriega L.E. Cohen C.J. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and promotes surface expression of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 (5HT3) receptors in COS-7 cells (11Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22502-22507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes both C. elegans and human RIC-3 promote or inhibit functional expression of co-expressed receptors in a subtype-specific manner (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We now show that RIC-3 expression also affects the properties, kinetics, and affinity of the C. elegans DEG-3/DES-2 receptor. Effects on receptor properties are usually attributed to auxiliary subunits interacting with the mature receptor on the membrane, but RIC-3 is unlikely to function on the surface membrane (5Halevi S. McKay J. Palfreyman M. Yassin L. Eshel M. Jorgensen E. Treinin M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Cheng A. McDonald N.A. Connolly C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22502-22507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Instead, we show that effects of RIC-3 on receptor properties can be mimicked by increasing the ratio of DEG-3 to DES-2, suggesting that RIC-3 may preferentially promote expression of receptors having high DEG-3 to DES-2 stoichiometry. Support for this suggestion comes from the preferential effects of RIC-3 on whole cell current amplitudes in oocytes expressing high DEG-3 to DES-2 ratios. Together with previously reported results on receptor subtype-specific effects of RIC-3 (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), this suggests that although RIC-3 interacts with multiple divergent nAChRs, the implications of these interactions differ in a subtype-specific manner. Members of the RIC-3 family have two transmembrane domains followed by a coiled-coil domain (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We now show that this core structure, as seen in the RIC-3 minimal protein, is sufficient for RIC-3 function, as deletion of the non-conserved, C. elegans-specific N- and C-terminal domains has no effects on the function of RIC-3 in Xenopus oocytes. Coiled-coil domains have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions (13Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); thus, conservation of the first coiled-coil domain in all RIC-3 homologs suggested that they may function as part of a protein complex needed for efficient maturation of nAChRs (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, we now show that the coiled-coil domains are not necessary for the effects of RIC-3 in Xenopus oocytes, demonstrating that RIC-3 does not require assistance of “maturation-promoting factors” brought in through interactions with the coiled-coil domain for its activity. The finding that only a short sequence within RIC-3 is required for its function raises the question of what is the role of the “non-essential” domains. Specifically, we were surprised by the finding that the conserved coiled-coil, a domain conserved in all RIC-3 homologs (6Halevi S. Yassin L. Eshel M. Sala F. Sala S. Criado M. Treinin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34411-34417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), is not necessary for function. One explanation for this finding is that in vivo RIC-3 has additional effects that cannot be detected in oocytes expressing the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor. A second explanation and our preferred hypothesis is that these domains are needed for regulating RIC-3 function. Our deletion analysis shows that a short 118-amino acid region encoding for the two transmembrane domains and the proline-rich spacer is sufficient for the effects of RIC-3 on the DEG-3/DES-2 receptor. Within this short region, the second transmembrane domain is the most conserved, whereas conservation within the proline-rich spacer is limited to having high frequency of prolines (6Halevi S.

In addition, signal peptide predictions (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) show that in all vertebrate RIC-3 homologs, but not in the invertebrate homologs, the first transmembrane domain is likely to function as a signal peptide (12Williams M.E.

Treinin, unpublished results. Thus, its sole role is likely to be proper orientation of RIC-3 relative to the membrane, further reducing the size of the protein needed for interaction with and regulation of nAChR expression. These sequence analysis and sequence conservation data suggest that conserved functions of RIC-3 may be mediated solely by the second transmembrane domain. Such a short sequence is less likely to recruit additional maturation-promoting factors for its activity; rather, it may act similarly to pharmacological chaperones, small molecules that specifically bind and stabilize proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (14Bernier V. Legace M. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This binding may stabilize receptor intermediates in a conformation that either promotes or interferes with further maturation, thus providing an explanation for the diverse effects of RIC-3 on co-expressed nAChRs.

https://openalex.org/W2047192558,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is essential for rapid induction of cellular responses to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In this study, we mapped a nuclear localization signal (NLS), 385KRKK388, within the amino terminus of ATM and demonstrate its recognition by the conventional nuclear import receptor, the importin α1/β1 heterodimer. Although mutation of this NLS resulted in green fluorescent protein (GFP)·ATM(NLSm) localizing predominantly within the cytoplasm, small amounts of nuclear GFP·ATM(NLSm) were still sufficient to elicit a DNA damage response. Insertion of an heterologous nuclear export signal between GFP and ATM(NLSm) resulted in complete cytoplasmic localization of ATM, concomitantly reducing the level of substrate phosphorylation and increasing radiosensitivity, which indicates a functional requirement for ATM nuclear localization. Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal half of ATM, containing the kinase domain, which localizes to the cytoplasm, could not autophosphorylate itself or phosphorylate substrates, nor could it correct radiosensitivity in response to DSBs even when targeted to the nucleus by insertion of an exogenous NLS, demonstrating that the ATM amino terminus is required for optimal ATM function. Moreover, we have shown that the recruitment/retention of ATM at DSBs requires its kinase activity because a kinase-dead mutant of GFP·ATM failed to form damage-induced foci. Using deletion mutation analysis we mapped a domain in ATM (amino acids 5–224) required for its association with chromatin, which may target ATM to sites of DNA damage. Combined, these data indicate that the amino terminus of ATM is crucial not only for nuclear localization but also for chromatin association, thereby facilitating the kinase activity of ATM in vivo.

Cells derived from A-T patients are hypersensitive to agents that cause double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, such as ionizing radiation (IR), but retain normal resistance to UV irradiation and other damaging agents. The role of ATM in the DNA damage response is well documented (see Ref. 1Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Jackson S.P. Mulhern T.D. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Loss of ATM function in human and mouse cells cause defects in molecular pathways that are normally activated after DNA DSBs. ATM is reported to be present as inactive dimers in human cells, and exposure to IR induces its autophosphorylation at serine 1981, dimer dissociation, and activation as a kinase (2Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, ATM accumulates at sites of DNA DSBs as marked by phosphorylation of H2A.X at serine 139. The subsequent signaling cascade that results from ATM activation transduces signals to downstream targets such as p53, MDM2, CHK1, CHK2, BRCA1, and NBS1, which instigate cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. ATM is reported to localize predominantly within the nucleus of most proliferating cells, with small amounts residing in the cytoplasm (3Watters D. Khanna K.K. Beamish H. Birrell G. Spring K. Kedar P. Gatei M. Stenzel D. Hobson K. Kozlov S. Zhang N. Farrell A. Ramsay J. Gatti R. Lavin M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1911-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Brown K.D. Ziv Y.

A. 1997; 94: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), consistent with its role in the DNA DSB response pathway. However, ATM has been reported to localize mainly within the cytoplasm of mouse Purkinje cells, in cells of the human cerebellum, and in a subset of cells in the dorsal root ganglia of mouse (5Barlow C. Ribaut-Barassin C. Zwingman T.A. Pope A.J. Brown K.D. Owens J.W. Larson D. Harrington E.A. Haeberle A.M. Mariani J. Eckhaus M. Herrup K. Bailly Y. Wynshaw-Boris A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although it is not clear what function ATM performs within the cytoplasm, it has been demonstrated in mouse that ATM deficiency results in abnormalities of organelles. Many mutations identified to date involve truncation of ATM that results in deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region containing the kinase domain, thereby eliminating its kinase activity. The transport of large proteins such as ATM into the nucleus is a complex process that involves active transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in signal-dependent fashion through the action of nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), which are recognized by members of the cellular importin superfamily of transport proteins (7Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 8Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The best understood pathways involve those in which cargoes containing lysine-arginine-rich NLSs are recognized by either importin β1 or the importin α1/β1 heterodimer (7Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 8Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Subsequent to import into the nucleus through the nuclear envelope-localized nuclear pore complex structures mediated by the importins, release into the nucleoplasm is effected by binding of the monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ran in activated GTP-bound form to importin β (7Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 8Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Sequences reminiscent of known NLSs have been identified within ATM. As a first step to identifying targeting signals within ATM that regulate its localization and activity, we tagged full-length and various subfragments of ATM with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and analyzed their subcellular localization and function. We characterized an importin α1/β1-recognized NLS in the amino terminus of ATM, mutation of which in the context of full-length ATM results in predominantly cytoplasmic localization and inhibits interaction with importins. Importantly, we show that the amino-terminal region of ATM confers association with chromatin and is required for its efficient kinase activity in vivo; only the nuclear fraction of ATM is autophosphorylated in response to IR induced DNA damage. Overall, our results imply that the amino terminus of ATM is crucial for both nuclear localization and chromatin association, thereby facilitating the kinase activity of ATM in vivo. Plasmid Construction—pEGFP·ATM (amino acids 5–1303), encoding the amino-terminal half of the ATM protein fused with GFP, was created by subcloning ATM-(5–1303) as a XhoI/KpnI fragment from pMAT1, which lacks the coding sequence for the first five amino acids (9Zhang N. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). pEGFP·ATM-(1303–3056), encoding the carboxyl-terminal half of ATM fused with GFP, was created by subcloning ATM-(1303–3056) as a KpnI fragment from pMAT1 into pEGFP-C2. pSG5GFP·ATM, encoding full-length ATM fused with GFP, was created by subcloning GFP·ATM-(5–1303) as an NheI (end-filled) BamHI fragment from pEGFP·ATM-(5–1303) and subsequently ATM-(1303–3056) as a KpnI fragment from pMAT1 into pSG5 (Stratagene, with an expanded multiple cloning site). Deletion mutants pEGFP·ATM-(5–568), -(677–1303), -(5–224), and -(227–568) were prepared by restriction digestion, end-filling with T4 DNA polymerase, and religation. The NLSm (R386A/K387A) and KD (D2870A/N2875K) mutants of ATM were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit following the supplier's protocol (Stratagene). The NLS-ATM-(1303–3056) construct was prepared by restriction digestion of pEGFP·ATM-(1303–3056) with BsrGI and insertion of an oligonucleotide dimer containing the coding sequence of the SV40 large T-antigen NLS between GFP and ATM-(1303–3056); nuclear localization this fusion protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay. The GFP·NES-ATM(NLSm) construct was prepared by restriction digestion of pSG5GFPATM(NLSm) with EagI and insertion of an oligonucleotide dimer containing the coding sequence of the HIV-Rev NES between GFP and ATM(NLSm); cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay. All of the above GFP·ATM constructs were transferred into pREP4EGFP (pREP4, Invitrogen, with the expression cassette replaced by the pEGFP-C3 expression cassette) using AgeI and KpnI. A detailed description of all constructs is available from the authors upon request. Cell Culture—Mammalian cell lines COS-7 (marmoset, SV40-transformed), HEK293T (human embryonic kidney fibroblast, SV40-transformed), AT5BIVA (human A-T fibroblast cell line, SV40-transformed), AT1ABR (human A-T lymphoblastoid cell line), and HeLa (tumor cell line) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Lipofectamine-mediated Transfection and Selection of Stable Cell Lines—Cells were seeded into 30-mm Petri dishes containing coverslips for immunofluorescence and grown to 50–80% confluence. Cells were then transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 1.4 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) serum-free medium and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The medium was then replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated at least 16 h under normal growth conditions prior to assaying. For stable selection of AT1ABR lymphoblastoid cells or AT5BIVA cells transfected with pREP4-based plasmids, cells were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence—For general visualization of GFP-tagged proteins, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for 10 min, washed again, and then counterstained with DAPI to detect cell nuclei. To visualize foci of GFP·ATM and phosphorylated ATM substrate, cells were treated with extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.5% IGEPAL (same chemically as obsolete Nonidet P-40), pH 7.5) on ice for 20 min prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For detection of phosphorylated ATM and substrates, cells were blocked with 0.5% FBS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then immunostained with either anti-phosphohistone H2A.X antibody (S139) diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution, anti-phosphoserine 1981 ATM antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, or anti-FLAG antibody diluted 1:600 in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS and counterstained with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes, cat. no. A-11010/03) secondary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. DNA was counterstained with DAPI in PBS and then washed in PBS. Following processing, coverslips were mounted with Mowiol containing 0.6% diazobicyclo-octane and allowed to set overnight at 4 °C prior to fluorescent microscopy at room temperature using a Zeiss Axioskop 20 microscope, Zeiss Plan-NEOFLUAR ×100/1,30 oil lens, Zeiss AxioCam MRc digital camera, and MRGrab 1.0 software. Figures were assembled using CorelDraw 8.0. Antibodies used were: anti-phosphohistone H2A.X antibody (S139) (Upstate 05-636), anti-phosphoserine 1981 ATM (Rockland, cat. no. 600-401-400), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F3165), Alexa Fluor 546 or 488 (Molecular Probes, cat. no. A-11010/003/001). Immunoblot Assays—Cells were pelleted and then washed with PBS prior to being lysed directly in sample buffer (5% glycerol, 1.7% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8) with sonication and boiling. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, 4% for full-length ATM or 8% for other proteins and some ATM deletion mutants. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were detected with antibodies in Blotto and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies used were: ATM phosphoserine 1981 (Rockland, 600-401-400), ATM (Genetex, 2C1), GFP (Molecular Probes, A6455), MCM3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9850), BRCA1 (Oncogene, OP92), α-tubulin (Sigma, T9026). Clonogenic Survival Assay—AT5BIVA cells, stably transfected with pREP4GFPATM and mutants, were plated at low density into 6-well Petri dishes in triplicate. Cells were grown for 1 day following plating, to allow cells to adhere, and then subjected to ionizing radiation of 1, 2 or 4 Gy (MDS Nordion, Gammacell 40 Exactor). Cells were grown for a further 13 days with regular changes of growth medium to allow for outgrowth of colonies of surviving cells. Cells were then fixed with methanol, dried, stained with Coomassie Blue stain, and washed to facilitate the counting of colonies (50 or more cells). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Interaction between ATM-(227–568) and importin α proteins was determined using the yeast two-hybrid method by growth selection on synthetic dropout media. Small scale co-transformation of yeast with plasmids was carried out using the lithium acetate method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 following the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech). Transformed yeast were plated on synthetic dropout medium lacking the amino acids Leu and Trp, to select for plasmids, or lacking Leu, Trp, His, and Ade for growth selection. The strength of protein-protein interaction was quantitated using a sensitive colorimetric α-galactosidase assay following the manufacturer's recommendations (Clontech). The assay was carried out in 96-well plates, in triplicates, by combining a small aliquot of cell-free culture medium with a fixed volume of assay buffer. After a prescribed preincubation time, absorbance at 410 nm was recorded and used to calculate the concentration of α-galactosidase. Chromatin Fractionation—S1, S2, and P chromatin fractions were isolated as described by Kreitz et al. (10Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 0.4 ml of cold hypertonic buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaOV3, pH 7.5). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min and were then broken with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 325 × g (2000 rpm) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic proteins) was transferred to a fresh tube and placed on ice. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A with 0.5% IGEPAL and incubated on ice for 15 min to lyse the nuclear envelope. Free nucleosolic proteins were separated from the nuclear matrix by centrifugation at 13400 × g (12000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing nucleosolic proteins, was transferred to a fresh tube and placed on ice. The pellet was washed with 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.3 m sucrose, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaOV3, pH 7.5) with increasing concentrations of NaCl (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 m) to release structure bound proteins and transferred to fresh tubes on ice. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Samples were analyzed as described under “Immunoblot Assays.” GFP·ATM Is Distributed between the Nucleus and Cytoplasm—To initiate our studies of ATM localization, we created a plasmid for expression of GFP-tagged ATM in mammalian cells. Localization of the GFP·ATM fusion protein was determined by fluorescence microscopy after transient expression into various cell types including HEK293T, COS-7, and AT5BIVA (an ATM-deficient cell line) cells. The majority of GFP·ATM protein was localized within the nucleus, with variable levels of cytoplasmic localization being observed. A minority of cells displayed a predominantly cytoplasmic accumulation around the nuclear periphery (Fig. 1A). The distribution of GFP·ATM within cells was determined statistically over a larger sample, with at least 200 transfected cells, repeated over three independent experiments in three cell lines. In ∼60–70% of log phase cells GFP·ATM localized within both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas in 25–40% of cells localization was predominantly nuclear; in the remaining 5% of the cells GFP·ATM localized predominantly around the cytoplasmic periphery (Fig. 1B). A similar distribution of GFP·ATM was seen in all three cells lines. The observed nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was independent of the amount of DNA transfected, indicating that protein expression levels did not impact the observed intracellular distribution of GFP·ATM (data not shown). In addition, GFP·ATM was excluded from the nucleoli. Next we wished to determine whether GFP·ATM was able to form foci and phosphorylate substrate in response to DNA DSBs, as has been reported for the endogenous wild type protein. When A-T fibroblast cells (AT5BIVA) expressing GFP·ATM were exposed to IR (30 min after 4 Gy IR), GFP·ATM was seen to change localization from being evenly distributed through the nucleus to forming distinct foci that co-localized with phospho-H2A.X (S139) as a marker for sites of DNA DSBs (Fig. 1C). A small number of ATM foci were sometimes present in nuclei in the absence of DNA damage. Interestingly, GFP·ATM(KD) could not form foci following induction of DNA DSBs. As expected, GFP·ATM(KD) did not phosphorylate H2A.X (Ser-139). This experiment was repeated using FLAG-tagged ATM. Once again foci formation occurred only for wild type ATM and not for the KD mutant. These data indicate that ATM kinase activity is required for ATM foci formation. Identifying Nuclear Localization Signals within ATM—To map functional NLSs within ATM, a series of deletion mutation constructs was prepared in the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) (Fig. 2A). Expression of these GFP-tagged deletion mutants was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B), with all proteins being of the predicted size. Ectopically expressed GFP·ATM-(5–1303) exhibited a subcellular distribution similar to that of the full-length protein, with mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in the majority of cells (Fig. 2C). However, the carboxyl-terminal half of ATM-(1303–3056) was localized exclusively within the cytoplasm. This implied the existence of one or more nuclear localization signals within the amino-terminal half of ATM. To narrow down the region containing the NLS, we performed deletion mutation analysis of the amino-terminal half of ATM. This led to the identification of two non-overlapping amino-terminal fragments, ATM-(5–224) and ATM-(227–568), which were localized predominantly within the nucleus (Fig. 2C). Both these deletion mutants contained a short motif of basic amino acids reminiscent of the SV40 large T-antigen NLS. Deletion mutant ATM-(5–224) contained a cluster of three (+) charged basic residues (23RKK28), whereas ATM-(227–568) contained a cluster of four (+) charged basic residues (385KRKK388). To determine whether these amino acid sequences form functional NLSs, site-directed mutagenesis of these motifs was performed, changing core lysine or arginine residues to alanine. Amino acids 23RKK25 were mutated to 23RAA25 in the construct GFP·ATM-(5–224), and amino acids 385KRKK388 were mutated to 385KAAK388 in the construct GFP·ATM-(227–568). When expressed in cells the 23RAA25 mutant protein remained localized predominantly within the nucleus of transfected cells, indicating that 23RKK25 is not important for nuclear transport of the GFP·ATM-(5–224) construct (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the 385KAAK388 mutant localized predominantly within the cytoplasm, indicating that 385KRKK388 is critical for nuclear import of the GFP·ATM-(227–568) construct. Subsequently, the 385KAAK388 mutation was introduced into the full-length ATM construct, GFP·ATM(NLSm), which also localized predominantly within the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that this is the dominant NLS within full-length ATM. The distribution of GFP·ATM(NLSm) within cells was determined statistically over a larger sample, at least 200 transfected cells, repeated over three independent experiments in AT5BIVA cells (Fig. 2E). The results indicate that the mutation of this NLS sequence in ATM does not result in complete absence of ATM from the nucleus, as GFP·ATM(NLSm) was still faintly nuclear in about 18–25% of cells. Nuclear Import of ATM Is Mediated by Importin α1 and Importin β1—To identify proteins involved in transporting ATM into the nucleus, we assayed for interaction between ATM and members of the importin family of proteins by co-immunoprecipitation with ATM. We were able to detect interaction between ATM and importin β1 in whole cell extracts prepared from an A-T lymphoblastoid cell line stably expressing GFP·ATM but not from cells stably expressing GFP or GFP·ATM(NLSm) (Fig. 3A). Attempts to detect importin α by this technique were inconclusive because of close migration of importin α (58 KDa) with immunoglobulin. As an alternative strategy we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to assess whether ATM interacts directly with importin α1, α3, or α5 and β1. The fragment of ATM that contains the NLS, ATM-(227–568), was expressed in yeast in fusion with the GAL4 binding domain. Yeast were co-transformed with plasmids expressing importins in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain. We were able to show interaction of ATM-(227–568) with importins α1 and, to a lesser extent, α5 (Fig. 3B). To establish positive controls we assayed for interaction of p53 with the SV40 T-antigen (Clontech, yeast two-hybrid controls), which are known to interact very strongly, and of BRCA1 with importin α1 (11Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The extent of interaction between ATM-(227–568) and importin α1 was comparable with that seen between BRCA1 and importin α1. The interaction with importin β1 was negligible compared with GAD424 vector alone, suggesting that interaction of ATM with importin β1 detected in co-immunoprecipitation experiments is mediated through importin α1. Amino-terminal Sequences of ATM Are Required for Survival of Complemented A-T Cells in Response to IR-induced DNA Damage—We chose to compare the protective function of GFP·ATM with that of GFP·ATM(NLSm) (which localizes predominantly with the cytoplasm), GFP·ATM-(1303–3056) (which localizes within the cytoplasm), GFP·NLS-ATM-(1303–3056) (which is artificially targeted to the nucleus by insertion of an exogenous NLS), and GFP·ATM(KD) in stably transfected A-T fibroblast cells (AT5BIVA), which are exquisitely sensitive to IR. Cells complemented with GFP·ATM or the above mentioned mutants were assayed for their ability to survive DNA damage induced by IR at doses of 1, 2, or 4 Gy. Cells expressing GFP·ATM demonstrated a similar, although slightly higher, level of survival compared with that of cells expressing GFP·ATM(NLSm) (Fig. 4A). An explanation for this observation may be that low, but sufficient, amounts of GFP·ATM(NLSm) are present within the nucleus of these cells. Even this low level of GFP·ATM(NLSm) may provide a damage signal that allows these cells to survive. Cells expressing GFP·ATM(KD) and GFP·ATM-(1303–3056) exhibited no correction of radiosensitivity at the higher dose of 4 Gy. These results would be expected, as GFP·ATM(KD) cannot phosphorylate substrate, whereas GFP·ATM-(1303–3056) localizes exclusively within the cytoplasm and may therefore not be able to be activated or to phosphorylate substrate in response to a damage signal. Interestingly, cells expressing GFP-NLS·ATM-(1303–3056) were also impaired in their ability to correct radiosensitivity. This mutant of ATM contains a functional kinase domain and is artificially targeted to the nucleus, indicating that it is not sufficient to simply target the isolated kinase domain of ATM to the nucleus of cells to correct radiosensitivity. From these data we infer that amino-terminal sequences of ATM are required for its biological activity. Amino-terminal Sequences of ATM Are Required for Substrate Phosphorylation in Vivo—To assess whether the differences in survival of complemented A-T fibroblast cells correlate with restoration of the kinase activity of ATM, we examined the ability of A-T lymphoblastoid cells stably expressing GFP·ATM, GFP·ATM(KD), GFP·ATM(NLSm), and GFP·NLS-ATM-(1303–3056) to phosphorylate Ser-15 of p53 after exposure to IR (30 min after 4 Gy). GFP·ATM and GFP·ATM(NLSm) were able to phosphorylate p53 (Fig. 4B), whereas GFP·ATM(KD) and GFP·NLS-ATM-(1303–3056) could not phosphorylate p53. The residual level of signal seen with these mutants was comparable with GFP-vector only-expressing cells, suggesting that the amino terminus of ATM is required for optimal phosphorylation of substrates in vivo. Furthermore, when the above mentioned constructs were tested for ATM activation using phospho-Ser-1981 antibody, the GFP· ATM(KD) and GFP·NLS-ATM-(1303–3056) mutants did not show any detectable autophosphorylation relative to GFP· ATM. The autophosphorylation of GFP·ATM(NLSm) was considerably weaker than that seen with GFP·ATM. To find an explanation for our observation concerning the reduced autophosphorylation of GFP·ATM(NLSm), we performed immunofluorescence assays on A-T fibroblasts expressing these fusion proteins. We found that only the nuclear fraction of GFP·ATM or GFP·ATM(NLSm) was autophosphorylated (Fig. 4C). Considering the relatively small amount of GFP·ATM(NLSm) protein within the nucleus of these cells, this observation would explain why an apparent substantial reduction in the amount of autophosphorylated GFP·ATM(NLSm) mutant was seen by immunoblot analysis. To determine whether GFP·ATM(NLSm) is able to confer radioresistance and normal phosphorylation of p53, perhaps because of the small amount of ATM that is localized in the nucleus, we introduced the HIV-Rev nuclear export signal (NES) between GFP and ATM(NLSm), GFP· NES-ATM(NLSm), in order to remove ATM from the nucleus. A-T lymphoblastoid cells stably expressing GFP·ATM (wild type), GFP·ATM(KD), GFP·ATM(NLSm), and GFP-NES-ATM-(NLSm) were compared for their ability to correct radiosensitivity and to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15 after IR-induced DNA damage. We found that GFP·NES-ATM(NLSm), which localized exclusively within the cytoplasm, had a substantially reduced ability to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-15 (Fig. 4D) and increased radiosensitivity, compared with GFP·ATM(NLSm) (Fig. 4E), suggesting that nuclear localization is required for ATM activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the amino terminus of ATM is required for optimal ATM activation and the subsequent ATM activity.

https://openalex.org/W2172201098,"Mlc from Escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor controlling the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), including ptsG and manXYZ, the specific enzyme II for glucose and mannose PTS transporters. In addition, Mlc controls the transcription of malT, the gene of the global activator of the mal regulon. The inactivation of Mlc as a repressor is mediated by binding to an actively transporting PtsG (EIICBGlc). Here we report the crystal structure of Mlc at 2.7 Å resolution representing the first described structure of an ROK (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family protein. Mlc forms stable dimers thus explaining its binding affinity to palindromic operator sites. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of Mlc is stabilized by the amphipathic C-terminal helix implicated earlier in EIICBGlc binding. Furthermore, the structure revealed a metal-binding site within the cysteine-rich ROK consensus motif that coordinates a structurally important zinc ion. A strongly reduced repressor activity was observed when two of the zinc-coordinating cysteine residues were exchanged against serine or alanine, demonstrating the role of zinc in Mlc-mediated repressor function. The structures of a putative fructokinase from Bacillus subtilis, the glucokinase from Escherichia coli, and a glucomannokinase from Arthrobacter sp. showed high structural homology to the ROK family part of Mlc.

Mlc (makes large colonies) has been discovered as a regulator protein curbing the utilization of glucose in Escherichia coli (1Hosono K. Kakuda H. Ichihara S. Biosci. Biotechnol.

In contrast to the classical mode of repressor inactivation by a cognate inducer, Mlc is inactivated by the sequestrating interaction with the actively transporting glucose transporter, the EIICBGlc protein of the PTS (10Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouché J.P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The interaction occurs at the EIIBGlc domain of the transporter encompassing a critical cysteine residue (Cys-421). This cysteine residue is phosphorylated in the resting transporter and becomes readily dephosphorylated during glucose transport by the transfer of the phosphoryl group onto the incoming glucose. Mlc binds only to the dephosphorylated form of EIIBGlc (13Seitz S. Lee S.J. Pennetier C. Boos W. Plumbridge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10744-10751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound state of EIIBGlc is essential for Mlc inactivation. Soluble EIIBGlc, even though able to interact with Mlc (12Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J.

However, EIIBGlc attached to the membrane by any lipophilic anchor, even unrelated to EIICBGlc, binds Mlc in a fashion that prevents binding to the operator regions (13Seitz S. Lee S.J. Pennetier C. Boos W. Plumbridge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10744-10751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This indicates that Mlc, when it is in close contact with the membrane, alters its conformation to suppress operator binding. As judged by its amino acid sequence, Mlc belongs to the ROK family (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) (14Titgemeyer F. Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) of transcriptional regulators encompassing xylose repressors, sugar kinases, and transcriptional regulators with the widely conserved CXCGXXGCXE motif (consensus sequence 2). They also harbor another consensus motif (consensus sequence 1) consisting of 28 amino acid residues, located 9 residues upstream from consensus sequence 2 (15Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding motif of Mlc consists of a typical helix-turn-helix motif at its N terminus, and the protein behaves in dilute buffer solution as tetramer of a polypeptide of 44.3 kDa (12Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.-O. Ryu S. Seok Y.-J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Seitz S. Lee S.J. Pennetier C. Boos W. Plumbridge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10744-10751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The removal of the 18 C-terminal residues leads to dimer formation, to the loss of EIICBGlc binding, as well as to the loss of operator interaction (13Seitz S. Lee S.J. Pennetier C. Boos W. Plumbridge J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10744-10751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, most surprisingly, the C terminus, which is far from the helix-turn-helix motif in the primary sequence, must be involved directly or indirectly, possibly via a large conformational change in EIICBGlc binding as well as in operator recognition and subsequent repression. Regarding its unusual mechanism of derepression, it was of interest to elucidate the crystal structure of this novel transcriptional regulator. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of dimeric Mlc R52H at 2.7 Å resolution. Structure Determination and Refinement—Mlc was cloned, expressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously (16Gerber K. Boos W. Welte W. Schiefner A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Three data sets were collected on a selenomethionine-labeled Mlc crystal at the Swiss Light Source SLS Villigen (CH) beamline X06SA. The crystals of space group C2 with unit cell parameters of a = 235.95 Å, b = 74.71 Å, c = 154.95 Å, β = 129.15° diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.7 Å. The raw data were reduced using XDS (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Because of the radiation sensitivity of the crystals, only the peak and inflection data sets were used for structure solution and refinement (Table I). The selenium substructure was determined with SHELXD (18Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), and phases were calculated with SHARP (19de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) using the data sets collected at the peak and the inflection wavelength. Density modification was done in RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), resulting in interpretable electron density maps up to 3 Å resolution. Model building was done manually with the programs “O” (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). To use the best data for refinement, the peak and the inflection data sets were merged resulting in a better overall quality of the data (Table I). Refinement statistics and quality indicators of the resulting Mlc model are listed in Table II.Table ICrystal data and x-ray data collection statistics for a single SeMet-Mlc crystal Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.

Programs Used for Structural and Sequence Analyses—The program DSSP (Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins) (26Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar) was used for buried surface calculations and SIM (27Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar) for sequence alignments. The quality of the resulting Mlc model was checked with the program PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). PDB Accession Code—The coordinate data sets of the structure of SeMet-Mlc R52H is available in the Protein Data Bank (29Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H.

Structure of the Mlc Monomer—The structure of Mlc represents the first described structure of an ROK family member. An Mlc molecule shown in Fig. 1 consists of three domains as follows: (a) a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain (30Harrison S.C. Aggarwal A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 933-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 31Wintjens R. Rooman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) from amino acid residues 1 to 81 + 395 to 406 (domain 1, green); (b) a smaller α/β-domain from residues 82 to 194 + 381 to 394 (domain 2, yellow); and (c) a larger α/β-domain from residues 195 to 380 (domain 3, blue). The final Mlc model contains 382 of 406 residues. Two segments in domain 1, residues 1–11 and 64–76, were structurally disordered in all four molecules within the asymmetric unit and were therefore not included in the final model. The structurally disordered region 64–76 of the HTH domain is known to be very flexible from HTH motifs described previously. It adopts its destined conformation, the so-called hinge helix, only upon binding to the operator DNA (32Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 33Spronk C.A. Slijper M. van Boom J.H. Kaptein R. Boelens R. Nat. Struct.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2866-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Domains 2 and 3 are common to all ROK family members (14Titgemeyer F. Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1, yellow and blue). Both α/β-domains (domains 2 and 3) consist of a central β-sheet flanked by a pair of α-helices on one side and a single α-helix on the other side. Between domains 2 and 3 the polypeptide chain switches twice, so that domain 3 is formed by a continuous polypeptide, whereas the fold of domain 2 is completed by the returning C terminus from domain 3, packing as a C-terminal helix against the β-sheet of domain 2 (bright yellow in Fig. 1). The interface between domains 2 and 3 is mainly formed by the two single α-helices flanking the β-sheet in each domain. However, the packing of both domains toward each other is not very tight, allowing the domains to adopt different conformations with respect to each other. In addition to being part of domain 2, the C-terminal helix bends and is also part of domain 1 (bright-green in Fig. 1), thereby stabilizing the orientation of the HTH domain (domain 1) with respect to domain 2. This stabilization might be the reason why the HTH part of domain 1 is structurally ordered, whereas the connecting segment, including the hinge helix in domain 1, is not. The three domains of an Mlc monomer behave as rigid groups, but the pairwise arrangement of the domains is different in the four molecules (A–D) within the asymmetric unit. The differences in the domain orientations were analyzed with the program DYNDOM (35Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) using domain 3 of the Mlc molecule A as the reference. Several rotational axes do not coincide in all possible domain pairs of the four Mlc molecules. Domains 1 and 2 are rotated as single units in molecules B and C by 18 and 5°, respectively. In molecule D, however, domain 2 is rotated by 22°, and domain 1, with respect to domain 2, is rotated by 12° around another axis at the same time. In addition, the comparison of molecule A with molecule B shows that residues 244–270 of domain 3, harboring parts of the two ROK motifs, are able to rotate separately by 14° with respect to the rest of domain 3. The ROK Signature Forms a Zinc-binding Site—Domain 3 contains consensus motifs 1 and 2 that characterize the ROK family members (14Titgemeyer F. Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both motifs are highlighted in Fig. 1 as red and orange ribbons. Consensus motif 1 (Fig. 1, red) forms part of the central β-sheet in domain 3, leading into a loop followed by a short 310 helix that ends with the invariant histidine His-247. Nine residues downstream, consensus motif 1 is followed by consensus motif 2 (Fig. 1, orange), starting with the conserved cysteine residues Cys-257 and Cys-259, followed by the conserved cysteine residue Cys-264. The structural explanation for the conservation of these residues is the tetrahedral coordination of a zinc ion by the four residues His-247, Cys-257, Cys-259, and Cys-264 (see Fig. 1, highlighted as a gray sphere). The presence of the zinc ion (0.9 ± 0.1 zinc per protein) was confirmed by atom absorption spectroscopy, EPR, and UV-visible spectroscopy. The Mlc Dimer and Its Binding to DNA—The four molecules within the asymmetric unit are arranged as two homodimers AB (chains A and B) and CD (chains C and D). Fig. 2A shows AB perpendicular to the 2-fold axis, and Fig. 2B shows AB along the 2-fold axis of the dimer. The dimerization occurs via domain 3 (Fig. 2B, blue) of each monomer, burying a surface area of 1378 Å2 (in the case of AB) and 1393 Å2 (in the case of CD). In the CD dimer there is an additional contact of 303 Å2 between the HTH domains resulting from the above-mentioned Mlc flexibility and the crystal packing, but it is apparently not relevant for the dimer formation. Both dimers found in the asymmetric unit show different conformations. Although the superposition of chains A and C shows almost identical molecules, the superposition of chains B and D reveals two conformationally distinguishable dimers (see superposition in Fig. 3A). The conformational flexibility results in different distances between the two recognition helices in each dimer. Fig. 3, B–D, shows the isolated HTH domains of both dimers (AB in yellow and CD in blue). In dimer AB, the distance between the recognition helices is ∼31.7 Å, very close to the helical pitch of B-DNA, which is 34 Å (Fig. 3, B and C). On the other hand, the CD dimer is much narrower with a distance of ∼26.7 Å between the two recognition helices (Fig. 3, D and E), excluding its participation in DNA binding in this conformation. In addition, Fig. 3, C and E, shows that the recognition helices are not completely parallel, as one would assume from Fig. 3, B and D. The DNA would have to bend upon Mlc binding in order to accommodate both recognition helices of the AB dimer.Fig. 3Comparison of the two Mlc dimers and the orientation of their recognition helices. A, superposition of the two Mlc dimers AB (yellow) and CD (blue) as found in the asymmetric unit. Chains A and C (left) are almost identical in their conformation and fit well onto each other, whereas chains B and D have different conformations. The arrow indicates the hinge region that is the main source of flexibility. B–E, dimers reduced to the three N-terminal helices of the HTH domain, dimer AB shown in yellow (B and C) and dimer CD in blue (D and E).

In order to determine whether the biochemically described tetramer is present in the Mlc crystals as well, we investigated all intermolecular contacts of the two Mlc dimers (AB and CD) within possible asymmetric units. The most symmetric arrangement relates both Mlc dimers by a pseudo 2-fold axis via domains 3. The single contacts are relatively weak with only 600 Å2 between chains A and D and 636 Å2 between chains B and C. Both contacts taken alone are not significant for a stable multimer formation (36Janin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 973-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the sum of both contacts in a dimer of dimers with 1236 Å2 could be relevant for a tetrameric structure. Nevertheless, we do not consider the crystallographic tetramer to be physiologically relevant. Comparison of Mlc with Related Structures—A similarity search using the DALI server (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed three bacterial kinases having the same structure as the ROK part of Mlc. In Table III the alignment lengths and the r.m.s. deviations of the identical C-α positions are listed. The highest structural homology to Mlc shows a putative fructokinase from Bacillus subtilis (Bs-FrcK), PDB code 1XC3, which has not been published so far. Bs-FrcK belongs to the ROK family as well, a fact explaining the structural homology. Its zinc ion is coordinated by two histidines and two cysteines spaced by a different number of amino acids as compared with Mlc. The second and third most similar structures are the glucokinase from E. coli (Ec-GlcK), PDB codes 1Q18 and 1SZ2 (38Lunin V.V. Li Y. Schrag J.D. Iannuzzi P. Cygler M. Matte A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6915-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and a bacterial inorganic polyphosphate/ATP glucomannokinase from Arthrobacter sp. (As-GMK), PDB code 1WOQ (39Mukai T.

Both proteins, Ec-GlcK and As-GMK, are not regarded as ROK family proteins but are in fact very similar to the ROK part of Mlc consisting of domains 2 and 3.Table IIIStructural comparison of Mlc, Bs-FrcK, a putative fructokinase from B. subtilis (PDB code 1XC3), Ec-GlcK, the glucokinase from E. coli (PDB code 1Q18), and As-GMK, the inorganic polyphosphate/ATP-glucomannokinase from Arthrobacter sp. (PDB code 1WOQ) R.m.s. deviations and alignment lengths were determined by using the DALI structural alignment server. Crystal contacts equivalent to the Mlc dimer contact are given by their buried surfaces between two monomers as calculated by the program (Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins). Except for the structure of Bs-FrcK, where this contact was formed by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, this putative dimeric arrangement was found within the asymmetric units of the described structures. Oligomeric states were determined either by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for As-GMK (47Mukai T. Kawai S. Matsukawa H. Matuo Y. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by dynamic light scattering (DLS) for Ec-GlcK (38Lunin V.V. Li Y. Schrag J.D. Iannuzzi P. Cygler M. Matte A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6915-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As-GMK forms only monomers, and Bs-FrcK has not yet been investigated for oligomeric states.

The fifth residue, an asparagine in Ec-GlcK and in As-GMK is a histidine (His-194) in Mlc and a threonine in Bs-FrcK. However, despite the high structural similarity of the corresponding region in Mlc to the binding site for glucose in Ec-GlcK and As-GMK, Mlc does not bind glucose or glucose 6-phosphate as measured by the ammonium sulfate precipitation technique (40Richarme G. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The same technique readily revealed glucose binding of Ec-GlcK (data not shown). This suggested that the fifth position (His-194 in Mlc) either discriminates between different sugars or between sugar binding and non-binding. However, altering His-194 to Asn did not result in glucose binding or glucokinase activity. 2M. Erhard, unpublished results. The structural homology between the monomeric forms of Mlc, Bs-FrcK, Ec-GlcK, and As-GMK indicated similar quaternary structures. Our Mlc structure clearly shows two dimers within the asymmetric unit. In Table III the contact interfaces within the crystal packings are listed, showing the same 2-fold symmetry as the Mlc dimer. According to their buried surfaces, Bs-FrcK, Ec-GlcK, and As-GMK could be able to form stable homodimers of similar architecture as well (see Table III). Structural Localization of Mlc Mutants—All mutations in Mlc characterized so far are shown in Fig. 4, highlighted by different colors.

To characterize the specific interaction between XPF and ERCC1, we expressed the human ERCC1 binding domain of XPF (XPF-EB) and the XPF binding domain of ERCC1 (ERCC1-FB) in Escherichia coli. Milligram quantities of a heterodimer were characterized with gel filtration chromatography, an Ni2+-NTA binding assay, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Cross-linking experiments at high salt concentrations revealed that XPF interacts with ERCC1 mainly through hydrophobic interactions. XPF-EB was also shown to homodimerize in the absence of ERCC1. NMR cross-saturation methods were applied to map the residues involved in formation of the XPF-EB·XPF-EB homodimer and the XPF-EB·ERCC1-FB heterodimer. Helix H3 and the C-terminal region of XPF-EB were either within or in close proximity to the homodimer interface, whereas the ERCC1-FB binding site of XPF-EB was distributed across helix H1, a small part of H2, H3, and the C-terminal region, most of which exhibited large changes in chemical shift upon ERCC1 binding. The XPF-EB heterodimeric interface is larger than the XPF-EB homodimeric one, which could explain why XPF has a stronger affinity for ERCC1 than for a second molecule of XPF. The XPF binding sites of ERCC1 were located in helices H1 and H3 and in the C-terminal region, similar to the involved surface of XPF. We used cross-saturation data and the crystal structure of related proteins to model the two complexes.

DNA lesions, which interfere with DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (1.Benhamou S. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), occur as a result of exogenous and endogenous damaging agents, such as UV irradiation, products of oxidative stress, and DNA-reactive chemicals. To maintain the integrity of the genome, DNA lesions are efficiently removed by DNA repair pathways, such as the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which removes various types of bulky DNA adducts. During nucleotide excision repair, the 5′ and 3′ sides of a lesion are cut by two endonucleases, the XPF-ERCC1 heterodimeric complex and XPG, respectively (2.de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G.J.

To more fully characterize the mode of interaction between ERCC1 and XPF, the human ERCC1 binding domain of XPF (XPF-EB) and XPF binding domain of ERCC1 (ERCC1-FB) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and 1-mg quantities of a soluble form of the XPF-EB·ERCC1-FB complex were generated and characterized. To decipher the nature of the XPF-ERCC1 interaction in detail, we used the soluble, recombinant complex in NMR cross-saturation experiments to map the amino acid residues that make contact between the two subunits. This enabled us to study the XPF-ERCC1 interaction at the molecular level and to propose a model for XPF-ERCC1 complex formation. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which XPF and ERCC1 interact specifically and tightly and how this binding contributes to the stabilization of the subunits. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of XPF-EB1, XPF-EB2, XPF-EB3, and ERCC1-FB—The DNA coding sequences for XPF-EB1 (amino acids 813-905) and ERCC1-FB (amino acids 224-297) were subcloned into two versions of the bacterial expression vector pET21a (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI sites, one with a C-terminal His tag and one without. The DNA coding sequence for XPF-EB2 (amino acids 838-901) was subcloned, with an N-terminal His tag, into pET100/D-TOPO® (Invitrogen). The plasmid for expression of the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-XPF-EB3 fusion protein (amino acids 813-847) was generated from pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) using the BamHI and XhoI sites. The resulting proteins are shown in Fig. 1. The nucleotide sequences of the various constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids harboring the genes for the various versions ERCC1 and XPF were transformed into E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and BL21 for large scale protein preparation. To produce the 15N-labeled and 13C/15N-labeled proteins, the bacteria were grown in M9 minimal medium that contained 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and (for double-labeled protein) 2 g/liter 13C-labeled glucose as the carbon source. For uniformly 2H- and 15N-labeled proteins, the cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 98% 2H2O, 15NH4Cl, and [2H]glucose (98 atom %). All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C except for the steps carried out in 6 m urea. The soluble His-tagged ERCC1 binding domain of XPF was purified using both a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) and a gel filtration column. After thrombin cleavage to release the N-terminal His tag, a benzamidine column (Amersham Biosciences) was used to remove the thrombin. GST-XPF-EB3 was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). ERCC1-FB was overexpressed in inclusion bodies, solubilized in resuspension buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 6 m urea), and purified using a Sepharose column (16 mm × 100 cm) charged with Sephacryl S-200 resin (200 ml; Amersham Biosciences) under denaturing conditions. Refolding—Refolding of urea-treated ERCC1-FB, either alone or in the presence of the ERCC1 binding domain of XPF, was performed at 4 °C using two different refolding methods. One method involved stepwise dialysis to remove the denaturing agent (urea) gradually. Proteins were dialyzed sequentially over a period of 8 h against 4, 2, 1, 0.1, and 0 m urea, each in dialysis buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl). A pH of 8.0 was used because disulfide bond formation occurs more rapidly at higher pH than at neutral pH (22.Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar); the XPF and ERCC1 binding assays also were performed at a pH near pH 8.0 as in other reports (13.McCutchen-Maloney S.L. Giannecchini C.A. Hwang M.H. Thelen M.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9417-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19.de Laat W.L. Sijbers A.M. Odijk H. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4146-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). l-Arginine (250 mm) was added to the 1 m urea buffer to facilitate protein refolding during stepwise dialysis (23.Suenaga M. Ohmae H. Tsuji S. Itoh T. Nishimura O. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 28: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). The second refolding method used was rapid dilution. The ERCC1-FB protein, either alone or in the presence of the ERCC1 binding domain of XPF (final protein concentration was ∼80 μg/ml), was refolded by making 100-fold dilutions in refolding buffer (pH 8, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm oxidized glutathione, and 250 mm l-arginine). Refolding was allowed to proceed for 20 h with stirring. At the end of 20 h, the refolding solution was dialyzed against dialysis buffer. The soluble and insoluble fractions of the final protein solution were separated by centrifugation and subjected to PAGE to identify the fractions enriched for the protein of interest. Binding Assays Using Ni2+-NTA-agarose—A Ni2+-NTA-agarose column was pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT). The detergent Nonidet P-40 was added to the buffer to prevent nonspecific binding between proteins. After loading the column with protein, it was washed with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer and His tag washing buffer (50 mm imidazole, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT). The proteins were then eluted with His tag elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT), and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Binding Assays of GST-XPF-EB3-(813-847) using GST Resin—The GST-XPF-EB3-(813-847) fusion protein and GST were prepared and incubated in the presence of ERCC1-FB during the refolding process described above. A glutathione-Sepharose column was pre-equilibrated with GST-binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT). After loading the column with protein, it was washed with 10 bed volumes of GST-binding buffer. Proteins were eluted with GST elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75 prep grade (16 mm × 120 cm)) was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The column was equilibrated with XPF-ERCC1 binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6), 500 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT) before the protein preparation was applied. Molecular size standards were bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43.5 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome C (12.4 kDa) (Sigma). Molecular sizes of the recombinant proteins of interest were calculated from a plot of the elution volume versus the log of the molecular size. Chemical Cross-linking—Refolded heterodimers (20 μm) were allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C in the following buffers: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT with various concentrations of NaCl (75, 150, 300, 500, or 1000 mm). Glutaraldehyde is a homobifunctional amine cross-linker that reacts with primary amino groups on proteins and thus has been used as a protein cross-linking reagent. Glutaradehyde was then added to the refolded heterodimer mixture to a final concentration of 0.005%. After incubation for 2 h, the reaction was quenched with a Tris (pH 6.8) solution to a final concentration of 50 mm. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—We carried out sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments at 4 °C and 20 °C on a Beckman model XLA analytical ultracentrifuge using an AN-60-Ti rotor. Most experiments were carried out using the standard 12-mm path length, six-channel, charcoal-filled epon cells with quartz windows. Continuous radial scanning at 280 nm was used for both the refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex (3.9, 3.8, and 4.1 mg/ml) and for XPF-EB1 (3 mg/ml). The six channels were scanned at speeds of 18,000 and 20,000 rpm. The cells were scanned every 0.001 cm, and 50 scans were averaged. The standard buffer was XPF-ERCC1 binding buffer. The default value of 1.00017 g/ml was used for the density of the solvent, and a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g was calculated from the weight average of the partial specific volumes of individual amino acids. CD—10 μm protein samples were prepared in XPF-ERCC1 binding buffer, and CD spectra of the proteins were measured on a JASCO J-720 CD spectropolarimeter at room temperature using a cell path length of 1 mm. For urea denaturation experiments, urea was dissolved in XPF-ERCC1 binding buffer, and the samples were incubated in the urea buffer for 12 h prior to analysis by CD. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K using a 600-MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer and a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer with a cryoprobe. A series of three-dimensional triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA-(CO)NH, HNCO, C(CC-TOC-CO)NH, and H(CC-TOC-CO)NH) were recorded for spectral assignments (24.Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe/nmrDraw programs (25.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). NMR samples contained 1 mm 13C,15N-labeled proteins dissolved in 1H2O/2H2O (9:1, v/v) containing 50 mm phosphate (pH 6), 1 mm DTT, and 500 mm NaCl. Cross-saturation experiments were carried out at 25 °C according to the procedure of Takahashi et al. (26.Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The sample contained 1 mm 2H,15N-labeled protein with the nonlabeled interaction partner protein in 1H2O/2H2O (1:9, v/v) that contained 50 mm phosphate (pH 6), 1 mm DTT, and 500 mm NaCl. The WURST-2 decoupling scheme (27.Kupce E. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 117: 246-256Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was used for the saturation of aliphatic protons with the irradiation frequency set to 1 ppm. A recycle delay of 3.0 s (1.8-s saturation time) was employed. The results of significantly overlapped residues were excluded when the reduction ratios of the signal intensities were calculated. Molecular Modeling—The only structure of a dimeric HhH protein reported at the time of this work was that of the Eph receptor sterile α motif (SAM) domain (28.Stapleton D. Balan I. Pawson T. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Protein Data Bank code 1b0x. The differences in the residues comprising helix 5 and differences in the regions of contact in the XPF-EB2/ERCC1-FB complex (indicated by cross-saturation experiments) relative to what is seen in the crystal structure indicated that modeling the interface in the XPF-EB2·ERCC1-FB complex based on the SAM domain structure would be problematic. To generate a model for the XPF-EB2·ERCC1-FB complex, a structure of each protein was first generated by carrying out homology modeling based on the Protein Data Bank using MODELLER 6v2 (29.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10564) Google Scholar). Models for XPF-EB2 and ERCC1-FB were built onto the SAM domain (Protein Data Bank code 1b0x) and C-terminal domain of UvrC (Protein Data Bank code 1kft) as a template with the highest identity and similarity, respectively. Restrained energy minimization was used for portions of the model, which required manual refinement, and the model consistency was assessed with PROCHECK (30.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

The resulting structures were then used to generate a model for the heterodimer complex using the program AUTODOCK 3.05 (31.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K.

The electrostatic potential grid of this cubic box was calculated using a grid spacing of 0.75 Å. Step sizes of 2 Å for translation and 50° for rotation were chosen, and the maximum number of energy evaluations was set to 250,000. For the genetic algorithm, a population size of 50 was used, and the maximum number of generations was set to 27,000. The best complex was chosen according to the lowest energy. After submission of this manuscript, a new structure appeared for an archaeal XPF homodimer (32.Newman M. Murray-Rust J. Lally J. Rudolf J. Fadden A. Knowles P.P. White M.F. McDonald N.Q. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) including nuclease and (HhH)2 domains. The sequences of human XPF and ERCC1 were threaded to the individual monomers of this model, using Swiss-PDBViewer 4.7, for comparison. Aggregated ERCC1-FB Is Refolded Only in the Presence of Its Interaction Partner XPF-EB—XPF-EB1-(813-905) carrying a C-terminal His tag was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). In contrast, non-His-tagged ERCC1-FB-(224-297) was expressed exclusively in inclusion bodies in the same E. coli strain (Fig. 1). Although a variety of expression vectors, E. coli strains, and culturing temperatures were tested, we were unable to produce soluble ERCC1-FB. To try to obtain a soluble form of the protein, we disrupted the aggregated ERCC1-FB in resuspending buffer that contained the denaturing reagent urea and then refolded the protein in vitro at 4 °C by stepwise dialysis or rapid dilution of the urea concentration. Although we modulated various factors, including pH, composition of the refolding medium, and redox conditions, the bulk of the ERCC1-FB remained aggregated during the refolding process. We next tried to refold ERCC1-FB in the presence of XPF-EB1 using stepwise dialysis or rapid dilution. The two recombinant proteins were combined in the 6 m urea initial buffer described above, and the mixture was subjected to stepwise dialysis to eliminate the urea. In addition, ERCC1-FB that had been solubilized in the 6 m urea buffer was subjected to rapid dilution with refolding buffer that contained XPF-EB1. After stepwise dialysis or rapid dilution, most of the ERCC1-FB protein, along with the XPF-EB1 protein, was recovered in the soluble fraction, which could be concentrated to yield an ERCC1-FB·XPF-EB1 preparation that was greater than 1 mm. The 1H NMR spectra of the proteins refolded by the two methods were identical (data not shown), indicating that both methods yielded comparably folded proteins in an efficient manner. To examine the structural stability of XPF-EB1, urea-induced unfolding of XPF-EB1 was monitored by far UV CD using ellipticity changes at 222 nm (Fig. 2A). Loss of the minimum at 222 nm indicates the disruption of α-helical structure, which is a major structural component of XPF-EB1. The unfolding of XPF-EB1 did not occur until the urea concentration reached 6 m (Fig. 2A); this finding suggests that, during the refolding of ERCC1-FB in the presence of XPF-EB1 described above, most of the XPF-EB1 had a secondary structure similar to the native state. This result could explain the high yields from the refolding process used for the XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex. In other words, during the refolding of this protein complex, XPF-EB1, which was mostly structurally intact, prevented the aggregation of the exposed hydrophobic regions of ERCC1-FB and/or acted as a template to induce the proper folding of ERCC1-FB. Refolded ERCC1-FB and XPF-EB1 Bind Tightly to Each Other in a 1:1 Ratio by Hydrophobic Interactions—In order to determine whether refolded XPF-EB1 and ERCC1-FB are functionally active (ERCC1-FB binds tightly and specifically to XPF-EB1), binding assays using Ni2+-NTA-agarose were performed. A mixture containing the refolded complex (XPF-EB1 with a C-terminal His tag and ERCC1-FB) was loaded on a Ni2+-NTA affinity column, and the resin was extensively washed with Ni2+-NTA binding and His tag washing buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding. ERCC1-FB remained adhered to the column along with XPF-EB1, revealing that ERCC1-FB was bound tightly to XPF-EB1 (Fig. 2B), showing that the refolded proteins retain their ability to bind to each other, which is the key function of these domains. Other reports have shown that active XPF-ERCC1 complexes can be prepared using methods that involve co-expression and co-purification, reflecting strong interactions between XPF-EB1 and ERCC1-FB (2.de Laat W.L.

On the basis of their amino acid sequences, XPF-EB1 and ERCC1-FB have predicted monomeric molecular masses of 11 and 8.2 kDa, respectively. In order to determine the stoichiometry of the refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex, gel filtration chromatography and equilibrium sedimentation were performed. The hydrodynamic molecular size of nonrefolded XPF-EB1 was analyzed on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column. XPF-EB1 eluted as a single peak at 64.51 min, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 38 kDa, consistent with either a trimer of globular shape or a dimer with an extended shape. The refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex eluted as a single peak at 71.19 min, a significantly longer elution time than that of XPF-EB1 alone, and corresponding to a molecular mass of 25.2 kDa (Table I). We also tested refolded XPF-EB1 alone, which eluted at the same position as native XPF-EB1 on a gel filtration column. These results indicate that the refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex is a 1:1 heterodimeric complex with a slightly extended conformation and that XPF-EB1 binds preferentially to ERCC1-FB despite competition from the self-association reaction of XPF-EB1.Table IEstimation of the molecular sizes of XPF-EB1 alone, XPF-EB2 alone, the XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex, and the XPF-EB2·ERCC1-FB complex by gel filtrationProteinsElution timeMolecular massminkDaXPF-EB1 alone64.5138.0Refolded XPF-EB1 alone64.4238.0XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB71.1925.2XPF-EB2 alone78.8016.4XPF-EB2·ERCC1-FB77.2317.4 Open table in a new tab To confirm the gel filtration data, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation equilibrium sedimentation experiments. The concentration of protein versus radius data were fitted with various models and were best described by a single component model. The equilibrium sedimentation data yielded a molecular weight of 17,863 ± 600 g·mol-1 for the refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex for the different rotor speeds, protein concentrations, and temperatures used (Table II). This supports the conclusion that the XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex has a stoichiometry of one ERCC1-FB molecule bound per monomer of XPF-EB1 and that the 25-kDa size observed with gel filtration chromatography results from an elongated shape for the complex. In addition, equilibrium sedimentation results showed that XPF-B1 alone had a molecular weight of 21,060 ± 300 g·mol-1 at 4 °C (Table II), which implies that XPF-EB1 exists as a homodimer.Table IISedimentation equilibrium experiments with the refolded XPF-EB1·ERCC1-FB complex and XPF-EB1 aloneConcentrationRotor speedMolecular weightaFrom ultrascan 6.0 analysis.mg/mlrpmg·mol−1XPF-EB·ERCC1-FB3.918,00018,490bAt a temperature of 20 °C.XPF-EB·ERCC1-FB3.820,00017,720cAt a temperature of 4 °C.XPF-EB·ERCC1-FB4.120,00017,300cAt a temperature of 4 °C.XPF-EB13.020,00021,060cAt a temperature of 4 °C.a From ultrascan 6.0 analysis.b At a temperature of 20 °C.c At a temperature of 4 °C. Open table in a new tab To determine whether electrostatic interactions are important in the interaction of XPF-EB1 and ERCC1-FB, we assessed the cross-linking of the complex by glutaraldehyde in the presence of varying sodium chloride concentrations, analyzing products by SDS-PAGE. Variation in the sodium chloride concentration from 0.075 to 1 m did not alter the cross-linked patterns, although the intensity of the protein bands (lanes 5 and 6) in the SDS gel was slightly decreased at high salt concentrations (Fig. 2C), suggesting that formation of this complex is driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions. We also optimized the solvent conditions for NMR studies of this complex and observed that the complex showed reduced tendency to aggregate at higher salt concentrations (data not shown). Finally, the same cross-linking experiment with XPF-EB1 alone indicates that the XPF-EB1 homodimer is also driven by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2C). Other studies have highlighted the importance of hydrophobic interactions in distinct structure-specific endonuclease complexes that participate in nucleotide excision repair, such as UvrB and UvrC E. coli (33.Moolenaar G.F.

Two members of the Kunitz family of inhibitors that are involved in regulating coagulation and fibrinolysis are tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) 1The abbreviations used are: TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; KD1, Kunitz domain 1; FVIIa, factor VIIa; TF, tissue factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; APPI, amyloid precursor protein inhibitor; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; KD1, Kunitz domain 1; FVIIa, factor VIIa; TF, tissue factor; ECM, extracellular matrix; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; APPI, amyloid precursor protein inhibitor; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and TFPI-2. TFPI-2, also known as matrix serine protease inhibitor or placental protein 5, features a domain organization similar to TFPI and contains three Kunitz-type inhibitory domains in tandem with a short acidic amino terminus and very basic carboxyl-terminal tail (9Sprecher C.A.

Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 45-52Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These three forms are believed to correspond to differentially glycosylated forms of TFPI-2 (16Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y.Y. O'Toole E.A.O. Reeder D.J. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 45-52Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 exhibits inhibitory activity primarily toward trypsin, plasmin, and factor VIIa (FVIIa)/tissue factor (TF) through its Kunitz domain 1 (KD1) and is believed to be the major inhibitor of plasmin in the ECM (17Chand H.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17500-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, TFPI-2 has little inhibitory activity toward urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue-type plasminogen activator, or thrombin (18Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). By inhibiting plasmin, TFPI-2 decreases the activation of the matrix metalloproteinases pro-MMP-1 and pro-MMP-3 and thereby suppresses formation of the active MMP-2. As a consequence of decreased MMP-2 activation, ECM degradation and tumor growth and metastasis are reduced (19Rao C.N. Mohanam S. Puppala A. Rao J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Moreover, TFPI-2 expression is reported to be up-regulated in atherosclerotic coronary arteries, indicating that it may play a role in prevention of atherosclerotic plaque rupture (23Crawley J.T. Goulding D.A. Ferreira V. Severs N.J. Lupu F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also, TFPI-2 has recently been shown to delay retinal degeneration by stimulating proliferation of the retinal pigment epithelium, although the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear (24Obata R. Yanagi Y. Tamaki Y. Hozumi K. Mutoh M. Tanaka Y. Eye. 2004; 18: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the protease specificity of KD1 is biologically significant. TFPI-2 inhibits proteases via the P1 arginine residue 2For comparison, the chymotrypsin amino acid numbering system is used throughout for trypsin, plasmin, and FVIIa.

Although KD1 is specific for inhibiting plasmin, the other two Kunitz domains in TFPI-2 have no discernable inhibitory activity and may serve to bind to nearby proteins to localize TFPI-2 in the ECM. These two Kunitz domains may also serve as spacers to correctly position KD1 to interact with plasmin. As a prelude to crystal structure determinations, mutagenesis and molecular modeling of KD1 were employed to understand the specificity of interaction between KD1 and trypsin, plasmin, or FVIIa/TF (17Chand H.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17500-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We now report the crystal structure of KD1 complexed with trypsin that precisely defines the interactions between KD1 and this protease. The crystal structures of KD1, plasmin, and FVIIa/TF were then used to refine the protease·inhibitor models built previously (17Chand H.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17500-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Knowledge gained from these studies may help in the development of a potent and specific TFPI-2 KD1 molecule that can selectively inhibit plasmin without targeting other proteases. Such a molecule could have a large pharmacologic impact specifically in preventing tumor metastasis, retinal degeneration, and degradation of collagen in the ECM. Materials—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and pET28a expression vectors were products of Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Amicon Ultra-15 and Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (5000 molecular weight cutoff) were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Q-Sepharose FF, SP-Sepharose, and His-Trap HP columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Novex® 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Invitrogen. Kanamycin and TPCK-trypsin were obtained from Sigma. Human thrombin was prepared as described previously (26Kisiel W. Smith K.J. McMullen B.A. Blood. 1985; 66: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Expression and Purification of KD1—The first Kunitz-type domain of human TFPI-2 (KD1) was overexpressed as an amino-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS using the T7 promoter system. The recombinant plasmid derived from pET28a, containing a His6 leader sequence followed by a thrombin cleavage site and the cDNA encoding the first Kunitz-domain of TFPI-2, was prepared according to standard procedures. The recombinant construct was examined for in-frame orientation and integrity by nucleic acid sequencing. The His6-tagged KD1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli grown in rich media containing 10 mg/liter kanamycin and induced at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside at mid-log-phase (A600 = 0.4-0.7). The induced cells were harvested and lysed using a lysozyme-nucleotidase mix (0.2% lysozyme, 20 μg/ml DNase I, and 20 μg/ml RNase A in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was carried out at room temperature for 2 h, and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min). The cell pellet was then resuspended in a detergent solution (3% Igepal® CA-630 in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA) and sonicated at 50% power, and inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min). The inclusion bodies were then washed twice with water following brief sonication and centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min). The highly enriched inclusion bodies were then solubilized overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was centrifuged at 47,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was filtered (0.2 μ filters), and the filtrate was subsequently loaded onto a nickel-charged His-Trap column. The column was washed with equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 6 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), followed by equilibration buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged KD1 fusion protein was eluted from the column in equilibration buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The His-Trap purified protein was reduced by the addition of 50 mm dithiothreitol. This solution was incubated overnight with rocker shaking at 4 °C, diluted to a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 6 m urea and 0.02% azide, and dialyzed against 20 volumes of the same buffer at 4 °C. The refolding was then initiated by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 2 m urea, 2.5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 0.02% azide (buffer A) essentially as described by Stone et al.

The dialysis was performed for 48 h at 4 °C, and the solution was subsequently dialyzed against fresh buffer A for another 48 h at 4 °C. The solution was then dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The refolded protein solution was then filtered (0.2 μ filters) and applied to a Q-Sepharose FF column equilibrated at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The protein was eluted from the column using a linear 0-1 m NaCl gradient, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing pure His6-tagged KD1 were pooled and digested with human thrombin at a 1:1000 enzyme/substrate molar ratio for 2 h at 37 °C. Complete digestion of KD1 by thrombin was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of temporal aliquots. Thrombin-treated KD1 preparations were then applied to a His-Trap column to remove the His6 peptides followed by SP-Sepharose chromatography equilibrated with 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) buffer to remove traces of thrombin. The pure, His6 tag-free KD1 preparations were then dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), concentrated to >10 mg/ml in Amicon Ultra-15 (5000 molecular weight cutoff) filters, and stored at -80 °C. Each batch preparation was characterized with respect to protein concentration (A280), purity (SDS-PAGE analysis), and inhibition kinetics as previously described (17Chand H.S. Schmidt A.E. Bajaj S.P. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17500-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Crystallography—For crystallographic purposes, the His6 tag-free preparations of KD1 were found to be essential to achieve high concentrations of KD1 without precipitation. Bovine trypsin (TPCK-treated) was dissolved in 1 mm HCl. For crystallization of the KD1·trypsin complex, the solution was set up at 27 mg/ml in a 1:1.1 molar ratio using sitting drops (equal volume of protein and mother liquor) subjected to vapor diffusion at 37 °C against a reservoir containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) with 40% (NH4)2SO4. Crystals were routinely obtained in 2 days. The crystals were soaked in 33% glycerol and flash frozen. X-ray Data Collection—The data set was collected at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA) using beam line 8.2.2 and an ADSC Q315 detector. One crystal diffracted to a resolution of 1.8 Å and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121with two molecules of the KD1·trypsin complex in the asymmetric unit. The data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

The starting phases for refinement were obtained by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (30Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The starting search model for KD1·trypsin was derived from the coordinates of the APPI·trypsin complex (Protein Data Bank code 1TAW, Ref. 32Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rotation and translation search gave two trypsin·KD1 complexes per asymmetric unit. The model was rebuilt using the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. Five percent of the data were kept out of refinement for cross-validation (33Kleywegt G.J. Brunger A.T. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Subsequently, solvent molecules were added to the model. The final refinement statistics are given in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited into the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank with accession code 1ZR0. Molecular Modeling—Three-dimensional structural information on complexes formed between KD1 and plasmin and between KD1 and FVIIa was obtained using molecular modeling strategies. The crystallographically determined structures of KD1 (this report), FVIIa/TF inhibited with a BPTI mutant (Ref. 34Zhang E. St. Charles R. Tulinsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2089-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1FAK), FVIIa/TF (Ref. 35Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1DAN), and plasmin (Ref. 36Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Protein Data Bank code 1BML) served as templates in building these models. The relative positions of the inhibitor and proteinase domains were maintained, and minor adjustments were only made in the side chains. Hydrophobic/van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and ionic interactions were observed between each proteinase·inhibitor complex. All of these interactions were taken into consideration in evaluating each inhibitor·proteinase complex, and it was assumed that all potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors would participate in these interactions. Bulk solvent was excluded from the proteinase· inhibitor complex, and, accordingly, it was anticipated that hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions that may play an important role in specificity could be accurately evaluated. The protocols for modeling these complexes have been described previously (37Bajaj M.S. Birktoft J.J. Steer S.A. Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). KD1·Trypsin Crystallization and Structure Determination— His6-tagged KD1 was cloned and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The fusion protein was refolded/renatured in the presence of redox exchange buffer, the His6 tag was removed by thrombin proteolysis, and the His6 tag-free KD1 was purified to homogeneity. The KD1 fragment was then incubated in a 1.1:1 molar ratio with bovine trypsin containing ∼1 mm Ca2+, and crystals were obtained at 37 °C in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 40% ammonium sulfate after 2-3 days. The crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å and were found to belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 74.107, b = 77.013, and c = 125.424. There were two KD1·trypsin complexes in the asymmetric unit. An initial structure was obtained by molecular replacement using the structure of APPI·trypsin (Protein Data Bank code 1TAW, Ref. 32Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) as a search model and refined using CCP4/REFMAC to a final Rwork of 23.0 and Rfree of 29.5 (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics and geometry of the final structure are summarized in Table I. KD1·Trypsin Interactions Involving the S1 Site and Gln-192 in Trypsin—The two trypsin molecules in the asymmetric unit are in close proximity with each other and interact via the 162-helix of one molecule and the carboxyl-terminal helix of the other through water molecules. Notably, one KD1·trypsin complex was very well ordered as compared with the other, which had some areas of increased disorder with high B-factors, particularly within the trypsin molecule loop regions. This increased flexibility within the second KD1·trypsin complex is attributable, in part, to the large solvent channel located next to it and its lack of contact with neighboring complexes in the crystal packing. Thus, all figures and results discussed in this study are based upon the more ordered and well-defined KD1·trypsin complex. The overall fold of the KD1·trypsin structure is similar to those of BPTI·trypsin (38Helland R. Otlewski J. Sundheim O. Dadlez M. Smalas A.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 923-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Grzesiak A. Helland R. Smalas A.O. Krowarsch D. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and APPI·trypsin (32Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig. 1A. As is the case with all Kunitz-type inhibitors, the segment formed by residues 10-20 primarily mediates the protease inhibitory activity of KD1. This segment forms a hairpin-like structure, which is located outside the segment formed by residues 34-39 in KD1. A disulfide bridge (Cys-14-Cys-38) joins these two segments together along with several H-bonds forming a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The P1 residue, Arg-15 of KD1, makes the primary contact with the S1 residue, Asp-189 of trypsin. The side chain NH1 and NH2 of Arg-15 in KD1 make H-bonds with the hydroxyl of Ser-190 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-219 in trypsin, as has been observed previously for the APPI·trypsin complex (32Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As noted in previous structures of BPTI·protease complexes, H-bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-13 in KD1 and nitrogen of Gly-216 in trypsin and between the backbone nitrogen of Arg-15 in KD1 and carbonyl oxygen of Ser-214 in trypsin were also observed (Fig. 1B). The negative charge that develops during complex formation at the carbonyl oxygen of Arg-15 in KD1 is stabilized by H-bonds involving the backbone nitrogens of Gly-193 and Ser-195 (Fig. 1B). In the KD1·trypsin complex, trypsin Gln-192 is well ordered in the structure. The side chain nitrogen of Gln-192 in trypsin forms an H-bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Cys-14 in KD1 as well as with a water molecule. This water molecule makes three additional H-bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement involving Nϵ of Arg-15 and the carbonyl oxygen of Cys-14 in KD1 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-219 in trypsin. Moreover, the side chain oxygen of trypsin Gln-192 is linked via well-ordered water molecules to the carbonyl oxygens of Ala-16 and Leu-34 in KD1, as well as to the side chain nitrogen of Asn-143, the hydroxyl of Tyr-151, and the carbonyl oxygens of Cys-220 and Ser-146 in trypsin (Fig. 1C). Such interactions further stabilize the KD1·trypsin complex. Hydrophobic Interactions That Stabilize the KD1 Structure and Its Interaction with Trypsin—KD1 consists of a hydrophobic core, which is composed of Leu-9, Tyr-11, Tyr-21, Tyr-22, Phe-33, and Tyr-35 (Fig. 2A). These residues are part of the 10-20 segment as well as the two β-strands in KD1 (Fig. 1A), and they are defined by the high-resolution electron density map shown in Fig. 2B. The hydrophobic residues Leu-17, Leu-18, Leu-19, and Leu-34 in KD1 interact with a complementary hydrophobic patch in trypsin composed of Tyr-39, Phe-41, and Tyr-151. The details of these interactions are shown in Fig. 3 and appear to play a major role in the KD1·trypsin interaction.Fig. 3KD1·trypsin hydrophobic interactions. KD1 is shown as yellow ribbons, and trypsin is shown as magenta ribbons. Residues from KD1 are labeled in yellow, and those from trypsin are labeled in mage"
https://openalex.org/W1971165852,"Apoptotic cells redistribute phosphatidylserine (PS) to the cell surface by both Ca2+-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Binding of dimeric galectin-1 (dGal-1) to glycoconjugates on N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-activated neutrophils exposes PS and facilitates neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages, yet it does not initiate apoptosis. We asked whether dGal-1 initiated Ca2+ fluxes that are required to redistribute PS to the surface of activated neutrophils. Prolonged occupancy by dGal-1 was required to maximally mobilize PS to the surfaces of fMLP-activated neutrophils. Like fMLP, dGal-1 rapidly elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in Fluo-4-loaded neutrophils. An initial Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores was followed by movement of extracellular Ca2+ to the cytosolic compartment, with return to basal Ca2+ levels within 10 min. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ did not prevent PS mobilization. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ revealed that fMLP and dGal-1 independently release Ca2+ from intracellular stores that cooperate to induce optimal redistribution of PS. Ca2+ mobilization by ionomycin did not permit dGal-1 to mobilize PS, indicating that fMLP initiated both Ca2+-dependent and -independent signals that facilitated dGal-1-induced exposure of PS. dGal-1 elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and mobilized PS through a pathway that required action of Src kinases and phospholipase Cγ. These results demonstrate that transient Ca2+ fluxes contribute to a sustained redistribution of PS on neutrophils activated with fMLP and dGal-1."

The aims of the present work were first to correlate receptor phosphorylation level to internalization and recycling, measured by flow cytometry and in some cases by confocal microscopy using a monoclonal antibody that did not interfere with ligand binding, and second to identify the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues. Combining receptor mutations and truncations allowed identification of Ser250 (in the second intracellular loop), Thr429, Ser435, Ser448 or Ser449, and Ser455 (all in the distal part of the C terminus) as candidates for VIP-stimulated phosphorylation. The effects of single mutations were not additive, suggesting alternative phosphorylation sites in mutated receptors. Replacement of all of the Ser/Thr residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail and truncation of the domain containing these residues completely inhibited VIP-stimulated phosphorylation and receptor internalization. There was, however, no direct correlation between receptor phosphorylation and internalization; in some truncated and mutated receptors, a 70% reduction in phosphorylation had little effect on internalization. In contrast to results obtained on the wild type and all of the mutated or truncated receptors that still underwent phosphorylation, internalization of the severely truncated receptor was reversed within 2 h of incubation in the absence of the agonist.

These are members of a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), designated as Class II or B. This class also includes, among others, receptors for peptides of at least 20 amino acid residues like secretin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptides, growth hormone-releasing peptide, parathormone, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (1Harmar A.J.

VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors are preferentially coupled to the Gαs protein (1Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M. Pisegna J.R. Rawlings S.R. Robberecht P. Said S.I. Sreedharan S.P.

As with most, if not all, of the GPCRs, both VIP receptors are desensitized, sequestered, and down-regulated after exposure to agonist (3Robberecht P. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Tastenoy M.

This was observed in cells expressing native receptors as well as in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and HEK 293 cells. It was recently demonstrated that VPAC1 receptor phosphorylation and desensitization was enhanced by co-transfection with the G protein receptor kinases, GRK2, -3, -5, and -6 (5Shetzline M.A. Walker J.K.

Although the overexpression of arrestin or of a dominant negative mutant did not modify receptor internalization, the inhibitory effect of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin suggested the following sequence of events for receptor regulation: agonist stimulation, G protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation, β-arrestin translocation, and dynamin-dependant receptor internalization (5Shetzline M.A. Walker J.K.

In the present work, we detailed the contribution of the carboxyl-terminal intracellular tail to receptor internalization by studying truncated and mutated human VPAC1 receptors expressed in CHO cells. We developed a monoclonal antibody against the amino-terminal extracellular part of that receptor that permitted the quantification, by flow cytometry, of the receptors expressed at the cell membrane. Immunoprecipitation of the receptor after metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, allowed for phosphorylation quantification. We therefore evaluated the link between receptor phosphorylation and receptor internalization. We also evaluated the recycling of the receptors to the membrane. We found that VIP induced in the wild type (WT) receptor a rapid phosphorylation and internalization, which was not reversible within 2 h. Mutation into Ala or truncation of all of the Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal tail and mutation of one Ser in the second intracellular loop abolished receptor phosphorylation and internalization. A larger truncation of a domain located between the seven transmembrane helix and the Ser/Thr-containing region led to a receptor that was no longer phosphorylated but remained internalized. However, receptors were re-expressed at the membrane within 120 min. Single and combined mutations of the Ser/Thr residues indicated the possibility of alternative phosphorylation sites in mutant receptors and also indicated that phosphorylation of all of the identified sites was not necessary for receptor internalization. The cell line expressing the VPAC1 receptor has been detailed in a previous publication (6Langer I. Perret J. Vertongen P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Generation of the truncated receptors was achieved by introduction of a stop codon using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions as described (2Langer I. Vertongen P. Perret J. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The expected mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing on an ABI automated sequencing apparatus, using the BigDye Terminator Sequencing Prism Kit from ABI (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The complete nucleotide sequence of each construction was verified by DNA sequencing. 20 μg of the receptor-coding region were transfected by electroporation in the CHO cell line expressing aequorin and Gα16 (kindly provided by Vincent Dupriez, Euroscreen SA, Belgium) as described (2Langer I. Vertongen P. Perret J. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Selection was carried out in culture medium (50% Ham/F-12, 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin (10 milliunits/ml), 1% streptomycin (10 μg/ml), 1% l-glutamine (200 mm)), supplemented with 600 μg of Geneticin (G418)/ml of culture medium. After 10-15 days of selection, isolated colonies were transferred to 24-well plates and grown until confluence, trypsinized, and further expanded in 6-well plates, from which cells were scraped and membranes were prepared for identification of receptor-expressing clones by an adenylate cyclase activity assay in the presence of 1 μm VIP. The selected clones were expanded in the same medium as that used for the selection but in the absence of Geneticin. Membranes were prepared from scraped cells lysed in 1 mm NaHCO3 by immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the lysate was first centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 400 × g, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mm NaHCO3 and used immediately. Binding studies, using 125I-labeled VIP, were performed for 30 min at 23 °C in a total volume of 120 μl containing 20 mm Tris-maleate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4), and 3-30 μg of protein/assay. The assays were performed in such conditions that specific binding was strictly proportional to the amount of protein. Bound and free radioactivities were separated by filtration through glass fiber GF/C filters presoaked for 24 h in 0.01% polyethyleneimine. The filters were rinsed three times with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Binding site density was evaluated as follows: density = bound/free × IC50/mg of protein. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined by the Salomon (7Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar) procedure as previously described (8Juarranz M.G. Van Rampelbergh J. Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (3-15 μg) were incubated in a total volume of 60 μl containing 0.5 mm [α-32P]ATP, 10 μm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm cAMP, 1 mm theophylline, 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 30 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 mm Tris-HCl at a final pH of 7.8. The reaction was initiated by membrane addition and was terminated after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C by adding 0.5 ml of a 0.5% SDS solution containing 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm cAMP, and 20,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP. cAMP was separated from ATP by two successive chromatographies on Dowex 50Wx8 and neutral alumina. All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methodology using the Fmoc (9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl) strategy with an automated Symphony apparatus. The peptides were cleaved, precipitated with 10 volumes of cold ether, and purified on reverse phase and ion exchange chromatographies. The peptide purity (>95%) was assessed by capillary electrophoresis, and peptide conformity was assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The peptide mentioned as the VPAC1 antagonist was Ac-His1 [d-Phe2,Lys15,Arg16,Leu27]VIP-(3-7)/GRF-(8-27). Genetic Immunization and Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies—Genetic immunization and generation of monoclonal antibodies were performed according to Costagliola et al. (9Costagliola S. Rodien P. Many M.C. Ludgate M. Vassart G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1458-1465PubMed Google Scholar). The protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation. Six-week-old Balb/c female mice were anesthetized by injections of 6-10 mg/kg Ketamin HCl® associated with 0.1 ml/kg Rompum®. The anterior tibialis muscle of each leg was injected at day 0 with 100 μl of 10 mm cardiotoxin (Latoxan, Rosans, France). Five days later, 50 μg of the plasmid construct was injected in the same region in a final volume of 100 μl of 0.09% NaCl. Injections were repeated 3 and 6 weeks thereafter. Blood samples were obtained from retro-ocular puncture 7 weeks after the initial immunization, and serum was tested for the presence of antibodies against the VPAC1 receptor. The mouse selected (by FACS and Western blotting) for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, was boosted by an IV injection of 100 μl of a saline solution containing 106 CHO cells expressing the human VPAC1 receptor. Three days later, splenocytes were fused with SP2O, a nonsecreting myeloma cell line, at a 3:1 ratio in the presence of polyethylene glycol. Fused cells were then delivered into 10 96-well plates and selected by 100 μm hypoxanthine, 400 μm aminopterine, and 16 μm thymidine. Irradiated macrophages from mouse peritoneum were added to the well for supply of cytokines and growth factors. After 10 days, culture supernatants were screened by FACS (see below), and the cells producing antibodies were cloned by dilution. The monoclonal antibody selected (mAb-VPAC1) was purified using ImmunoPure IgG purification kit (Pierce) and was of the IgG 2a subtype, based on the mouse mAb isotyping kit (Isotrip; Roche Applied Science). Properties of the Selected Antibody—CHO cells expressing the recombinant human VPAC1 receptor were detached from the plates using a 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, harvested by centrifugation (500 × g, 4 °C, 4 min), washed once with PBS solution, and resuspended to 3 × 105 cells/tube in 100 μl of PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, containing 0.1 μg of purified mAb VPAC1. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed in the same buffer and centrifuged in the same conditions. They were then incubated for 30 min, on ice in the dark, with secondary antibody, an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated γ-chain-specific goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The cells were again washed and resuspended in 250 μl of PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The level of fluorescence was analyzed using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences), and the data were processed using Cell Quest software. Basal fluorescence was determined from a sample of nontransfected CHO cells. The use of propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) allowed exclusion of debris and dead cells from the analysis. The same procedure was used to evaluate the selectivity of the antibody; the level of fluorescence observed with CHO cells expressing the human VPAC2 and the rat VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors was not different from that of cells that did not express the human VPAC1 receptor. Chimeric receptors made of different parts of the human VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors and expressed in CHO cells (8Juarranz M.G. Van Rampelbergh J. Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were only detected when the amino-terminal domain of the VPAC1 receptor was conserved (Fig. 1). Furthermore, preincubation of membranes prepared from cells expressing the human VPAC1 receptor with the monoclonal antibody at increasing concentrations did not modify the binding of 125I-labeled VIP or the VIP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Receptor internalization was defined as the percentage of cell surface receptors that were no longer accessible to the monoclonal antibody after agonist exposure. Cells expressing the VPAC1 receptor were incubated with agonist at 37 °C and, after washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, were processed for FACS analysis as described above. Details on specific protocols for evaluation of receptor recovery are given in the figure legends. Confocal microscopy was also used to confirm receptor sequestration. Cells were cultured on 22-mm glass slides for 72 h. After a 30-min VIP treatment, cells were washed in PBS and fixed with -20 °C absolute methanol for 10 min. Nonspecific protein binding was prevented by a 15-min incubation with 5% normal sheep serum. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the monoclonal anti-VPAC1 antibody (1:250). The primary antibody was diluted in PBS, 1% normal sheep serum, 1‰ azide. The optimal working dilution had been previously determined empirically by serial dilutions for the antibody used. After three washes and a second 15-min incubation at room temperature with normal sheep serum, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated γ-chain-specific goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:100) and diluted in the same solution as the primary antibody. Omission of the primary or secondary antibody resulted in the absence of labeling. Cells were finally incubated for 5 min at room temperature with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After three rinses in PBS, coverslips were mounted with “Slow Fade Light” anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) in 50% glycerol (or the Calbiochem mounting medium) before viewing under an LSM510 NLO confocal microscope fitted on an Axiovert M200 inverted microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat ×63/1.2 numeric aperture water immersion objective (Zeiss). A ×2 electronic zoom was used across regions of interest. The 488-nm excitation wavelength of the Argon/2 laser, a main dichroic HFT 488, and a band pass emission filter (BP500-550 nm) were used for selective detection of the green (fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate) fluorochrome. The nuclear stain Hoechst was excited in multiphotonic mode at 760 nm with a Mai Tai tunable broad band laser (Spectra-Physics, Darmstadt, Germany) and detected using a main dichroic HFT KP650 and a band pass emission filter (BP435-485 nm). Optical sections, 2.5 μm thick, were collected for each fluorochrome sequentially. The images generated (512 × 512 pixels, pixel size 0.14 μm) were merged and displayed with the Zeiss LSM510 software and exported in jpg image format. All figures show a single optical section across the regions of interest. Scale bars represent 10 μm. Cells were first cultured in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mCi/ml acid-free [32P]orthophosphate. At the end of this labeling period, agonist was added for 5 min. Phosphorylation inhibitors were added 30 min prior to agonist addition. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 11.7 mm glucose, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 118 mm NaCl, and 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and then lysed in 1.2 ml of a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% dodecylmaltoside (Roche Applied Science) and solubilized for 45 min at 4 °C. The remaining insoluble material was eliminated by a further centrifugation. The supernatant (200 μl) was added to 50 μl of a 10% protein A-Sepharose suspension coated during 2 h with 2 μg of purified mAb VPAC1. After a 150-min incubation under rotating agitation at 4 °C, the Sepharose beads were separated by centrifugation and washed successively with the concentrated lysis buffer and then with a 2-fold diluted buffer and finally with water. The final bead pellet was resuspended in a buffer consisting of 125 mm Tris, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. After heating at 60 °C for 10 min, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. The gel was fixed and dried, and the phosphorylated bands were detected and quantified by phosphorimaging (Vilber Lourmat, Kaiser). The contribution of GRK to agonist-dependent phosphorylation was assessed in in vitro assays. CHO cells expressing the VPAC1 or the CCR5 receptor (kindly provided by Dr. C. Blanpain, IRIBHN, Brussels) were grown as previously described and resuspended in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA added to a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Fifty μl of membrane (2 μg/μl of protein) were incubated with 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of the tested agents. The final volume was 100 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of ATP and stopped by a 30-s centrifugation at 13,000 × g, removal of the supernatant, and solubilization of the membranes with 250 μl of a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete), and 1% dodecylmaltoside, pH 7.5. Human VPAC1 solubilized receptor was then immunoprecipitated as previously described, and protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. CCR5-solubilized receptor was immunoprecipitated in 80 μl of a 50% protein G-Sepharose suspension and 3 μg of purified monoclonal anti-human CCR5 antibody (2D7; PharMingen). After five successive washes, the sample was resuspended in the buffer, heated at 50 °C for 20 min, and processed as for the VPAC1 receptor. Receptor density was evaluated in all cases by binding studies using 125I-labeled VIP as ligand as previously described (10Busto R. Juarranz M.G. De Maria S. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and confirmed in some cases by Western blotting. Because Western blotting could not be performed with the monoclonal antibody used for the FACS and immunoprecipitation studies, we used a polyclonal antibody generated by Prof. Schulz (Otto-von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany) directed against the 438-457 sequence of the carboxyl terminus of the receptor (11Schulz S. Rocken C. Mawrin C. Weise W. Hollt V. Schulz S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8235-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This antibody does not recognize any of the truncated receptors under study (data not shown), but Western blots performed on WT and selected mutated receptors validated binding data (see “Results”). Membranes were prepared as described above. The protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with 1 μg/ml primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. We used as secondary antibody anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Proteins were visualized using SuperSignal® West Pico reagent chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce and Perbio Science). Agonist-induced VPAC1 Receptor Phosphorylation and Internalization—VIP induced a rapid, dose-dependent stimulation of 32P incorporation into a protein with an apparent molecular size of 75 kDa that immunoprecipitated with the mAb-VPAC1 (Fig. 2). No signal was observed in nontransfected cells. Receptor phosphorylation was agonist-dependent. Forskolin, phorbol esters, and the selective VPAC1 antagonist were inactive per se; forskolin and phorbol esters did not modify VIP-induced phosphorylation. VIP-stimulated phosphorylation was not affected by 100 nm H-89, 6 μm staurosporine, 300 nm K252a, and 100 μm genistein but was inhibited by 30 μm H-89, 100 μm A3, and 200-500 μm CKI-7 (Fig. 3). The possible contribution of the G protein receptor kinases to receptor phosphorylation was evaluated on membranes incubated in the presence of radioactive ATP and 1 μm VIP with 0.1 mm Zn2+ and 1 μg/ml heparin as inhibitors (12Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

A positive control consisted in CHO cell membranes expressing the chemokine receptor CCR5 stimulated by RANTES (15Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). VPAC1 receptor internalization was estimated by flow cytometry by the decrease in fluorescence associated with the binding of the mAb-VPAC1. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 4. Exposure to VIP induced a rapid and sustained decrease in the receptor number expressed at the cell surface that was completely blocked by preincubation in the presence of 0.5 m sucrose, suggesting that the receptor was internalized in endosomes. The selective VPAC1 receptor antagonist was inefficient. Results observed at 5 and 30 min were presented in Fig. 4. Seventy-five percent of the receptors disappeared within 30 min. Receptor internalization was further visualized by confocal microscopy; as shown in Fig. 5 (left panels), fluorescence signal was detected in unstimulated cells exclusively at CHO cell membranes, whereas the fluorescence was scattered in the cytosol after a 30-min stimulation with 1 μm VIP. As negative control (right panel), we used the poly(A) mutant that was considered as noninternalized by the FACS technique (see below) and remained indeed at the cell membrane by confocal inspection (Fig. 5). The reversibility was tested after 30-min exposure to agonist; after three washes, cells were incubated for 20-120 min, and the receptors accessible to the antibody were again evaluated. There was no reappearance of the receptors (Fig. 6). We used as positive control the VPAC2 receptor expressed in the same CHO cell line, which was similarly internalized but was re-expressed to the membrane within 120 min (Fig. 6); the results of the VPAC2 receptor were detailed in Ref. 16Langlet C. Gaspard N. Nachtergael I. Robberecht P. Langer I. Peptides. 2004; 25: 2079-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Properties of Carboxyl-terminally Truncated Receptors—The truncated receptors studied were schematized in Fig. 7 and listed in Table I. They were all stably expressed in CHO cells. For each construction, at least four clones were generated and studied. To compare the different constructions, we detailed clones that expressed (when possible) a similar receptor density. The binding receptor properties and the capability of VIP to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity were detailed elsewhere for some of the truncated receptors (17Vertongen P. Langlet C. Langer I. Gaspard N. Robberecht P. Peptides. 2004; 25: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Table I. The IC50 values of binding, the EC50 values, and the maximal stimulatory effect of VIP on adenylate cyclase were comparable for all of the truncated receptors. We already reported that two receptors had an elevated basal adenylate cyclase activity that was decreased by the selective VPAC1 receptor antagonist (17Vertongen P. Langlet C. Langer I. Gaspard N. Robberecht P. Peptides. 2004; 25: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), suggesting a constitutive activity but one that did not modify VIP stimulation.Table ISummary of binding, adenylate cyclase activation, phosphorylation, and internalization studies performed on wild type and truncated VPAC1 receptorsReceptorsBinding pIC50cAMP pEC50cAMP EmaxPhosphorylation (percentage of WT)Internalization5 min30 minfold stimulation%%%VPAC1 WT8.8 ± 0.028.6 ± 0.083.3 ± 0.310066 ± 577 ± 4VPAC1 1-4448.8 ± 0.038.4 ± 0.033.9 ± 0.462 ± 3ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.82 ± 288 ± 8VPAC1 1-4418.5 ± 0.058.6 ± 0.063.1 ± 0.367 ± 7ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.85 ± 490 ± 6VPAC1 1-4368.8 ± 0.048.6 ± 0.022.7 ± 0.270 ± 8ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.73 ± 386 ± 7VPAC1 1-4338.3 ± 0.038.7 ± 0.043.1 ± 0.330 ± 4ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.77 ± 983 ± 2VPAC1 1-4298.6 ± 0.058.5 ± 0.042.8 ± 0.232 ± 5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.37 ± 6ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.58 ± 5ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.VPAC1 1-4218.8 ± 0.078.3 ± 0.053.6 ± 0.410 ± 2ap < 0.05 evaluated by Mann-Whitney test as compared with wild type receptor value.14 ± 4ap < 0"

In the centuries preceding this intellectual sea change, the Arab world played a pivotal historical role. Its own scholars studied nature and pushed the bounds of knowledge, while its scribes preserved the discoveries and insights of earlier thinkers whose works did not fit well with the prevalent Christian dogma of a world unfolding according to a divinely predetermined plan. In recent times, however, Arab and Muslim societies have turned away from science, precluding these societies from enjoying its many benefits. Wasim Maziak argues that all of us now should have a vested interest in advancing science and technology in the Arab and Muslim world. Not only can science and technology help to feed people, improve their health, and create wealth, but they can help reduce societal tensions and build international bridges for badly needed dialogue and mutual understanding. To usher science and technology more thoroughly into Arab culture and society, however, Maziak suggests that the West needs to acknowledge the Arab world's historical contributions, and he advises the Arab world to stop dwelling on its golden past by embracing lessons about science and technology that the West learned long ago.

In this study we have used photoaffinity labeling to identify proximity sites between CT and its receptor. Two analogues of the antagonist sCT(8-32) containing a single photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) residue in position 8 or 19 were used. Both analogues retained high affinity for the CT receptor and potently inhibited agonist-induced cAMP production. The [Bpa19]sCT(8-32) analogue cross-linked to the receptor at or near the equivalent cross-linking site of the full-length peptide, within the fragment Cys134-Lys141 (within the amino terminus of the receptor, adjacent to transmembrane 1) (Pham, V., Wade, J. D., Purdue, B. W., and Sexton, P. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 6720-6729). In contrast, proteolytic mapping and mutational analysis identified Met49 as the cross-linking site for [Bpa8]sCT(8-32). This site differed from the previously identified cross-linking site of the agonist [Bpa8]human CT (Dong, M., Pinon, D. I., Cox, R. F., and Miller, L. J. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 31177-31182) and may provide evidence for conformational differences between interaction with active and inactive state receptors. Molecular modeling suggests that the difference in cross-linking between the two Bpa8 analogues can be accounted for by a relatively small change in peptide orientation. The model was also consistent with cooperative interaction between the receptor amino terminus and the receptor core.

Calcitonin receptors (CTRs) belong to the class II subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, which also includes receptors for other peptides such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, growth hormone-releasing hormone, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and corticotropin-releasing factor. These peptide hormone class II G protein-coupled receptors share 30-50% amino acid identity as well as a number of conserved structural motifs and are thought to interact with their ligands in a similar manner (16.Gether U.

Rudolph S.M. Flannery M.R. Morton C.C. Weremowicz S. Wang T.Z. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2680-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Of these, the hCTRa is the major human receptor isoform and is expressed in essentially all tissues known to express the CTR. CTs from different species can be subdivided into three major classes: human/rodent, artiodactyl, and teleost/avian. Of these, the members of the teleost/avian group are generally the most potent, although relative potency varies in a species- and isoform-specific manner (19.Gorn A.H. Lin H.Y. Yamin M. Auron P.E.

The higher potency combined with a longer in vivo half-life has led to fish-like CTs, exemplified by salmon CT (sCT), being the principle form of CT used for the clinical treatment of bone disorders (32.Gonzalez D. Ghiringhelli G. Mautalen C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33.Zaidi M. Inzerillo A.M. Troen B. Moonga B. Abe E. Burckhardt P. Bilezikian J.P.

This can be due to the development of circulating antibodies against non-human CT (34.Singer F.R. Aldred J.P. Neer R.M. Krane S.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Bloch K.J. J. Clin.

Ejiri S. Ozawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40.Takahashi S. Goldring S. Katz M. Hilsenbeck S. Williams R. Roodman G.D. J. Clin.

The optimal use of CTs remains unresolved, a situation that stems in part from lack of understanding of the bimolecular interaction between CT and its receptor and how this leads to receptor activation. Like other class II receptor ligands, CT has a diffuse pharmacophore with residues throughout the peptide sequence contributing to binding affinity and/or agonist potency. Whereas it is clear that much of the binding energy for high affinity interaction of the peptide and its receptor derives from interaction of the peptide with the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor (42.Stroop S.D. Kuestner R.E. Serwold T.F. Chen L. Moore E.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 43.Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4752-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), detailed information on how receptor and ligand interact is scant. Photoaffinity labeling, which relies on the spatially restricted (within 3.1 Å) cross-linking of photolabile amino acids within peptide ligands and their receptors, presents a mechanism for establishing proximity between individual amino acids of a peptide ligand and small fragments (or even individual amino acids) of the receptor. This provides essential information about nature of the interaction. We have previously shown that position 19 of sCT is in close contact with the receptor region Cys134-Lys141 (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In human CT (hCT), amino acid 16, located one helical turn apart from residue 19, cross-linked to Phe137, consistent with orientation of the α-helix of agonist peptides with the membrane-proximal region of the receptor amino terminus (46.Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that hCT amino acid 26 interacts with Thr30 in the distal amino terminus (46.Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas hCT amino acid 8 interacts with Leu368 in the third extracellular loop (47.Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31177-31182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal truncation of the disulfide-bridged loop (amino acids 1-7) of sCT leads to the generation of potent antagonists (48.Feyen J.H. Cardinaux F. Gamse R. Bruns C. Azria M. Trechsel U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 49.Pozvek G. Hilton J.M. Quiza M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and allows for comparative analysis of the site of cross-linking of equivalent amino acids of agonist and antagonist peptides. In this study we have generated antagonist peptides substituted with the photolabile amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) at residue 8 ([Bpa8]sCT(8-32)) and 19 ([Bpa19]sCT(8-32)) and compared their interaction with the published sites of interaction for full-length agonist peptides. The data show that the [Bpa19]sCT(8-32) analogue cross-links to the equivalent domain of the receptor labeled by the full-length peptide. In contrast, [Bpa8]sCT(8-32) cross-linked to Met49 in the distal amino terminus, a region quite distinct from the site labeled by [Bpa8]hCT. Materials—125I-Na (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. sCT, sCT(8-32), hCT, and all amino acid derivatives were synthesized by Auspep (Parkville, Australia). CNBr, protein G-agarose beads, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and iodoacetamide were obtained from Sigma. Sequencing grade endoproteinases Lys-C and Asp-N, N-glycosidase F, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Endoglycosidase F was prepared as previously described (50.Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from ICN. Penicillin G/streptomycin was from Multicell Technologies (Warwick, RI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, HEPES, fungizone, Lipofectamine transfection reagent, and protein molecular mass markers were obtained from Invitrogen. Tissue culture disposables and plastic ware were purchased from Falcon (Bedford, MA). Synthesis of the sCT(8-32) Photoactive Analogues—The two sCT(8-32) antagonist analogues were synthesized with a Bpa moiety incorporated into either position 8 (designated as [Bpa8]sCT(8-32)) or position 19 (designated as [Bpa19]sCT(8-32)), where 8 is the most amino-terminal amino acid (Fig. 1). In addition, for each of the photoactive analogues, lysine residues at positions 11 and 18 in the native sCT sequence were replaced with arginines to render the ligand resistant to enzymatic cleavage by endoproteinase Lys-C; this substitution does not alter activity of the peptide (51.D'Santos C.S. Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Evans T. Martin T.J. Kemp B.E. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both photoactive peptide analogues were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis as described previously (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Analysis of the synthetic sCT analogues, [Bpa19]sCT(8-32) and [Bpa8]sCT(8-32), by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed the principal products with the expected molecular masses (Bpa8 = 2937.6 Da and Bpa19 = 2925 Da), and amino acid analysis further validated the authenticity of the analogues. The synthetic peptides were purified to homogeneity by analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in good overall yield. Iodination of Peptides—sCT, [Bpa8]sCT(8-32), and [Bpa19]sCT(8-32) were iodinated using chloramine-T method, as described previously, with specific activity of about 700 Ci/mmol (29.Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Sexton P.M. Mendelsohn F.A. Martin T.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the [Bpa8]sCT(8-32) peptide analogue was also radiolabeled using IODO-BEAD (Pierce) as a solid-phase oxidant of a chloramine-T analogue followed by reversed-phase HPLC (52.Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of the [Bpa8]sCT(8-32) peptide was solubilized in 100 μl of 40% acetonitrile followed by 100 μl of 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.0, and 10 μl of Na125I (1 mCi). This reaction mixture was exposed to IODO-BEAD for 15 s and subsequently diluted with 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before purification by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column. Fractions containing the radioactive peaks (specific activity, ∼ 2000 Ci/mmol) from the HPLC were collected and stored in 50-μl aliquots at -20 °C until use. Receptor Mutagenesis—The WT HA-hCTRa (Leu447 polymorphic variant) was generated as described previously (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CTR mutants M48I, M59L, and M376L were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), using the WT HA-hCTRa as template. All other receptor mutants were generated as previously described (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primer pairs (sense and antisense) were synthesized by GeneWorks (Hindmarsh, Australia). Selected clones were chosen for plasmid isolation (Qiagen), and the fidelity of mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Parkville, Australia). Once the authenticity of mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing, large-scale plasmid preparations were purified using a Qiagen kit (Qiagen). Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Monkey kidney epithelium (COS-7 and COS-1) or human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells stably expressing the hCTRa were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with either 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum or fetal clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 16 mm HEPES, and 50 μg/ml fungizone at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. For radioligand receptor binding assay, COS-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. For cAMP assay and cross-linking studies, COS-7 cells were grown in 60-cm2 dishes and 140-cm2 dishes, respectively. Once the cell monolayers were at 95% confluence, cells were transfected in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM using 0.1, 3, or 7 μg of plasmid DNA for 24-well plates, 60-cm2 dishes, and 140-cm2 dishes, respectively, as instructed by the manufacturer. Before addition to cells, DNA was complexed with the transfection lipid reagent Lipofectamine at a ratio of 1 μl/0.1 μg DNA. Following transfection, cells were incubated for at least 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, and the culture medium was replaced with complete DMEM as described above. All transient transfections were performed with plasmids encoding either the WT HA-hCTRa or the required mutant constructs. Transfected cells were grown for at least 48 h before radioligand binding studies, cAMP assay, or photoaffinity labeling. Receptor Binding Assays—The binding of the radiolabeled analogues to HA-hCTRa was assessed in 24-well plates as previously described (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with ∼90 pm 125I-sCT, 125I-sCT(8-32), or [125I-Bpa]sCT(8-32) analogue in binding buffer (DMEM and 0.1% BSA) in the absence (total binding) or presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5 m NaOH. Nonspecific binding was determined in wells containing 1 μm unlabeled sCT(8-32), and maximal specific binding at each competing ligand concentration was calculated as a percentile of the total specific binding observed in the absence of competitor. The entire cell lysate was counted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-irradiation counter to determine the bound radioactivity. cAMP Assays—Intracellular cAMP assay was performed in 384-well plates using an Alpha Screen cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In brief, transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 60-cm2 dishes were harvested, counted, and resuspended in stimulation buffer (phenol red-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and preincubated at 37 °C for ∼20 min. Required concentrations of peptides and cAMP were prepared in stimulation buffer. To generate a cAMP standard curve, increasing concentrations of cAMP (10-11 to 10-6 m) were added to wells. To generate agonist dose-response curves, cells (10,000 cells/well) were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of agonists (10-13 to 10-8 m), either sCT or sCT analogues. To generate antagonist dose-response curves, cells (10,000 cells/well) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with increasing concentrations of hCT (10-12 to 10-5 m) in the presence of 0, 10-6, 10-7, or 10-8 m of the antagonist sCT(8-32) or its analogues. Following incubation, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, 0.3% Tween 20, and 0.1% BSA). Anti-cAMP acceptor beads (7.5 μg/ml), which were prepared in lysis buffer, were added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The detection mix of biotinylated cAMP (5 mm)/streptavidin donor beads (10 μg/ml) in lysis buffer, which was preincubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, was then added to all wells. The assay plate was incubated overnight at room temperature before reading on a Fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each experiment, forskolin and cAMP dose-response curves were performed in parallel to allow translation of the α-screen signal to either cAMP or a percentage of the maximum forskolin response. Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism 4.02. (San Diego, CA). In each assay, the quantity of cAMP generated was back-calculated from the raw data using a cAMP standard curve. For agonist responses, concentration-effect curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation (53.Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data using Linear and Nonlinear Regression: A Practical Guide to Curve Fitting. GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA2003Google Scholar). For calculation of antagonist potency, agonist concentration-response curves in the absence and presence of antagonist were globally fitted to the following equation using Prism (53.Motulsky H. Christopoulos A. Fitting Models to Biological Data using Linear and Nonlinear Regression: A Practical Guide to Curve Fitting. GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA2003Google Scholar): Response = Emin+(Emax−Emin)[A]nH[A]nH+(10−pEC50[1+([B]/10−pA2)s])nH(Eq. 1) where Emax represents the maximal asymptote of the concentration-response curves, Emin represents the lowest asymptote of the concentration-response curves, pEC50 represents the negative logarithm of the agonist EC50 in the absence of antagonist, [A] represents the concentration of the agonist, [B] represents the concentration of the antagonist, nH represents the Hill slope of the agonist curve, s represents the Schild slope for the antagonist, and pA2 represents the negative logarithm of the concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist EC50 by a factor of 2. Photoaffinity Labeling of Analogues to the Receptors and Mapping of the Binding Domain—The radiolabeled photoactive peptide [Bpa19]sCT(8-32) or [Bpa8]sCT(8-32) was cross-linked to hCTRs expressed in intact COS-7 cells followed by multiple enzymatic/chemical cleavage as previously described (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT or mutated receptor HA-hCTRa transiently transfected into COS-7 cells was incubated for 1 h in darkness with binding buffer (DMEM and 0.1% BSA) containing ∼900 pm 125I-Bpa-substituted sCT(8-32). Labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and immediately irradiated for 30 min with a 365-nm UV lamp on ice. Cells were collected in 0.1 m Tris and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, and subsequently subjected to immunoprecipitation according to the methodology of Sengstag et al. (54.Sengstag C. Stirling C. Schekman R. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The precipitated receptors were then subjected to enzymatic or chemical cleavage using methods described previously (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the [Bpa8]sCT(8-32) probe, a modified approach was also used because it yielded more complete digestion of the receptor. Briefly, plasma membranes from COS-1 cells transiently expressing WT or mutant receptor (M59L, M376L, or M48I) containing 50 μg of protein were incubated with 0.1 nm 125I-[Bpa8]sCT(8-32) in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (0.25 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.04 m NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, and 12 mm MgSO4)in the dark for 1 h. The reaction was immediately photolysed in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) at 4 °C for 30 min and then washed twice with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer. Photolabeled membranes were then subjected to reduction/alkylation (45.Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or solubilized in 1× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE followed by elution, lyophilization, ethanol/acetone precipitation, and endoglycosidase F/CNBr cleavage (55.Hadac E.M.

Polyacrylamide Electrophoresis and Autoradiography—Radioactive protein samples were warmed to 70 °C for 10 min and then analyzed using a combination of 10% SDS-glycine, 16.5% SDS-Tricine, or 10% NuPAGE bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Invitrogen), depending on the molecular weight of the protein of interest. Following electrophoresis, if necessary, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G,"

The Klebsiella pneumoniae LPS molecule shares significant similarity with the well characterized LPS structures from other members of the Enterobacteriaceae, like Escherichia coli and Salmonella (1Raetz C.R.H.

The inner core region, which is generally well conserved in the Enterobacteriaceae, contains 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (Hep), whereas the outer region shows more diversity. Conservation in the inner core may reflect its crucial role in the essential barrier function of the outer membrane (OM). There is a single core OS structure in K. pneumoniae and small variations between isolates in the addition of non-stoichiometric substituents (3Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Carbohydr.

The genes responsible for core OS biosynthesis in K. pneumoniae are encoded by the waa gene cluster, whose sequence has been reported (4Regué M. Climent N. Abitiu N. Coderch N. Merino S. Izquierdo L. Altarriba M. Tomás J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3564-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the K. pneumoniae core OS region has now been well characterized, with functions having been assigned to all but one of the genes encoded in the gene cluster; the exception is orf10 (4Regué M.

The only unassigned function is the addition of the non-stoichiometric β-galacturonic acid (GalUA) residues in the inner core (see Fig. 1), which potentially involves orf10 activity. One major feature distinguishing the K. pneumoniae core OS from those of E. coli and Salmonella is the absence of phosphoryl substitutions (Fig. 1). The negative charges provided by these phosphate residues in E. coli and Salmonella play a critical role in maintaining the barrier function of the OM by providing sites for cross-linking of adjacent LPS molecules with divalent cations or polyamines (reviewed in Refs. 1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar, 10Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 11Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar). In addition, the negative charges are important in mediating interactions between LPS and the positive charges on certain OM proteins (OMPs) (12Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Vandeputte-Rutten L. Kramer R.A. Kroon J. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Gros P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5033-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mutants with highly truncated core OS structures lacking the inner core Hep region display a pleiotrophic phenotype known as the deep-rough phenotype, characterized by changes in structure and composition of the OM (reviewed in Refs. 10Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar, 14Schnaitman C.A.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In E. coli and Salmonella, these mutants show a decrease in the amount of OMPs and a corresponding increase in phospholipids. The loss of OMPs is likely because of improper folding and assembly of OMPs in the absence of LPS negative charge (12Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K.

These mutants are also hypersensitive to hydrophobic compounds, because of the appearance of phospholipids in the outer leaflet of the OM that may facilitate rapid penetration of these compounds through the phospholipid bilayer regions of the membrane. Other characteristics of deep-rough mutants seen in E. coli include the release of periplasmic enzymes, the loss of cell surface organelles (e.g. pili and flagella), secretion of an inactive form of hemolysin, and increased susceptibility to polymorphonuclear leukocyte lysosomal fractions and phagocytosis by macrophages (reviewed in Refs. 1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar, 10Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nikaido H.

In addition, there is an up-regulation of colanic acid production because of induction of the RcsC/YojN/RcsB phosphorelay system (14Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RcsC/YojN/RcsB activating signal is unknown, but it is responsive to OM perturbations (24Gottesman S. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 253-262Google Scholar, 25Conter A. Sturny R. Gutierrez C. Cam K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Mouslim C. Groisman E.A. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50588-50595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One difficulty in relating some of the elements of the deep-rough phenotype to the LPS structure is the fact that the original findings were based on severely truncated LPS molecules with unknown genetic defects, rather than precise mutations. Precise mutations that eliminate core phosphorylation in E. coli and Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium yield strains that exhibit the major characteristics of the deep-rough phenotype with an increase in susceptibility to hydrophobic compounds, but there is no alteration in the profile of the major OMPs (28Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Yethon J.A. Gunn J.S. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Laroche L. Malo D. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4485-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The S. enterica sv. Typhimurium mutant also caused a complete attenuation of virulence in a mouse model (29Yethon J.A. Gunn J.S. Ernst R.K. Miller S.I. Laroche L. Malo D. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4485-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The only source of negative charge outside the lipid A domain of K. pneumoniae is contributed by the GalUA residues in the core OS region. This is also seen in the core OS regions of other environmental isolates, Rhizobium etli (30Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Rhizobium leguminosarum (30Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and Plesiomonas shigelloides O54 (31Niedziela T. Lukasiewicz J. Jachymek W. Dzieciatkowska M. Lugowski C. Kenne L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11653-11663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that having GalUA residues instead of phosphoryl substitutions may give these organisms an ecological advantage in habitats that are low in phosphate and low in the divalent cations involved in cross-linking adjacent LPS molecules, because carboxyl groups become more easily protonated, decreasing the repulsion between LPS molecules (11Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar). To determine the role that the carboxyl groups on GalUA residues play in OM stability and whether they fulfill the same functions as the negative charges provided by the phosphate residues in E. coli and Salmonella, a mutant was created that lacked all GalUA residues from the core OS (the GalUA in the inner core as well as the non-stoichiometric substitutions in the inner core). The transferase (WabG) involved in adding the GalUA onto HepII of the inner core has been identified (7Izquierdo L. Coderch N. Pique N. Bedini E. Corsaro M.M. Merino S. Fresno S. Tomas J.M. Regue M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 7213-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A wabG mutant showed enhanced sensitivity to hydrophobic compounds. However, this mutant may still possess some GalUA in its inner core, because the transferase(s) responsible for the addition of the non-stoichiometric substitutions onto the HepIII and β-Glc of the inner core is presently unknown. Therefore, to entirely eliminate GalUA from the K. pneumoniae core OS, UDP-GalUA precursor synthesis was targeted. UDP-GalUA is formed from UDP-GlcUA by the UDP-GalUA C4-epimerase (formerly uge but henceforth referred to as Gla) (32Regué M. Hita B. Pique N. Izquierdo L. Merino S. Fresno S. Benedi V.J. Tomas J.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Frirdich E. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4104-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A mutant in glaKP was constructed to ascertain the effect of this mutation on the OM stability of K. pneumoniae. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table I. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth (34Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 439Google Scholar). Growth media were supplemented with chloramphenicol (15 or 7.5 μg/ml), gentamicin (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), or streptomycin (200 μg/ml), as necessary. For mutant complementation, wild-type copies of glaKP were expressed using a pBAD-vector derivative, which is a family of expression vectors that use the arabinose-inducible and glucose-repressible araC promoter (35Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3940) Google Scholar). For induction, a culture was grown at 37 °C for 18 h in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics and 0.4% (w/v) glucose. This culture was diluted 1:100 into fresh medium without glucose and grown until the culture reached an A600 of 0.2. l-Arabinose, 0.02% (w/v), was then added and the culture was grown for another 2 h. Repressed controls were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium with 0.4% (w/v) glucose.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidGenotype, serotype, or descriptionRef. or sourceE. coliDH5αK12 ϕ80d deoR lacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17(rK-mK+) supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 F-79Sambrook J.

(36Hull R.A. Gill R.E. Hsu P. Minshew B.H. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1981; 33: 933-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen) in a modified protocol for bacteria (6Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PCR were performed in 0.05-ml volumes with either PwoI DNA polymerase (Roche) or Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), using conditions optimized for the primer pair. Oligonucleotide primer synthesis and automated DNA sequencing were performed at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada). All PCR products were sequenced to verify that they were error-free. Plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α, except for pRE112 derivatives, which were maintained in DH5α [λ pir]. For E. coli strains, transformation was carried out by electroporation and methods described elsewhere (37Binotto J. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson P.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1991; 37: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For some K. pneumoniae strains, a modification of this method was required (6Frirdich E. Vinogradov E. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27928-27940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Enderle P.J. Farwell M.A. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (958): 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Insertion Mutagenesis—The mutation glaKP (CWG630) was constructed by insertion of the pRE112 plasmid into the glaKP gene on the K. pneumoniae chromosome, using methods described previously (39Nesper J. Kraiss A. Schild S. Blass J. Klose K.E. Bockemuhl J. Reidl J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2419-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pRE112-derivative containing a glaKP internal fragment was transformed into E. coli SM10 [λ pir] and then transferred by conjugation to the recipient strain, K. pneumoniae CWK2. The plasmid pRE112 requires the pir gene product to replicate (40Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), so for the plasmid to be maintained in CWK2, it must be integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination within glaKP. CWK2 mutant derivatives in which pRE112 has been inserted into glaKP were selected by resistance to streptomycin (resistance carried by CWK2) and chloramphenicol (antibiotic marker on the plasmid). An internal fragment of glaKP was amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA using primers KPwbnF8 (5′-AACTTGAACAGCGCCATATC-3′) and KPwbnF9 (5′-GGCATAATGTTGTCGGAATC-3′) and the blunt ends of the 510-bp product were ligated to pRE112 digested with SmaI, giving pWQ68. The resulting glaKP mutant was designated K. pneumoniae CWG630. The colony morphology of the mutant was indistinguishable from the parent. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Analysis—For PAGE analysis, LPS was isolated on a small scale from proteinase K-digested whole cell lysates as described by Hitchcock and Brown (41Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS was then separated on 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gels from Invitrogen, and visualized by silver staining (42Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE of proteins, the protein samples were solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) by boiling at 100 °C for 15 min and then separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Determination of the Structure of Deacylated LPS—K. pneumoniae CWG630 (glaKP) and the complemented strain CWG630 (pWQ69; His6-Gla+KP) were grown in a fermenter (2× 10 liters) in LB for 21 h, harvested, and then lyophilized. For the CWG630 (glaKP) rough strain lacking O-PS (rough LPS), the LPS was isolated from the dried cells by the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum method (44Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). For the complemented strain producing smooth LPS, CWG630 (pWQ69; Gla+KP), the hot water phenol method of LPS extraction was used (45Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). LPS was deacylated by procedures described elsewhere (46Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 47Holst O. Holst O. Methods in Molecular Biology, Bacterial Toxins: Methods and Protocols. 145. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 345-353Google Scholar). Briefly for O-deacylation, the LPS (100 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (3 ml), incubated for 1 h at 40 °C, and then poured into cold acetone. The precipitated O-deacylated LPS was collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and then lyophilized. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were obtained using a Micromass Quattro spectrometer (GV Instruments Inc., Hudson, NH) in 50% MeCN with 0.2% HCOOH, at a flow rate of 15 μl/min with direct injection. OM Protein Preparations—For OM preparations, bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C. The culture was then diluted 1:100 in 100 ml of fresh medium and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 18 h. The cells were harvested and frozen until required. The cell pellet was thawed, resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and sonicated on ice (for a total of 2 min using 10-s bursts, followed by 10-s cooling periods). Unbroken cells and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 20,000 × g). The membrane fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g). The membrane fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2% Sarkosyl (sodium lauryl sarcosine) and incubated on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 30 min. The OM is resistant to Sarkosyl solubilization, whereas the inner membrane is not (48Filip C. Fletcher G. Wulff J.L. Earhart C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sarkosyl-insoluble OM was separated from the soluble inner membrane by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The OM fraction was washed again with 2% Sarkosyl, washed twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and then resuspended in 0.2 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The protein content of each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unlike E. coli, the inner and outer membranes of these K. pneumoniae strains could not be reliably separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation. The molecular basis for this is unclear, but it is not a unique situation (49Larsen B.S. Biedermann K. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Identification of individual OM proteins was performed at the Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of Guelph, by peptide mass fingerprinting and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. Data base searching was done using the ProFound search engine (prowl.rockefeller.edu). Sensitivity to Hydrophobic Compounds and Polymyxin B (PMB)— For SDS sensitivity, serial 2-fold dilutions of SDS (from 6.25 to 0.098 mg/ml) were made in 5 ml of LB. An 18-h culture of each strain was used to inoculate each 5-ml tube at a ratio of 1:100. After incubation for 8 h at 37 °C, a tube was rated positive for growth if the optical density at 600 nm was greater than 0.2. For sensitivity to novobiocin, vancomycin, and PMB, a plate assay was performed. An 18-h culture grown at 37 °C was added to an LB plate supplemented with antibiotics, where appropriate, and the excess was poured off. The plates were dried and 0.01 ml of serial 2-fold diluted novobiocin (from 51.2 to 0.2 mg/ml), vancomycin (from 40 to 0.0098 mg/ml), or PMB (from 780 to 0.095 μg/ml) were spotted onto the plates. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the highest dilution resulting in clearing. All assays were performed in triplicate. Spectrophotometric Assay for Detection of β-Lactamase Activity—To measure endogenous β-lactamase activity, bacteria were grown at 37 °C for 18 h in LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. The culture was then diluted 1:50 in 200 ml of fresh medium and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 4 h. 1 ml of cells were pelleted and the culture supernatant was retained and kept on ice. The remaining cells were harvested and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cold LB. The cells were lysed by sonication and the unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (15 min at 5000 × g). The cell lysate was diluted to 10 times the original culture volume, because of high levels of β-lactamase activity. 160 μl of supernatant and diluted cell lysate from each strain was aliquoted in triplicate into 96-well polystyrene microplates (Evergreen Scientific Inc., Los Angeles, CA). Reactions were started by the addition of 40 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml nitrocephin stock (0.1 mg/ml final concentration; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and the absorbance at 560 nm was measured every minute for 30 min using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies Inc., Offenburg, Germany). A sample of 160 μl of LB growth medium with 40 μl of nitrocephin was used to measure background absorbance. Each strain was assayed in triplicate in multiple experiments. GlaKP Is Required for GalUA Addition to the Core—To examine the role of glaKP in core OS biosynthesis, a gene disruption mutant K. pneumoniae (CWG630) was constructed. The lipid A-core fraction of the LPS of the glaKP mutant migrated significantly faster"

We observed that Tat induced OGG1 gene expression by enhancing its promoter activity without changing its mRNA stability. We found that the upstream AP-4 site within the OGG1 promoter is responsible and that Tat interacted with AP-4 and removed AP-4 from the OGG1 promoter by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Thus, Tat appears to activate OGG1 expression by sequestrating AP-4. Interestingly, although Tat induces oxidative stress known to generate 8-oxo-dG, which causes the G:C to T:A transversion, we observed that the amount of 8-oxo-dG was reduced by Tat. When OGG1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA, Tat increased the amount of 8-oxo-dG, thus confirming the role of OGG1 in preventing the formation of 8-oxo-dG. These findings collectively indicate the possibility that Tat may play a role in maintenance of the genetic integrity of the proviral and host cellular genomes by up-regulating OGG1 as a feed-forward mechanism.

Tat is an essential transactivator of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; 8-oxo-dG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine; ROS, radical oxygen species; siRNA, small interfering RNA; mTat, mutant Tat; PonA, ponasterone A; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ECD, electrochemical detector. gene expression and viral replication (1Jones K.A.

Tat stimulates viral gene expression by directly binding to the characteristic RNA stem-loop-bulge structure called the transactivation response region located within the long terminal repeat (2Berkhout B.

A. 1998; 95: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1, a regulatory subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor-b complex, binds to the activation domain of Tat and facilitates the hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at the vicinity of HIV genes. Thus, Tat makes RNA polymerase II highly competent for the transcription elongation and productive expression of HIV genes (10Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Although much of the efforts in Tat studies have focused on its transcriptional activation from the HIV provirus, the actions of Tat on cellular genes have also been revealed. For example, Tat is known to promote cellular transformation (11Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485PubMed Google Scholar), to induce oxidative stress (12Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P. Bose S.K. Nelson S.K. McCord J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These biological actions of Tat are considered to cause activation of nuclear factor-κB, AP-1 (activating protein-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (13Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 776-781PubMed Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to search for cellular target genes of Tat, either up-regulated or down-regulated, using a gene expression profile analysis. In addition to the very high efficiency of the viral replication rate that is mainly ascribable to Tat action, HIV owes its morbidity to its high mutation rate, leading to the emergence of drug resistance and escape from the host immune response. In fact, the high frequency of G:C to A:T and G:C to T:A mutations was previously observed in HIV-1 and other lentiviruses (18Li Y. Kappes J.C. Conway J.A. Price R.W. Shaw G.M. Hahn B.H. J.

Another type of mutation, G:C to T:A transversion, is mediated by the generation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) by radical oxygen species (ROS) and occurs at the DNA level (26Kasai H. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2137-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 27Kasai H. Mutat. Res. 1997; 387: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The oxidatively damaged guanosine, 8-oxo-dG, is widely accepted as a pre-mutagenic lesion because of its potential to mispair with adenine, thus generating the G:C to T:A transversion. This type of mutation is often found in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, such as p53 and K-ras, in mammalian cells (28Hatahet Z. Zhou M. Reha-Krantz L.J. Morrical S.W. Wallace S.S. Proc. Natl.

The OGG1 (8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase-1) enzyme is responsible for the excision/repair of this oxidatively damaged DNA by excising 8-oxo-dG (30Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 31Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In fact, OGG1 gene knockout actually shows accumulation of such a mutation (33Arai T. Kelly V.P. Komoro K. Minowa O. Noda T. Nishimura S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar, 34Minowa O. Arai T. Hirano M. Monden Y. Nakai S. Fukuda M. Itoh M. Takano H. Hippou Y. Aburatani H. Masumura K. Nohmi T.

In this study, we demonstrate the up-regulation of OGG1 by Tat and provide evidence that this effect of Tat is through the sequestration of the negative transcription factor AP-4 for the expression of OGG1. We examine the effect of Tat on the actual levels of 8-oxo-dG in the presence and absence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against OGG1 mRNA. Plasmids—The cDNA of wild-type Tat (101 amino acids) originating from HIV-1 was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide primer pair 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCG CCA CCA TGG ATT ACA AGG ATG ACG ACG ATA AGA TGG AGC CAG TAG ATC CTA GAC TAG AGC CCT GG-3′ (forward; containing an EcoRI site and a FLAG epitope) and 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG CTG ATG GAC CGG ATC TGT CTC-3′ (reverse; containing a BamHI site). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated in-frame into the pIND-V5 expression vector (Invitrogen), thus generating pIND-Tat. As a control, we employed mutant Tat (mTat) lacking transcriptional activity because of the absence of binding activity with cyclin T1 or the transactivation response region (6Kanazawa S. Okamoto T. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 2000; 12: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing mutant Tat (pIND-mTat) in which Cys30 and Lys41 were substituted with Ala was generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pairs: 5′-CTA TTG TAA AAA GGC CTG CTT TCA TTG CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC AAT GAA AGC AGG CCT TTT TAC AAT AG-3′ (reverse) or 5′-GTT TCA CAA CAG CCG CCT TAG GCA TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT GCC TAA GGC GGC TGT TGT GAA AC-3′ (reverse). To generate the mammalian expression plasmid for AP-4, AP-4 gene was amplified by PCR with the oligonucleotide primer pair 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCG CCA CCA TGG ATT ACA AGG ATG ACG ACG ATA AGA TGG AGC CAG TAG ATC CTA GAC TAG AGC CCT GG-3′ (forward; containing an EcoRI site) and 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG CTG ATG GAC CGG ATC TGT CTC-3′ (reverse; containing a BamHI site). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated in-frame into the pcDNA-Myc expression vector (Invitrogen). The construction of pCD12-luc, containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeats V3 and R linked to the luciferase gene, and pcDNA-Tat was described previously (35Okamoto H. Cujec T.P. Okamoto M. Peterlin B.M. Baba M. Okamoto T. Virology. 2000; 272: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Takada N. Sanda T. Okamoto H. Yang J.P. Asamitsu K. Sarol L. Kimura G. Uranishi H. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Human OGG1 promoter-luciferase fusion constructs, including pPR116, pPR128, pPR130, and pPR143, were kindly provided by Dr. J. P. Radicella (Radiobiologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS-CEA, Fontenay aux Roses, France) (37Dhénaut A. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The mutant pPR128-luc reporter constructs were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutant sequences (sense strand) utilized were as follows: 5′-AP-4 site mutant (m5′AP-4), GAC GGC AGG CAG tcg cga TGG CGG CCG GCG; 3′-AP-4 site mutant (m3′AP-4), GGG AAA GGC GAG tcg cga GCA GAG AGC CCA G; GA TA site mutant (mGATA), CTT GCA GCC Tct TAG TTA AGA TAC AGC; and AP-2 site mutant (mAP-2), CAG CTG TGG CGG CCa ttC GGG ACG ACA ATC (with consensus binding sites underlined and mutated sequences in lowercase letters). The construct containing mutations in both the 5′- and 3′-AP-4 sites (mwAP-4) was generated by two successive PCRs using the m5′AP-4 and m3′AP-4 mutant sequences. The control luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic vector was purchased from Promega. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using an ABI PRISM™ dye terminator cycle sequencing ready kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on an Applied Biosystems 313 Automated DNA Sequencer. Cell Lines That Inducibly Express Tat, mTat, and LacZ—HEK293-EcR cells, stably transfected with pVgRXR expressing the ecdysone receptor, were purchased from Invitrogen and transfected with pIND-Tat and pIND-mTat to establish Tat/293 and mTat/293 cells, respectively. The control cell line (LacZ/293) was a gift from Dr. L. Naumovski (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) (38Ao Y. Rohde L.H. Naumovski L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes is under the stringent control of a homolog of the insect hormone 20-OH-ecdysone, ponasterone A (PonA; Invitrogen). Cells containing these plasmids were selected by 500 μg/ml G418 and 450 μg/ml Zeocin. Cell clones were singly isolated by two successive rounds of limiting dilution of cells and were screened for the expression and transcriptional activity of Tat proteins. Cell Culture—Tat/293, mTat/293, and LacZ/293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Maebashi, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Jurkat T cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors, stimulated with phytohemagglutinin for 48 h, and further cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 20 units/ml interleukin-2. Preparation of mRNA—Total cellular RNA was prepared from each cell clone using RNeasy (Qiagen Inc.). Purification of polyadenylated mRNA was carried out using an Oligotex-dT30 super RNA purification kit (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) as described previously (39Ando K. Kanazawa S. Tetsuka T. Ohta S. Jiang X.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mRNA samples were digested with RNase-free DNase, ethanol-precipitated, and further purified through Microcon YM-100 columns (Amicon Inc.). The quantity and quality of mRNA were assessed by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Generation of Fluorescently Tagged cDNA and Gene Expression Profile Analysis—Gene expression profiles were examined as described (39Ando K. Kanazawa S. Tetsuka T. Ohta S. Jiang X. Tada T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the human 3K DNA CHIP™ (Takara) containing 2600 human genes of known functions. Briefly, fluorescently labeled cDNA was synthesized from 1-μg aliquots of purified mRNA by oligo(dT)-primed polymerization using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The pool of nucleotides in the labeling reaction contained 0.5 mm each dGTP, dATP, and dTTP; 0.3 mm dCTP; and 0.1 mm fluorescent nucleotide (Cy3- or Cy5-labeled dCTP, Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescently labeled cDNA was purified by chromatography through Microcon YM-20 columns (Amicon Inc.). The microarray slide was hybridized to combined Cy5-dCTP- and Cy3-dCTP-labeled cDNA probes for 14 h in hybridization solution (6× SSC and 0.2% SDS with 5× Denhardt's solution and carrier DNA) at 65 °C under coverslips. After hybridization, the microarray slide was washed twice with 1.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 55 °C for 5 min, with 1.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 65 °C for 5 min, and with 0.05× SSC at room temperature as a final wash. The hybridized array was scanned at 10-μm resolution on an Affymetrix 428 array scanner. Analysis of differential expression of each gene was performed using ImaGene Version 4.2 computer software (Bio-Discovery Ltd.). Normalization of hybridized signals was performed by global scaling. These experiments were repeatedly performed: we performed comparative microarray analyses three times (24 h after PonA stimulation in 293/Tat and 293/LacZ cells) and two times (12 h after PonA stimulation in 293/Tat and 293/LacZ cells). Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Assay—The experimental procedures have been described previously (41Tetsuka T. Uranishi H. Imai H. Ono T. Sonta S. Takahashi N. Asamitsu K. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4383-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation with the FLAG epitope, anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma) were used. The immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the antibody-bound proteins were dissolved by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with antibodies, including anti-cyclin T1 and anti-AP-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-Myc (Invitrogen) antibodies; and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). To evaluate the level of OGG1 protein, cells were similarly treated with lysis buffer, and the cell lysate was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-OGG1 antibody (Novus Biologicals, Inc.). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described (36Takada N. Sanda T. Okamoto H. Yang J.P. Asamitsu K. Sarol L. Kimura G. Uranishi H. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8019-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (42Sarol L.C. Imai K. Asamitsu K. Tetsuka T. Barzaga N.G. Okamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 107/ml) were electroporated in the presence of 2 μg of pcDNA-Tat or control plasmid (pcDNA3.0, Invitrogen) in 400 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium using the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 apparatus (BTX) at 260 V/1050 microfarads. For the internal control, we employed pRL-TK, expressing Renilla luciferase, which is not modified by Tat action. The transfected cells were harvested, and the extracts were subjected to luciferase assay using the Luciferase Assay System™ (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity as an internal control to assess the transfection efficiency. The data are presented as the -fold increase in luciferase activities (means ± S.D.) relative to the control from three independent transfections. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For cDNA synthesis, 1 μg of purified total RNA were reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was then amplified from each RNA sample with Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen Inc.) and gene-specific primers designed using Oligo Version 4.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights). The primer sequences for each amplified gene were as follows: TFPI2 (tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2), 5′-CAG GAG CCA ACA GGA AAT AAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TAC GAC CCC AAG AAA TGA-3′ (reverse); OGG1, 5′-GCG TGC GCA AGT ACT TCC AGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA GTG ATG CGG GCG ATG TTG-3′ (reverse); OGG1 type 1, 5′-GCG TGC GCA AGT ACT TCC AGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAA AGG GAA GAT AAA ACC ATC-3′ (reverse); OGG1 type 2, 5′-GCG TGC GCA AGT ACT TCC AGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA TCA CAT GAC CAA TTA CTG-3′ (reverse); MEN1β2 homolog FLJ23538/clone 137308, 5′-GAG AGG GTT GGT TAG AGA TAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGA TTT TAG GTG ATA GTT TCC-3′ (reverse); integrin α7, 5′-AAG ACC GAC AGC AGT TCA AGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAC GAA ACC ACG AAA CCA CTA-3′ (reverse); SLC20A1 (solute carrier family 20, member 1), 5′-TAT GTT TGG TTC TGC TGT GTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT ATC TAT GCT GGT TTC CTC-3′ (reverse); ENPP2 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-2), 5′-TTC TTT TGG TCT GTG TCA TC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTC TTC TGT TGT TGG CAT AGT-3′ (reverse); SEPP1 (selenoprotein P, plasma, 1), 5′-GGA ACA GAG AGC CAG GAC CA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCT ATG CTG ACC CTT GTG CTT-3′ (reverse); stanniocalcin-1, 5′-AAG AAA GAA AGA GGG AAA AAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAC CAA ATC ACA AGG AAA GAA-3′ (reverse); ETV5 (Ets variant gene-5), 5′-TTG TGT TGT GCC TGA GAG ACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCT ATG GGT TTG TGA TTT TTC-3′ (reverse); NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream regulated gene-1), 5′-GCG GTG GCT GAG AAA ATG TAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAA GGT GAT GGG CGG CAG GTA-3′ (reverse); ARHE (Ras homolog gene family, member E), 5′-ACT TCG GGT TCT CCT TAC TAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTC TCA TCA CTT GGT CTA CAT-3′ (reverse); HSTF2 (heat shock transcription factor-2), 5′-CAG AAC CAA CCC AAA GTA AGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACA GCA TCA ACA GGA AAA CA-3′ (reverse); NTHL1 (Nth endonuclease III-like 1 (E. coli)), 5′-CAG CAG AAG CGA GGA AAA GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGC GCA GAG GGC TTG GTT GAG-3′ (reverse); RGS16 (regulator of G-protein signaling-16), 5′-TGA GAG TCC TGC TGA AAT CCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCA ACA ATA ACA AAA ACA ATG-3′ (reverse); hexokinase-2, 5′-GAA CTG GTG GAA GGA GAA GAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGG GAA GAA GGA GAG AAA GAG-3′ (reverse); LTA1 (L-type amino acid transporter subunit-1), 5′-TCG GGG TCT GGT GGA AAA ACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAC AAA GGA GGG AAG GGA AAA-3′ (reverse); SLC1A3 (solute carrier family 1, member 3), 5′-TAT GTT TGG TTC TGC TGT GTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCT ATC TAT GCT GGT TTC CTC-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-CAG CAA GCA GGA GTA TGA CGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTG GAC TTG GGA GAG GAC TGG-3′ (reverse). The number of cycles was selected to allow linear amplification of the cDNA under study. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by EtBr staining. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed essentially as described (39Ando K. Kanazawa S. Tetsuka T. Ohta S. Jiang X. Tada T. Kobayashi M. Matsui N. Okamoto T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7796-7803Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers and probes for the OGG1 and β-actin genes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Assays-on-Demand™). Quantitative measurements of each mRNA level were performed in triplicate. The accuracy of mRNA quantitation for each gene was confirmed by measurement of serially diluted control mRNA samples and comparison of the fluorescent intensity from a standard carve of the mRNA levels. Amplification of β-actin mRNA was performed with all samples to control the variation in mRNA levels. The gene expression levels were normalized to β-actin levels for each mRNA preparation, and the -fold increase in an individual gene was calculated by comparison with the result obtained without PonA stimulation. The non-template control was incubated in each amplification reaction to exclude the contaminating template. HIV Infection and p24 Determination—PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin for 48 h and infected with HIV-1MN. HIV-1MN was challenged at 100 TCID50 (where TCID50 is the tissue culture infectious dose resulting in 50% infected cells)/2.0–2.5 × 106 PBMCs or Jurkat cells for 1 h (43Pincus S.H. Messer K.G. Hu S.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and HIV-1 p24 antigen concentration in the culture supernatant was measured using a commercial kit (ZeptoMetrix Corp., Buffalo, NY). mRNA Stability Assay—Total cellular RNA was serially prepared from Tat/293 and mTat/293 cells treated with PonA for 24 h, followed by the treatment with 2 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). The amount of OGG1 mRNA was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR as described above. Detection of ROS—The detection of ROS was measured by flow cytometry with a FACScan (BD Biosciences) equipped with argon ion laser delivering 200 megawatts of power at 488 nm, and the results were analyzed using CellQuest™ software (BD Biosciences). After treatment of cells with PonA (10 μm) to induce Tat or mTat, the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added to the culture at a final concentration of 5 μm, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and then subjected to the fluorescence-activated cell sorter detection of 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (green) at 530 nm. Measurement of Intracellular Reduced GSH and GSSG Contents— The total cellular GSH and GSSG concentrations were measured using a glutathione quantification kit (Dojindo). Briefly, each cell culture (5 × 106 cells) was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was treated with 80 μl of 10 mm HCl, crashed by freeze/thawing repeated twice, and further treated by adding 20 μl of 5% sulfosalicylic acid to precipitate the proteins. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the total GSH and GSSG concentrations were determined. The sample was incubated with GSH reductase and NADPH at 30 °C for 5 min, and the total GSH concentration thus generated was measured by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 30 °C for 10 min. Spectrophotometric detection of 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid was performed at 415 nm. The GSSG concentration was determined by performing the same procedure, but GSH was masked by treatment with 2-vinylpyridine and triethanolamine prior to the reaction with GSH reductase and NADPH. The concentration of reduced GSH was determined by subtracting the GSSG concentration from the total GSH concentration. Each determination was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least twice. Measurement of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase Activity—The enzymatic activity of manganese superoxide dismutase was measured using a WST-1™ superoxide dismutase assay kit (Dojindo) with slight modifications. Briefly, equal numbers of cells (1.5 × 107) were washed twice with PBS, and the cell lysates were extracted by freeze/thawing. The mang"

The molecular scaffold/receptor interaction is mediated by the association of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor with the PDZ domains of SAP97. Here, we characterize the binding of the C terminus of NR2B with the PDZ domains of SAP97 and determine the structure of the PDZ1-NR2B complex employing high-resolution NMR. Based on fluorescence anisotropy, the NR2B subunit binds to the first and second PDZ domains of SAP97, with higher affinity for PDZ2; no appreciable binding to PDZ3 could be measured. The structural features of the NR2B bound to PDZ1 is consistent with the canonical PDZ-binding motif with the glutamic acid at the -3 position of the C terminus (i.e. -E-S-D-V) interacting with the β2/β3 loop. Two sites within the loop of PDZ1 were replaced with the corresponding residue from PDZ2, D243G and P245Q. The former mutation, designed to remove a possible Coulombic repulsion between E-3(NR2B) and Asp-243 (PDZ1) has only a minimal effect on binding. The P245Q mutation leads to a 2-fold increase in binding affinity of NR2B, approaching that observed for wild-type PDZ2. These results indicate that modification of the β2/β3 loop provides an avenue for regulating the ligand specificity of PDZ domains.

Within the postsynaptic density, scaffold proteins mediate the localization and clustering of glutamate receptors, thereby affecting synaptic plasticity and excitatory signal transmission (1Doyle D.A.

MAGUKs contain three PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, Zo-1) domains, an SH3 domain, and an inactive guanylate kinase domain, which recognize and bind different membrane receptors and cytoplasmic-signaling proteins (5Muller B.M.

Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains are ∼90-residue repeats found in a number of proteins implicated in ion-channel and receptor clustering. They recognize and bind to specific motifs that occur at the C terminus of target proteins (7Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 274-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are divided into class I, which recognizes the sequence X-3-(S/T)-2-X-1-φ0 (X = any residue, φ = hydrophobic residue, and residue numbering is relative to the C terminus as 0) and class II, which recognizes the sequence X-3-φ-2-X-1-φ0 (8Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Thus residues at positions 0 and -2 are critical for PDZ domain binding.The NMDA receptors, a subclass of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, play an important role in the activity-dependent neuroplasticity and excitatory synaptic transmission (9Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are generally composed of two types of subunits, the glycine-binding subunit NMDA receptor 1 (NR1) and the glutamate-binding subunits NMDA receptor 2, A through D (NR2A–D) (2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3651) Google Scholar). Different combinations of these subunits exhibit distinct properties and characteristic regional and developmental expression in vivo (10Lynch D.R. Guttmann R.P. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Among these subunits, NR2 has a large cytoplasmic C terminus that modulates activity and localization of NMDA receptors (11Mori H. Manabe T. Watanabe M. Satoh Y. Suzuki N. Toki S. Nakamura K. Yagi T.

Green, submitted for publication. 2O. Jeyifous, L. A. Needleman, J. Marshall, and W. N. Green, submitted for publication.; the first two PDZ domains of SAP97 bind with the C terminus of NR2A and NR2B subunits (15Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klocker N. Bunn R.C. Schnell E. Caruana G. Bernstein A. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was found that the PDZ binding motif tSXV at the C terminus of the NR2 subunit is mandatory but not sufficient for efficient binding with SAP97. Some evidence suggests that amino acids upstream of the C terminus modulate the binding specificity and affinity (13Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Lim I.A. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Similarly, SAP97 has been reported to affect the clustering and localization of the Shaker voltage-gated K+ channel subunits in specific microdomains on the neuronal surface. Heterologous coexpression of SAP97 with the Shaker-type subunit Kv1.4 results in the formation of large round intracellular aggregates with colocalization of SAP97 and Kv1.4 (18Kim E. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This association is mediated through the PDZ domains of SAP97 and the C terminus of Kv1.4 (-E-S-D-V).In this study we have undertaken the structural characterization of the PDZ domains of SAP97 complexed with the C terminus of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. These studies are aimed to understand the molecular basis of SAP97 regulation of NMDA receptor function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The DNA encoding the PDZ1 (residues 221–313), PDZ2 (residues 314–404), and PDZ3 (residues 462–548) domains of rat SAP97 were cloned separately into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET11d vector. All point mutations of the PDZ1 domain (D243G, D243A, D243R, D243K, P245Q, and P245A) were generated with the appropriate nucleotide modification by PCR and sequenced for accuracy. All proteins contain an N-terminal methionine and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and were grown in BL21 (DE3) cells at 37 °C for 3 h before induction by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). Cells were lysed by French Press and the protein purified with TALON-MAR beads, followed by elution with 100 mm imidazole. The isotopically enriched (15N, 13C, and 15N/13C) samples were prepared by growing cells in M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl and/or [13C]glucose (Spectral Gases).Peptides—The peptide NR2B_14 contains the last 14 C-terminal residues of NR2B (GHVYEKLSSIESDV). The peptide NR2B_9 contains the 9 C-terminal residues of NR2B and an N-terminal fluorescein ((fluorescein isothiocyanate)-βAla-KLSSIESDV). The peptide Kv1.4 contains the 6 C-terminal residues of Kv1.4 and an N-terminal fluorescein, (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-βAla-YKETDV.NMR Spectroscopy—The PDZ1 protein, uniformly enriched in 15N and 13C, was prepared to a concentration of 1 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer (10% D2O) at pH 7.4. The resonance assignment and structure determination was achieved following standard procedures and acquisition of the following three-dimensional experiments: HNCA, CBCACONH, HNCO, HNCACO, HBHACONH, 15N-NOESY-HSQC, 13C-NOESY-HSQC, and HCCH-TOCSY.The PDZ1(SAP97)-NR2B complex was formed by addition of NR2B_14 peptide to the PDZ1 solution to a final concentration of 2 mm. All resonances were assigned using the triple resonance experiments above plus the double half-filtered NOESY (19Otting G. Wuethrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 586-594Google Scholar) and half-filtered TOCSY (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar) experiments. Chemical shift perturbation was calculated using the expression, Δppm=(ΔδHN)2+(ΔδN*αN)2 (Eq. 1) where αN = 0.17 (21Tochio H. Hung F. Li M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).All NMR spectra were collected at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer using a triple resonance probe equipped with triple axes gradients. The spectra were processed with NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11388) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Backbone dihedral angle restraints were derived from the secondary structure of the protein and the backbone chemical shift analysis program TALOS (23Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using the CNS program (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) employing the torsion angle simulated annealing protocol.Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Peptide binding was determined using the fluorescein-labeled peptides, NR2B_9 and Kv1.4, at a concentration of 0.1 μm and varying the protein concentration from 0.10 to 200 μm in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. All fluorescence experiments were carried out on a Jobin-Yvon FluoroLog-3 fluorometer at room temperature. Samples were excited at a wavelength of 492.3 nm, and fluorescence anisotropy was collected at the emission wavelength of 515 nm. Each datum point was averaged over 10 measurements. Fluorescence anisotropy was calculated from, R(t)=Iv(t)−IH(t)Iv(t)+2IH(t) (Eq. 2) where Iv is the vertically polarized light intensity, IH is the horizontally polarized light intensity. The binding constant (KD) was derived from curve fitting of the anisotropy-protein concentration spectra (25Piserchio A. Pellegrini M. Mehta S. Blackman S.M. Garcia E.P. Marshall J. Mierke D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6967-6973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Molecular Dynamics and Homology Models—The PDZ2 sequence of SAP97 was aligned to the PDZ1 using the program LALIGN (26Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (831) Google Scholar), and the PDZ2 model was generated by the program Modeler, using the structure of PDZ1 determined here as a template. This structure was superimposed to the PDZ1-NR2B structure to generate the PDZ2-NR2B complex. For energy refinement the resulting peptide/PDZ complex was placed in a simulation cell of 12,200 water molecules and 200 ps of molecular dynamics carried out using the GROMACS program (27Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Buuren R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 95: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7011) Google Scholar) following procedures previously detailed (25Piserchio A. Pellegrini M. Mehta S. Blackman S.M. Garcia E.P. Marshall J.

In the structure calculation, 671 distances restraints and 60 dihedral angle restraints were applied (see Table I). In Fig. 1, the secondary shifts of the α-protons are shown clearly delineating the 2 α helixes and 6 β strands within the canonical PDZ fold (29Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). As part of the tertiary structure, the β strands, β1/β6, β2/β3, and β4/β5 form anti-parallel β sheets with β1, β2, β3, and α1 forming one face of the shell-shaped structure, and β4, β5, β6, and α2 forming the other face (see Fig. 2). The β4 strand is much less well determined when compared with the structure of the PDZ1 domain of SAP90 (25Piserchio A. Pellegrini M. Mehta S. Blackman S.M. Garcia E.P. Marshall J. Mierke D.F. J.

Closer inspection of the induced shifts (Fig. 3) also illustrates perturbations in the β2/β3 loop and β3 strand. The shifting of the resonances, observed as averages of bound/free, is consistent with weak binding, as borne out by the fluorescence anisotropy measurements (detailed below).Fig. 3The perturbation of the chemical shifts of the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 upon the binding of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The structural features of the binding mode of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit was determined by intermolecular NOEs measured using isotope-filtered experiments (19Otting G.

The NR2B sequence includes a PDZ binding motif -SDV (30Fujita A. Kurachi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and a negatively charged glutamic acid at the -3 position. Based on the NOEs, the final 4 residues lie between the α2 helix and β2 strand, anti-parallel to the β2 strand (see Fig. 2), very similar to the binding motives observed for other PDZ domains (31Piserchio A.

A large number of intermolecular NOEs are observed between the side chain of V0 and the PDZ1 residues Gly-235, Phe-236, and Ile-238 in the β2 and Val-293, Leu-296, and Lys-297 of α2. The negatively charged D-1 projects out toward the β2 strand, with NOEs with Ser-237 and Ile-238 of the β2 strand with the adjacent S-2 forming interactions with Ile-238 and Val-293 of the β2 and α2, respectively. The side chain of E-3 projects toward the β2/β3 loop, partially occupying the β2/α2 cleft (as determined by NOEs to Ala-239 and Val-293) as illustrated in Fig. 2.Fluorescence Anisotropy—The binding of the NR2B peptides to the three PDZ domains of SAP97 was characterized using fluorescence anisotropy. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the fluoresce-in-labeled peptide while free displays little anisotropy (0.04) that rapidly increases in a saturable manner upon addition of the PDZ domain. The binding of the C terminus of NR2B to the PDZ2 domain is appreciably better (1.3 μm) than measured for the PDZ1 domain (9.7 μm). The NR2B peptide displayed no measurable binding to the PDZ3 domain of SAP97. For comparison purposes, the binding of the C terminus of Kv1.4 (-E-S-D-V) was also determined. The Kv1.4 displays an enhanced binding for PDZ1 in comparison to NR2B (5.0 versus 9.7 μm); whereas only a small difference is observed for the binding of the two peptides to PDZ2 (1.7 and 1.3 μm for Kv1.4 and NR2B, respectively). Likewise, the Kv1.4 displayed no affinity for the PDZ3 domain of SAP97.Fig. 4Fluorescence anisotropy based binding curves for the C-terminal peptides of NR2B (– – –) and Kv1.4 (····) to the PDZ1 (a) and PDZ2 (b) domains of SAP97. The KD for PDZ1 is 9.7 and 5.0 μm for NR2B and Kv1.4, respectively and for PDZ2 KD is 1.3 and 1.7 μm for NR2B and Kv1.4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Using the structure of the PDZ1 complexed with the C terminus of NR2B, we created a homology model of the PDZ2 domain of SAP97 with the NR2B bound. This initial model was then relaxed, and the molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. The results were compared with molecular dynamics simulations carried out for the PDZ1 complex. In both PDZ1 and PDZ2, the β2/β3 loop is dynamic, undergoing conformational changes during the simulation, consistent with the small number of experimental constraints observed for the loop. Despite the motional averaging, distinct differences between the simulations of the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains were observed with respect to E-3 and the β2/β3 loop. Of particular relevance is the association of the E-3 of the NR2B with Gln-339 of PDZ2, with hydrogen bonds formed during portions of the simulation; in PDZ1 the equivalent residue is a proline, Pro-245. To examine the importance of this interaction in the association of the C terminus of NR2B with the PDZ2 domain, site-directed mutagenesis studies targeting this site were initiated.Mutagenesis of β2/β3 Loop—From the molecular dynamics simulations the β2/β3 loop is important in the binding of the NR2B C terminus. Based on a sequence comparison of PDZ1 and PDZ2 (PDZ3 lacks this loop), we have targeted two sites for further examination. PDZ1:241GTDNPHIGDDSS252 * * ** ** * PDZ2:335GVGNQHIPDDNS346 SEQUENCE 1 In the P245Q mutant, we replace the Pro-245 in PDZ1 with the Gln-339 of PDZ2 to probe the favorable interaction observed in the homology model of NR2B/PDZ2. This mutation, directly in the center of the loop region, enhances the affinity of NR2B by a factor of 2 (KD = 4.8 μm); the affinity for Kv1.4 is likewise enhanced from this mutation (KD = 2.6 μm). This enhancement can be attributed to the glutamine side chain, as the P245A mutation did not alter the binding affinity for NR2B (KD = 9.8 μm).Based on the sequence comparison, the Asp-243 of PDZ1 could be responsible for a lower affinity through an unfavorable Coulombic interaction with E-3 of NR2B. To test this, we replaced Asp-243 with the corresponding glycine, Gly-337, of PDZ2. Surprisingly, the Asp/Gly mutation leads to a PDZ1 with reduced affinity for both NR2B and Kv1.4, KD of 11.5 and 6.0 μm, respectively. Removal of the side chain or replacement with a positive charge also depletes the binding affinity for NR2B; the D234A, D243R, and D243K mutations have KDs of 20, 19, and 16 μm, respectively.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the structural features of the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 and characterized the binding of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. The association of NR2B with PDZ2 (1.3 μm) is ∼10 times better than that of PDZ1; no affinity could be measured for PDZ3. We obtained similar binding profiles for the highly homologous C terminus of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.4 (see Fig. 4). A similar pattern of binding (i.e. PDZ2 > PDZ1; PDZ3 = no binding) has been reported for two other MAGUKs, SAP90, and SAP102 (15Niethammer M. Kim E. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lim I.A. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6967-6973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The NMR results indicate that NR2B binds to the PDZ1 domain of SAP97 in the canonical fashion, with the peptide ligand adopting an extended, β strand-like conformation, occupying the cleft between α helix 2 and β strand 2 (with an anti-parallel arrangement with the β2 strand). A homology model of the PDZ2-NR2B complex was created using the structural features determined for PDZ1. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations suggest specific interactions between the side chain of E-3 of NR2B with the glutamine, Gln-339, of PDZ2. The negatively charged residue at the -3 position (in contrast to the -1 position) has been shown to be important for binding to a number of different proteins, the most recent being the association of SAP97 to the recently discovered TANC (TRP-, ankyrin repeat-, and coiled-coil region containing protein) molecular scaffold which contains a C-terminal -E-S-N-V (33Suzuki T.L.W. Zhang J.P. Tian Q.B. Sakagami H. Usada N. Kondo H. Fujii T. Endo S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In the structure of the PDZ1-NR2B complex, the E-3 sits in the middle of the unstructured β2/β3 loop; this loop region has been previously implicated in ligand specificity of PDZ domains (34Reina J. Lacroix E. Hobson S.D. Fernandez-Ballester G. Rybin V. Schwab M.S. Serrano L. Gonzalez C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar). This is most clearly illustrated with the PDZ3 domain of SAP97, which lacks this loop and displays no affinity for NR2B or Kv1.4. In this study we have targeted two sites within the β2/β3 loop based on the comparison of the PDZ1 and PDZ2 sequences. We find that the incorporation of Gln-339 of PDZ2 into PDZ1 (P245Q) enhances the affinity for NR2B and Kv1.4. This result is not from the removal of the proline, as P245A does not alter binding. This illustrates that the Gln-339 is involved in ligand binding, although not sufficient alone to account for the affinity of NR2B for PDZ2. Interestingly, the replacement of the negatively charged aspartic acid (Asp-243) with glycine (Gly-337 of PDZ2), alanine, lysine, or arginine reduced the affinity of NR2B and Kv1.4. These findings demonstrate that a Columbic repulsion between Asp-243 and E-3 of the peptide is not the source of the reduced affinity for PDZ1.This suggests that residues removed from the binding site, more distal than those examined here, are contributing to ligand specificity. However, the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of SAP97 are highly homologous with over 55% sequence identity (85% sequence homology). Similarly, the PDZ1 domains of SAP90 and SAP97 have high sequence identities and yet these domains show distinct binding patterns (14Larsson M. Hjalm G. Sakwe A.M. Engstrom A. Hoglund A.S. Larsson E. Robinson R.C. Sundberg C. Rask L. Biochem. J. 2003; 15: 381-391Crossref Google Scholar, 35Mehta S. Wu H. Garner C.C. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16092-16099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Recently, the interaction of megalin, an integral membrane protein of the lipoprotein receptor family, with the MAGUK family was examined (14Larsson M. Hjalm G. Sakwe A.M. Engstrom A. Hoglund A.S. Larsson E. Robinson R.C. Sundberg C. Rask L. Biochem. J. 2003; 15: 381-391Crossref Google Scholar). The C terminus of megalin, -D-S-E-V, displayed no binding to PDZ2 of SAP97. Binding could be recovered by T389A, replacing the threonine of SAP97 to alanine as found in the PDZ2 domains of the other MAGUKs. The exact role of this residue is presently not clear. However, our structural findings with the side chain of the E-3 projecting toward the β2/β3 loop and the remainder of the C terminus in close contact with the α2 domain is consistent with the observed significance of the T389A mutation. Within the postsynaptic density, scaffold proteins mediate the localization and clustering of glutamate receptors, thereby affecting synaptic plasticity and excitatory signal transmission (1Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1"
https://openalex.org/W2133113218,"<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> aminopeptidase S (AmpS) has been named for its predicted, but experimentally untested, aminopeptidase activity. The enzyme is homologous to biochemically characterized aminopeptidases that contain two cobalt or zinc ions in their active centers, but it is unrelated to all structurally characterized metallopeptidases. Here, we demonstrate AmpS aminopeptidase activity experimentally, and we present the 1.8-Å crystal structure of the enzyme. Two metal ions with full occupancy and a third metal ion with low occupancy are present in the active site. A water molecule and Glu-319 serve as bridging ligands to the two metals with full occupancy. One of these metal ions is additionally coordinated by Glu-253 and His-348 and the other by His-381 and Asp-383. In addition, the metals are involved in weak metal-donor interactions to a water molecule and to Tyr-355. In the crystal, AmpS forms a dimer with a large internal cavity. The active sites are located at opposite ends of this internal cavity and are essentially inaccessible from the outside, suggesting that an inactive conformation was crystallized. Because gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation data also suggest dimer formation, the problem of substrate access to the active site cavity remains unresolved."

Such showers are expected to occur on Mars as well, and on 7 March last year, the panoramic camera of Spirit, the Mars Exploration Rover, revealed a curious streak across the martian sky. Here we show that the timing and orientation of this streak, and the shape of its light curve, are consistent with the existence of a regular meteor shower associated with the comet Wiseman-Skiff, which could be characterized as martian Cepheids."
