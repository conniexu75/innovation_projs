https://openalex.org/W3102763870,"The blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang has been transformed by the expansion of the Universe into the nearly isotropic 2.73 K cosmic microwave background. Tiny inhomogeneities in the early Universe left their imprint on the microwave background in the form of small anisotropies in its temperature. These anisotropies contain information about basic cosmological parameters, particularly the total energy density and curvature of the Universe. Here we report the first images of resolved structure in the microwave background anisotropies over a significant part of the sky. Maps at four frequencies clearly distinguish the microwave background from foreground emission. We compute the angular power spectrum of the microwave background, and find a peak at Legendre multipole lpeak = (197 ± 6), with an amplitude ΔT200 = (69 ± 8) µK. This is consistent with that expected for cold dark matter models in a flat (euclidean) Universe, as favoured by standard inflationary models."

https://openalex.org/W3105111701,"It is of fundamental importance to establish whether there is a limit to how thin a superconducting wire can be, while retaining its superconducting character--and if there is a limit, to determine what sets it. This issue may also be of practical importance in defining the limit to miniaturization of superconducting electronic circuits. At high temperatures, the resistance of linear superconductors is caused by excitations called thermally activated phase slips. Quantum tunnelling of phase slips is another possible source of resistance that is still being debated. It has been theoretically predicted that such quantum phase slips can destroy superconductivity in very narrow wires. Here we report resistance measurements on ultrathin (< or = 10 nm) nanowires produced by coating carbon nanotubes with a superconducting Mo-Ge alloy. We find that nanowires can be superconducting or insulating depending on the ratio of their normal-state resistance (R(N)) to the quantum resistance for Cooper pairs (Rq). If R(N) < Rq, quantum tunnelling of phase slips is prohibited by strong damping, and so the wires stay superconducting. In contrast, we observe an insulating state for R(N) > Rq, which we explain in terms of proliferation of quantum phase slips and a corresponding localization of Cooper pairs."

The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) is a transmembrane metalloproteinase responsible for the proteolytic release or “shedding” of several cell-surface proteins, including TNF and p75 TNFR. We established a TACE-reconstitution system using TACE-deficient cells co-transfected with TACE and substrate cDNAs to study TACE function and regulation. Using the TACE-reconstitution system, we identified two additional substrates of TACE, interleukin (IL)-1R-II and p55 TNFR. Using truncations and chimeric constructs of TACE and another ADAM family member, ADAM-10, we studied the function of the different domains of TACE in three shedding activities. We found that TACE must be expressed with its membrane-anchoring domain for phorbol ester-stimulated shedding of TNF, p75 TNFR, and IL-1R-II, but that the cytoplasmic domain is not required for the shedding of these substrates. The catalytic domain of ADAM-10 could not be functionally substituted for that of TACE. IL-1R-II shedding required the cysteine-rich domain of TACE as well as the catalytic domain, whereas TNF and p75 TNFR shedding required only the tethered TACE catalytic domain.

We have created transgenic mice that are genetically deficient in catalytically active TACE (tace ΔZn/ΔZn mice) (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E.

Beyond the involvement of TACE in these shedding events, however, little is known about the shedding mechanism or how TACE function is regulated. Like other members of the ADAM family of metalloproteases (10.Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), TACE is a multidomain, type I transmembrane protein. The initial product of translation contains a pro-domain (which is removed by proteolysis to generate the active enzyme), a zinc-dependent metalloprotease catalytic domain, a cysteine-rich sequence of 197 amino acids (comprising disintegrin and “epidermal growth factor-like” domains), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. The term “disintegrin domain” was originally applied to a region of about 100 amino acids found in a group of snake venom proteins homologous to the ADAMs; the snake venom disintegrins bind to integrins on the surface of platelets and block platelet aggregation. It appears that the corresponding sequence in ADAM-2, expressed in sperm, binds to an integrin on the surface of eggs (11.Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), but the function of this region in most ADAMs, including TACE, is unknown. Nothing is known about the function of the cytoplasmic domain of TACE, although the corresponding domain in ADAM-9 is required for induced ADAM-9 mediated shedding of heparin binding-EGF (12.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). TACE appears to directly cleave multiple proteins, as opposed to activating a proteolytic cascade. In virtually all cases, purified TACE cleaves peptides containing the sequence of the processing site at the physiologically relevant peptide bond (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage site sequences in most substrates do not resemble the TNF processing site and TACE cleaves membrane proteins of both the type I and type II topology. Therefore, it is unclear how the enzyme recognizes all these substrates. Regulatory mechanisms involved in the shedding of the various substrates are undefined. Most shedding events are induced by phorbol esters, which are believed to mimic physiological stimuli (13.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and the Raf/MAP kinase pathway is involved in at least one case (14.Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of most shed proteins is not required for induced shedding (15.Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev E.E. Batkin M. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Ramchandran R. Sen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the cytoplasmic domain of TACE is required. The catalytic domain of TACE is sufficient for cleavage of TNF in solution, 2J. L. Slack, unpublished results. but previous studies have not determined which domains are necessary for constitutive or induced shedding of membrane-associated TNF. We have developed a system for reconstituting shedding in a fibroblast cell line derived from the tace ΔZn/ΔZn mice to study the function of different domains of the TACE protein. In this paper, we address the potential roles of membrane anchoring, the cytoplasmic domain, and the cysteine-rich sequences in the shedding of three different TACE substrates. We found that expression of TACE with a membrane anchor reconstitutes shedding in these cells, whereas expression of secreted TACE does not. We also found that the cytoplasmic domain of TACE is not required for any of the shedding events examined and that the cysteine-rich domain of TACE is required for shedding of one of the substrates while affecting the inhibitor sensitivity of another substrate's shedding. Two clonal fibroblast cell lines, wild-type (wt) EC-4 and tace ΔZn/ΔZnEC-2, were established by infecting primary fibroblast cultures derived from wt or tace ΔZn/ΔZn mice, respectively, with a Ras-Myc encoding retrovirus (23.Overell R.W. Weisser K.E. Cosman D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The resulting cultures were expanded, and clones were obtained by limiting dilution. The wt EC-4 and tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 1% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator and passaged by trypsinization. tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 or wt EC-4 cells were cultured overnight in 6-well dishes and transfected using the DEAE-dextran transfection method (24.Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1990: 87-160Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of TACE, variant TACE (see below), or a control irrelevant cDNA (all in pCDNA3 neo vector, Invitrogen) plus 1.5 μg of substrate cDNA (TNF, TNFR, or IL-1 receptor in sfCAV vector) (19.Crowe P.D. Walter B.N. Mohler K.M. Otten-Evans C. Black R.A. Ware C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The irrelevant cDNA was either insulin-like growth factor-1 or soluble CD40 fused to the Fc domain of IgG (CD40.Fc). Three days post-transfection, cells were tested for shedding function as follows. Cells were washed with 2 ml of medium and incubated at 37 °C with 1 ml of fresh medium ± 100 ng/ml phorbol ester (PMA, phorbol 12-N-myristate 13-acetate), ±50 μm IC-3 (a hydroxamate inhibitor of metalloproteinases, including TACE) (25.Alele J. Jiang J. Goldsmith J.F. Yang X. Maheshwari H.G. Black R.A. Baumann G. Frank S.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (or as indicated below). The culture medium was removed from the cells. The cells were solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min in 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (10 μm leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA). Both culture media and cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 rpm in a Microfuge. The levels of substrate (full-length and cleaved) in cell lysates and culture media were measured by ELISA. TNF ELISA was performed using the method described in Ref. 19.Crowe P.D. Walter B.N. Mohler K.M. Otten-Evans C. Black R.A. Ware C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar. TNFR and IL-1R-II ELISAs were performed using kits from R&D Systems. To normalize for differences in transfection efficiency between plates and for differences in cDNA expression, we report the shedding of proteins as a ratio of the protein in the culture medium to the cell-associated protein. All the variable conditions (i.e. ± phorbol ester, ± IC-3) were tested in duplicate transfections and the average values of the ratios are shown. Expression plasmids encoding two truncated versions of TACE were created. The first version, referred to as TACE B, was truncated immediately after the transmembrane domain of full-length TACE (see Fig. 1). We also added poly-His and the FLAG epitope sequences to the C terminus of TACE B to facilitate detection (26.Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Liggy R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and refer to this protein as TACE B His-flag. The second truncated form of TACE, referred to as soluble, secreted TACE, consists of the extracellular domain of human TACE, i.e. the pro, catalytic, and Cys-rich domains. Three TACE/ADAM-10 chimeric molecules were made from human ADAM-10 and mouse TACE B (see Fig. 1). The first molecule, catalytic ADAM-10/dis-EGF TACE B, contains the pro and catalytic domains of ADAM-10 joined to the disintegrin domain (dis), epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF), transmembrane domain, and epitope tags from TACE B His-flag. The second chimeric molecule, catalytic dis-TACE/EGF ADAM-10 B, contains the TACE pro, catalytic, and disintegrin regions joined to the EGF and transmembrane domain regions from ADAM-10 with the His-flag tag sequences added to the C terminus of the molecule. The third chimeric molecule, catalytic TACE/dis-EGF ADAM-10 B, consists of the TACE pro and catalytic domains joined to the disintegrin, EGF, and transmembrane domain regions from ADAM-10 with the His-flag epitope sequences added to C terminus of the molecule. All cDNAs encoding poly-His and FLAG-tagged TACE B and TACE/ADAM-10 chimeras were expressed in the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The polymerase chain reaction (27.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar, 28.Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was used to create the various TACE and ADAM-10 constructs and the three TACE/ADAM-10 chimeric molecules. Detection of TACE B and TACE/ADAM-10 chimeric proteins in the transiently transfected tace ΔZn/ΔZnEC-2 cells using radioimmunoprecipitation was inefficient. Therefore stable transfectants were isolated after transfectingtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells with cDNAs encoding TACE His-flag, TACE B His-flag, or the TACE chimeras (all in pCDNA3 zeo, Invitrogen), to facilitate reliable detection of the expression and processing of these proteins. Zeocine-resistant colonies were isolated and tested for expression and processing of TACE and TACE/ADAM-10 chimeras. Cells were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors but no metal chelators. Clarified cell lysates were then incubated with Ni2+-chelating resin (Ni-NTA beads from Qiagen) to recover the poly-His-tagged TACE and TACE/ADAM-10 proteins. The Ni-NTA beads were washed, and the protein was eluted from them in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody M2. We examined shedding of TNF or TNFR from these cell lines by transiently transfecting the cells with cDNA encoding TNF or p75 TNFR. Shedding (S:C ratio) in the stably transfectedtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cell lines was very similar, for both substrates, to that measured in thetace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells transiently transfected with both enzyme and substrate, indicating that expression levels were not limiting in the latter case. Therefore we report under “Results” only shedding data generated with the transient system, with which many more experiments were carried out (all the shedding data reported is representative of at least three experiments). ADAM-10 was detected in the concanavalin A-binding fraction of cell extracts by Western blot analysis with an anti-ADAM-10 antiserum generously supplied by Paul Glynn (29.Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TACE is expressed ubiquitously in mice, and several established cell lines (i.e. COS, 293 EBNA, CHO, and C127) were all found to shed TNF following transfection with pro-TNF cDNA (data not shown). We therefore established a fibroblast cell line from the tace ΔZn/ΔZn mice that could be used to study TACE function and regulation by reconstitution techniques. The wt EC-4 and tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells are immortalized fibroblast cell lines derived from wt andtace ΔZn/ΔZn mice, respectively. We first studied the shedding of TNF from these cells and then established their utility for examining the role of TACE in shedding additional membrane proteins. Neither the tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 nor the wt EC-4 cells expressed detectable levels of endogenous TNF upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide for 18 to 24 h. Therefore, shedding of TNF from these cells was examined by co-transfection of the cells with TNF cDNA and TACE cDNA or control cDNA. TNF protein in the culture supernatant and in the cells was measured by ELISA after a 2–3-h incubation at 37 °C, in the absence or presence of PMA and/or the metalloprotease inhibitor IC-3. Phorbol ester is a known stimulator of various shedding events in other cell types. We chose to use a 2-h incubation period for most of our studies based on results from initial experiments that showed the TNF accumulation in the medium was linear up to 3 h (data not shown). Although there was some release of TNF from the TACE-deficient EC-2 cells without TACE cDNA transfection, we observed a clear increase in PMA-induced TNF shedding from tace ΔZn/ΔZnEC-2 cells after TACE cDNA transfection (TableI). To control for variation between different transfections, we expressed TNF shedding as a ratio of soluble TNF (S) accumulated in the medium to cell- associated TNF (C) retained in the cells at the end of the incubation. The S:C ratio is a reflection of substrate shedding rates, and a change in the S:C ratio by transfection with TACE or other proteins indicates a change in the discretionary change extent or rate of substrate shedding. The S:C ratio for TNF increased 3–4-fold in phorbol ester-stimulatedtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells when transfected with TACE cDNA (Table I). Without phorbol ester, there was much less shedding with or without TACE (Table I). IC-3 inhibited the TACE-dependent shedding of TNF intace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells. More importantly, the S:C ratio of TNF in phorbol ester-stimulated wt EC-4 cells was similar to the S:C ratio observed in TACE-transfectedtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells (Table I), demonstrating reconstitution of TNF shedding intace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells by TACE expression. This restoration of TACE-mediated shedding activity to wild-type levels by transfection of tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells validated the use of the EC-2 reconstitution system for our studies on TACE function.Table IEffect of TACE on TNF shedding from tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 and wt EC-4 cellsTransfected cDNATACE genotypeNo additions,+PMA,+PMA + IC-3,S∶CS:CS∶CControlwt EC-42.88.33.8FL TACEwt EC-44.69.02.4Controltace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-22.12.50.9FL TACEtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-22.27.60.7TACE Btace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-22.38.01.6Wild-type EC-4 fibroblast cells and tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells were co-transfected with cDNA for TNF and full-length (FL) TACE, TACE B, or CD40.Fc (control) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The levels of TNF released into the culture media (S) or remaining in the cells (C) after a 1.5-h incubation ± phorbol ester (PMA, 100 ng/ml) and ± IC-3 (80 μm) were determined by ELISA, and the S:C ratio is shown.

We refer to the protein encoded by this cDNA as human TACE B. We have also constructed mouse TACE B, which is similarly truncated at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain at Val-694. We studied the expression and function of both human and mouse TACE B intace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells to examine the role of the cytoplasmic domain in TACE function. The two TACE B constructs and the mouse full-length TACE were examined for TNF shedding activity in tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells using the reconstitution assay. We found that all three TACE constructs reconstituted PMA-stimulated TNF shedding to similar extents when transfected into tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells (compare S:C ratios in the presence and absence of PMA in Table I; data not shown for human TACE B). The shedding activity of TACE and TACE B was inhibited to about the same extent by IC-3 (Table I). Soluble human TACE, consisting of the extracellular domain of the processed protein (catalytic-disintegrin-EGF) is secreted and found to specifically cleave both the TNF cleavage site peptide and pro-TNF extracted from cells (2.Black R.A.

However, the addition of 100 μg/ml purified, soluble recombinant TACE protein to pro-TNF-expressingtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells did not increase TNF shedding (the recombinant TACE is active in the culture medium and retains activity during a 3-h incubation with EC-2 cells) (TableII). In another set of experiments, we observed that co-cultivation of wt EC-4 cells with pro-TNF-expressingtace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells did not restore TNF shedding from the tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells (data not shown). These results suggested that TACE does not act intrans on TNF substrate, i.e. that both enzyme and substrate need to be expressed in the same cell for shedding to occur.Table IITNF shedding in tace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells transfected with various TACE constructs or exposed to exogenous recombinant TACEDNA transfectedAddition of recombinant TACES∶C ratioΔ in S∶C with TACEControlNone2.08FL TACENone12.86.1 XTACE BNone11.85.7 XTACE B His-flagNone12.35.9 XSecreted TACENone2.1NonepCDNA3neo100 μg2.16Nonetace ΔZn/ΔZn EC-2 cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding TNF and one of the following constructs: control (insulin-like growth factor-1), full-length (FL) TACE, TACE B, TACE B His-flag, or secreted TACE, or with empty vector (pCDNA3 neo).

In contrast, co-transfection of the soluble TACE cDNA did not have any effect on the S:C ratio of TNF (Table II). (Both TACE and TACE B were detected only in detergent-soluble cell extracts and were undetectable in cell-conditioned media.

Akt provides a survival signal that protects cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal, but its function in other forms of stress is less clear. Here we investigated the role of PI3-K/Akt during the cellular response to oxidant injury. H2O2treatment elevated Akt activity in multiple cell types in a time- (5–30 min) and dose (400 μM-2 mm)-dependent manner. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of p85 (regulatory component of PI3-K) and treatment with inhibitors of PI3-K (wortmannin and LY294002) prevented H2O2-induced Akt activation. Akt activation by H2O2 also depended on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling; H2O2 treatment led to EGFR phosphorylation, and inhibition of EGFR activation prevented Akt activation by H2O2. As H2O2 causes apoptosis of HeLa cells, we investigated whether alterations of PI3-K/Akt signaling would affect this response. Wortmannin and LY294002 treatment significantly enhanced H2O2-induced apoptosis, whereas expression of exogenous myristoylated Akt (an activated form) inhibited cell death. Constitutive expression of v-Akt likewise enhanced survival of H2O2-treated NIH3T3 cells. These results suggest that H2O2activates Akt via an EGFR/PI3-K-dependent pathway and that elevated Akt activity confers protection against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.

Cells respond to oxidant injury with the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways that serve to coordinate the cellular response and ultimately determine the outcome.

However, its potential role in influencing cell fate during other conditions of stress is less clear.Several reports have shown that Akt can be activated by some stresses such as heat, hyperosmotic stress, H2O2, cadmium chloride (CdCl2), and sodium arsenite (24.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M.

However, other studies have provided evidence that apoptosis-inducing stresses including ceramide, hyperosmotic stress, UVC, and ionizing radiation result in down-regulation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway (28.Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 29.Zundel W. Giaccia A.

Little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in altering Akt activity during stress or the functional significance of such changes in Akt activity. Indeed, the high concentrations of certain of the agents utilized to modulate Akt activity in many of the studies noted above raises concerns about the biologic relevance of the observations.In the present study we sought to explore the mechanisms involved in activation of Akt during the cellular response to oxidant injury and to determine its influence on cell survival. By using H2O2 as a model oxidant, we show that sub-millimolar concentrations lead to activation of Akt in a variety of cell types, and we further provide genetic, enzymatic, and pharmacological evidence indicating that this occurs through an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3-K-dependent signaling pathway. Most importantly, using various strategies to inhibit or enhance Akt activity, we present findings suggesting a pivotal role for the PI3-K/Akt pathway in promoting cell survival following oxidant injury.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are that Akt is activated by biologically relevant doses of H2O2, that this activation occurs via an EGFR/PI3-K-dependent mechanism, and most importantly, that Akt provides a pro-survival signal that can protect cells against oxidative stress.Akt is an established downstream target of PI3-K following stimulation of cells with growth factors, and a role for Akt in promoting cell growth and protecting against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis is well established (17.Dudek H.

Whether Akt activation occurs in response to other stressful stimuli is more controversial (24.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U.

Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported activation of Akt by H2O2 as well as by other stresses that are known to exert their toxic effects, at least in part, through an oxidative stress mechanism (24.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M.

J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, three recent studies have reported that ceramide and other stresses known to elevate cellular ceramide levels and induce apoptosis down-regulate Akt activity (28.Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 29.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30.Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In one such study, Zundel and Giaccia (29.Zundel W. Giaccia A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) provided evidence to indicate that UVC, ionizing radiation, and sorbitol all inhibit Akt, through stress-induced increases in ceramide that lead to inhibition of PI3-K and Akt. However, Zhou et al. (28.Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16568-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) suggested that ceramide inhibits Akt independently of PI3-K. Although H2O2 was not examined in either of these studies, like the other stresses examined, it is known to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis to generate ceramide (48.Goldkorn T. Balaban N. Shannon M. Chea V. Matsukuma K. Gilchrist D. Wang H. Chan C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3209-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, accordingly, would be expected to inhibit PI3-K and/or Akt. Clearly we did not observe such an effect, but rather we saw a significant activation of both PI3-K and Akt in H2O2-treated cells. It is also worth noting that, unlike the above-mentioned studies, we did not observe a down-regulation of Akt activity in response to UVC irradiation.Several studies have inferred a role for PI3-K in the activation of Akt by H2O2 based on the sensitivity of Akt activation to inhibition by wortmannin. Our studies have confirmed these observations with pharmacological inhibitors and have provided additional evidence for the dependence of H2O2-induced Akt activation on PI3-K using genetic mutant forms of p85 that prevent PI3-K activation. What then are the mechanisms involved in initiating PI3-K/Akt activation following H2O2? Our study provides several pieces of evidence that support a role for EGFR in initiating the response. First, the EGFR was found to undergo rapid phosphorylation in response to H2O2 treatment; the kinetics of activation and its attenuation coincided with that for elevated PI3-K activity and Akt activation. Second, treatment of cells with three different pharmacologic agents known to prevent EGFR signaling also inhibited Akt activation by H2O2. Third, pretreatment of cells with EGF to down-regulate the EGFR likewise prevented Akt activation in response to H2O2treatment. These findings are consistent with additional studies from our laboratory and others (36.Chen W. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 37.Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Zanella C.L. Posada J. Tritton T.R. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5334-5338PubMed Google Scholar), showing that the EGFR plays an important role in mediating activation of ERK MAPK in response to oxidative stress. However, and importantly, the Akt and ERK activations rely on independent signaling pathways, as treatment of cells with wortmannin (which completely prevents Akt activation) did not alter ERK activation (Fig. 7). Likewise, treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor, that prevents ERK activation did not interfere with Akt activation by H2O2 (data not shown). A recent study has implicated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, as the upstream mediator of PI3-K activation in T98 glioblastoma cells (27.Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It was shown that FAK underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to H2O2 treatment and associated with PI3-K in a time frame consistent with Akt activation. In that study, however, the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation and Akt activation (earliest activation occurring at 1 h and peaking at 4 h) were significantly delayed relative to what we have observed in our studies for both NIH3T3 and HeLa cells (activation seen as early as 5 min, peaking at 15–30 min, and returning to basal levels within 1 h of treatment). It is possible that different receptor and membrane-associated nonreceptor tyrosine kinases can contribute to the initiation of the response, dependent on the cell type and/or circumstances. In this regard, it is worth noting that we have obtained preliminary evidence that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor also undergoes phosphorylation in response to H2O2 treatment, and inhibitors capable of preventing this phosphorylation also partially inhibited Akt activation. Additional experiments will be required to understand better the role of growth factor receptors in mediating the response.Finally, and most importantly, our study has provided the first direct evidence that Akt activation contributes to the survival of H2O2-treated cells. Prior to our study, all reports of Akt activation in response to H2O2treatment involved H2O2 concentrations in excess of 1 mm, with most experiments performed with 5–10 mm H2O2. The use of such high concentrations raises concerns regarding the biologic relevance of the response as such concentrations can be markedly toxic for cells, leading to rapid necrosis. We have demonstrated that concentrations as low as 400 μm can result in activation of Akt. We had previously shown that H2O2 treatment leads to apoptosis of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner over a range of concentrations from 400 μm to 1.2 mm(6.Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). That Akt activation occurs over a similar dose-response range supports its biologic relevance, and a role for Akt activation in protecting cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis was suggested by the finding that inhibition of Akt activation with PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) and AG1478 (the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) led to enhanced apoptosis in response to H2O2 (Fig. 6). Direct evidence for the ability of Akt to confer protection against H2O2-induced apoptosis was obtained in two different cell types using two different strategies to constitutively elevate Akt activity as follows: infection of HeLa cells with adenovirus expressing myristoylated Akt, and constitutive expression of v-Akt in NIH3T3 cells. In both model systems, elevated Akt activity was associated with enhanced resistance of cells to apoptosis following H2O2 treatment.An important question remaining is what are the downstream targets responsible for the protective influence of Akt? A number of different Akt targets have been identified that are believed to contribute to its anti-apoptotic function as follows: BAD, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family; caspase-9, a protease that functions as an initiator and effector of apoptosis; forkhead, a transcription factor believed to regulate the activity of other apoptosis-related genes; and IKKα, a kinase involved in activation of NF-κB (49.Datta S.R.

The possible contribution of these downstream targets is currently under investigation. However, a role for IKKα appears to be ruled out by earlier studies from our laboratory (6.Wang X. Martindale J.L. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) indicating that activation of NF-κB does not play a role in influencing survival of H2O2-treated HeLa cells.In conclusion, although the precise mechanisms through which the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway acts to modulate the response to oxidants remains to be determined, our current findings provide strong support for a crucial role of the PI3-K/Akt pathway in regulating cellular protection during the response to oxidative stress. It is important to remember, however, that this is only one of many signaling pathways activated in response to oxidant injury. Some of these are generally pro-survival (e.g. ERK and NF-κB), whereas others appear to be pro-apoptotic (e.g. JNK and p53). Thus, the ultimate cellular outcome in a given cell type will reflect the relative balance between these various activities. Oxidative stress poses a major threat to organisms living in an aerobic environment and is believed to play a causative role in many disease processes. Cells respond to oxidant injury with the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways that serve to coordinate the cellular response and ultimately determine the outcome. Depending on the particular stimulus encountered or the cell type involved, the response can range from proliferation and transformation, to growth arrest or cell death (1.Janssen Y.M. Van Houten B.

Among the major signaling pathways and/or key mediators known to influence survival of cells subjected to oxidant injury are the phosphorylation cascades leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)1 including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 (4.Kyriakis J.M.

Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, was originally identified as the cellular homolog of the v-aktoncogene (9.Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). It is activated via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)-dependent signaling pathway when cells or tissues are exposed to growth factors, insulin, certain cytokines, and integrin-linked extracellular stimuli (10.Burgering B.M.

Akt has received widespread attention as an important anti-apoptotic protein through which various survival signals suppress cell death induced by growth factor withdrawal, cell cycle discordance, and detachment of cells from their extracellular matrix (17.Dudek H.

Several reports have shown that Akt can be activated by some stresses such as heat, hyperosmotic stress, H2O2, cadmium chloride (CdCl2), and sodium arsenite (24.Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M.

However, other studies have provided evidence that apoptosis-inducing stresses including ceramide, hyperosmotic stress, UVC, and ionizing radiation result in down-regulation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway (28.Zhou H.

Little is known regarding the mechanisms involved in altering Akt activity during stress or the functional significance of such changes in Akt activity. Indeed, the high concentrations of certain of the agents utilized to modulate Akt activity in many of the studies noted above raises concerns about the biologic relevance of the observations. In the present study we sought to explore the mechanisms involved in activation of Akt during the cellular response to oxidant injury and to determine its influence on cell survival. By using H2O2 as a model oxidant, we show that sub-millimolar concentrations lead to activation of Akt in a variety of cell types, and we further provide genetic, enzymatic, and pharmacological evidence indicating that this occurs through an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3-K-dependent signaling pathway. Most importantly, using various strategies to inhibit or enhance Akt activity, we present findings suggesting a pivotal role for the PI3-K/Akt pathway in promoting cell survival following oxidant injury. DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are that Akt is activated by biologically relevant doses of H2O2, that this activation occurs via an EGFR/PI3-K-dependent mechanism, and most importantly, that Akt provides a pro-survival signal that can protect cells against oxidative stress.Akt is an established downstream target of PI3-K following stimulation of cells with growth factors, and a role for Akt in promoting cell growth and protecting against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis is well established (17.Dudek H.

These studies identified a mRNA whose levels were highly induced in lipid-loaded macrophages. The mRNA encoded the human White protein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily of proteins. The mRNA levels of ABC8, the murine homolog of the human white gene, were also induced when a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was incubated with acetylated low density lipoprotein and sterols. Additional studies demonstrated that white/ABC8 mRNA levels were induced by specific oxysterols that included 25-, 20(S)-, and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and by a retinoid X receptor-specific ligand. Furthermore, the oxysterol-mediated induction of ABC8 expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages was dependent on the presence of the nuclear oxysterol receptors, liver X receptors (LXRs). Macrophages derived from mice lacking both LXRα and LXRβ failed to up-regulate the expression of ABC8 following incubation with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. Oxysterol-dependent induction of white/ABC8 mRNA was blocked by actinomycin D but not by cycloheximide treatment of cells. We conclude that thewhite and ABC8 genes are primary response genes that are transcriptionally activated by specific oxysterols and that this induction is mediated by the LXR subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. These data strongly support the hypothesis thatwhite/ABC8 has a role in cellular sterol homeostasis.

In the presence of oxidized or modified forms of LDL,1 these macrophages accumulate cytoplasmic lipid droplets that contain excess cholesteryl esters (1.Gerrity R.G. Am. J.

The latter cells are termed macrophage “foam” cells, because the lipid droplets give them a characteristic foamy appearance when viewed under the microscope (1.Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of monocyte/macrophages in the development of fatty streaks and the more advanced atherosclerotic lesions can be gauged from the effect of deletions or mutations of genes that are involved in either monocyte recruitment into the artery wall or their subsequent differentiation into macrophages. For example, mice defective in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (4.Gu L. Okada Y. Clinton S.K. Gerard C. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Rollins B.J. Mol.

Relatively little is known about the alterations in gene expression that occur when macrophages accumulate excess lipids to become macrophage foam cells. In previous attempts to identify such genes, macrophages were incubated with Ac-LDL to produce foam cells (8.Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid.

In other studies, Remaley et al.(10.Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Amouzadeh H.R. Brewer Jr., H.B. Hoeg J.M. J. Lipid.

However, the mechanism(s) involved in these induction processes is unknown. In other studies, macrophages that were lipid-loaded in the presence of inhibitors of acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase, so as to prevent the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, were shown to both accumulate unesterified cholesterol and to activate phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (11.Tabas I.

In contrast to the paucity of information available on the identification of lipid- or sterol-induced genes and the mechanisms involved in this process, the molecular mechanism by which excess cellular sterols repress gene expression is well established (18.Brown M.S.

Each ABC is composed of conserved Walker A and Walker B domains that are spaced by 90–120 amino acids and a “signature” motif just upstream of the Walker B domain (28.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev.

The oxidized LDL (>20 thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances/mg of protein) was dialyzed extensively, stored at 4 °C, and used within 10 days. Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by elutriation and plated on 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in the presence of 30% autologous serum, 0.22% insulin, antibiotics, and fungizone (49.Fogelman A.M.

On day 8, the medium was replaced with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% LPDS and mevalonic acid (100 μm) (medium A) in the presence of either mevinolin (5 μm) or Ac-LDL (100 μg/ml) and sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol (25 μm) and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (2.5 μm)). Cells incubated under these two conditions are referred to as unloaded or lipid-loaded, respectively. Where indicated, cells were incubated in medium A supplemented with either Ac-LDL, highly oxidized LDL, native LDL, specific oxysterols, cholesterol, LPS, or TNFα. The time of incubation (4–48 h) is indicated in the text or in the figure legend. Sterols were dissolved in ethanol and added to the cells at <1 μl/ml medium. An equivalent amount of ethanol was added to control dishes. RAW264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% LPDS and mevalonic acid (100 μm) (medium B) and either mevinolin (unloaded cells) or Ac-LDL and/or sterols (lipid-loaded cells), as indicated above for human macrophages and as stated in legends to Figures 5 and 7.Figure 7Murine ABC8 mRNA levels are induced by an RXR-specific ligand.

Lobaccaro and D. J. Mangelsdorf, manuscript in preparation. Genotyping of tail DNA was performed by Southern blot analysis and/or PCR to confirm LXR receptor status of mice used in these studies. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 4% thioglycolate solution three days prior to harvesting macrophages. To isolate macrophages, mice were sacrificed and ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 ml) was injected into the peritoneal cavity. This fluid was carefully withdrawn and spun down, and the cell pellet was resuspended in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were pooled from eight mice of each genotype and distributed on duplicate plates for each treatment, and the macrophages were allowed to adhere for at least 6 h. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% LPDS and mevalonic acid (100 μm) ± compactin (5 μm) or 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (10 μm) or 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (10 μm), and the cells were incubated for 42 h. Two independent experiments were performed that yielded the same results. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in lysis buffer (25 mmTris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100), and sonicated (two times for 10 s). Cholesteryl esters were quantitated using a minor modification of the method of Mehrabian et al. (51.Mehrabian M. Qiao J.-H. Hyman R. Ruddle D. Laughton C. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler.

Total RNA was isolated from unloaded or lipid-loaded human macrophages that had been incubated for 48 h in the absence or presence of Ac-LDL and sterols, as described above. The RNA was DNaseI-treated and reverse transcribed, and the PCR performed in the presence of [33P]dATP, the 3′-primer T11A, and different 5′-primers (AP1-AP24), as described (41.Tabor D.E. Kim J.B.

The PCR products were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and exposed to x-ray film for 20 h. Differentially displayed bands were eluted from the gel, reamplified by PCR, and subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) (41.Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J.

Ten μg of RNA was separated by 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the latter was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled DNA probes (41.Tabor D.E.

Transcript abundance was determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) standardized against GAPDH or cyclophilin, as indicated. For Fig. 6, the values were adjusted to define the wild-type, compactin-treated sample as 1 unit. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and the membrane was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled murine LXRα- or LXRβ-specific probes. We hypothesized that the conversion of macrophages to macrophage foam cells in the artery wall would be associated with increased expression of specific genes that would play an important role in the development of both fatty streaks and atherosclerotic lesions. To identify such genes, we isolated human monocytes from peripheral blood and allowed them to adhere to plastic dishes and differentiate into macrophages in the presence of medium containing autologous serum (49.Fogelman A.M. Elahi F. Sykes K. Van Lenten B.J. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid. Res. 1988; 29: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After one week, the cells were washed free of autologous serum and cultured for 8–48 h in medium supplemented with 10% LPDS and mevalonic acid in the absence (unloaded) or presence (lipid-loaded) of Ac-LDL and sterols, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1shows that the cholesteryl ester content of the cells increased dramatically during this time, consistent with the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets and the formation of foam cells (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from macrophages that had been unloaded or lipid-loaded for 48 h and used for mRNA differential display, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This latter technique identified a band of ∼630 bp that was expressed in lipid-loaded"

Similar to cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates are derived from amino acids and have aldoximes as intermediates. We report cloning and characterization of cytochrome P450 CYP79A2 involved in aldoxime formation in the glucosinolate-producing Arabidopsis thaliana L. The CYP79A2 cDNA was cloned by polymerase chain reaction, and CYP79A2 was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of the recombinant protein shows that CYP79A2 is an N-hydroxylase convertingl-phenylalanine into phenylacetaldoxime, the precursor of benzylglucosinolate. Transgenic A. thaliana constitutively expressing CYP79A2 accumulate high levels of benzylglucosinolate. CYP79A2 expressed in E. coli has a K mof 6.7 μmol liter−1 for l-phenylalanine. Neither l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan,l-methionine, nor dl-homophenylalanine are metabolized by CYP79A2, indicating that the enzyme has a narrow substrate specificity. CYP79A2 is the first enzyme shown to catalyze the conversion of an amino acid to the aldoxime in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates. Our data provide the first conclusive evidence that evolutionarily conserved cytochromes P450 catalyze this step common for the biosynthetic pathways of glucosinolates and cyanogenic glucosides. This strongly indicates that the biosynthesis of glucosinolates has evolved based on a cyanogenic predisposition.

Glucosinolates are found throughout the order Capparales, which includes agriculturally important crops of the Brassicaceae family such as oilseed rape and Brassica forages and vegetables, and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. Upon tissue damage, glucosinolates are rapidly hydrolyzed to biologically active degradation products by the thioglucosidase myrosinase (EC 3.2.3.1). Glucosinolates or rather their degradation products defend plants against insect and fungal attack (1.Fenwick G.R. Heaney R.K. Mullin W.J. Crit. Rev. Food. Sci. Nutr. 1983; 18: 123-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 2.Chew F.S. Cutler H.G. Biologically Active Natural Products. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1988: 155-181Google Scholar) and serve as attractants to insects that are specialized feeders on Brassicaceae (3.Stadler E. Entomol. Exp. Appl. 1978; 24: 711-720Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The degradation products have toxic as well as protective effects in higher animals and humans (1.Fenwick G.R. Heaney R.K. Mullin W.J. Crit. Rev. Food. Sci. Nutr. 1983; 18: 123-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Antinutritional effects such as growth retardation caused by consumption of large amounts of rape seed meal have an economic impact, as they restrict the use of this protein-rich animal feed. Anticarcinogenic activity has been documented by pharmacological studies for several degradation products of glucosinolates, e.g. for sulforaphane, a degradation product of 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate from broccoli sprouts (4.Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cho C.G. Posner G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2399-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Metabolic engineering of the biosynthetic pathways of glucosinolates would open the possibility to tissue-specifically regulate and optimize the level of individual glucosinolates to improve the nutritional value of a given crop. To date, more than 100 different glucosinolates have been identified. They are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolyl glucosinolates, depending on whether they are derived from aliphatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan. The amino acid often undergoes a series of chain elongations prior to entering the biosynthetic pathway, and the glucosinolate product is often subject to secondary modifications such as hydroxylations, methylations, and oxidations, giving rise to the structural diversity of glucosinolates.A. thaliana cv. Columbia has been shown to contain 23 different glucosinolates derived from tryptophan, the chain-elongated phenylalanine homologue homophenylalanine, and several chain-elongated methionine homologues (5.Hogge L.R. Reed D.W. Underhill E.W. Haughn G.W. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 26: 551-556Google Scholar). Although not many genes of the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway have been identified, many of the intermediates and some of the enzymes involved are known. In vivo biosynthetic studies have previously shown that N-hydroxyamino acids, aldoximes, thiohydroximates, and desulfoglucosinolates are precursors of glucosinolates (for review, see Ref. 6.Halkier B.A. Ikan R. Naturally Occurring Glycosides: Chemistry, Distribution and Biological Properties. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1999: 193-223Google Scholar). The enzymes catalyzing the last two steps in the pathway, UDPG:thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-) and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate:desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.-), have been purified and shown to be nonspecific with respect to the nature of the side chain (7.Glendening T.M.

Bull. 1968; 16: 1128-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The nature of the enzymes catalyzing the conversion of amino acids to aldoximes has been the subject of many discussions. Independent biochemical studies have indicated that three different enzyme systems are involved in this step, namely cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, flavin-containing monooxygenases, and peroxidases (12.Du L. Halkier B.A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 425-431Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).

Biol. 1998; 38: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but their function has never been determined. In the present paper, we report cloning and functional expression of the cytochrome P450 CYP79A2 from A. thaliana. We show that CYP79A2 catalyzes the conversion ofl-phenylalanine to phenylacetaldoxime and that transgenicA. thaliana expressing CYP79A2 under control of CaMV35S1 promoter accumulate high levels of benzylglucosinolate. Our data are consistent with the involvement of CYP79A2 in the biosynthesis of benzylglucosinolate inA. thaliana. The following PCR primers (Fig. 1) were designed from the genomic CYP79A2 sequence (GenBank accession no. AB010692; Arabidopsis thaliana L. cv. Columbia) (added restriction sites are underlined, sequence encoding CYP17A is indicated by italics): A2F1 (5′-GTGCATATGCTTGACTCCACCCCAATG), A2R1 (5′-ATGCATTTTTCTAGTAATCTTTACGCTC), A2F2 (5′-CGTGAATTCCATATGCTCGCGTTTATTATAGGTTTGC), A2R2 (5′-CGGAAGCTTATTAGGTTGGATACACATGT), A2R3 (5′-CGTCACTTGTGCTTTGATCTCTTC), A2F3 (5′-GAACTAATGTTGGCGACGGTTGAT), A2FX1 (5′-CGTGAATTCCATATG GCTCTGTTATTAGCAGTTTTTCTCGCGTTTATTATAGGTTTG), A2FX2 (5′-CGTGAATTCCATATG GCTCTGTTATTAGCAGTTTTTCTTCTTCTTGCATTAACTATG), A2R4 (5′-CATCTCGAGTCTTCTTCCACTGCTCTCCTT), A2FX3 (5′-TTAATCGGAAACCTACC). In addition, the following primers were used: 17AF (5′-CGTGAATTCCATATG GCTCTGTTATTAGCTGTT), A1R (5′-GGGCCACGGCACGGGACC). PCR was performed on phage DNA representing 2.5 × 107 plaque-forming units of theA. thaliana L. (cv. Wassilewskija) silique cDNA library CD4–12 (kindly provided by Dr. Linda A. Castle and Dr. David W. Meinke, Department of Botany, Oklohoma State University, Stillwater, OK, and ABRC) using primers A2F1/A2R1. PCR reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl in Expand HF buffer with 1.5 mmMgCl2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) supplemented with 200 μm dNTPs, 50 pmol of each primer, and 5% (v/v) Me2SO. After incubation of the reactions at 97 °C for 3 min, 2.6 units of Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added and 35 cycles of 90 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 65 °C, 120 s at 70 °C were run. 0.5 μl of the reaction were subjected to nested PCR with primers A2F2/A2R2 using the same PCR conditions. PCR fragments of the expected size were excised from an agarose gel and cloned intoEcoRI/HindIII-digested pYX223 (R&D Systems), and the inserts of 10 clones derived from two nested PCR reactions were sequenced. Sequencing was performed using a Thermo Sequence fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (7-deaza-dGTP) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and analyzed on an ALF-Express DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence computer analysis was done with programs of the GCG Wisconsin sequence analysis package. The GAP program was used with a gap creation penalty of 8 and a gap extension penalty of 2 to compare pairs of sequences. The splice site prediction was done using NetPlantGene (26.Hebsgaard S.M. Korning P.G. Tolstrup N. Engelbrecht J. Rouze P. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3439-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Expression constructs were derived from a CYP79A2 cDNA, which had been obtained by fusion of the two CYP79A2 exons generated from genomic DNA of Arabidopsis thaliana L. The two exons were amplified by PCR with primers A2F2/A2R3 and A2F3/A2R2, respectively, using 1.25 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 4 μg of template DNA. PCR reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl in Pwo polymerase PCR buffer with 2 mm MgSO4 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) supplemented with 200 μm dNTPs, 50 pmol of each primer, and 5 (v/v) % Me2SO. After incubation of the reactions at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 PCR cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C were run. After digestion of the PCR fragments with EcoRI (exon 1) and HindIII (exon 2), the blunt ends generated with primers A2R3 and A2F3 andPwo polymerase were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The two exons were then ligated intoEcoRI/HindIII-digested pYX223. The cloned cDNA was sequenced to exclude incorporation of PCR errors. Four expression constructs (Fig. 2) were made in the expression vector pSP19g10L (Ref. 27.Barnes H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Henry Barnes, Synthetic Genetics/Immune Complex Inc., San Diego, CA): 79A2 (“native”), 17A(1–8)79A2 (“modified”), 17A(1–8)79A2Δ(1–8)(“truncated-modified”), and 17A(1–8)79A1(25–74)79A2Δ(1–40) (“chimeric”) (79A2: CYP79A2; 17A(1–8): modified N terminus of CYP17A, MALLLAVF (Ref. 28.Barnes H. Arlotto M.P. Watermann M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar); 79A1(25–74): amino acids 25–74 of CYP79A1 (Ref. 22.Koch B. Sibbesen O. Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). The N-terminal modifications were introduced by generating PCR fragments from the ATG start codon to the PstI site of the CYP79A2 cDNA (Fig. 1). These fragments were ligated with the PstI/HindIII fragment of theCYP79A2 cDNA (Fig. 1) andEcoRI/HindIII-digested pYX223. For the modified and the truncated modified CYP79A2, primers A2FX1/A2R4 and A2FX2/A2R4, respectively, were used. The fusion with the N terminus of CYP79A1 was made by blunt-end ligation of a PCR fragment generated from theCYP79A1Δ(1–25) bov cDNA (29.Halkier B.A. Nielsen H. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with primers 17AF/A1R with a PCR fragment generated from the CYP79A2cDNA with primers A2FX3/A2R4. PCR products were cloned and sequenced to exclude incorporation of PCR errors. The differentCYP79A2 cDNAs were excised from pYX223 by digestion withNdeI and HindIII and ligated intoNdeI/HindIII-digested pSP19g10L. E. coli cells of strain JM109 transformed with the expression constructs were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1ampicillin and used to inoculate 100 ml of modified TB medium containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 1 mmthiamine, 75 μg ml−1 δ-aminolevulinic acid, and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (28.Barnes H. Arlotto M.P. Watermann M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 28 °C for 65 h at 125 rpm. Cells from 75 ml of culture were pelleted and resuspended in buffer composed of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 100 μg ml−1. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, magnesium acetate was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Spheroplasts were pelleted, resuspended in 5 ml of buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mm magnesium acetate, and 60 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.4, and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After DNase and RNase treatment, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 29%. Temperature-induced Triton X-114 phase partitioning was performed as described previously (29.Halkier B.A. Nielsen H. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Triton X-114-rich phase was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fe2+·COversus Fe2+ difference spectroscopy (30.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed on 100 μl of E. coli spheroplasts resuspended in 900 μl of buffer containing 50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and a few grains of sodium dithionite. The solubilizate was distributed between two cuvettes, and a base line was recorded between 400 and 500 nm on a SLM Aminco DW-2000 TM spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). The sample cuvette was flushed with CO for 1 min, and the difference spectrum was recorded. The amount of functional cytochrome P450 was estimated, based on an absorption coefficient of 91 l mmol−1 cm−1. The activity of CYP79A2 was measured in E. coli spheroplasts reconstituted with NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase purified from Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench as described previously (21.Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3506-3511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In a typical enzyme assay, 5 μl of spheroplasts and 4 μl of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (equivalent to 0.04 units defined as 1 μmol of cytochrome c min−1) were incubated with 3.3 μml-[U-14C]phenylalanine (453 mCi mmol−1) in buffer containing 30 mmKPi, pH 7.5, 4 mm NADPH, 3 mmreduced glutathione, 0.042% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1 mg ml−1l-α-dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine in a total volume of 30 μl. To study substrate specificity, 3.7 μml-[U-14C]tyrosine (449 mCi mmol−1), 0.1 mml-[methyl-14C]methionine (56 mCi mmol−1), and 1 mml-[5-3H]tryptophan (33 Ci mmol−1), respectively, were used instead ofl-[U-14C]phenylalanine. After incubation at 26 °C for 4 h, half of the reaction mixture was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 F254 sheets (Merck) using toluene:ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) as eluent. Radioactive bands (14C) were visualized and quantified by STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Radioactive bands (3H) were visualized by autoradiography. Product formation from l-[U-14C]phenylalanine was linear with time within the first 2 h of incubation as determined using time points 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 6 h. For estimation of K m and V maxvalues, reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 26 °C. For GC-MS analysis, 450 μl of reaction mixture containing 33 μml-phenylalanine (Sigma) or 33 μm homophenylalanine were incubated for 4 h at 26 °C and extracted twice with a total volume of 600 μl of chloroform (Normapur, May and Baker). The organic phases were combined and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform and analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed on an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph directly coupled to a Jeol JMS-AX505W mass spectrometer. An SGE column (BPX5, 25 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness) was used (head pressure 100 kilopascals, splitless injection). The oven temperature program was as follows: 80 °C for 3 min, 80 °C to 180 °C at 5 °C min−1, 180 °C to 300 °C at 20 °C min−1, 300 °C for 10 min. The ion source was run in EI mode (70 eV) at 200 °C. The retention times of the (E)- and (Z)-isomers of phenylacetaldoxime were 12.43 and 13.06 min. The two isomers had identical fragmentation patterns withm/z 135, 117, and 91 as the most prominent peaks. Radiolabeled amino acids were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Homophenylalanine and 3-phenylpropanaldoxime were kindly provided by Prof. John A. Pickett (IACR Rothamsted, Rothamsted, United Kingdom), and phenylacetaldoxime (mixture of the (E)- and (Z)-isomers) was a gift from Dr. Jens Lykkesfeldt (KVL, Copenhagen, Denmark). A. thaliana L. cv. Columbia was used for all experiments. Plants were grown in a controlled-environment Arabidopsis Chamber (Percival AR-60 I, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol of photons m−2 s−1, 20 °C, and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h for plants used for transformation and 8 h for plants used for biochemical analysis. For expression of CYP79A2 under control of the CaMV35S promoter inA. thaliana, the native full-length CYP79A2cDNA was introduced into EcoRI/KpnI-digested pRT101 (31.Töpfer R. Matzeit V. Gronenborn B. Schell J. Steinbiss H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) via several subcloning steps. The expression cassette was excised by HindIII digestion and transferred to pPZP111 (32.Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (33.Zambryski P. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) transformed with this construct was used for plant transformation by floral dip (34.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.005% (v/v) Silwet L-77 and 5% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm MgCl2. Seeds were germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin, 2% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.9% (w/v) agar. Transformants were selected after 2 weeks and transferred to soil. Rosette leaves (five to eight leaves of different age from each plant) were harvested from 6-week-old plants (nine transgenic plants and three wild-type plants), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried for 48 h. Desulfoglucosinolates were analyzed as described in Ref. 35.Sørensen H. Shahidi F. Canola and Rapeseed: Production, Chemistry, Nutrition and Processing Technology. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1990: 149-172Crossref Google Scholar. Briefly, freeze-dried material (2–5 mg) was homogenized in 3.5 ml of boiling 70% (v/v) methanol by a Polytron homogenizer for 1 min, 10 μl of internal standard (5 mm p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate; Bioraf Denmark) were added, and homogenization was continued for another 1 min. Plant material was pelleted, and the pellet was re-extracted with 3.5 ml of boiling 70% (v/v) methanol for 1 min using a Polytron homogenizer. Plant material was pelleted, washed in 3.5 ml of 70% (v/v) methanol, and centrifuged. The supernatants were pooled and loaded on a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated as follows; 25 mg of DEAE-Sephadex A-25 were swollen overnight in 1 ml of 0.5 macetate buffer, pH 5, packed into a 5-ml pipette tip, and washed with 1 ml of water. The plant extract was loaded, and the column was washed with 2 ml of 70% (v/v) methanol, 2 ml of water, and 0.5 ml of 0.02m acetate buffer, pH 5. Helix pomatia sulfatase (type H-1, Sigma; 0.1 ml, 2.5 mg ml−1 in 0.02m acetate buffer, pH 5) were applied, and the column was left at room temperature for 16 h. Elution was carried out with 2 ml of water. The eluate was dried in vacuo, the residue dissolved in 150 μl of water, and 100 μl were subjected to HPLC on a Shimadzu LC-10A Tvp equipped with a Supelcosil LC-ABZ 59142 C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 mm; Supelco) and a SPD-M10AVP photodiode array detector (Shimadzu). The flow rate was 1 ml min−1. Elution with water for 2 min was followed by elution with a linear gradient from 0% to 60% methanol in water (48 min), a linear gradient from 60% to 100% methanol in water (3 min), and with 100% methanol (3 min). The assignment of peaks was based on retention times and UV spectra compared with standard compounds. Glucosinolates were quantified in relation to the internal standard and by use of the response factors as described previously (36.Buchner R. Wathelet J.P. Glucosinolates in Rapeseed: Analytical Aspects. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1987: 50-58Google Scholar, 37.Haughn G.W. Davin L. Giblin M. Underhill E.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the analysis of rosette leaves, the term “total glucosinolate content” refers to the molar amount of the five major glucosinolates (4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, 4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate, 8-methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate, indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, and 4-methoxyindol-3-ylglucosinolate), which account for 85% of the glucosinolate content in rosette leaves of wild-type A. thaliana (37.Haughn G.W. Davin L. Giblin M. Underhill E.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and benzylglucosinolate. The glucosinolate content of seeds harvested from T1 plants 10, 13, and 14 was analyzed and compared with the glucosinolate content of wild-type seeds. Twelve to thirty milligrams of seeds were extracted and subjected to HPLC analysis as described above (with the exception that lyophilization of the tissue was omitted). In the analysis of seeds, the term total glucosinolate content refers to the molar amount of the 10 major glucosinolates (3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate, 4-hydroxybutylglucosinolate, 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, 4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate, 8-methylsulfinyloctylglucosinolate, 7-methylthioheptylglucosinolate, 8-methylthiooctylglucosinolate, indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, 3-benzoyloxypropylglucosinolate, and 4-benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate), which account for more than 90% of the glucosinolate content in seeds of wild-type A. thaliana(37.Haughn G.W. Davin L. Giblin M. Underhill E.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and benzylglucosinolate. CYP79A2 (GenBank accession no. AB010692 (11,000–13,200 region)) is one of severalCYP79 homologues identified in the genome of A. thaliana. According to a computer-aided splice site prediction (26.Hebsgaard S.M. Korning P.G. Tolstrup N. Engelbrecht J. Rouze P. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3439-3452Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), CYP79A2 contains one intron. This intron, which is characteristic for A-type cytochromes P450 (38.Paquette, S. M., Bak, S., and Feyereisen, R. (2000) DNA Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar), is shared by all members of the CYP79 family known to date. Although it is the only intron in CYP79A2, CYP79B2 andCYP79B3, other members of the CYP79 family have one or two additional introns. This may suggest that CYP79A2is one of the ancient members of the family. Using a PCR approach, we have isolated a full-length CYP79A2 cDNA from anA. thaliana silique cDNA library. The sequence of the cDNA confirmed the splice site prediction (Fig.1). The reading frame of theCYP79A2 cDNA has two potential ATG start codons, one positioned 15 base pairs downstream of a stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region and another one 15 base pairs further downstream. We have used a cDNA starting with the second ATG codon for all further studies. This cDNA encodes a protein of 523 amino acids, which has 64% similarity and 53% identity to CYP79A1 involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin (22.Koch B. Sibbesen O. Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of a full-length CYP79A2 cDNA from the silique cDNA library required a total of 70 PCR cycles resulting in incorporation of PCR errors. PCR errors at different positions were verified by sequencing of 10 different cloned PCR products, each of which contained at least a single PCR error. Consequently, these cDNAs were not suitable for expression of the protein. PCR amplification of fragments of the CYP79A2 cDNA from theA. thaliana λPRL2 cDNA library (CD4–7 (Ref. 39.D'Alessio J.M. Bebee R. Hartley J.L. Noon M.C. Polayes D. Focus. 1992; 14: 76-79Google Scholar), kindly provided by ABRC) and an A. thaliana whole plant library (Stratagene, 937010) was unsuccessful. This may indicate that the CYP79A2 mRNA is expressed at very low levels. An alternative approach, in which the two exons of the CYP79A2gene were directly PCR-amplified from genomic DNA by relatively few PCR cycles, was applied to clone the CYP79A2 cDNA for protein expression. The property of Pwo polymerase not to add nucleotides to the ends of the PCR product enabled blunt end"
https://openalex.org/W2076233716,"The extracellular domains of many proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, receptors, and adhesion molecules, are proteolytically released from cells, a process termed “shedding.” Tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) is a metalloprotease-disintegrin that sheds tumor necrosis factor-α and other proteins. To study the regulation of TACE-mediated shedding, we examined the effects of stimulation of cells on TACE localization and expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a punctate distribution of TACE on the surface of untreated cells, and stimulation of monocytic cells with lipopolysaccharide did not affect TACE staining. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent inducer of shedding, decreased cell-surface staining for TACE. Surface biotinylation experiments confirmed and extended this observation; PMA decreased the half-life of surface-biotinylated TACE without increasing the turnover of total cell-surface proteins. Soluble fragments of TACE were not detected in the medium of cells that had down-regulated TACE, and TACE was not down-regulated when endocytosis was inhibited. Antibody uptake experiments suggested that cell-surface TACE was internalized in response to PMA. Surprisingly, a metalloprotease inhibitor prevented the PMA-induced turnover of TACE. Thus, PMA activates shedding and causes the down-regulation of a major “sheddase,” suggesting that induced shedding may be regulated by a mechanism that decreases the amount of active TACE on the cell surface.

Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). TACE (ADAM-17) is a member of the ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) family of metalloprotease-disintegrins. It was originally identified by its ability to cleave transmembrane proTNF-α resulting in the release of mature, soluble TNF-α from cells (10.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies using mice and cell lines lacking TACE activity implicated TACE in the shedding of transforming growth factor-α, L-selectin, and the p75 TNF-receptor (9.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Both ADAM-10 and TACE may also participate in the α-secretase processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (12.Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 13.Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J.

Another ADAM, ADAM-9 (meltrin-γ, MDC9), has recently been suggested to mediate the shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) (14.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Kuzbanian, the Drosophilahomolog of mammalian ADAM-10, is thought to release the Notch ligand Delta from cells (15.Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and may also be required for proteolytic cleavage of Notch itself (16.Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, ADAM proteins containing functional metalloprotease domains may constitute a family of sheddases that regulate plasma membrane composition and release soluble signaling molecules and receptors from cells. The mechanisms by which shedding is regulated are poorly understood. Many shedding events are induced by phorbol esters (1.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for protein kinase C (PKC). However, a number of metalloprotease-mediated shedding events induced by other stimuli are insensitive to PKC inhibitors, indicating that there are multiple signaling pathways capable of inducing the shedding of a particular molecule (17.Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18.Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1969-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is not generally known whether induced shedding events occur via an activation or mobilization of metalloproteases or via some alteration in the conformation or localization of substrates. PKCδ associates with the cytoplasmic domain of MDC9 and is required for phorbol ester-induced, MDC9-mediated HB-EGF shedding in Vero cells, suggesting that PKC may directly activate ADAMs in response to phorbol esters (14.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast, L-selectin shedding can be induced by cross-linking of L-selectin molecules (20.Palecanda A. Walcheck B. Bishop D.K. Jutila M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1279-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or by treatment of cells with calmodulin inhibitors, which are thought to antagonize the function of calmodulin molecules associated with the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin (21.Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, induced shedding occurs even if the cytoplasmic domain of the substrate has been deleted entirely (22.Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev E.E. Batkin M. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32488-32496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24.Cheng H.J.

Shedding enzymes are also thought to be regulated by naturally occurring inhibitors. ADAM proteins are synthesized as pro-enzymes. The N-terminal pro-domain is thought to maintain the metalloprotease in a catalytically inactive state via a cysteine-switch mechanism until it is removed by proteolysis (30.Loechel F. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13427-13433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, posttranslational processing of ADAMs may regulate activity. In addition, purified TACE is inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-3 (TIMP-3) (32.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and TIMP-3 can inhibit a number of shedding events (33.Hargreaves P.G. Wang F. Antcliff J. Murphy G. Lawry J. Russell R.G. Croucher P.I. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 101: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34.Smith M.R. Kung H. Durum S.K. Colburn N.H. Sun Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2810-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly, TIMP-1 can partially inhibit the shedding of an alkaline phosphatase-HB-EGF fusion protein (17.Dethlefsen S.M. Raab G. Moses M.A. Adam R.M. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Presumably, other sheddases can be similarly regulated, suggesting that an interplay between stimulatory and inhibitory regulators determines the shedding activity of a given cell. In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which TACE-mediated shedding events are activated, we examined the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) on the localization and abundance of cell-surface TACE. LPS treatment of monocytic cells appeared to have no effect on TACE expression or localization. Surprisingly, TACE was down-regulated in cells treated with PMA. This down-regulation occurred via the internalization and degradation of TACE molecules; TACE appeared quite stable in untreated cells. The PMA-induced internalization and degradation of TACE was inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor, and the processed form of TACE was preferentially down-regulated in response to PMA, suggesting that inducible shedding events may be under feedback regulation. THP-1 and Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Monoclonal antibody M220 was raised from a mouse immunized with recombinantly expressed human TACE extracellular domain (containing the catalytic and disintegrin/cysteine-rich regions) fused to the human IgG1 Fc region (10.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). The P1 polyclonal antiserum was from a rabbit immunized with the same recombinant human TACE extracellular domain-Fc fusion protein. The crude P1 antiserum was affinity-purified as described (36.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) on a column of immobilized recombinant human TACE extracellular domain. The P7 antiserum was from a rabbit immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 19–31 of human TACE (RPPDDPGFGPHQR, within the pro domain of TACE). The mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human L-selectin was purchased from R&D Systems. Fluorescently conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Recombinant TACE extracellular domain (containing both catalytic and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains) was purified from supernatants of Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been transfected with a plasmid encoding amino acids 1–670 of human TACE. The purified protein consisted primarily of processed material (lacking the pro-domain). The expression and purification of recombinant TACE catalytic domain has been described (37.Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R. Petersen M. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. March C.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). A protein containing the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain of TACE (residues 478–671 of human TACE) fused to human IgG1 Fc was purified from the supernatants of transfected COS cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were purchased from Sigma. Paraformaldehyde stock solution (16%) was purchased from EM Sciences. Immunex compound 3 (IC-3) was prepared at Immunex Corp. (10.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Recombinant TACE extracellular domain, catalytic domain, and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain-Fc fusion protein were separated on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels and Western-blotted by standard methods onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The blots were blocked with a solution of 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The M220 monoclonal antibody and affinity-purified P1 polyclonal antibodies were each used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. The blots were then washed three times for 5 min with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) as appropriate. After four more washes, the blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). THP-1 or Jurkat cells treated as indicated were pelleted at 200 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 5% serum and incubated for 15 min on ice. For THP-1 cells, heat-inactivated human serum was used as a blocking agent to saturate Fc receptors; goat serum was used to block Jurkat cells, which were not as susceptible to nonspecific staining. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in primary antibody diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in blocking solution, and incubated for 30 min on ice. In some experiments, soluble TACE extracellular domain was used as a competitor at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml in the primary antibody solution. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, fixed in a solution of 3.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies diluted to 5 μg/ml in PBS containing 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with gentle mixing. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were either mounted on chambered coverslips (Nalge Nunc International) in a solution of 50% glycerol in PBS or on standard microscope slides using ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Samples were viewed and images acquired on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon/Molecular Dynamics) using a 60× objective and appropriate filters. Cells from cultures treated as indicated were pelleted for 5 min at 200 × g, washed three times with ice-cold PBS C/M (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mmCaCl2), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml d-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in PBS C/M, pH 8.4. The cells were then washed 3 times with an ice-cold solution of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl. Depending on the experiment, the biotinylated cells were then either lysed immediately or returned to culture medium and incubated as indicated. Lysates were prepared from pelleted cells by resuspending the cells in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μmleupeptin (Sigma) and incubating on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Normalized amounts of total protein (typically 200 μg) were used as input for each immunoprecipitation. Lysates were incubated with 5 μg of antibody/sample for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then collected on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing, after which the beads were washed four times with immune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing protease inhibitors as above. The washed beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE on pre-cast gels (Novex). Following electrophoresis, Western transfers onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) were performed by standard methods, and biotinylated proteins were detected by probing blots with streptavidin conjugated to either HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or alkaline phosphatase (Molecular Probes). Blots probed with HRP conjugates were visualized using ECL reagents and exposure to x-ray film. Blots probed with alkaline phosphatase conjugates were developed using enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were scanned on a Storm scanner (Molecular Dynamics) in blue fluorescence mode. Jurkat cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were pelleted and resuspended in culture medium lacking serum at a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml PMA. To estimate the loss of soluble TACE during the culture period and subsequent preparation of the culture supernatants, purified recombinant TACE extracellular domain protein was added to the culture medium of some samples. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were pelleted and lysates were prepared in ice-cold immune precipitation buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm pepstatin A, 10 μmleupeptin, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma), and 25 μm IC-3. The culture supernatants were concentrated approximately 25-fold using Centricon-10 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon). Equivalent fractions of the cell lysates and culture supernatants were separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted as above. To estimate the sensitivity of the blots, 1:3 serial dilutions of lysates of untreated cells were prepared in non-reducing sample buffer and analyzed in parallel to treated samples and culture supernatants. The blots were probed with the affinity-purified P1 antibodies diluted to 0.1 μg/ml or with a 1:5000 dilution of the P7 polyclonal antiserum as described above for characterization of anti-TACE antibodies. Jurkat cells were incubated in culture medium or hypertonic culture medium (culture medium with sucrose added to a final concentration of 450 mm) in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml PMA and 25 μm IC-3 as indicated. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were pelleted, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against L-selectin or an isotype-matched control antibody diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS containing 5% goat serum. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were pelleted and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. They were then fixed and reacted with secondary antibodies as described above for immunofluorescence detection of TACE. The final stained cell preparations were resuspended in PBS and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. HeLa cells were plated onto glass coverslips 2 days prior to each experiment. THP-1 cells were grown and treated in suspension. On the day of the experiment, the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 100 ng/ml PMA and 5 μg/ml anti-TACE M220 or an isotype-matched control antibody as indicated. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, washed once with PBS, and fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by a 10-min incubation in −20 °C methanol. Residual paraformaldehyde was quenched by incubation in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and processed for microscopy as described above. For measurement of transferrin uptake, cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml BODIPY-FL transferrin (Molecular Probes), diluted in RPMI 1640 medium lacking serum for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, once with ice-cold mild acid wash buffer (50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 280 mm sucrose), and once more with ice-cold PBS. They were next fixed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry as above. For measurement of fluid-phase endocytosis, Jurkat cells were incubated with 40-kDa lysine-fixable fluorescein-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes) diluted to 500 μg/ml in culture medium containing 100 ng/ml PMA and 25 μm IC-3 as indicated. After 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were pelleted and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then fixed with 3.2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, pelleted and resuspended in PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of TACE were raised in mice and rabbits immunized with a recombinant TACE extracellular domain-human IgG1 Fc fusion protein. To further characterize the resulting antibodies, we examined their specificity on Western blots of recombinantly expressed fragments of TACE. Fig.1 A shows the domain structure of TACE. Western blots of recombinant proteins containing the catalytic domain (cat only), the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain (dis only), or both domains (cat+dis) were probed with the anti-TACE antibodies (Fig.1 B). The M220 monoclonal antibody detected the recombinant catalytic domain plus disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain protein and the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain protein alone, but not the catalytic domain protein alone. Thus, M220 recognizes an epitope within the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain of TACE. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum designated P1 recognized all three recombinant proteins. Therefore, this polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies that recognize epitopes within both the catalytic and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains of TACE. We next used THP-1 cells to evaluate the reactivity of the anti-TACE antibodies toward cellular forms of TACE. M220 and P1 each recognized processed and unprocessed forms of TACE on Western blots of THP-1 cell lysates (Fig. 1 C, cell lysates). Unprocessed forms of TACE (containing the pro-domain) were identified by probing Western blots with P7, a polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the pro-domain of TACE. M220 and P1 also immunoprecipitated both processed and unprocessed forms of TACE (Fig.1 D). However, only the processed form of TACE was detected when immunoprecipitates of surface-biotinylated cells were probed with streptavidin-HRP conjugates, regardless of the precipitating antibody used (Fig. 1 D). Therefore, M220 and P1 recognize unprocessed and processed forms of TACE, but only processed TACE is detectable on the surface of cells, as has been suggested previously (10.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). We next used THP-1 cells to evaluate the utility of the M220 antibody for immunofluorescence detection of cell-surface TACE. The antibody produced a punctate pattern of staining on the surface of THP-1 cells (Fig. 1 E, left panel). This pattern of staining was not observed with an isotype-matched control antibody (Fig. 1 E, middle panel), and including excess soluble TACE as a competitor in the primary antibody reaction effectively blocked the cell-surface staining (Fig. 1 E,right panel). Therefore, M220 appears to specifically detect TACE on the surface of cells. To begin to address"

https://openalex.org/W2032093848,"Extracellular interactions of plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa) with tissue factor (TF) on cell surfaces trigger the intracellular signaling events. At present, it is unclear how these signals influence phenotype. To elucidate this, we have used cDNA microarray technology to examine changes in transcriptional program in human fibroblasts in response to exposure to FVIIa. cDNA microarrays revealed that FVIIa binding to TF up-regulated the expression of Cyr61 and CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), the genes that encode extracellular matrix signaling proteins Cyr61 and CTGF, respectively. Northern blot analysis confirmed that FVIIa binding to TF markedly increased the expression ofCyr61 and CTGF in a time- and dose-dependent manner. FVIIa catalytic activity is required for the gene induction. In addition to FVIIa, thrombin also induced the expression of Cyr61 and CTGF. Hirudin abolished the thrombin-induced expression of these mRNAs but not the FVIIa-induced expression. FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61appears not to involve the currently known protease-activated receptors (PARs), whereas thrombin-induced expression involves the activation of PAR1 and possibly an additional PAR. Various intracellular signaling pathway inhibitors exhibited different inhibitory pattern on FVIIa and thrombin-induced up-regulation of Cyr61.

Cyr61 and CTGF could act as downstream mediators of FVIIa·TF in affecting various biological processes. factor VIIa tissue factor active site-inactivated factor VIIa factor Xa connective tissue growth factor mitogen-activated protein tick anticoagulant protein protease-activated receptor The primary function of plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa),1 upon its binding to TF on the cell surface, is to initiate blood coagulation (1.Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). However, a number of recent studies suggest that FVIIa binding to TF influences an array of important biological functions other than coagulation, such as angiogenesis (2.Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Curr.

At present, it is unclear how FVIIa·TF contributes to these biological processes. Recent studies have shown that FVIIa binding to TF induces various intracellular signals (7.Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8.Prydz H.S. Camerer E. Rottingen J. Wiiger M.T. Gjernes E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cumulative data so far suggest that FVIIa·TF mediates cell signaling by two distinct mechanisms, TF cytoplasmic domain-dependent (independent of the proteolytic activity of FVIIa) and FVIIa·TF proteolytic activity-dependent (independent of the cytoplasmic domain of TF) (7.Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A growing number of recent reports suggest that the later mechanism is a predominant mechanism. For example, binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF was shown to induce intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in a number of TF expressing cells (9.Rottingen J.A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J.

Furthermore, specific inhibitors for FXa and/or thrombin failed to inhibit the FVIIa-induced signal transduction (12.Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sorensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C.

At present, it is unclear how various intracellular signals induced by proteolytically active FVIIa contribute to pathophysiological functions, such as angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Studies have shown that the FVIIa·TF complex has a strong effect on migration of cultured smooth muscle cells (17.Sato Y. Asada Y. Marutsuka K. Hatakeyama K. Kamikubo Y. Sumiyoshi A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and pancreatic cancer cells (15.Taniguchi T. Kakkar A.K. Tuddenham E. Williamson R. Lemoine N.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4461-4467PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of FVIIa was essential for the increased cell migration in these cells. In preliminary studies, Seigbahn et al. (18.Siegbahn, A., Johnell, M., Rorsman, C., Heldin, C., and Ronnstrand, L. (1999) Thromb. Haemostasis (suppl.), 505Google Scholar) showed that incubation of fibroblasts with FVIIa reduces the platelet-derived growth factor concentration required to stimulate fibroblast migration by a 100-fold. Overall, all of the above data suggest that a signaling cascade involving the proteolytic function of FVIIa can result in phenotypic changes that are crucial for angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. However, so far, no clear connection has been established among the various FVIIa-induced intracellular changes. Furthermore, it is yet to be shown how FVIIa-induced intracellular changes lead to phenotypic changes. One possibility is that FVIIa could induce the expression of growth regulators that act downstream to induce cellular processes. To investigate the above possibility, in the present study, we have examined alterations in gene expression in human fibroblasts in response to FVIIa using cDNA microarray technology. Our data reveal that the cellular expression of only very few genes was detectably altered in fibroblasts upon exposure to FVIIa. Further studies confirmed that FVIIa up-regulated the expression of two related genes,Cyr61 and CTGF , which are growth factor-inducible immediate early genes, the products of which were shown to promote cell adhesion, augment growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, and stimulate cell migration in fibroblasts and endothelial cells (19.Lau L.F. Lam S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). A fibroblast cell line derived from normal embryonic lung tissue (WI-38, obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (GLUTAMAX with high glucose from Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Herndon, VA), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and 1%l-glutamine (BioWhittaker). When the cells reached about 80% confluency, the serum containing growth medium was removed and the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20–24 h to make the cells quiescent. Recombinant human FVIIa, a gift from Novo Nordisk (Gentofte, Denmark), was reconstituted in sterile water at a concentration of 1–1.3 mg/ml. The stock FVIIa solutions were checked for contaminating trace levels of endotoxin using limulus amebocyte lysate (BioWhittaker), and none was detected (detection level, 30 pg). Active site-inactivated factor FVIIa was prepared by incubating recombinant human FVIIa with a peptidyl inhibitor,d-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone, as described earlier (20.Sorensen B.B.

Human factor VII was purified as described earlier (21.Rao L.V.M. Bajaj S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Factor VII preparations contained 0.03–0.4% (w/w) FVIIa in them. Human plasma FXa was purified as described previously (22.Rao L.V.M. Robinson T. Hoang A.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Recombinant tick anticoagulant protein (TAP) was kindly provided by George Vlasuk (Corvas, San Diego, CA) and recombinant hirudin was obtained from either Sigma or Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Preparation of monospecific, polyclonal rabbit anti-human TF IgG was described earlier (23.Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Res. 1988; 51: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti-human factor X antiserum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with purified homogenous human factor X and IgG fractions from the antisera were obtained by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate saturation followed by DEAE-Affi-Gel-Blue chromatography. WI-38 cells were cultured to 80% confluency in T-75 flasks and serum-deprived for 24 h to cause them to enter the quiescent state as described above. The culture medium was replaced with fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2) and allowed to stabilize for 2 h in tissue culture incubator. Then, the cells were treated with a control medium or the medium supplemented with recombinant FVIIa (5 μg/ml, 100 nm) for 90 min at 37 °C in a culture incubator. At the end of 90 min of treatment, total RNA was isolated from the control and FVIIa-treated cells using TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A) RNA was purified by a double pass over Oligo Tex mRNA isolation columns as described in manufacturer's technical bulletin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eight hundred ng of highly purified poly(A) RNA from the control and FVIIa-treated cells were sent for cDNA microarray analysis service (UniGEM Human V microarray, Genome Systems Inc, St. Louis, MO). Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent from quiescent monolayers of WI-38 cells that were exposed to FVIIa and other materials as described under “Results.” Northern blot analysis was carried out using a standard procedure. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose/6% formaldehyde gels and transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane by a capillary blot method. Northern blots were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h with a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll, 5 mmEDTA, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin before hybridizing with either 32P-labeledCyr61 or CTGF cDNA probes (106cpm/ml) in the same solution for overnight. The hybridized membranes were exposed to either DuPont NEF or Fuji RX x-ray film. For quantification purposes, the membranes were exposed to phosphor screens for 1–4 h, and the exposed screens were analyzed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using Image-Quant NT software. The units (counts) obtained in various treatments were normalized to counts present in control-treated sample and/or counts present in a positive control, such as FVIIa-treated cells. 125I-FVIIa binding to cell surface TF was determined as described earlier (24.Iakhiaev A. Pendurthi U.R. Voigt J. Ezban M. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36995-37003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of WI-38 in 12-well culture plates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with varying concentrations of125I-FVIIa in a calcium-containing Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin). Then, unbound 125I-FVIIa was removed, and the monolayers were washed four times with the buffer. The cells were removed from the well by trypsin digestion and counted for the radioactivity to determine the amount of cell-associated FVIIa. Parallel experiments were carried out in which the monolayers were first incubated for 30 min with rabbit anti-human TF IgG (100 μg/ml) before radioactive ligand was added to cells to obtain nonspecific FVIIa binding to cell surfaces. TF-specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific FVIIa binding values from the corresponding binding values obtained in the absence of anti-TF antibody. In general, TF-specific binding of 125I-FVIIa in WI-38 cells was in the range of 70–80%. Activation of factor VII bound to WI-38 cells was evaluated as described earlier (25.Rao L.V.M. Williams T. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1996; 87: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of WI-38 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with125I-factor VII (10 nm) in a buffer containing benzamidine·HCl (10 mm) and calcium ions (5 mm) to allow factor VII binding to TF with minimal activation of factor VII. Then, the unbound factor VII was removed, and the monolayers were washed three times and overlaid with calcium-containing buffer. At indicated time periods, the supernatant was removed from the dish, and cell-bound 125I-factor VII was eluted by incubating cells for 5 min with EDTA (5 mm). The eluates were reduced with 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. WI-38 cells were cultured in 96-well culture plates and made quiescent as described above. After washing the cells, 5 μg/ml (100 nm) FVIIa in 100 μl of calcium-containing buffer was added to the wells containing cells or to the control wells coated with buffer (no cells). After 45 min of incubation, 25 μl of chromogenic substrates for FXa or thrombin,i.e. Chromozym X and Chromozym TH (1.25 mm), were added to the wells and allowed to stand for 3 h to develop color. The plate was read in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. To establish the sensitivity of the assay to detect the generation of traces of FXa and thrombin, trace concentrations of factor Xa, 0.1–2 ng/well (20 pm to 0.4 nm), or thrombin, 0.2–10 milliunits/well (17 pm to 0.87 nm), were added to directly to cells cultured in parallel wells on the same plate before Chromozym X or Chromozym TH was added to the wells to develop color. The quiescent human fibroblasts (WI-38) were exposed to a control serum-free medium or the serum-free medium supplemented with recombinant human FVIIa (5 μg/ml, 100 nm) for 90 min. Poly(A) RNA was purified from these samples, and 600 ng of mRNA was labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescence and then hybridized to the UniGem Human V chip containing 8000 sequence-verified expressed sequence tags, representing up to 5000 known human genes (service performed by Genome System Inc. for a fee). As controls, to measure sensitivity, monitor the reverse transcription reaction and purification, determine hybridization efficiency, and gain an overall view of the quality and performance of the assay, several known concentrations of reference cDNA were spiked into mRNAs during the probe generation reaction. Analysis of these controls indicated the success of hybridization process (balance coefficient, 1.69). Global analysis of experimental data revealed minimal differences in hybridization signals between the control and FVIIa-treated samples. Only a very small number of genes showed moderate differential expression. We found up-regulation of five genes (2–3.5-fold higher in FVIIa treatment), whereas one gene was down-regulated upon FVIIa treatment (2.4-fold lower) (± 2 is a conservative estimate for determining the minimum magnitude of real ratios). One of the FVIIa up-regulated genes (2.5-fold higher in FVIIa-treated cells),Cyr61, encodes an extracellular matrix signaling protein that was recently shown to promote cell proliferation, migration and tumor metastasis (19.Lau L.F. Lam S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that CTGF ,a gene belonging to the same family as Cyr61, was at a level 1.8-fold higher in FVIIa-treated cells than in control cells. A repeat of cDNA microarray with mRNA samples obtained in cells exposed to FVIIa for 30 min confirmed the up-regulation of bothCyr61 and CTGF but not the other genes. To validate the data obtained in microarray, we have subjected the RNA samples from the control and FVIIa-treated cells that were originally used for microarray analysis to Northern blot analysis and probed with radiolabeled Cyr61 cDNA. The data show thatCyr61 cDNA probe hybridized to a single transcript (approximately 2.0 kilobases) of RNA isolated from the control and FVIIa-treated cells. The hybridization signal was very faint for the RNA isolated from the control-treated cells, and the intensity of hybridization signal was higher for the RNA isolated from FVIIa-treated cells (data not shown). Quantitation of the signal revealed that the expression of Cyr61 was 2.8-fold higher in cells exposed to FVIIa over the control-treated cells, which correlates well with the data of the microarray. To determine the kinetics of Cyr61 expression, quiescent fibroblasts were treated for varying time periods with 100 nm FVIIa. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, Cyr61 expression was markedly increased in time-dependent manner in FVIIa-treated cells. The expression was peaked at about 45 min and thereafter declined close to base levels. Cyr61 mRNA levels in cells treated with FVIIa for 45 min were 5–15-fold higher than in cells treated with a control vehicle. To determine dose dependence of FVIIa, quiescent fibroblasts were treated with varying doses of FVIIa (0.1–5 μg/ml, 2–100 nm) for 45 min, and then total RNA samples from the cells were subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.2 A, treatment of fibroblasts with concentrations as low as 2 nm FVIIa was sufficient to induce the expression of Cyr61. Treatment of fibroblasts with 10 nm FVIIa, a concentration equivalent to the plasma concentration of factor VII, resulted in a prominent response, close to the maximal. The kinetics of FVIIa-induced dose-dependent expression of Cyr61 was quite similar to the kinetics of FVIIa binding to TF receptor on WI-38 cells (Fig. 2 B). FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61 is fully dependent on FVIIa binding to cell surface TF because preincubation of WI-38 cells with rabbit anti-human TF IgG (100 μg/ml) for 30 min before the addition of FVIIa completely blocked the FVIIa-induced expression ofCyr61 (see Fig. 11).Figure 11Effect of anti-TF and anti-FX IgG on FVIIa - and FXa-induced expression of Cyr61. Quiescent monolayers of WI-38 cells were incubated with either control IgG, rabbit anti-human TF IgG, or rabbit anti-human FX IgG (100 μg/ml) for 30 min. Similarly, FVIIa (100 nm) and FXa (20 nm) were also incubated with antibodies before they were added to the cells. Cells were treated with FVIIa and FXa with or without antibodies for 45 min. Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to Northern blot analysis and probed with radiolabeled Cyr61. A shows a representative autoradiograph, and B shows quantitative data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an additional experiment, we investigated whether a plasma concentration of factor VII is sufficient to induce the expression ofCyr61. Quiescent fibroblasts were treated with 10 nm factor VII for varying time periods, and the induction of Cyr61 gene expression was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. The data show that a plasma concentration of factor VII effectively induced the expression of Cyr61 (Fig.3 A). However, it requires at least 2 h of incubation with factor VII to induce the expression of Cyr61. This is consistent with the observation that factor VII bound to cell surface TF was slowly autoactivated to FVIIa, and a 60-min time period was required for the conversion of a substantial amount of factor VII to FVIIa (Fig. 3 B). CTGF, a molecule structurally related to Cyr61, exhibits biological responses similar to those of Cyr61. Because the relative ratio of CTGF expression in FVIIa-treated sample versus the control sample in the initial cDNA microarray was 1.8, which was lower than a conservative estimate of the lowest possible real magnitude, we did not initially choose this for further examination. However, after knowing the kinetics of FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61(i.e. FVIIa-stimulated expression of Cyr61reached a peak at 45 min and thereafter was repressed to base levels within 2 h after the stimulation), we thought it possible that FVIIa could also induce the expression of CTGF and that the minor difference in CTGF expression that we observed in the cDNA microarray analysis between the control and FVIIa-treated cells might be the result of a 90-min treatment period selected for the microarray assay. Therefore, we have tested the kinetics of FVIIa-induced expression of CTGF by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, FVIIa treatment markedly induced the expression of CTGF mRNA steady state levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The kinetics of FVIIa-induced expression of CTGF were very similar to the kinetics of FVIIa-induced expression ofCyr61. To investigate whether transcription is involved in FVIIa-mediated increase inCyr61 mRNA steady-state levels, quiescent WI-38 cells were incubated with actinomycin-D (10 μg/ml) for 30 min before the addition of FVIIa for 45 min. As shown in Fig.5, actinomycin-D treatment completely blocked the FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61. This finding indicates a transcriptional mechanism for induction ofCyr61. To investigate whether de novo protein synthesis is required for the induction of Cyr61 mRNA by FVIIa, WI-38 cells were pretreated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, before the cells were exposed to FVIIa for 45 min. As shown in Fig. 5, the stimulatory effect of FVIIa was not blocked by cycloheximide. In fact, cycloheximide markedly increased the FVIIa-induced Cyr61 mRNA accumulation, indicating a rapid degradation of mRNA involving a labile protein, a hallmark property of immediate-early genes. Similar results were obtained with FVIIa-induced expression of CTGF (data not shown). To test whether FVIIa catalytic activity is required for the induction of Cyr61, WI-38 cells were treated with FVIIa and FVIIai for 45 min and the expression of Cyr61 was evaluated by Northern blot analysis. In contrast to FVIIa, FVIIai failed to induce the expression of Cyr61 (Fig.6). These data suggest that FVIIa proteolytic activity is required for the induction of Cyr61. In this context, it may be important to point out that FVIIai was shown to bind to cell surface TF with the same or higher affinity than FVIIa (20.Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P. Kjalke M.

Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9 (suppl.): S67-S71Google Scholar). Furthermore, the specific inhibitors of FXa and thrombin,i.e. TAP and hirudin, respectively, failed to abolish the FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61 (Fig.7). Quantitation of the hybridization signals from several independent experiments showed that TAP partially reduced the FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61, whereas hirudin had only a minimal effect on the FVIIa-induced gene expression. Data for Cyr61 expression were as follows (percentage normalized to basal expression found in untreated cells): FVIIa, 684 ± 94%; TAP + FVIIa, 438 ± 135%; hirudin ± FVIIa, 571 ± 109% (mean ± S.E., n = 5). Similar data were obtained with FVIIa-induced expression ofCTGF. Although the difference between FVIIa-induced expression of Cyr61 in the presence of inhibitors was not statistically significant from Cyr61 expression in the absence of inhibitors (p = 0.173 for FVIIaversus TAP + FVIIa and p = 0.46, FVIIaversus FVIIa + hirudin), we cannot entirely discount the inhibitory effect of TAP on FVIIa-induced gene expression. At present, it is unclear the reason for this partial inhibitory effect of TAP. It is unlikely that the inhibition stemmed from a direct effect of TAP on FVIIa·TF catalytic activity because TAP, even at a concent"

(Here e is the charge of an electron, k is Boltzmann's constant, and h is Planck's constant.) The nature of the individual sites--metallic, superconducting, semiconducting or quantum dot--is to first order irrelevant for this phenomenon to be observed. Coulomb blockade has also been observed in two-dimensional arrays of normal-metal tunnel junctions, but the relatively large capacitances of these micrometre-sized metal islands results in a small charging energy, and so the effect can be seen only at extremely low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that organic thin-film transistors based on highly ordered molecular materials can, to first order, also be considered as an array of sites separated by tunnel resistances. And as a result of the sub-nanometre sizes of the sites (the individual molecules), and hence their small capacitances, the charging energy dominates at room temperature. Conductivity measurements as a function of both gate bias and temperature reveal the presence of thermally activated transport, consistent with the conventional model of Coulomb blockade."

https://openalex.org/W2128920100,"The Crk-associated substrate, p130CAS, has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton following ligation of cell integrins with the extracellular matrix. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion involves p130CAS association with focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK). Internalization/cell entry of type 2 and type 5 adenoviruses (Ad) is also mediated by αv integrins. However, expression of dominant negative forms of p125FAKdoes not alter virus entry, and Ad entry occurs normally in p125FAK-deficient fibroblasts. We now provide evidence that Ad internalization, a process which is mediated by αvintegrins, also requires p130CAS and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase). Ad induces p130CAS phosphorylation and inhibition of p130CAS phosphorylation by tyrphostin and genistein, or expression of the substrate domain deleted p130CAS blocks Ad internalization. p130CAS was also found to associate with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase through its proline-rich domain during virus internalization and expression of p130CAScontaining a deleted proline-rich domain (PRD) inhibited adenovirus cell entry. We showed further that the RPLPSPP motif in the proline-rich region of p130CAS interacts with the SH3 domain of p85/PI 3-kinase.

Adenovirus has proved to be a useful tool for uncovering the signaling events involved in integrin-mediated viral endocytosis. Adenoviruses are associated with mild/acute infections of the eye, upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (3.Horwitz M.S. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology.

Adenovirus types 2/5 entry into host cells occurs after initial binding via the adenovirus fiber protein to a 46-kDa cell receptor (4.Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A.

Adenovirus internalization also requires PI 3-kinase1activation (9.Li E. Stupack D. Cheresh D. Klemke R. Nemerow G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Rho family of small GTPases (10.Li E. Stupack D. Bokoch G. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8806-8812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These signaling molecules promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process required for efficient virus entry. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins that mediate the formation of focal adhesion complexes via interaction with extracellular matrix proteins. This process also involves signaling events including the rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and colocalization with actin-associated proteins such as vinculin, α-actinin, paxillin, tensin, and others, which help bridge integrins and actin (11.Craig S.W. Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A number of signaling molecules, including c-Src, COOH-terminal Src kinase, p130CAS, phospholipase C-γ, PI 3-kinase, PKC, and the Ras/Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, have also been identified in focal adhesions. Src family protein tyrosine kinases bind to the autophosphorylation site of p125FAK (tyrosine 397), via their SH2 domain (12.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). This interaction results in further modification of p125FAK, including phosphorylation of the catalytic domain residues, tyrosines 576 and 577, and tyrosine 925 (13.Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K.

Tyrosine phosphorylation at 397 of p125FAK mediates its interaction with p85 of PI 3-kinase and subsequently activates PI 3-kinase during cell adhesion (16.Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated uptake of a pathogenic bacterium, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, has also been shown to require p125FAK signaling (17.Alrutz M.A. Isberg R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). p130CAS (Crk-associated substrate) is a signaling intermediate which was initially identified as a highly phosphorylated protein in v-Src and v-Crk transformed rat fibroblasts (18.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). p130CAS contains an amino-terminal SH3 domain, a central substrate domain composed of a cluster of putative SH2-binding sites, and a COOH-terminal proline-rich domain with consensus binding site for the SH3 domain of c-Src (19.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the SH3 domain of p130CAS binds the tyrosine kinases, p125FAK, RAFTK (related adhesionfocal tyrosine kinase)/Pyk2 and FRNK (p125FAK-relatednon-kinases) (20.Polte T.R.

Recent genetic studies have indicated that p130CAS plays a critical role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. p130CAS-deficient mouse embryos die in utero and show marked cardiovascular defects which are linked to altered myofibril organization as well as defective actin stress fiber formation (34.Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nature Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Given the potential role of p130CAS in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, we investigated whether p130CAS also participates in the signaling events required for adenovirus internalization. We found that adenovirus cell entry involves p130CAS and that an association of p130CAS with PI 3-kinase but not p125FAK is crucial for this process. p130CAS interaction with p85/PI 3-kinase is mediated by an RXL motif in the proline-rich domain of p130CAS. Adenovirus type 2 (Ad2, ATCC) was propagated in A549 epithelial cells and purified by banding on CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (6.Wickham T.J. Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Purified virions were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.1, containing 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. Ad2 was radiolabeled with Na125I using IODO-GEN-coated beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The specific activity of labeled virions was approximately 106-107 cpm/μg. The human colon colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480, A549 lung carcinoma cells (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA), HEK-293T embryonic kidney cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts expression or lacking p125FAK (35.Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue KK. Nakatsui N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), (kindly provided by Dr. Ilı́c, University of California, San Francisco) were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 mml-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cell monolayers at 30% confluency were either transiently-transfected using the LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), as recommended by the manufacturer or by using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Under these conditions approximately 60% of SW480 and more than 90% of 293T cells were transfected at 48 h post-transfection as ascertained by the use of a plasmid containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene under control of the same CMV promoter. Mammalian expression vectors containing cDNA for the expression of wild-type and substrate domain deleted p130CAS, wild-type p125FAK, and the Y397F point mutant of p125FAK, have been described previously (18.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 31.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding mouse wild-type p85, p85Δ (deletion of aa 478–513), and p85-SH3 (aa 1–79), p130CAS-SH3 (19.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and p130CAS-PRD16 (aa 634–649) were generated by standard molecular cloning protocols and the sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The cDNAs encoding p130CAS with the deletion of the proline-rich domain of p130CAS (ΔSB) and a mutant form of this molecule (p130CAS-PLP⇒SLGS) were constructed as described previously (19.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were cloned in-frame into a eukaryotic expression vector, pEBG-GST (glutathione S-transferase) (18.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) or the pGEX-2T or 4T bacterial expression vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The polyclonal and monoclonal anti-p130CAS antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. The anti-p85 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, Invitrogen, CA), anti-GST antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, UBI, New York) were obtained commercially. Affinity purified polyclonal anti-p125FAK antibody was prepared as described previously (37.Sieg D.J. Iiic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For detection in immunoblotting, the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent was used (Pierce, Rockford, IL). All other reagents were acquired from Sigma. Adenovirus-infected or uninfected cell cultures were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and disrupted on ice for 5 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μmNa3VO4, 0.1 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer A). For PI 3-kinase activity assay, cells were lysed with Buffer A supplemented with 100 mm sodium fluoride, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, equivalent amounts of cell lysates (as determined by protein content) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal anti-p130CAS, or a monoclonal anti-p85 antibody immobilized onto protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer, and twice with ice-cold PBS before the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresis on 8 or 8–16% SDS gel under reducing conditions. For certain experiments, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), nonspecific binding sites blocked by incubation in 5% nonfat dry milk and then reacted with antibodies to p130CAS, p85, GST, or phosphotyrosine followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence detection reagent (Pierce). For the preparation of GST fusion proteins, pGEX expression vectors containing cDNAs encoding different signaling molecules were transformed into either the DH5α or the BL-21 strain of Escherichia coli. Bacterial cells from 400-ml overnight cultures grown at 37 °C were resuspended in an equal volume of fresh LB medium. After 30 min of additional growth at 30 °C, a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for 90 min. Induced bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of cold PBS and then sonicated. The bacterial cells were further incubated with Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%) and lysozyme at 0.2 mg/ml at room temperature for another hour. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, bacterial lysates were incubated with 0.5 ml of packed glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed with 0.5 m NaCl buffered with phosphate, followed by twice in PBS. The fusion proteins were then eluted with either 10 mm glutathione (reduced form) for qualitative and quantitative analysis or left on the beads for further affinity (pull-down) experiments. Certain GST fusion proteins were also produced in a mammalian expression system by transiently transfecting 293T cells with pEBG expression vector using the calcium phosphate precipitation. Two days post-transfection, cells were lysed with Buffer A and the fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads precipitation. The beads were washed with lysis buffer two times and then twice with PBS. The purified proteins were identified by immunoblotting with an anti-GST antibody. For affinity studies, purified GST fusion proteins expressed from bacterial or mammalian cells (see below) were incubated with mammalian cell lysates. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, and twice with ice-cold PBS and boiled in 1× sample buffer. The proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then immunoblotted as described above. Serum-starved SW480 cells were incubated with Ad2 at a multiplicity of infection of 100, or epidermal growth factor at 10 μg/ml at 37 °C for the indicated times prior to lysis. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, disrupted with lysis buffer, and then immunoprecipitated with an anti-p85 antibody, anti-p130CAS antibody as described above. The PI 3-kinase activity in the immunocomplexes was assayed as reported previously (9.Li E. Stupack D. Cheresh D. Klemke R. Nemerow G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,38.Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. p130CAS-associated PI 3-kinase activity was quantitated by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with a polyclonal anti-p130CAS antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA and then incubated with 2.5 × 105cpm of 125I-labeled virus per 106 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% purified bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 60 min. These cells were warmed to 37 °C for varying times after removal of non-bound virus by washing with ice-cold PBS. Uninternalized virions were removed by incubation with trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min. The internalized viral particles were then measured by counting trypsin-resistant radioactivity. Since p125FAKdirectly interacts with PI 3-kinase (39.Chaudhary P.M. Eby M. Jasmin A. Bookwalter A. Murray J. Hood L. Immun. 1997; 7: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and our earlier studies indicated that p125FAK phosphorylation occurs during PI 3-kinase-mediated adenovirus internalization (9.Li E. Stupack D. Cheresh D. Klemke R. Nemerow G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine if p125FAK is actually required for virus internalization and infection. SW480 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA plasmid encoding either wild-type FAK or a single point mutant of FAK (Phe397) which lacks the ability to associate with the endogenous p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (40.Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant FAK expressing cells (approximately 50–70% of the total cell population) were then assayed for their ability to internalize125I-labeled adenovirus particles. Somewhat to our surprise, very similar levels of adenovirus internalization was observed in cells expressing mutant FAK relative to those expressing wild-type FAK (Fig. 1 A). These studies suggested that while adenovirus interaction with αv integrins induces FAK phosphorylation (9.Li E. Stupack D. Cheresh D. Klemke R. Nemerow G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this event is not required for virus internalization. Several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in FAK are associated with its activity (24.Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 41.Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (20701): 20701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine 925 of FAK, which was identified as the binding site for Grb2 protein, as well as three other tyrosines (Tyr180, Tyr652, and Tyr950) in the YXXM motif have been indicated for optimal binding to p85 SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase (42.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechieider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate further the possible role of FAK in virus entry, we quantitated adenovirus internalization and gene delivery in FAK-deficient (FAK−/−) or FAK-expressing (FAK+/+) mouse embryo fibroblasts. Each of these cell types bound equivalent amounts of adenovirus and virus attachment was capable of being blocked by soluble fiber protein (data not shown). FAK-deficient fibroblasts also supported very similar levels of adenovirus internalization as FAK-expressing cells (Fig.1 B). These studies indicated that FAK activity is not essential for αv integrin-mediated adenovirus entry into host cells. To examine further whether FAK might play a role in Ad internalization, we expressed the non-kinase domain of FAK (FRNK), a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase (43.Richardson A. Shannon R.A. Adams R.B. Schaller M.D. Parsons J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in SW480 cells. Expression of FRNK failed to block adenovirus internalization (Fig. 1 C), indicating that FAK is not required for cell entry. In our investigation of adenovirus internalization, we noted that there was a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 125–130-kDa protein which was also present in p125FAK-deficient fibroblasts (data not shown), consistent with the size of p130CAS. Although p130CAS has been shown to colocalize with integrin-associated focal adhesion complexes, its involvement in Ad cell entry or in endocytosis in general was unknown. To investigate the potential role of p130CAS in virus infection, we first determined whether adenovirus interaction with cells resulted in p130CAS phosphorylation. Incubation of SW480 cells, which express only integrin αvβ5, with Ad, resulted in a 5–7-fold increase in p130CAS phosphorylation compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 A). This response was relatively rapid, occurring 5 min after exposure to virus and persisted for up to 20 min after incubation. To assess whether p130CAS phosphorylation was specifically due to integrin interaction with the adenovirus penton base, we preincubated viral particles with soluble recombinant integrin αvβ5 (44.Mathias P. Galleno M. Nemerow G.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8669-8675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then asked whether such viruses were still capable of inducing p130CASphosphorylation. Preincubation of virus particles with soluble integrin αvβ5 reduced p130CASphosphorylation by approximately 50% compared with untreated viruses (Fig. 2 B). The soluble integrin alone had little effect on p130CAS phosphorylation. These studies indicate that the Ad penton base interaction with αv integrins promotes p130CAS phosphorylation. To determine whether p130CAS phosphorylation is required for Ad endocytosis, we treated cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitors tyrphostin or genistein (5 or 20 μm) for 60 min in serum-free medium, and measured the amount of p130CAS tyrosine phosphorylation and Ad internalization. Treatment of cells with genistein or tyrphostin 25 blocked Ad-induced p130CAS phosphorylation (Fig.3 A, upper panel) as well as Ad2 internalization (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PD98059 (PD), an inhibitor of the ERK1/ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (45.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 46.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) did not inhibit either Ad endocytosis or p130CAS phosphorylation. These studies indicated that p130CAS phosphorylation is associated with adenovirus cell entry. p130CAS contains an SH3 domain, a cluster of SH2-binding sites in its substrate domain, and a proline-rich region that is a candidate for SH3 domain binding. The substrate domain of p130CAS contains most of the putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites and accounts for a significant portion of its tyrosine phosphorylation (18.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 31.Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of p130CAS phosphorylation in adenovirus internalization, we transiently expressed wild type CAS, or CAS truncated in either the substrate domain (ΔSD, Δ213–514 aa) or the COOH terminus (ΔSB, Δ556–806 aa), and assayed tyrosine phosphorylation induced by Ad infection as described. As showed in Fig. 3 C, little if any phosphorylation of the overexpressed proteins was detected in the absence of Ad, while in contrast, Ad induced substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type p130CAS as well as p130CAS ΔSB. Interestingly, the substrate domain-deleted p130CAS (ΔSD) which has the putative tyrosine phosphorylation domain deleted had significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation upon Ad infection (Fig. 3 C). We next tested whether the expression of p130CAS (ΔSD) could alter Ad internalization. Overexpression of p130CAS ΔSD inhibited Ad internalization by about 75%, whereas virus uptake was unaffected in cells expressing wild-type p130CAS (Fig. 3 D). Together these data suggest that the p130CASphosphorylation/activity is required for efficient adenovirus internalization. We previously demonstrated that Ad cell entry requires PI 3-kinase activation, however, it was unknown whether PI 3-kinase associates with other signaling molecules such as p130CAS during infection. To examine this, we incubated SW480 cells with Ad2 particles at 37 °C for 10 min and then immunoprecipitated with either anti-p85 or anti-p130CAS, or a control antibody. PI 3-kinase activity in the immunocomplexes was then assayed with phosphatidylinositol as a substrate and analyzed by TLC. PI 3-kinase activity induced by Ad infection could be detected in both anti-p85 and anti-p130CAS immunoprecipitants, but not in cell samples immunoprecipitated with a control polyclonal antibody (Fig. 4 A). To determine if the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associates with p130CAS during infection, we then immunoprecipitated SW480 cell lysates with a polyclonal anti-p130CAS antibody, a portion of the immunocomplexes were immunobloted for associated-p85 after separation on an SDS gel, or used to assay PI 3-kinase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Adenovirus infection induced p130CAS association with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and this correlated with increased PI 3-kinase activity in anti-p130CAS complexes (Fig. 4, B andC). The association of p130CAS with p85 was also detec"

The recent observation of differential sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity in normal (low SMS) versusSV40-transformed (high SMS) WI38 human lung fibroblasts provides an opportunity to assess the involvement of ceramide and SMS in NF-κB activation. Treatment of normal WI38 fibroblasts with bacterial sphingomyelinase resulted in a 4-fold elevation of ceramide and blocked NF-κB activation by serum stimulation. Such inhibition was not observed in SV40-transformed fibroblasts. Under regular growth conditions, after sphingomyelinase was washed out, normal WI38 did not show SM re-synthesis nor NF-κB activation. In SV40-WI38, on the other hand, sphingomyelinase washout induced resynthesis of SM due to the action of SMS on ceramide generated at the plasma membrane. NF-κB activation correlated with SM resynthesis. This activation was abrogated by D609, which inhibited SM resynthesis but not the initial formation of ceramide. The differential activity of SMS may explain the effects of ceramide in NF-κB signaling: in the absence of significant SMS activity, ceramide inhibits NF-κB, whereas with high SMS, the conversion of the ceramide signal to a diacylglycerol signal by the action of SMS stimulates NF-κB. These results also suggest a role for SMS in regulating NF-κB. The precise role of ceramide in NF-κB signaling remains unclear.

Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1992; 255: 1715-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5.Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

One important action of TNFα involves the expression of specific genes via activation of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors (Refs. 7.Osborn L. Kunkel W. Nabel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholarand 8.Lowenthal J.W. Ballard D.W. Bogerd H. Böhnlein E. Greene W.C. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Before TNFα stimulation, inactive dimers of NF-κB subunits remain bound by I-κB in the cytosol. Upon TNFα stimulation, I-κB undergoes phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, allowing free NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and stimulate transcription of its appropriate target genes (10.Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Some proteins such as Traf2 have been shown to associate with the receptors for TNFα and possibly mediate TNF-induced activation of NF-κB (12.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). In addition, TNFα has been suggested to activate phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), and the resultant diacylglycerol (DAG) functions as an activator of protein kinase C (13.Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C may contribute to NF-κB activation by anti-neoplastic agents (14.Das K.C. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14914-14920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and the ζ isoform of protein kinase C has also been proposed as a specific activator of NF-κB (15.Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain de Lera M.T. Alcami J. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα is also known to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis and concomitant ceramide generation (1.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), and there have been many attempts to couple ceramide to the activation of NF-κB. Some studies have suggested that ceramide plays an essential role in NF-κB activation (16.Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Johns L.D. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5877-5882PubMed Google Scholar), and in one proposed scheme, it has been suggested that DAG generated from PC-PLC causes activation of acid sphingomyelinase, and the resultant ceramide induces activation of NF-κB (13.Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 18.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting a role for ceramide pathways in the activation of NF-κB has come primarily from the following observations. 1) The addition of bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase) to some (16.Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not all (19.Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) cells results in activation of NF-κB, and 2) D609, a putative inhibitor of PC-PLC, inhibits activation of NF-κB (13.Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, the existence of membrane PC-PLC and the specificity of D609 have not been demonstrated at a biochemical level. In fact, the use of D609 as an inhibitor of a mammalian PC-PLC-like activity is based solely on in vitro studies of the effects of D609 on a bacterial PC-PLC (31.Amtmann E. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1996; 22: 287-294PubMed Google Scholar); no such evidence has been provided for direct effects of D609 on a mammalian PC-PLC. Other studies have found acid SMase and ceramide to have no effect or even exert a negative effect on NF-κB (5.Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

In certain cell lines, TNFα activates NF-κB without ceramide generation (20.Betts J., C. Agranoff A.B. Nabel G.J. Shayman J.A. J. Biol.

Studies using cell-permeable analogs of ceramide or bSMase showed that these manipulations could mimic apoptosis or activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase but had no effect on NF-κB (5.Dbaibo G.S.

Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), still show activation of NF-κB by TNFα (21.Kuno K. Sukegawa K Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thus refuting a necessary role for this enzyme in activation of NF-κB. A recent study showed that ceramide inhibits the activation of NF-κB by PMA (19.Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In recent studies, we have observed that mammalian sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) demonstrates many of the properties that had been ascribed to the putative PC-PLC, including inhibition by D609 both in intact cells and in cellular membrane preparations (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that SMS may account for some of the cellular effects that had been attributed to PC-PLC. In particular, we wondered whether SMS might be involved in activation of NF-κB and, thus, may explain some of the conflicting results on the possible roles of ceramide. SMS utilizes as substrates ceramide and phosphatidylcholine to produce sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol, “converting” a sphingolipid bioeffector into a glycerolipid messenger. With each lipid's own unique profile of biological activity, any shift in levels between the two lipids could result in very divergent signaling outcomes. Moreover we had shown that WI38 human lung fibroblasts have low or undetectable plasma membrane-related SMS activity, whereas the SV40-transformed WI38 demonstrated high SMS activity: in the wild type cells, ceramide generated at the plasma membrane persisted over several hours, with no detectable resynthesis of SM. In contrast, ceramide generated at the plasma membrane of SV40-transformed cells was re-incorporated into SM over 6 h, indicating the presence of a distinct SMS in these cells. We exploited this difference between the two cell lines to investigate the role of SMS in activation of NF-κB by endogenous ceramide. The results indicate a clear increase in NF-κB activation in the presence of high SMS activity not seen in the WI38 cell line or when SMS activity is inhibited by D609. These observations help to clarify the heretofore perplexing effects of ceramide on NF-κB activation and suggest a possible physiologic function of the SMS pathway in regulation of NF-κB. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, MEM, and all MEM solutions were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Summit Technology. bSMase (from Staphylococcus aureus) was from Sigma, and D609 was from Calbiochem. TNFα was a kind gift from Dr. Phillip Pekala (East Carolina University). [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Poly(dI-dC) and poly(dN6) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-NF-κB (p65 and p50) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-NF-κB (p65) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Rockland. Both normal and SV40-transformed WI38 human lung fibroblasts were obtained from the National Institute on Aging Cell Repository. Normal WI38 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and Hepes buffer. WI38 cells were used up to passage 24–26. SV40-transformed fibroblasts were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS along with MEM solutions of vitamins and essential and non-essential amino acids. Both cell lines were grown at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were harvested in methanol, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The chloroform organic phase was separated into aliquots (in duplicates) and dried down for ceramide and phosphate measurements. Ceramide levels were evaluated using the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay. Ceramide was quantitated by using external standards and normalized to phosphate content (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105in 100-mm dish. After 2 days, the medium was changed, and the cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (final specific activity: 0.5 μCi/ml) for 60 h. After this time, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and chased for 2 h. After washing with PBS again, cells were treated with 100 milliunits/ml bSMase for 25 min. Then cells were washed twice with PBS, and fresh medium was added to continue the incubation for up to additional 6 h. In some experiments 50 μg/ml D609 (aqueous solution) were added to the medium. After removing the medium, cells were washed and scraped in PBS. The suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were stored at −80 °C. SM measurements were performed as indicated previously (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells in a 100-mm dish in 10% FBS-supplemented medium. After 2 days, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS, and finally, medium supplemented with 0.1% FBS was added. After approximately 2.5 days, on the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with fresh 10% FBS medium with or without 100 milliunits/ml bSMase. Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 cells in a 100-mm dish in regular growth medium. After 2 days, cells were washed with PBS, and medium supplemented with 0.1% FBS was added (7 ml/plate). After 12 h, cells were treated with PMA (50 nm) in the presence or absence of bSMase (100 milliunits/ml) in a final volume of 8 ml. Cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 105 cells in a 100-mm dish in regular growth medium. After 2 days, the medium was changed (7 ml of fresh medium were added), and after 12 h, cells were treated with 100 milliunits/ml bSMase for 25 min in a final volume of 8 ml of medium/plate (bSMase was added in 1 ml medium/plate). The cells were washed twice with PBS and further incubated in fresh medium (8 ml) for the specified time points. In some experiments, 50 μg/ml D609 (aqueous solution) was added to the bSMase treatment and to the subsequent incubation medium. The nuclear extraction procedure was modified from Dignam et al. (27.Dignam J.D. Leibovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), with all procedures performed at 4 °C. After treatments, the medium was removed, and cells washed twice with PBS. The cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Just before centrifugation, 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added, and the suspension was triturated 3 times. Nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in 20 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 mNaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was mixed gently for 30 min and pelleted at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Assays were performed in a final volume of 20 μl using 10 μg of nuclear extract and incubated in HDKE buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μg poly(dI-dC), 1 μg poly(dN6), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. One μl of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (60,000–100,000 cpm) was added to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl 15% Ficoll solution containing indicator dyes (bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). For supershift experiments, 1 μl of antibody was added to appropriate samples and incubated for 30 min on ice before Ficoll termination. Equal amounts (20 μl) of reaction mixture were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA and run at 200 V. Gels were placed onto Whatman filter paper, dried, and autoradiographed. A synthetic NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide from Promega with the following sequence: 5′-ACTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was end-labeled using polynucleotide T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified on a microspin G25 column. For immunocytochemical analysis, wild type or transformed WI38 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm plate that contained 22-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). After treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized during a 20-min incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed, blocked, and treated for 30 min with a rabbit anti-p65 NF-κB antibody (1:200). The cells were then washed and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100). Nuclei were visualized by a 5-min incubation with Hoechst dye (10 μg/ml bisbenzimide; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were photographed with a Dage-MTI 100 video camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with fluorescence optics, a using a video digitizer (Snappy Video Snapshot, Play Inc., Rancho Cordova) operated through Adobe Photoshop. To investigate the role of endogenous plasma membrane ceramide in the regulation of NF-κB activation, the effect of bSMase was assessed on serum-induced NF-κB translocation. Normal WI38 human lung fibroblasts were withdrawn from serum for approximately 60 h and then stimulated by the addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS, in the presence or absence of 100 milliunits/ml bSMase. As shown in Fig.1 A, simple serum stimulation of WI38 cells did not induce changes in ceramide levels during 25 min incubation (zero time versus 25 min). On the other hand, the presence of bSMase caused a burst of ceramide (110 pmol/nmol Pi versus 27 pmol/nmol Pi) that was generated through the hydrolysis of the SM in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. When determining the effect of serum stimulation on NF-κB activation as evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we found that normal WI38 cells showed a time-dependent activation of the transcription factor, clearly seen after 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the presence of bSMase, although inducing ceramide accumulation, significantly inhibited this activation during the time course (Fig. 1 B) and was most pronounced at the 25 min time point. To assess whether the same pattern of activities occurred in SV40-transformed WI38 fibroblasts compared with the normal counterpart, the effect of bSMase treatment during acute serum stimulation was studied in the transformed cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, in a manner very similar to the normal WI38, bSMase treatment induced a significant accumulation of ceramide over the incubation period (75 pmol/nmol Pi), whereas simple serum stimulation did not cause any changes in the lipid level. Under these conditions, serum stimulation induced a progressive activation of NF-κB over time (25 min versus 15 min), similar to what was observed in the normal fibroblasts (Fig. 1 D). On the other hand, in the SV40-WI38 cells, the treatment with bSMase was not able to block the serum-induced effect on NF-κB and, if anything, it promoted its activation (Fig. 1 D). It is important to note that, as previously observed in this cell line (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and, as reported by several authors (for a review, see “Discussion” in Zhang et al.(32.Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)), treatment with bSMase did not exert any cytotoxic effect or significant morphological changes appreciable by optical microscopy analysis. To confirm the results obtained on NF-κB activation in the two cell lines under conditions of serum stimulation, we investigated the effect exerted by the treatment with bSMase on phorbol ester-induced NF-κB activation. Cells withdrawn from serum (0.1% FBS-containing medium) for 12 h were stimulated with 50 nm PMA for 30 min in the presence or absence of 100 milliunits/ml bSMase. As shown in Fig.2, stimulation with PMA caused NF-κB activation in both normal (left panel) and SV40-transformed WI38 (right panel). When bSMase was added concomitantly with PMA, it blocked almost completely NF-κB activation in normal WI38, whereas it had no inhibitory effect in the SV40-WI38. These results reproduce the effects observed during serum stimulation conditions. We have recently reported that there is a significant difference in ceramide metabolism between normal and SV40-transformed WI38 (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In response to treatment with bSMase, the normal and SV40-transformed WI38 show distinct levels and patterns of SMS activity. A 25-min incubation with bSMase resulted in significant SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation in both cell lines. However, following washout of bSMase, only the SV40-transformed cells metabolized the high levels of ceramide generated at the plasma membrane (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Moreover, the decrease in ceramide levels in the transformed cells was accompanied by an increase in SM (Fig. 3 A). In view of these observations, we asked whether the differences in SM and ceramide metabolism between the two cell lines relate to the differences in NF-κB activation. To address this question, both cell lines were treated with bSMase for 25 min in growth medium, washed twice (to remove bSMase), then incubated with fresh medium up to 30 min. In normal cells, after bSMase washout, there was little if any increase over basal activity of NF-κB, as assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 3 B, left panel). However, SV40-transformed cells, with their high SMS activity, showed an increase in NF-κB activation following bSMase treatment (Fig.3 B, right panel) during the phase of SM resynthesis. Since the NF-κB-DNA binding appeared different between normal and transformed WI38, the specificity of this activation was examined using monoclonal antibodies against the p65 and p50 subunits of the NF-κB heterodimer. In both cell lines, the supershift of NF-κB-specific bands was not seen with the p50 antibody. However, co-incubation with the p65 antibody resulted in similar retardation of the bands in both TNFα- and bSMase-treated extracts (Fig. 4). These bands were competitively washed out by addition of excess cold consensus oligonucleotide. Of note is also the slightly higher basal NF-κB activation in WI38 cells compared with the SV40 fibroblasts (Fig.4,first lanes) (confirmed by immunocytochemistry, see Fig.5). In the SV40 WI38, the patterns of NF-κB activation induced by bSMase treatment were similar to those seen with TNFα (included as positive control), although bSMase appeared to be significantly less effective.Figure 5Immunocytochemical analysis of NF-κB translocation in normal and SV40-WI38 fibroblasts after bSMase washout. Wild type or transformed WI38 were grown for 2 days on 22-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Medium was changed (7 ml/100-mm plate), and after 12 h, 100 milliunits/ml bSMase was added in 1 ml of medium. After 25 min of stimulation, the cells were washed 2 times with PBS, new medium was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. When TNFα was used, it was added at 3 nm for 30 min after a mock washout. All cells were fixed and processed for NFkB immunostaining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SV40-transformed cells are particularly flat, and their perimeter can barely be tracked under phase optics, but it is better-defined in the corresponding fluorescent images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunocytochemical analysis was subsequently carried out to confirm the differences in the activation of NF-κB after bSMase washout in the two cell lines. Cells were fixed 30 min after bSMase washout and probed with an anti-NF-κB p65 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, SV40-WI38 control cells displayed a diffuse cytosolic NF-κB signal. After bSMase treatment, the immunoreactivity was almost exclusively present in the nucleus, indicating that NF-κB translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus, confirming what was observed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. No such NF-κB translocation was seen in normal WI38 cells either under control conditions or after bSMase. However, it should be noted that normal WI38 fibroblasts showed a small basal NF-κB activation seen both by immunocytochemistry and by gel shift assay. Nevertheless, treatment with TNFα caused a strong NF-κB translocation (Fig. 5), indicating that NF-κB activation remained inducible. Previous studies have described and utilized D609 as a PC-PLC-specific inhibitor. In the SV40-transformed cell line, we were unable to detect any PC-PLC activity (25.Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, we found that the high level of SMS activity in transformed cells was inhibited by D609 (Fig.3 A). This provided another opportunity to establish the effect of SMS on NF-κB activation and to distinguish the effects of bSMase due to ceramide formation per se from effects due to subsequent metabolism through SMS. SV40-transformed cells were treated for 25 min with or without bSMase. The cells were then washed to remove the bSMase and then incubated in fresh medium (see Fig. 6 A). The effect of D609 on NF-κB activation was investigated, and D609 was added during bSMase incubation and after its washout (Fig.6 A) to determine the effects of D609 on the induction of ceramide by bSMase and its effects on resynthesis of SM. To verify that the presence of D609 during bSMase treatment did not interfere with the enzymatic activity, ceramide levels were determined. As shown in Fig. 6 B, D609 had no effect in vivo on ceramide generation by bSMase in SV40-transformed cells. In contrast, D609 nearly totally inhibited SM resynthesis (Fig. 3 A). These results clearly show that D609 inhibits SMS but not the initial ceramide formation. Notably, the robust activation of NF-κB by bSMase at 30 min was virtually eliminated by incubation with D609, and this inhibitory effect remained after a 1-hr incubation (Fig.6 C). Altogether these results demonstrate that the action of D609 is downstream of ceramide generation but upstream of SM resynthesis, consistent with a major effect on SMS. In this study, we demonstrate two distinct effects of bSMase on NF-κB (Fig. 7). First, serum- and PMA-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited during treatment with bSMase in normal WI38 fibroblasts. This is consistent with a previous study showing that short chain ceramides inhibit activation of NF-κB by PMA but not by TNFα (19.Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Second, bSMase treatment activated NF-κB in the SV40-transformed line. This activation correlated with high SMS activity in the transformed cells versus their normal WI38 counterparts. This activation was prevented by D609. Although the results with D609 do not conclusively support a role for SMS in the activation of NF-κB, they do rule out a direct role for ceramide in this process because ceramide generation was not inhibited by D609. Moreover, the action of exogenous ceramides or bSMase in the absence of SMS activity results in inhibition of NF-κB activation. These results suggest that metabolism of ceramide is needed for the activation of NF-κB. We propose that SMS action on ceramide is responsible for NF-κB activation because 1) it is inhibited by D609, 2) its activity is absent in the wild type cells, 3) it is the primary metabolic pathway that acts on ceramide in the transformed cells (for approximately 40 pmol/nmol Pi of resynthesized SM there are 40 pmol/nmol Pi of cleared ceramide), and 4) the production of DAG by SMS or its analog PMA are sufficient to activate NF-κB (Ref. 15.Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain de Lera M.T. Alcami J. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it should be noted that, in the absence of more specific inhibitors or antisense regulators of SMS, we cannot exclude other metabolites of ceramide as being involved in activation of NF-κB. However, for this to occur, the following conditions must apply. (i) This metabolite must be sufficient to activate NF-κB, at least in the SV40 cells, (ii) formation of this metabolite or its action must be inhibited by D609, and (iii) this metabolite should be generated in the SV40 cells but not in the WI38 cells. Therefore, based on all the factors in support of SMS and against other metabolites, we favor a role for SMS as the key determinant in the SV40 cells that permits activation of NF-κB following ceramide generation, although additional tools are required to fully substantiate this suggestion. These results may have multiple implications on the physiologic regulation of NF-κB and the possible role of ceramide in this process. The pleiotropic cytokine TNFα activates NF-κB and induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis with resultant ceramide generation in many cell lines. The possible relationship between these two separate observations has generated much discussion and conflicting bodies of evidence. A review is provided by Gamard et al. (19.Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and by Levade and Jaffrézou (29.Levade T. Jaffrézou J.-P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Briefly, Schütze et al. (13.Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) reported activation of NF-κB in permeabilized Jurkat T cells treated with exogenous SMase and nanomolar concentrations of ceramide. The group also found SMase and ceramide-induced I-κB proteolysis in nuclei-free lysates (30.Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schütze S. Baeuerle P. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other groups utilizing intact cell systems met with varying degrees of success in activating NF-κB via exogenous SMase and ceramide treatment (16.Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Johns L.D. Sarr T. Ranges G.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5877-5882PubMed Google Scholar). However, several other groups using intact cells reported no activation of NF-κB with SMase or ceramide (5.Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

In Jurkat cells, we previously reported that TNFα can activate NF-κB independent of ceramide and that ceramide has an inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation by PMA (19.Gamard C.J. Dbaibo G.S. Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The current findings suggest that the discrepancies in the literature may be due to the presence or absence of SMS in the various cell lines utilized in the various studies. Cells with low SMS activity, similar to the normal WI38 fibroblast line, would show no activation of NF-κB by ceramide and possibly a negative feedback of its regulation, whereas those cells with high SMS activity would demonstrate activation. Moreover, the results with D609 further refute the model whereby NF-κB is activated by TNFα through a PC-PLC/acid SMase/ceramide pathway. According to that proposed scenario, ceramide is downstream of the inhibition of PC-PLC by D609, and D609 should inhibit ceramide formation (13.Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 18.Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, when ceramide is generated by bSMase, the activation of NF-κB is still inhibited by D609 without effects on ceramide generation. This necessitates a model where ceramide is upstream of the target of D609. This PC-PLC/acid SMase model is also negated by the lack of inhibition of NF-κB stimulation by TNFα in Niemann-Pick fibroblasts (21.Kuno K. Sukegawa K Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thus ruling out a role for acid SMase. Finally, these results also have three potential implications. First, there are many cellular events that have been attributed to PC-PLC based on studies with D609. These events, such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or the atypical protein kinase C, may need to be reconsidered as potential downstream targets of the SMS pathway or possibly other targets of D609. Second, by potentially monitoring and regulating the effective levels of ceramide and DAG, SMS may assume a key “biostat” role. According to this scenario, high SMS activity can efficiently “convert” a ceramide signal to a DAG one, whereas low activity allows the predominance of the ceramide signal (Fig. 7). Third, SMS may have a physiologic role in regulating NF-κB. It is tempting to speculate that a specific pool of DAG (or subsequent metabolites) formed from PC by the action of SMS may couple many agents to activation of NF-κB."

The interaction of SK with Pm and its relationship to the mechanism of Pg activation were evaluated in equilibrium binding studies with active site-labeled fluorescent Pm derivatives and in kinetic studies of SK-induced changes in the catalytic specificity of Pm. SK bound to fluorescein-labeled and native Pm with dissociation constants of 11 ± 2 pm and 12 ± 4 pm, which represented a 1,000–10,000-fold higher affinity than determined for Pg. Stoichiometric binding of SK to native Pm was followed by generation of a two-fragment form of SK cleaved at Lys59 (SK′), which exhibited an indistinguishable affinity for labeled Pm, while a truncated, SK55–414 species had a 120–360-fold reduced affinity. Binding of SK to native Pm was accompanied by a >50-fold enhancement in specificity for activation of Pg, which was paralleled by a surprising 2.6–10-fold loss of specificity of Pm for 8 of 11 tripeptide-pNA substrates. Further studies with Pm labeled at the active site with 2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid demonstrated directly that binding of SK to Pm resulted in expression of a new substrate binding exosite for Pg on the SK·Pm complex.

SK possesses no intrinsic enzyme activity, but binds specifically to Pg and Pm, converting both the zymogen and proteinase into Pg activators. SK binding to Pg results in the conformational expression of an active catalytic site on the zymogen that cleaves specifically the Arg561-Val562 activation bond in the catalytic domain of Pg to form Pm (3.McClintock D.K.

De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mechanism of conformational activation of Pg and the origin of the dramatic macromolecular substrate specificity change that Pm exhibits upon SK binding are unknown. The x-ray crystal structure of SK bound to the catalytic domain of Pm shows that SK consists of three, similarly-folded globular domains (11.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). SK surrounds the catalytic site, the three domains forming a “three-sided crater” with the active site of Pm at the bottom (11.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The structure suggests that SK may induce a conformational change affecting the specificity of the catalytic site and/or participate directly in the binding of Pg as a substrate (11.Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of these two mechanisms to the change in Pm specificity has not been established. Structure-function correlation studies with recombinant or proteolytic SK derivatives support a direct role for SK in recognition of Pg as a substrate (12.Lin L-F. Oeun S. Houng A. Reed G., L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16879-16885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13.Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P.

SK has been reported to cause modest changes in the kinetic constants for Pm with two peptide chromogenic substrates, suggesting that SK binding may also cause a change in catalytic specificity (9.Wohl R.C.

Quantitative equilibrium binding studies of SK interactions with Pg and Pm are required to define the mechanism of Pg activation and the origin of the SK-induced change in Pm substrate specificity. These studies are complicated by the coupling between the binding interactions and formation of Pm, and the ensuing additional proteolytic reactions catalyzed by Pm. Pm cleaves a 77-residue peptide from the amino terminus of native [Glu]Pg to form [Lys]Pg, which is accompanied by a conformational transition from a compact to an extended conformation that is activated to Pm more rapidly (2.Ponting C.P.

Although the initial products retain activity in Pg activation, proteolysis at a number of other sites results ultimately in inactivation of SK. Intrinsic differences in the affinity of SK for Pg and Pm species accompanying these Pm-catalyzed reactions may contribute to the wide variation in estimates of the affinities of SK-Pg interactions from equilibrium binding studies. Binding studies using primarily surface-immobilized proteins have reported widely disparate dissociation constants for SK binding to [Glu]Pg ranging over ∼10,000-fold, from 28 to 220,000 pm. A similarly undefined range of values have been reported for Pm, and these studies found equivalent affinity of SK for Pg and Pm (10.Cederholm-Williams S.A. De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J.

Fluorescent Pg analogs that are inactivated and covalently labeled at the zymogen catalytic site with probes were developed in previous studies to allow characterization of equilibrium binding interactions of SK in solution and without proteolysis occurring (19.Bock P.E.

In the present studies, this approach was extended to quantitatively characterize the interaction of SK with Pm under such conditions for the first time. Analysis of the fluorescence responses of an array of 16 active site-labeled fluorescent Pm derivatives shows that SK binds with an affinity that is 1,000–10,000 higher than that determined previously for Pg (19.Bock P.E.

This finding supports the novel conclusion that SK conformationally activates Pg in part by stabilization of the active conformation of the zymogen. Stoichiometric binding of SK to native Pm is followed by appearance of SK′ due to enhanced susceptibility of bound SK to cleavage by Pm. Comparison of the affinities of Pm for native SK, SK′, and a recombinant truncation mutant of SK reveals that cleavage at Lys59 alone has little effect on Pm binding, whereas deletion of the amino-terminal 54 residues decreases the affinity greatly. Kinetic studies revealed that the emergence of macromolecular substrate specificity for Pg activation which accompanied binding of SK to Pm was surprisingly linked to an overall decrease in specificity for tripeptide-p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates. Binding of Pg as a substrate of the SK·Pm complex was directly demonstrated to be due to expression of a substrate recognition exosite on the SK·Pm complex. The results support the conclusion that SK binding to Pm induces changes in the catalytic site affecting the substrate-binding subsites, but that these changes are not responsible for the enhanced specificity for activation of Pg, and that an exosite expressed on the SK·Pm complex mediates SK-induced recognition of Pg as a specific substrate. [Glu]Pg carbohydrate form 2 was purified from human plasma (28.Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Bovine Pg was purchased from Hematologic Technologies. Pm was prepared by activation of 10 μm [Glu]Pg with 90 units/ml urokinase (Calbiochem) in 10 mm Mes, 10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 20 mm 6-AHA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.4, at 25 °C, and isolated by affinity chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose by the published method (19.Bock P.E.

Purified Pm was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm 6-AHA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.0, at 4 °C, and stored at −70 °C. Native SK was obtained from Diapharma and purified by affinity chromatography on a column (1.5 × 9 cm) of Pm immobilized onto iodoacetyl-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose through its active site with ATA-FFR-CH2Cl (5.5 mg of Pm coupled/ml of gel) (19.Bock P.E.

Cleaved SK (SK′) was generated by incubation of 30 μm Pg with equimolar SK in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.4, at 25 °C for 10 min. One-tenth volume of 1 m Hepes, 10 mm 6-AHA, pH 7.0, was added, and Pm was inactivated by incubation with 200 μm ATA-FFR-CH2Cl for 15 min. After dialysis against 50 mm Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 15 mm 6-AHA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.0, the inactivated SK′·Pm complex was immobilized onto iodoacetyl-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose through the thiol group of the inhibitor (29.Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13143-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immobilization was initiated by addition of 0.1m NH2OH to the inactivated SK′·Pm complex in the presence of 8 ml of iodoacetyl-(3,3′-iminobispropylamine)-agarose, and followed by rapid mixing at room temperature for 2 h. The gel was washed with the above pH 7 buffer and SK′ was eluted with buffer containing 3 m NaSCN. SK′ was concentrated with a YM-3 membrane and dialyzed against the buffer used for the experiments. Wild-type recombinant SK and a mutant SK species lacking the amino-terminal 54 residues (SK55–414) were those described by Fay and Bokka (30.Fay W.P. Bokka L.V. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and induced in log phase with 3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The collected cells were suspended in 20 ml of pH 7.4 buffer lacking PEG, and containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), FFR-CH2Cl (1 μm), FPR-CH2Cl (1 μm), and aprotinin (1.6 μg/ml), and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing, with addition of DNase I (200 μg/ml) and MgCl2 (80 mm) after the first and last cycles. SK species were precipitated from the lysate by addition of ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation and mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in buffer containing the above inhibitors, and the precipitation was repeated twice. SK species were purified by affinity chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)−1cm−1) and molecular weights; SK, 0.95 and 47,000 (31.Taylor F.B. Botts J.

Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The absorption coefficients for Pm and the SK derivatives were determined from the amino acid composition and the measured absorbances in 0.1m Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, ± 6 mguanidine, pH 7.0 (33.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Pm preparations were 76–90% active, as determined by titration with p-nitrophenylp-guanidinobenzoate or fluorescein mono-p-guanidinobenzoate (34.Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch.

SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) were stained with GELCODE Blue Stain (Pierce) or SYPRO Orange fluorescent protein stain (Molecular Probes). For studies of SK cleavage by Pm, reactions were initiated at 25 °C by addition of Pm and stopped at various times by addition of 30 μmFFR-CH2Cl before preparation of the gel samples. ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and ATA-FPR-CH2Cl were prepared as described previously (36.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Bock P.E. J. Biol.

ATA-FFR-Pm and ATA-FPR-Pm were prepared by incubation of a 5-fold excess of inhibitor with 10–15 μm Pm in 0.1 m Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 6-AHA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for 30–60 min, until inhibition was complete (>99.9%). Excess inhibitor was removed by dialysis against >250 volumes of 50 mm Hepes, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Quantitation of the incorporation of ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and ATA-FPR-CH2Cl from the NH2OH-initiated burst of thiol measured with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (38.Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) gave stoichiometries of 0.8–1.4 mol of thioester/mol of Pm active sites, with no significant free thiol (4 ± 5%) detected. FFR-Pm was prepared by reaction of Pm with FFR-CH2Cl under the conditions given above. For labeling with fluorescence probes, 0.8–1.2-ml reactions of 5–10 μm ATA-FPR-Pm or ATA-FFR-Pm and 70–120 μmof one of eight thiol-reactive probes were initiated by addition of 0.1m NH2OH and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. Excess dye was removed by chromatography on 9-ml columns of Sephadex G-25 (superfine), followed by dialysis in the dark against >2000 volumes of the buffer used for the experiments. The concentrations of the labeled Pm derivatives were determined by absorbance or by micro-bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with FFR-Pm as the standard. The concentrations of incorporated probes for ACR, badan, BODIPY, OG, and RhX were determined from the absorbance in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mguanidine, pH 8.5. Absorption coefficients were determined by comparison of the free label absorbance in the guanidine buffer with the absorbance under the conditions used to determine previously published values (39.Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Sixth Edition. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). The resulting absorption coefficients (mm−1 cm−1) and wavelengths (nm) were: badan, 12.9 and 387; BODIPY, 63.6 and 508; OG, 55.8 and 491; ACR, 15.0 and 391; and RhX, 58.1 and 570. Incorporation of fluorescein and AANS were quantitated using the previously determined coefficients (19.Bock P.E. Day D.E. Verhamme I.M.A. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol.

Stoichiometries of probe incorporation were 0.7–1.5 mol of probe/mol of Pm active sites for all of the derivatives. The derivatives were homogeneous by SDS-gel electrophoresis, with the exception of faint bands corresponding to unlabeled, disulfide-bonded dimeric products (38.Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made with an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer in the ratio mode, using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000. Fluorescence titrations were measured at the excitation and emission wavelength difference maxima for the Pm derivatives, which were determined from spectra (4 nm band pass) in the absence and presence of 5 μm SK. The excitation and emission wavelengths (nm) used in titrations (8 or 16 nm band pass) were: AANS, 332, 456; acrylodan, 396, 502; badan, 399, 502; BODIPY, 513, 525; 5-F and 6-F, 500, 516; OG, 492, 517; and RhX, 578, 601. These values were identical for the ATA-FFR-CH2Cl and ATA-FPR-CH2Cl derivatives, except for [AANS]FPR-Pm (332 nm excitation, 442 nm emission), and [RhX]FPR-Pm (578 nm excitation, 598 nm emission). Fluorescence titrations were performed by sequential addition of small volumes of SK to labeled Pm in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm FFR-CH2Cl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Fluorescence changes were measured after equilibration for 5–10 min, and the measurements were expressed as the fractional change in the initial fluorescence ((F obs−F o )/F o =ΔF/F o). Fluorescence changes were corrected for background by subtraction of measurements made on blanks lacking the labeled protein. For titrations in which labeled Pm derivatives were screened for SK-induced fluorescence changes, concentrations of labeled Pm were 50 pm to 82 nm, which were the lowest concentrations that could be used for each label to give background signals of <20%. Titrations were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the quadratic binding equation, with the maximum fluorescence change (ΔF max /F o), dissociation constant (K D), and stoichiometric factor (n) as the fitted parameters. Measurements of the effect of native Pm on SK binding to [5-F]FFR-Pm were made following single additions of SK to cuvettes containing 75 pm [5-F]FFR-Pm and constant levels of native Pm, after a fixed incubation time of 10 min. The titrations were fit simultaneously by the equation for competitive binding of SK to native and labeled Pm to obtain the two dissociation constants, the stoichiometric factor for native Pm binding, and the maximum fluorescence change (40.Olson S.T. Bock P.E. Sheffer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41.Lindahl P. Raub-Segall E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The effect of SK on the kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of tripeptide-pNA substrates by Pm was measured from the initial rates (<5% substrate depletion) at 405 nm and 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 0.125m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG, pH 7.4, in polyethylene glycol 20,000-coated cuvettes. All of the substrates were obtained from commercial sources except PGR-pNA which was synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA) and was 98% pure. Concentrations of peptide-pNA substrates were determined from the absorbance at 342 nm using an absorption coefficient of 8,266m−1 cm−1, and product concentrations were calculated using an absorption coefficient of 9,933m−1 cm−1 (35.Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Blinder M. Binder E.P. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42.Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by addition of 0.25–100 nm Pm to buffer containing substrate in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of SK (100–500 nm). The results were fit by the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain K m andk cat. Substrate concentrations ranged up to 2 mm, representing 0.3–19 × K m. The difference in Gibbs free energy between the transition state for a substrate containing a single amino acid substitution compared with that of a reference substrate was calculated as, ΔGsubs=−RTlnssrefEquation 1 where s and s ref are the specificity constants (k cat /K m) for hydrolysis of the substrate and the reference substrate, respectively. ΔΔG subs was calculated by subtraction of ΔG subs in the absence of SK from that in the presence of saturating SK. The Gibbs free energy for the SK-induced change in specificity for a single substrate (ΔG SK) was calculated with Equation 2, ΔGSK=−RTlnsSKsEquation 2 where s and s SK are the specificity constants in the absence and presence of saturating SK, respectively. Initial rates of pyro-EPR-pNA hydrolysis as a function of Pm, SK, and substrate concentrations were analyzed with a model in which SK acts as a hyperbolic mixed-type modifier of Pm activity (Scheme 1; Ref. 43.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar).

SK binds to Pm with dissociation constant, K D, and to the Pm-substrate complex (Pm·S) with dissociation constant, αK D. The dependence of the initial velocity (v obs) on the total concentrations of substrate ([S]o), the active Pm concentration ([Pm]o), and the free SK concentration ([SK]f) is given by Equation 3 (43.Segel I.H.

The data collected as a function of SK and substrate concentrations were expressed asv obs/[Pm]o and fit globally by Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 to obtain K s, K D, α, and β, with the stoichiometric factor for SK binding fixed at 1.3 mol of SK/mol of Pm. The initial rate of bovine Pg (BPg) activation by mixtures of SK and Pm was measured by continuous monitoring of the increase in absorbance of Tos-GPR-pNA at 405 nm (A 405 nm). The parabolic progress curves of pNA formation were fit by Equation 6 (8.Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Arzadon L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, it is widely recognized that the oxidative metabolism of ethanol elicits a complex interplay of factors, including mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmune-mediated cell injury, oxidative stress, and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the development of the disease (1.Lieber C.S.

Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 1085-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Ross W.A. Gordon E.R. Lieber C.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1981; 98: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these effects, it has been shown that acetaldehyde increases the transcription of collagen in several cell types (8.Brenner D.A.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) mediated by enhanced DNA binding of transcription factors NF-1 and SP-1 to specific sites located in the promoter of the α2(I) collagen gene (12.Anania F.A.

Biophys. 1995; 341: 140-152Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, regulation of gene expression can be dramatically enhanced by the binding of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to promoter cis-acting elements. NF-κB and AP-1 are transcription factors whose role in gene regulation is widely recognized (14.Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Scott C. Herrmann F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4824-4830Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The DNA binding subunits of NF-κB belong to a multigene family that comprise several members including p50, p65 (Rel A), c-Rel, p-52, and RelB. These proteins share a domain required for DNA binding, forming homo- and heterodimers, IκB binding, and nuclear localization (15.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 16.Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 270: 297-311Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 17.Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AP-1 is a transcriptional activator composed of members of the Jun and Fos families. These proteins associate to form homo- and heterodimer complexes through a leucine zipper domain that bind to a common site (18.Abate C. Patel L. Ramcher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 19.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 20.Karin M. J.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The final step in the gene regulation of both transcription factors is the translocation of the active complex to the nuclei followed by the binding to specific DNA sequences. However, unlike the AP-1 complex, NF-κB activation combines several mechanisms used by other transcription factors such as phosphorylation at specific residues of the inhibitory subunit IκB followed by its degradation and translocation of the active NF-κB into the nuclei. Both transcription factors become activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, UV irradiation, and oxidative stress (18.Abate C. Patel L. Ramcher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 21.Johnson P.F. McNight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 22.Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). NF-κB and AP-1 control the inducible expression of a variety of genes that are involved in immune response as well as inflammatory and cellular defense mechanisms, including cytokines, cytokine receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and hematopoietic growth factors (15.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 20.Karin M. J. Biol.

Previous studies in experimental animal models of ALD have shown that overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, is a critical event in the progression of ALD as it has been shown that neutralization of tumor necrosis factor-α attenuates hepatic necrosis and inflammation caused by chronic ethanol feeding (23.Honchel R.

On the other hand, as transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 are recognized to up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hence, it can be inferred that both NF-κB and AP-1 would be of relevance in the development of ALD. However, because the role of acetaldehyde on NF-κB and AP-1 activation has not been definitively established, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the DNA binding and transactivation of NF-κB and AP-1 and the mechanisms involved in HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of acetaldehyde. The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wilts, UK) and grown at 37 °C in 5%CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose levels. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). A 174 mm stock solution of acetaldehyde was prepared daily in PBS. The cell cultures were then incubated with acetaldehyde at a wide range of concentration (50–200 μm) in serum-free medium in 25-cm2 flasks for up to 24 h, and the flasks were kept tightly closed with parafilm to prevent evaporation of acetaldehyde. In some cases, cells were preincubated with protein kinase C inhibitors, H7 or calphostin C, and the effect of acetaldehyde on activation of AP-1 and NF-κB was examined as described below. Nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells (3 × 106) were prepared by lysing cells with Nonidet P-40 followed by differential centrifugation as described before (27.Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mol Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar,28.Morales A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Marı́ M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30371-30379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and collected with a rubber policemen after 1, 4, and 24 h of incubation with acetaldehyde. Cells were resuspended in buffer 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml TLCK and kept on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed with Nonidet P-40 (10%), and the nuclear pellet was recovered after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 0. 4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml TLCK and stored at −80 °C. Activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 was examined using consensus oligonucleotides of NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′), respectively. Probes were labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase as described (27.Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Morales A. Kaplowitz N. Fernández-Checa J.C. Mol Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 825-834PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Morales A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Marı́ M. Colell A. Ardite E. Fernández-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30371-30379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Binding reactions included 10 μg of nuclear extracts or cytostolic fractions in incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 4% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and labeled oligonucleotide (30,000 cpm). The mixture was electrophoresed, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C overnight. Band specificity was determined by competition experiments using a molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB or AP-1 to the nuclear extracts before the addition of labeled probes. In some cases, supershift assays were done using human antibodies for p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, and RelB. Antibodies used were kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (29.Rice N.R. Mackicham M.L. Israell A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibody anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to immunoprecipitate the AP-1 complex containing c-Jun before the addition of labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide. To measure the transactivating activity of NF-κB and AP-1, HepG2 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct controlled by κB and AP-1 binding sites using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). In each experiment, six 35-mm wells containing 6 × 105 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of a DNA construct composed of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of four tandem κB (pNF-κB-Luc) or AP-1 (pAP-1-Luc) binding sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (CLONTECH) and 1.5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega) as control to monitor transfection efficiency. Alternatively, the 5′-flanking region of the IL-8 gene spanning from base pairs −133 to +44, encompasing the AP-1, NF-IL6, and κB binding sites, was subcloned into the luciferase expression vector as described (30.Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Yasumoto K. Rice N. Ishikawa Y. Horiguchi H. Murakaima S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8582-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA constructs were diluted in OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with acetaldehyde, okadaic acid, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 2–4 h. Following incubation cells were harvested in 350 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and supernatants (20 μl) were used to determine luciferase activity using a EG&Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. To determine the presence of c-Jun in nuclei, 15 μg of nuclear proteins obtained as described above were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were stained with Ponceau S to confirm the uniformity of protein loading in each lane. Membranes were blocked with 8% (w/v) nonfat milk in Tween-PBS (T-PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the antibody anti-c-Jun at a dilution of 1:1000 in T-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times with T-PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) at a dilution of 1:3000 at room temperature for 45 min. Immunodetections were carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in which membranes were exposed to Hyperfilms ECL. Cellular extracts from lysed HepG2 cells using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0, 2 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml TLCK, were obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. Cellular proteins (15 μg) were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the membranes were incubated with antibody anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 in T-PBS for 2 h at room temperature followed by ECL detection. To determine the effect of acetaldehyde on NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding in a cell-free system, a cytosolic fraction was prepared from untreated HepG2 cells. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were resuspended in an hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml TLCK) followed by 10 up and down passes in a glass Teflon homogenizer. Homogenization was verified by examination on a hemocytometer with a phase contrast microscope to confirm the absence of intact cells. The resulting homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting cytosolic extracts were then incubated with acetaldehyde, formamide, or deoxycholate for 30 min, and then activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was analyzed by EMSA as described above. Statistical analyses of mean values for multiple comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's test. Transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 are known to regulate expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the binding of these proteins to specific regulatory sites located in the promoter/enhancer of the target gene (14.Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Scott C. Herrmann F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4824-4830Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 16.Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 270: 297-311Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 31.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). However, because the role of acetaldehyde in the activation of these transcription factors has not been fully characterized, we examined the effect of acetaldehyde on activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in HepG2 cells. Nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells were isolated at various times after acetaldehyde addition, and NF-κB and AP-1 activation were determined as binding of members of these transcription factors to consensus κB and AP-1 oligonucleotides. Acetaldehyde activated NF-κB as demonstrated by the retarded complexes detected by EMSA using labeled κB oligonucleotide, an effect that was significant for complexes I and II (Fig.1). Similarly, an enhanced DNA binding of AP-1 in nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 incubated in the presence of acetaldehyde was detected (Fig. 2). However, the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 caused by acetaldehyde occurred with distinct kinetics, being detected within 1 and 4 h, respectively, of acetaldehyde treatment of HepG2 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). To determine the specificity of the enhanced DNA binding for either transcription factor induced by acetaldehyde, an excess of the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide was used (Figs. 1and 2). The retarded complexes of NF-κB and AP-1 were displaced by unlabeled κB and AP-1 oligonucleotides, respectively. A similar enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 was observed at lower acetaldehyde concentrations, 50–150 μm, as shown recently (32.Roman J. Colell A. Blasco C. Caballeria J. Parés A. Rodés J. Fernández-Checa J.C. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings reveal the ability of acetaldehyde to increase the binding to specific DNA sequences of NF-κB and AP-1. Similar to these findings with HepG2 cells, primary cultured rat hepatocytes displayed enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 following exposure to acetaldehyde (not shown).Figure 2Activation of AP-1 by acetaldehyde. A , nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of 200 μm acetaldehyde were prepared at different times as indicated. Activation of AP-1 analyzed by EMSA using specific labeled oligonucleotide encompassing the consensus AP-1 sequence was calculated relative to control at every time point.B, the specificity of AP-1 activation was verified using excess unlabeled oligonucleotides for AP-1 and NF-κB. Only an excess of unlabeled AP-1 oligonucleotide displaced the activated AP-1 complex. Results are the mean ± S.D. of four individual experiments. *,p < 0.05 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the presence of individual components of NF-κB, different human antibodies against individual members of the NF-κB family were used. Nuclear extracts were incubated with labeled κB consensus oligonucleotide and with polyclonal antibodies against p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB. p50, p52, and p65 antibodies resulted in supershifted bands, indicating that acetaldehyde activated the heterodimers p50/p65 and p50/p52, denoted by the arrows in Fig. 3. Interestingly, a lower molecular weight complex not shifted by any of the antibodies used was also detected, the identity of which remains to be established. However, this undetermined complex was specific for κB binding as it was displaced by an excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 1). The product of the proto-oncogene c-jun is a component of transcription factor AP-1 (18.Abate C. Patel L. Ramcher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 19.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 20.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Hence, we assessed its presence in the activated AP-1 complex by determining the levels of c-Jun in nuclear extracts prepared from acetaldehyde-treated HepG2 cells. As shown, acetaldehyde increased c-Jun levels, an effect that was dependent on the dose of acetaldehyde (Fig.4). The presence of c-Jun in nuclear extracts correlated with the greater DNA binding of AP-1 caused by increasing concentrations of acetaldehyde (Fig. 4), suggesting the presence of c-Jun in the activated AP-1 complex. Indeed, the immunoprecipitation from nuclear extracts using antibody anti-c-Jun abolished the binding of AP-1 to DNA (not shown).Figure 4Correlation between c-junexpression and AP-1 activation. A, nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells incubated with increasing doses of acetaldehyde for 5 h were prepared and analyzed for c-Jun levels by Western blot. B, parallel aliquots of nuclear extracts were used for AP-1 activation by EMSA using a specific labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the above findings indicate that acetaldehyde enhanced the binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 using EMSA, this approach fails to underscore the potential of acetaldehyde to regulate gene expression. Thus, to determine unambiguously whether the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 caused by acetaldehyde stimulates κB- and AP-1-controlled gene expression, we examined the transactivation potential of these transcription factors in HepG2 cells using a luciferase reporter gene construct containing κB or AP-1 binding sites upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. As seen, acetaldehyde induced the κB- and AP-1-dependent luciferase expression similar to okadaic acid and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, known activators of κB and AP-1, respectively (Fig.5). Similar findings were observed using a luciferase expression vector containing a 5′-flanking fragment of the IL-8 gene encompassing AP-1, NF-IL6, and κB binding sites (30.Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Yasumoto K. Rice N. Ishikawa Y. Horiguchi H. Murakaima S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8582-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). Therefore, these findings show that acetaldehyde enhances DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1, which activate the transcription of synthetic and natural promoters, indicating that these transcription factors may be components of a complex of additional transcriptional regulators, which trigger the inducible expression of target genes. As wild type HepG2 cells do not express the enzymes required for the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, namely alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P4502E1 (33.Clemens D. Halgard C.M. Miles R. Sorrel M.F. Tuma D. Arch. Biochem. Biosphys. 1995; 321: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34.Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), acetaldehyde cannot be converted back to ethanol, suggesting that acetaldehyde itself may play a direct role in controlling gene expression through activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Indeed consistent with these findings, we observed that the culture of HepG2 cells with acetaldehyde increased IL-8 and transforming growth factor-β1 mRNA levels, two genes known to be controlled by κB and AP-1 binding sites, respectively (35.Yasumoto K. Okamoto S.I. Mukaida N. Murakama S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 36.Leonarduzzi G. Scavazza A. Blasi F. Chiarpotto E. Camandola S. Vogl S. Dargel R. Poli G. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) (not shown). Thus, taken together our data suggest that acetaldehyde may play an additional role in the pathogenesis of ALD by triggering the inducible expression of inflammatory cytokines through the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Having shown that acetaldehyde enhances the binding of NF-κB to DNA, we next determined the levels of IκB-α in cellular extracts of HepG2 cells following exposure to acetaldehyde, as IκB-α degradation following phosphorylation has been described as a predominant pathway for NF-κB activation (15.Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 16.Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 270: 297-311Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 17.Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, there was a correlation between the degradation of IκB-α determined by Western analyses in cellular extracts and enhanced nuclear DNA binding of NF-κB caused by incubation of HepG2 cells with acetaldehyde for 60 min (Fig. 6). These findings demonstrate that NF-κB activation is because of the degradation of IκB-α induced by acetaldehyde, suggesting the involvement of the IκB kinase complex, which phosphorylates IκB-α at specific serine residues, preceding its proteolytic degradation by the proteosome (37.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 38.Mercurio F.M. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Future work must be aimed to determine whether or not acetaldehyde activates the IκB kinase complex. Our findings, however, contrast with recent observations by Jokelainenet al. (40.Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showing that acetaldehyde diminished the proteolytic degradation of IκB-α preventing the activation of NF-κB in rat Kupffer cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide because of the preservation of IκB-α levels. Experimental variations,e.g. incubation time, differences in the type of cells used, Kupffer cells versus HepG2 cells, or acetaldehyde concentration may have determined the differential outcome obtained. Although these studies suggested that acetaldehyde may form an adduct with IκB-α making the protein less susceptible to degradation, the inhibitory effect of acetaldehyde on the lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation appeared to be significant only at low acetaldehyde concentration (25–50 μm) (40.Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although these findings of Jokelainen et al. (40.Jokelainen K. Thomas P. Lindros K. Nanji A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), are intriguing and imply that acetaldehyde may function as a NF-κB repressor hence playing a potential anti-inflammatory role in ALD, the in vivo significance of their observation is uncertain as up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α, a gene regulated by NF-κB, is a hallmark feature of ALD and is recognized as a key factor for the development of the disease (26.Iimuro Y.

To address whether degradation of IκB-α is required for NF-κB activation and if acetaldehyde may exert a direct role in regulating the DNA binding of NF-κB, cytosolic extracts from untreated HepG2 cells were prepared and then incubated with acetaldehyde monitoring the DNA binding of NF-κB and IκB-α levels. As shown, incubation of cytosolic extracts with formamide increased the binding of NF-κB to DNA in agreement with previous reports (44.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using deoxycholate (not shown). Interestingly, acetaldehyde mimicked the effect elicited by formamide as revealed by the similar pattern of DNA binding of NF-κB in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 7). However, this process required a high acetaldehyde concentration, as acetaldehyde below 1 mm failed to enhance DNA binding of NF-κB (not shown). The activation of NF-κB in cytosolic extracts was a specific event as in intact cells, because an excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide displaced the DNA binding of NF-κB (not shown). Furthermore, the identification of individual components of NF-κB was performed in supershift assays using specific antibodies. Incubation of cytosolic extracts after acetaldehyde exposure with antibodies against p65 and p50 revealed a pattern of retarded complexes that differed from that obtained in nuclear extracts, as the heterodimer p65/p50 was the only complex detected (Figs. 3 and 7 A). In addition, because acetaldehyde signaled the degradation of IκB-α in intact cells resulting in NF-κB activation, we determined the levels of IκB-α in cytosolic extracts incubated with acetaldehyde. The levels of IκB-α remained unchanged, despite the fact that acetaldehyde activated NF-κB (Fig. 7 B). Having shown an increased DNA binding of NF-κB in cytolic extracts caused by acetaldehyde addition, we next examined the effect of acetaldehyde in the DNA binding of AP-1 in this paradigm. The addition of acetaldehyde at a wide range of concentrations failed to enhance the binding of AP-1 to DNA (Fig.7 C). Such an outcome contrasts with the lack of effect of acetaldehyde to enhance the DNA binding of AP-1 at the same concentration range. Although the significance of the preceding findings is unclear because of the exceedingly high, supra-physiological, acetaldehyde concentration required for this process, it could be speculated that such a putative, additional pathway for NF-κB activation by acetaldehyde may play a role in advanced stages of the disease accompanied by impaired mitochondrial acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, facilitating the accumulation of acetaldehyde, similar to the marked increase of acetaldehyde concentration in the livers from chronic ethanol-fed rats following inhibition of acetaldehdye dehydrogenase (45.Lindros K.O. Jokelainen K. Nanji A.A. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 799-806PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of the activity of many transcription factors. It may regulate subcellular localization, dimerization, binding to DNA, or the transactivation protential. Phosphorylation is an important regulator of NF-κB activation through the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the inhibitor IκB-α after phosphorylation at specific serine residues (31.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 37.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V.

On the other hand, previous studies have shown that acetaldehyde induces the levels of c-Jun through a PKC-dependent mechanism and enhances murine α2(I) collagen promoter mediated by PKC activation (46.Imbert V. Rupec R. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E. Mueller-Dickerman C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F.

HepG2 cells were preincubated with the PKC inhibitor H7, and the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 caused by acetaldehyde was assessed by EMSA. As shown, H7 abolished the DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 enhanced by acetaldehyde (Fig. 8). The effect of H7 on suppressing NF-κB activation induced by acetaldehyde is in line with previous studies by Imbert et al. (46.Imbert V. Rupec R. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.

Furthermore, previous studies indicated that H7 lowered the inducing effect of acetaldehyde on α2(I) collagen mRNA in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells by decreasing the c-jun mRNA (46.Imbert V. Rupec R. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E. Mueller-Dickerman C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F.

Alcohol Alcohol. 1994; 29: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar). Although H7 is a potent PKC inhibitor, it may also inhibit other serine/threonine protein kinases, and hence we used a highly specific PKC inhibitor, calphostin C. This inhibitor mimicked the abolishing effect of H7 on the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 caused by acetaldehyde (not shown). Thus, these findings suggest the involvement of PKC in the enhanced NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding by acetaldehyde. The mechanism whereby acetaldehyde activates PKC is presently unknown. Futher work will be required to determine the role of recognized activating PKC factors,e.g. Ca2+, and diacylglycerol, and the identity of specific PKC isoforms involved in the enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1 caused by acetaldehyde. It is recognized that acetaldehyde activates transcription factors NF-1 and SP-1, which mediate the inducible expression of collagen (8.Brenner D.A. Chojkier M. J. Biol.

The present study provides compelling evidence that NF-κB and AP-1 are activated by acetaldehyde in HepG2 cells. Because NF-κB and AP-1 are recognized to control the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, our data may be of significance in the pathogenesis of ALD. The present findings extend recent observations in HepG2 cells analyzing the differential effect of ethanol versus acetaldehyde in the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 (32.Roman J. Colell A. Blasco C. Caballeria J. Parés A. Rodés J. Fernández-Checa J.C. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that acetaldehyde itself plays a role in inducing gene expression through enhanced DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1, implying that acetaldehyde, in addition to its recognized role in cell dysfunction, may also contribute to the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, a critical event in the manifestations of the ethanol-induced cytotoxicity (26.Iimuro Y. Gallucci R.M. Luster M.I. Kono H. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 32.Roman J. Colell A. Blasco C. Caballeria J. Parés A. Rodés J.

Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 170-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recent observations have shown that disulfiram and benzcoprine, two inhibitors of aldehyde dehydrogenase that increase acetaldehyde levels, prevent NF-κB activation and subsequent inflammation in chronic ethanol-fed rats (45.Lindros K.O. Jokelainen K. Nanji A.A. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 799-806PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an apparent contrast between our findings and those of Lindros et al. (45.Lindros K.O. Jokelainen K. Nanji A.A. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 799-806PubMed Google Scholar) seems to emerge. Although the differential outcome obtained may reflect differences in the experimental model used, the in vivo findings did not provide direct evidence for a specific causal role of acetaldehyde in the prevention of NF-κB activation in ethanol-fed rats. Furthermore, the possibility that the findings reported may have been due, at least in part, to a putative anti-inflammatory activity of disulfiram or benzcoprine was not addressed, raising the concern that part of the attenuating effect of NF-κB activation in ethanol-fed rats may have been caused by these agents. Our present in vitro study demonstrates the ability of acetaldehyde to activate transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 by a mechanism probably mediated by PKC activation. In summary, the present in vitro study describes a new role for acetaldehyde in the progression of alcohol-induced dysfunction underscoring the potential of acetaldehyde to up-regulate the expression of genes that play a key role in the development of ALD."

This effect is due in part to the ability of glucocorticoids to induce the transcription of genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)1 and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) (1.Granner D.

A glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) that consists of two glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory elements (gAF1, 2We originally designated the accessory factor elements AF1, AF2, and AF3 in the order of their discovery.

A mutation of any of these accessory elements results in a 50% reduction of glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription, and a combination of any two mutations of the accessory elements abolishes the glucocorticoid response (3.Imai E.

Indeed, GR1 and GR2, either alone or in combination, cannot mediate a glucocorticoid response when placed in the context of a heterologous promoter (9.Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.-E. Wang J.-C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the glucocorticoid response of the PEPCK gene is completely dependent on accessory factor elements and the proteins that bind to these sites. In recent studies we have shown that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor and HNF4 bind to gAF1 (4.Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Much of this regulation is accomplished through N- and C-terminal transactivation domains (15.Pani L. Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Qian X. Lai E. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal domain is required for accessory factor activity in the PEPCK gene GRU, whereas the N-terminal transactivation domain does not support this function (16.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, HNF3 also functions as an accessory factor in many other GRUs, such as those located in the tyrosine aminotransferase, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene promoters (12.Zimmermann P.L. Pierreux C.E. Rigaud G. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13.O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional interaction between HNF3 and GR appears to be a common mechanism for glucocorticoid-regulated gene transcription. Although a considerable amount is known about the organization of the GRUs of various promoters, little is known about how the different components actually influence hepatic glucose production from gluconeogenesis.In this study recombinant adenoviruses that express structural variants of HNF3β were constructed to study the role this family of proteins plays in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in H4IIE hepatoma cells. We show that adenovirus-mediated expression of a form of HNF3β that lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain results in a decrease of glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK and G-6-Pase gene transcription. Exposure of H4IIE hepatoma cells to the same adenovirus reduces glucose production in proportion to the decreased rate of expression of these genes. By contrast, an HNF3β variant protein that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain does not support the glucocorticoid response on gene expression, nor does it influence gluconeogenesis. These results confirm the importance of HNF3β in the regulation of glucocorticoid-stimulated gene expression and provide direct evidence for the critical role of the protein in the regulation of gluconeognesis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious experiments have shown that HNF3β, by binding to the gAF2 element in the GRU, serves as an accessory factor for glucocorticoid-mediated activation of PEPCK gene expression. This effect requires the C-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β but is not dependent on the N-terminal transactivation domain (16.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that a protein lacking the C-terminal transactivation domain would bind DNA and compete with the endogenous protein with regard to glucocorticoid accessory factor activity. This protein, if abundantly expressed in H4IIE cells, should blunt the response of the PEPCK gene to glucocorticoids in a manner equivalent to a mutation or deletion of gAF2 (3.Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T.

If this gene is centrally involved in gluconeogenesis, as is suggested by metabolic control strength studies, glucocorticoid-mediated glucose production from noncarbohydrate precursors should also be decreased (22.Rognstad R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1875-1878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, a recombinant adenovirus (Ad-HNF3βΔC) that lacks this C-terminal domain was constructed. A second recombinant adenovirus was prepared in which the N-terminal transactivation domain of HNF3β was deleted (Ad-HNF3βΔN). The latter construct served as a control because it retains accessory factor activity (16.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). A gel mobility shift assay was used to confirm that these two HNF3β mutants/proteins are expressed in H4IIE hepatoma cells after the cells are exposed to the adenoviruses. The C-terminal truncated protein is smaller than the N-terminal truncated protein, thus the protein-DNA complex formed from extracts of HNF3βΔC-treated cells migrates faster than its counterpart from HNF3βΔN-treated cells (Fig.1, compare lanes 7 and10). The formation of both protein-DNA complexes was blocked by adding an antiserum directed against HNF3β but not by an antiserum directed against LexA (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9 and10–12). These experiments confirm that the truncated HNF3β proteins are expressed in H4IIE cells. Furthermore, the expression level of these two HNF3β proteins was approximately equal, and both were expressed in excess of the endogenous HNF3β (Fig. 1,lanes 1–6). The treatment of H4IIE cells with a recombinant adenovirus that contains a cDNA that expresses β-glactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) did not influence the binding pattern of HNF3β proteins in the gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–3with lanes 4–6).The HL1C cell line is a stable transfectant of H4IIE cells that contains the PEPCK gene promoter from −2100 to +69, relative to the transcription start site, ligated to the CAT reporter gene. The regulation of CAT gene expression and activity recapitulates the hormonal regulation of the endogenous PEPCK gene in these cells so they are very useful in studying PEPCK promoter activity (17.Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23.O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HL1C cells exposed to 500 nm DEX overnight exhibit a 20-fold induction of CAT activity (Fig. 2). As previously demonstrated, treatment of HL1C cells with the Ad-β-Gal adenovirus does not influence the DEX response of these cells (Fig. 2and Ref. 20.Scott D.K. O'Doherty R.M. Stafford J.M. Newgard C.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24145-24151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The DEX response was, however, reduced by about 50% when HL1C cells were treated with Ad-HNF3βΔC. By contrast, the DEX response of HL1C cells treated with HNF3βΔN was unaffected (Fig.2). These results are consistent with our previous findings showing that a deletion or a mutation of the HNF3-binding site (gAF2) of the PEPCK gene promoter resulted in a 50–70% reduction of the response of this gene to glucocorticoids (3.Imai E.

These results also confirm the observation that the C-terminal transactivation domain is required for the accessory activity of the PEPCK glucocorticoid response and that the N-terminal domain is not necessary (16.Wang J.C.

Ribonuclease protection assays were used to measure PEPCK mRNA (Fig.3). Overnight exposure of H4IIE cells to DEX resulted in a 3-fold induction of PEPCK mRNA (Fig. 3, comparelanes 1 and 2). The prior treatment of the cells with either Ad-β-Gal (lanes 3 and 4) or Ad-HNF3βΔN (lanes 7 and 8) had no significant effect on this induction, which is due to an increased rate of transcription of the gene (24.Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15242-15251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, treatment of cells with Ad-HNF3βΔC decreased the glucocorticoid-stimulated PEPCK mRNA response by about 50% and the basal expression of the PEPCK gene by about 20% (lanes 5 and 6). β-Actin mRNA was not affected by DEX or by the prior treatment with any of the adenovirus constructs. These results demonstrate the importance of HNF3 in the regulation of the endogenous PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids and are consistent with the conclusions derived from previous studies (7.Wang J.-C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar,16.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of the PEPCK gene is markedly reduced when the HNF3 DNA-binding domain, which does not contain either of the transactivation domains, is stably transfected into hepatoma cells (25.Vallet V. Antoine B. Chafey P. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5453-5460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the PEPCK gene is reduced in mice carrying a null mutation of the gene encoding HNF3γ (26.Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Figure 3Adenovirus-mediated expression of HNF3βΔC represses glucocorticoid-induced PEPCK mRNA in H4IIE cells.

Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are several HNF3-binding sites in the G-6-Pase gene promoter (28.Lin B. Morris D.W. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14096-14106Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), so we tested for effects of the HNF3β mutants on the expression of the endogenous G-6-Pase gene (Fig. 3). Adenovirus-mediated expression of HNF3βΔC, but not HNF3βΔN, repressed glucocorticoid-stimulated G-6-Pase mRNA levels (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7 and8). Although HNF3 is not known to be an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response of the G-6-Pase gene, the results here suggest that it may serve this function. This would not be surprising because HNF3 is an accessory factor for the glucocorticoid response of the tyrosine aminotransferase, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase genes (12.Zimmermann P.L. Pierreux C.E. Rigaud G. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13.O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Because HNF3βΔC reduced the glucocorticoid-mediated induction of PEPCK and G-6-Pase gene expression, we predicted that this treatment would also decrease glucocorticoid-stimulated gluconeogenesis. We therefore measured glucose production in H4IIE cells after exposure to the recombinant adenoviruses. The low basal glucose production from gluconeogenesis in H4IIE cells is increased 5-fold by an overnight exposure of the cells to DEX (Fig. 4). Adenovirus-mediated expression of HNF3βΔC reduced glucocorticoid-induced glucose production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). By contrast, the expression of HNF3βΔN had a small stimulatory effect on glucocorticoid-stimulated gluconeogenesis in these cells, and the expression of β-galactosidase had no effect (Fig. 4). Thus, the HNF3βΔC-mediated effect on gluconeogenesis corresponds to its ability to decrease the expression of two genes, PEPCK and G-6-Pase, that encode gluconeogenic enzymes. The important role of HNF3 in the regulation of glucose homeostasis has been proposed previously, but its direct role in gluconeogenesis has not been previously explored. HNF3 could be a master regulator of metabolism because it can regulate the expression of HNF4 and HNF1 genes, which in turn regulate the expression of several genes that encode enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (29.Dukes I.D. Sreenan S. Roe M.W. Levisetti M. Zhou Y.P. Ostrega D. Bell G.I. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. Philipson L. Polonsky K.S. J. Biol.

In fact, mutations in either the HNF4 or the HNF1 gene are associated with specific forms of maturity onset diabetes of the young, in which defective insulin secretion is the primary pathophysiologic feature (32.Yamagata K.

Our results provide direct evidence for a critical role of HNF3 in hepatic gluconeogenesis.Figure 4Adenovirus-mediated expression of HNF3βΔC represses glucocorticoid-induced glucose production in H4IIE cells. Control H4IIE cells or cells infected with Ad-β-Gal, Ad-HNF3βΔN, or Ad-HNF3βΔC overnight were treated with or without 500 nm dexamethasone for another 18 h. The amount of virus used was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, supplemented with 20 mm sodium lactate and 2 mmsodium pyruvate for 3 h. The glucose concentration was measured in the extracellular medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results are presented as percentages relative to the glucose produced by DEX-treated H4IIE cells (100%). Data represent the means (± S.E.) glucose, corrected for total cell protein, of at least three experiments.

The DEX response of cells transfected with Ad-HNF3βΔN was different (p < 0.05) from cells transfected with Ad-β-Gal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The different isoforms of HNF3 may have specific effects. The hypoglycemia of HNF3α knock-out mice has been linked to the reduction of glucagon gene expression in pancreatic α cells, but the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme genes was not altered in these animals (34.Kaestner K.H. Katz J. Liu Y. Drucker D.J. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). By contrast, targeted disruption of the HNF3γ gene in mice results in decreased expression of the PEPCK and tyrosine aminotransferase genes, whereas the expression of the G-6-Pase, albumin, and transthyretin genes was not affected (26.Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The lack of HNF3γ results in a mild phenotype that could be explained by a complementary increase of HNF3α and β gene expression (26.Kaestner K.H. Hiemisch H. Schutz G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our strategy of using the expression of HNF3β mutants that can bind to all HNF3-binding sites cannot be used to distinguish the specific role of each member of HNF3 family, but it does avoid the complications that arise from the compensation provided by other HNF3 proteins when one member of the family is eliminated. We were able to use this strategy to study the function of the HNF3 family in the regulation of gene expression and glucose production.In summary, this report provides direct evidence for the role of the HNF3 family of proteins in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. The importance of HNF3 in glucocorticoid-stimulated expression of the PEPCK and G-6-Pase genes suggests that modulation of the function of HNF3 could influence the excessive rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis that is part of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As an extension of this view, the intricate structure of the PEPCK GRU, which requires many transcription factors other than GR for a complete glucocorticoid response, may provide an opportunity for the pharmaceutical manipulation of gluconeogenesis. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis is one of the important functions of glucocorticoids. This effect is due in part to the ability of glucocorticoids to induce the transcription of genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)1 and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) (1.Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which glucocorticoids regulate transcription of the PEPCK gene has been studied in detail. A glucocorticoid response unit (GRU) that consists of two glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding sites (GR1 and GR2) and four accessory elements (gAF1, 2We originally designated the accessory factor elements AF1, AF2, and AF3 in the order of their discovery.

To understand how it contributes to β-cell development and function, we characterized its DNA binding and transactivation properties. A single copy of the homeodomain of Nkx6.1 binds to a strictly conserved 8-base pair DNA consensus sequence, TTAATTAC; even minor variations to this consensus reduce DNA binding affinity significantly. Full-length Nkx6.1, however, has markedly reduced DNA binding affinity due to an acidic domain at the carboxyl end of the molecule that functions as a mobile binding interference domain capable of interrupting the interaction between DNA and DNA binding domains of the helix-turn-helix type. When expressed in fibroblast cell lines, Nkx6.1 represses transcription through isolated Nkx6.1 binding sites; in β-cell lines, Nkx6.1 specifically represses the intact insulin promoter through TAAT-containing sequences. In Gal4 one-hybrid fusion studies, transcriptional repression maps to a discreet region within the amino terminus. Our findings suggest a model in which Nkx6.1, regulated by interactions through its carboxyl terminus, directs the repression of specific genes in developing and mature β-cells. β-Cell differentiation factor Nkx6.1 is a homeodomain protein expressed in developing and mature β-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans.

Recently, Nkx6.1 has been identified as a member of this pancreatic network of transcription factors and has been shown to specifically control β-cell differentiation (11.Sander, M., Kalamaras, J., and German, M. S. (1998) Keystone Symposium on Vertebrate Development, Steamboat Springs, CO, April 3-8, 1998Google Scholar). Nkx6.1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that is initially expressed broadly in the developing pancreatic bud, but eventually becomes restricted exclusively to the β-cells (12.Oster A. Jensen J. Serup P. Galante P. Madsen O.D. Larsson L.I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13.Jensen J. Serup P. Karlsen C. Nielsen T.F. Madsen O.D.

Studies of null mutations of the Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.1 genes in mice have outlined the role for Nkx6.1 in β-cell development. In mice deficient for Nkx2.2, β-cell development is arrested, as demonstrated by the accumulation of cells expressing some markers characteristic of β-cells, such as islet amyloid polypeptide and Pdx1, but lacking other markers, most notably insulin and Nkx6.1 (8.Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, these mice develop severe hyperglycemia and die shortly after birth. Mice deficient for Nkx6.1 display a dramatic reduction in β-cell numbers, with insulin levels reduced to 2% of wild type, but have near-normal development of all other endocrine and exocrine cell types (11.Sander, M., Kalamaras, J., and German, M. S. (1998) Keystone Symposium on Vertebrate Development, Steamboat Springs, CO, April 3-8, 1998Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that Nkx6.1 lies downstream of Nkx2.2 and is required for late steps in the pathway for β-cell differentiation. Nkx6.1 is a divergent member of the NK family of transcription factors. With the exception of the closely related factor Gtx (Nkx6.2), the homeodomain of Nkx6.1 displays only about 45% identity and 60% homology to the homeodomains of other members of the NK class (14.Rudnick A. Ling T.Y. Odagiri H. Rutter W.J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12203-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Gtx (Nkx6.2), a transcription factor expressed in testis and oligodendrocytes but not pancreas, shows striking homology to Nkx6.1 within the homeodomain and COOH-terminal region, but diverges significantly at the NH2 terminus (15.Komuro I. Schalling M. Jahn L. Bodmer R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1387-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16.Awatramani R. Scherer S. Grinspan J. Collarini E. Skoff R. O'Hagan D. Garbern J. Kamholz J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6657-6668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the homeodomain and NK decapeptide (the function of which is unknown), Nkx6.1 has no significant homology to any other transcription factor. Although it was very recently shown that the homeodomain of Nkx6.1 is capable of recognizing a TAAT-containing DNA sequence (17.Jorgensen M. Vestergard Petersen H. Ericson J. Madsen O.D. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), nothing is known of how it restricts DNA target specificity, the binding properties of the full-length protein, or its transactivation properties. In an effort to understand Nkx6.1 function during β-cell development, we investigated in detail its DNA binding characteristics and transactivation properties. We confirm that the homeodomain recognizes a TAAT-containing sequence, but demonstrate that flanking base pairs can have significant effects on DNA binding. We also show that the native transcription factor binds to this site in a conditional manner that is dependent upon a discreet binding interference domain (BID)1 in the COOH terminus. Furthermore, we show that Nkx6.1 functions as a potent transcriptional repressor, with repressor activity mapping to sequences in the NH2 terminus. The findings suggest that Nkx6.1, regulated by interactions through the BID, inactivates specific target genes during β-cell differentiation. All plasmids were constructed using standard recombinant DNA techniques and constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. The Escherichia coli expression vector, pET-NKX6.1.HD, encoding the homeodomain (aa 229–305) of Nkx6.1 was made by amplifying the appropriate coding fragment of hamster Nkx6.1 by PCR, then ligating it in frame to theNdeI and SalI sites of the 6X-His vector, pET15b (Novagen). The GAL4-TK reporter vector was constructed by inserting a 100-bp fragment containing five tandem copies of the yeast GAL4 binding site immediately upstream of the TK promoter in pFOXLuc2TK (18.Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8272-8280Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The one-hybrid expression vectors encoding the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD)-Nkx6.1 fusion constructs were made by inserting PCR-generated fragments of Nkx6.1 in frame into the EcoRI andSalI sites of vector pM (CLONTECH). Plasmids for the expression of intact Nkx6.1 and its fragments in mammalian cells were constructed in the CMV promoter-based vector, pBAT12 (18.Smith S.B. Ee H.C. Conners J.R. German M.S. Mol. Cell.

Constructs were made by subcloning the appropriate fragments from the GAL4-DBD vectors (pM) into the EcoRI andXbaI sites of pBAT12. For expression of proteins in vitro, fragments were subcloned into the same sites of the T7 promoter-based vector, pBAT11. The reporter vectors containing the −350 bp rat insulin I promoter constructs driving the luciferase gene were generated by subcloning the promoter fragments from pOK1 (20.Karlsson O. Edlund T.

The reporter plasmid pFOXLuc.6.1.TK was constructed by inserting a 150-bp fragment containing five tandem copies of the Nkx6.1 consensus site into the BamHI and BglII sites of pFOXLuc2TK. pBAT11.Pdx1HD-BID and pBAT11.Pax6PD-BID encoding the homeodomain of Pdx1 (aa 138–213) and Paired domain of Pax6 (aa1–137), respectively, fused to the COOH-terminal amino acids of Nkx6.1 (aa 306–364) were constructed by PCR amplification of the appropriate coding fragment of Pdx1 or Pax6, then ligating it in frame to the NcoI andEcoRI sites of pBAT11(306–364)Nkx6.1. Mutagenesis of the hamster Nkx6.1 coding sequence in plasmid pBAT11.Nkx6.1 was performed using the Quick Change®mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides (and their complementary strands) were used for making mutations A and B, respectively: A: 5′-ACTTCGGAGAACGAGGAGCGGCCCCCGCGGTACAACAAGCCCCTGGAC; B: 5′-CCCCTGGACCCGAACTCTCGGGCCCGGAAAATCACGCAGCTGCTG. The mouse β-cell line, β-TC3, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. The mouse fibroblast cell line, NIH3T3, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For transient mammalian cell transfections, cells were plated on six-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well (NIH3T3) or 7.5 × 105 cells/well (β-TC3) 1 day before transfection. A total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 6 μl of Transfast® reagent (Promega), and transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested approximately 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were measured using a commercially available assay kit (Promega) and an Optocomp® luminometer (MGM Instruments). The total amount of cDNA expression plasmid was 0.8 μg for pM-derived vectors and 0.25 μg for pBAT12-derived vectors; a total of 0.8–1.0 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid was used in each transfection. The balance of the 2 μg of vector per transfection was made up by adding a CMV promoter-driven β-galactosidase control plasmid (0.4 μg) and/or expression vector without insert cDNA. Data points represent the average of at least three independent transfections ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). For the production of 6XHis- (229–305)Nkx6.1,vector pETNkx6.1.HD was used to transformE. coli strain BL21(DE3). E. coli cultures (500 ml) were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth (LB), the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and applied directly to a 2-ml bed volume column containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen); the protein was eluted from the column using step gradients from 0–250 mm imidazole prepared in lysis buffer. Samples from the initial bacterial lysate and final column eluates were analyzed by 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford. The random oligonucleotide selection was a modification of previously published procedures (21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22.Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol.

The 55-mer (5′-GAGTCCAGCGGATCCTGTCGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCTGTCCTCGAG AGTGTCAAC) was duplexed by incubation with primer REV (5′-GTTGAC ACTCTCGAGGACA), dNTPs, and Taq polymerase at 68 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 10 pmol of double-stranded 55-mer was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 100 ng of (229–305)Nkx6.1 in 50 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% (v/v) Ficoll) at room temperature for 15 min. 50 μl of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed another 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was centrifuged, the supernatant was aspirated, and the resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The protein and its bound DNA were eluted by incubating the resin with 200 μl of 250 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The eluted 55-mers were then amplified using 20 cycles of PCR, the REV primer, and the FWD primer (5′-GAGTCCAGCGGATCCTGTCG). 10 μl of this PCR product was directly used as a probe for the next round of binding site selection. Six selection cycles were performed, after which an additional six cycles were performed using an EMSA technique for selection (21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After a total of 12 selection cycles was performed, the resulting 55-mers were subcloned into pCR2.1 (CLONTECH) and sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using a non-gapped algorithm (ClustalW) in MacVector® 6.5 software (Oxford Molecular). Nkx6.1 and its truncated derivatives were expressed in vitro, with or without [35S]methionine labeling, from coding fragments subcloned into pBAT11 using the T7 TNT® quick coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Single-stranded oligonucleotide probes were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were column-purified and annealed to an excess of complementary strand. EMSA buffers and electrophoresis conditions were described previously (24.German M.S. Moss L.G. Wang J. Rutter W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where in vitrosynthesized protein was used, 1 μl of the in vitroreaction mixture was used, and where supershift assays were performed, 1 μl of anti-Nkx6.1 antibody (8.Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or preimmune serum was also added. The following oligonucleotide probes were used (top strands shown): Nkx6.1 consensus, 5′-GATCTGACCATTTAATTACCCTTCGTTGACAAGG; rat insulin I A3/4, 5′-GATCCCTTGTTAATAATCTAATTACCCTAGGTCA; M1, 5′-GATCTGACCTAGTTTAATGAGATCGTTGACAAGG; M2, 5′-GATCTGACCATTTAGTTACCCTTCGTTGACAAGG; M2, 5′-GATCTGACCATTTAAGTACCCTTCGTTGACAAGG; rat insulin I C2, 5′- CTGGGAATGAGGTGGAAAATGCTC; Gal4 upstream activated sequence, 5′- GATCTCGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGG. Binding competition assays followed the principle described in Ref. 21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholarand were performed under identical EMSA conditions, except that only the Nkx6.1 consensus sequence was labeled with 32P and varying concentrations (from 10−11 to 10−6m) of unlabeled competitor sequence was added. Radioactivity in the EMSA gels was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were modeled using simple one-step binding kinetics by use of Kaleidagraph® (Synergy Software) and the following equation. Fraction of probe bound=1−(Bmax[c]/(Kd+[c]))Equation 1 B max is the fraction of probe bound in the absence of competitor, [c] is the concentration of competitor, and K d is the apparent dissociation constant. The quantity of (229–305)Nkx6.1 protein (1 ng) was chosen, such that no more than 10% of the total oligonucleotide probe was bound in the absence of competitor. Expression of Nkx6.1 or the Gal4-Nkx6.1 fusion protein derivatives in nuclear extracts of NIH3T3 cells was measured by performing Western blot analysis using either polyclonal anti-Nkx6.1 antibody raised in rabbit (8.Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or polyclonal anti-Gal4-DBD antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Western blots were visualized by using the ECL-Plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The homeodomain has been demonstrated to be a modular DNA binding protein motif of high integrity, such that even in isolation it maintains both DNA binding specificity and affinity (25.Draganescu A. Levin J.R. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26.Kissinger C.R. Liu B.S. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In order to identify the optimal DNA sequence recognized by Nkx6.1, we therefore expressed inE. coli the homeodomain of Nkx6.1 (amino acids 229–305) fused to 6 tandem histidine residues (His6) at the amino terminus and purified the protein on a nickel resin. This purified protein was used to select for binding of specific DNA sequences from among a library of oligonucleotides of 55 base pairs in length containing a central random stretch of 15 base pairs. The protein and its bound DNA sequences were isolated by adsorption to nickel resin, and the selected sequences were amplified by PCR and used in a subsequent round of selection. In the first round of selection, 10 pmol of oligonucleotide were used, which corresponds to approximately 1000 times more than the theoretical number of different sequences that would be present with 15 random base pairs (415). Six rounds of selection were performed using the nickel adsorption procedure. An additional six rounds of selection were performed using EMSA, in which the retarded protein-DNA complex was cut and eluted from the polyacrylamide gel, followed by PCR amplification of the oligonucleotide with incorporation of radiolabel. After a total of 12 rounds of selection, the sequences of 23 oligonucleotides were determined. The sequences were subjected to an ungapped alignment using the multiple sequence alignment function in the MacVector 6.5 software package (Oxford Molecular, Ltd.). Fig.1 A demonstrates that the oligonucleotide sequences are nonrandomly distributed and contain the consensus sequence TTAATTAC, which is similar to the sequence recently demonstrated to bind the rat Nkx6.1 homeodomain (TTAATT(G/A), Ref. 17.Jorgensen M. Vestergard Petersen H. Ericson J. Madsen O.D. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that an oligonucleotide containing this consensus clearly binds the Nkx6.1 homeodomain in an EMSA. The twofold symmetry of the consensus binding site we obtain for Nkx6.1 suggests the possibility that the homeodomain contacts DNA as a dimer. Several lines of evidence, however, demonstrate that the Nkx6.1 homeodomain binds DNA as a monomer: (a) an EMSA in which the homeodomain with and without the His6 tag (mass difference of approximately 2 kDa) were mixed together did not result in a migrating complex of intermediate molecular weight (Fig.1 B), (b) disruption of the twofold symmetry does not affect the migration of the shifted complex (see Fig.2, oligonucleotide M1), and (c) NMR and crystal structure data reveal that many other homologous homeodomains bind DNA as monomers (26.Kissinger C.R.

The consensus sequence that we have determined here contains the “core” motif, TAAT, which is also found in the DNA binding sites for many other homeodomain proteins, such as En of Drosophila (28.Draganescu A. Tullius T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the mammalian Hox proteins (21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the pancreatic homeodomain protein Pdx1 (29.Peers B. Leonard J. Sharma S. Teitelman G. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar). Since the promoter regions of many genes contain sequences with TAAT motifs that are highly similar to the Nkx6.1 consensus, it is difficult to predict the potential downstream target genes for this (or any other) transcription factor on the knowledge of this core motif alone. Sequences flanking this core are important in the recognition of specific sequences by the murine Hox proteins, En-1, Ubx, and Nkx2.5 proteins (21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 23.Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4059-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In an effort to determine if sequences flanking this core have significant effects on the DNA binding affinity of Nkx6.1, we performed EMSAs using oligonucleotides that contain alterations to the consensus motif (Fig. 2). Alterations within the core dramatically reduce binding affinity (oligonucleotides M2 and M3), but alterations flanking the core result in reductions as well (rat insulin I A3/4 and oligonucleotide M1; Fig. 2). In order to obtain quantitative information on the data presented in Fig. 2, we performed binding competition experiments using unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides and 32P-labeled Nkx6.1 consensus probe, followed by EMSA and PhosphorImager analysis. TableI shows the apparent dissociation constants (K d values) for the binding of each of the oligonucleotides to the Nkx6.1 homeodomain, expressed as a percentage of the apparent K d for the consensus sequence. TheK d for the consensus sequence (4 × 10−9m) is consistent with theK d values determined for the binding of other homeodomain proteins with DNA (21.Catron K.M. Iler N. Abate C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26.Kissinger C.R. Liu B.S. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the homeodomain displays a nearly 5-fold lower affinity for rat insulin I A3/4 sequence (an insulin promoter element that has been shown to be important in the control of insulin gene expression; see Refs. 19.German M.S.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1798-1806PubMed Google Scholar), notwithstanding that this sequence contains four TAAT cores. Although these cores have multiple flanking base pairs that differ from the ideal Nkx6.1 consensus, it is clear that even a single T → G base pair change in the flanking region (oligonucleotide M1, Table I) is sufficient to decrease binding significantly. Changes within the TAAT core are dramatically less well tolerated, resulting in greater than 10-fold decreases in binding affinity (oligonucleotides M2 and M3, Table I).Table IEffect of base pair alterations on the DNA binding affinity of the Nkx6.1 homeodomainOligonucleotideaDesignations for the individual oligonucleotides are the same as those in Fig. 2.Core sequencebAlignment with the Nkx6.1 consensus sequence is shown.

Open table in a new tab Although the data presented thus far establish the DNA binding characteristics of the Nkx6.1 homeodomain, they have not addressed the issue of whether the same applies to the native Nkx6.1 protein. For many other mammalian DNA-binding proteins, binding site specificities and affinities of the native protein parallels that of the DNA binding domains alone (22.Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T.

However, in EMSA studies, we have been unable to detect native Nkx6.1 binding from nuclear extracts of a murine β-cell line (β-TC3 cells) or from nuclear extracts of a fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3 cells) transiently transfected with Nkx6.1 cDNA, notwithstanding that Western blotting demonstrates the presence of Nkx6.1 in these extracts (data not shown). These data could be explained by either our inability to detect a specific migrating complex due to masking by other nonspecifically shifted complexes, or by the formation of a very weak protein-DNA complex that is below the detection limit of our EMSAs. In an effort to resolve this issue, we used various truncations (Fig.3 A) and mutations of the Nkx6.1 protein produced in vitro in EMSA studies with the Nkx6.1 consensus oligonucleotide as probe. In Fig. 3 B, native Nkx6.1 produced in vitro binds only very weakly to the co"

L., Wu, Z., Jacobson, K. L., Storm, D. R., Singh, J. C., and Ott, S. M. (1998) Am. J. Physiol.274, C557–C565). To evaluate the role of AC1 and AC8 in Ca2+ stimulation of cAMP synthesis in parotid cells, acini were isolated from AC1 mutant (AC1-KO) and AC8 mutant (AC8-KO) mice and analyzed for Ca2+ stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels. Although Ca2+ stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels in acini from AC1-KO mice was indistinguishable from wild type mice, acini from AC8-KO mice showed no Ca2+-stimulated cAMP accumulation. This indicates that AC8, but not AC1, plays a major role in coupling Ca2+ signals to cAMP synthesis in parotid acini. Interestingly, treatment of acini from AC8-KO mice with agents,i.e. carbachol and thapsigargin that increase intracellular Ca2+, lowered cAMP levels. This decrease was dependent upon Ca2+ influx and independent of phosphodiesterase activation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that AC5/6 and AC3 are expressed in parotid glands. Inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) kinase II with KN-62, or inclusion of the CaM inhibitor, calmidazolium, did not prevent agonist-induced inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation.In vitro studies revealed that Ca2+, independently of CaM, inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated AC.

Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and data obtained demonstrated that Ca2+ entry plays an important role in promoting AC synthesis. These data, combined with findings that AC8 is expressed in mouse parotid acini (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Ca2+/CaM stimulates AC and augments the effects of forskolin on cyclase activity in membrane fractions and intact cells (21.Piascik M.T. Babich M. Jacobson K.L. Watson E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C642-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Watson E.L. Singh J.C. McPhee C. Beavo J. Jacobson K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 547-553PubMed Google Scholar), are consistent with results obtained in HEK 293 cells expressing AC8 (8.Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M. J. Biol.

Interpretation of the mechanism(s) involved in the cross-talk that occurs between the Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways in cells is complex and requires not only identification of AC subtypes expressed, but also tools that provide definitive answers as to regulation of AC synthesis in specific cell types. Thus, the goal of the present study was to determine the involvement of AC8 in agonist-induced augmentation of stimulated cAMP levels in mouse parotid acini by examining the effects of carbachol and the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, on isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation in acini from AC8-KO mice. Our data show that carbachol and thapsigargin augmented stimulated cAMP accumulation in acini from wild type (WT) mice as previously reported (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas these agents not only prevented augmentation, but inhibited isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation in AC8-KO mice. Augmentation of stimulated cAMP accumulation, however, was not affected in acini from AC1-KO mice. Agonist-induced inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation was reversed in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer and in the presence of lanthanum (La3+), but not by KN-62, an inhibitor of CaM kinase, or by the CaM antagonist, calmidazolium. Studies with isolated parotid membranes revealed that Ca2+, independently of CaM, inhibits AC activity in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the expression of the Ca2+-inhibited AC5/6 isoforms in parotid gland. Results demonstrate that capacitative Ca2+ entry is associated with the activation of AC8 in mouse parotid acini and support an involvement of AC5/6 in the inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Materials were obtained as follows: hyaluronidase, carbachol, isoproterenol, lanthanum chloride (La3+), bovine serum albumin (BSA), EGTA, HEPES, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX), phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, and GTP were from Sigma; cAMP radioimmunoassay kits were from DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN); collagenase type CLS2 was from Worthington; thapsigargin, KN-62, and calmidazolium were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Isogenic AC8 clones were isolated from a 129/Sv murine genomic library (Strategene, La Jolla, CA). Two overlapping clones that extend 5.0 kb upstream and 7.0 kb downstream of the translational start codon, pND21 and pND22, respectively, were used to construct the targeting vector. A 6.2-kb XbaI fragment of the AC8 gene, which includes DNA sequences residing 4.7 kb upstream and 1.8 kb downstream of the translational start codon, was replaced by a NEOr cassette. The targeting vector (A12) consisted of sequences, flanking the 6.2-kb XbaI fragment on the 5′ end (3.75 kb) and the 3′ end (2.5 kb), that were ligated to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the neo cassette in pBluescript (Strategene). To enrich for homologous recombinants, a herpes simplex viral thymidine kinase gene (TK) was ligated to the 3′ end of the 2.5-kb fragment. ES cells were injected, and chimeric mice were obtained and bred for germline propagation. We have obtained homozygous AC8-KO mice that breed normally and have no obvious developmental defects. Disruption of the AC8 gene was confirmed by digestion of genomic DNA withXbaI and Southern blotting (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (Fig.1). F1 hybrid mice, derived from the initial chimeras, were used for this study. Littermate controls from heterozygous matings were used for all experiments. Mutant mice in which AC1 was inactivated by targeted mutagenesis were generated as reported previously by Wu et al. (24.Wu Z. Thomas S.A. Villacres E.C. Zhengui X. Simmons M.L. Chavkin C. Palmiter R.D. Storm D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Small groups of isolated mouse parotid cells (acini) were prepared as described previously by Watsonet al. (25.Watson E.L. Jacobson K.L. DiJulio D.H. Dowd F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1061-C1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, parotid glands from male AC8-KO, AC1-KO, WT B6129PF1 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and Simonsen mice were removed quickly, trimmed, and minced in a siliconized dish in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.9 mm MgCl2 and 1.28 mmCaCl2, 30 mm Hepes, 90 units/ml collagenase (CLS2), and 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase. Enzyme digestion was conducted in a rotary water bath at 37 °C for 60 min under continuous CO2/O2 (5%/95%) gassing. After the first 40 min of digestion, the suspension was pipetted up and down 12 times with a 10-ml plastic pipette. This was repeated two more times at approximately 5-min intervals. The pH during the dispersion was maintained at 7.2–7.4. Following digestion, the cells were centrifuged at 50 × g for 2 min, washed with buffer (KHB minus enzymes with 4% BSA, pH 7.4), filtered through two layers of nylon, and washed two additional times. Cells were suspended in KHB minus enzyme buffer containing 1% BSA and rested for 30 min at 37 °C with continuous gassing. Cyclic AMP levels were measured in intact mouse parotid acini suspended 1:300 (w/v) in KHB, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% BSA as described previously (22.Watson E.L. Singh J.C. McPhee C. Beavo J. Jacobson K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 547-553PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments in which La3+ was used, a phosphate- and bicarbonate-free buffer was used (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (1.5 ml) were incubated with agonists for varying times up to 8 min. Incubations were terminated by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cyclic AMP was determined by the radioimmunoassay procedure of Steineret al. (26.Steiner A.L. Parker C.W. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1106-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results were calculated as picomoles of cAMP/mg of protein. Acini were suspended 1:50 (w/v) in KHB containing 0.176 mg/ml ascorbic acid and 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4, and loaded with fura-2/AM at 3.3 μg/ml cell suspension for 30 min at 37 °C with continuous gassing (5% CO2, 95% O2) and shaking. Fura-2/AM was prepared at 1 mg/ml in Me2SO just prior to use. Loaded cells were washed three times in the 0.2% BSA/KHB containing ascorbic acid, resuspended at 1:50 (w/v), and maintained at 24 °C with gassing and shaking. After a 20-min incubation period, an aliquot was washed twice in the above buffer ± Ca2+, diluted 1:10 in fresh buffer, and placed in UV grade fluorometric cuvettes (Spectrocel) for [Ca]i measurements. [Ca]i was calculated using the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (27.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where K d = 224 mm. A Filterscan spectrofluorometer system equipped with a magnetic stirrer and constant temperature cuvette holder from Photon Technology International Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) was used for the [Ca]i measurements. Parotid glands were removed as described previously (28.Watson E.L. Williams J.A. Siegel I.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: C233-C237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared by homogenizing glands in ice-cold buffer containing 0.25 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, with and without 2 mm EGTA. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Pellets were rehomogenized and washed twice with the above buffers, recentrifuged, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. Fresh membranes were used in all experiments. Membranes were isolated from mouse parotid acini, and the adenylyl cyclase assay was carried out as described by Ammer and Schulz (29.Ammer H. Schulz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with modification. Adenylyl cyclase was determined in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 μg/ml phosphocreatine, 5 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10 μm GTP, and 0.5 mm MIX. Reactions were started by the addition of 15 μg of membrane protein, incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and stopped with 100% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. When CaCl2 was included in the assay, the concentration of free Ca2+ was derived from the computer program BAD3 (30.Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase was calculated as picomoles/mg of protein/10 min. Brain and heart microsomal membrane preparations, used as positive antibody controls, were prepared as described (31.DiJulio D.H. Watson E.L. Pessah I.N. Jacobson K.L. Ott S.M. Buck E.D. Singh J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15687-15696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Proteins of tissue fractions of mouse brain, heart, and parotid were resolved concomitantly with proteins of standard molecular weight at room temperature by 10% SDS-PAGE (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using mini-gels (10-well, 1 mm thick), the Xcell II Mini-Cell electrophoresis system and protocols of Novex (San Diego, CA). Resolved proteins were transferred overnight at a constant 30 V in transfer buffer (33.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filters (Novex, San Diego, CA) using the Mini Trans-Blot system of Bio-Rad. Peptides immobilized to the PVDF filters were screened for AC isoforms by immunoblot analysis performed at room temperature using rabbit affinity purified polyclonal antibodies specific to the carboxyl-terminal domain of AC3 or AC5/6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1 μg/ml and 1-h incubation. Primary antibody binding was detected using donkey horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:20,000 dilution and 1-h incubation with chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate and protocols of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemiluminograms of AC immunoblots were scanned into a computer, image data were captured and saved in TIFF format using Photoshop™ software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA), and blot densities and molecular weights were derived from TIFF files using Un-Scan-IT gel™ (SilkScientific, Orem, UT). Protein determinations were by the method of Lowry et al. (34.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP and AC data were calculated as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test (p < 0.05). To determine the consequence of disrupting the AC8 gene, AC sensitivity to Ca2+ in parotid membranes from AC8-KO mice was examined and compared with activity in membranes from WT mice. As shown in Fig.2 A, Ca2+inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01 μm-100 μm), isoproterenol (1 μm)-stimulated AC activity in membranes from AC8-KO mice. Further, Ca2+ inhibition of enzyme activity was also observed when membranes were washed with 2 mm EGTA to remove endogenous CaM (21.Piascik M.T. Babich M. Jacobson K.L. Watson E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C642-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that Ca2+ acts independently of CaM. In contrast to the observed inhibitory effects of Ca2+ in membranes from AC8-KO mice, Ca2+ stimulated AC activity in membranes from WT mice (Fig.2 A); at a 1 μm Ca2+ concentration, AC activity was increased by 80%, in agreement with data previously reported for the mouse parotid gland (21.Piascik M.T. Babich M. Jacobson K.L. Watson E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C642-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since capacitative Ca2+ entry can regulate AC in mouse parotid acini, and the AC8 isoform is expressed in these cells (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and known to be activated by Ca2+ entry (8.Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Fagan K.A. Mahey R. Cooper D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12438-12444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we examined the influence of Ca2+ entry in agonist augmentation of stimulated cAMP accumulation in parotid acini from control and AC8-KO mice. As shown in Fig. 3 A, incubation of acini with carbachol (10 μm) resulted in augmentation of isoproterenol (0.1 μm)-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a time-dependent manner in parotid acini from WT mice, as reported previously by Watson et al. (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parotid acini from AC8-KO mice, addition of carbachol not only prevented augmentation of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation, supporting an involvement of AC8 in capacitative Ca2+ entry in a non-neuronal cell, but resulted in a significant inhibition of stimulated cAMP levels (Fig. 3 B). Time-course studies showed that inhibition was detected as early as 0.5 min, peaked by 1 min, and remained constant for the remainder of the experiment. At 1 min, cAMP levels were reduced by approximately 47% in acini treated with carbachol (10 μm); cAMP values were 130 ± 15.6 and 68.6 ± 6 pmol/mg of protein in the absence and presence of carbachol, respectively. In similar studies, the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (2 μm), was considered a useful tool for examining the relationship between capacitative Ca2+ entry and stimulated cAMP accumulation, because it depletes intracellular Ca2+ pools independently of receptor activation and phosphoinositide production (35.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Any potential effects of receptor-generated PKC, and βγ subunits of G-proteins would thus be eliminated. As shown in Fig.4 A, addition of thapsigargin to acini from WT mice also augmented stimulated cAMP accumulation in a time-dependent manner, as reported previously by Watsonet al. (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In acini from AC8-KO mice, isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was inhibited by thapsigargin (Fig. 4 B). Unlike the early inhibitory effects produced by carbachol, inhibition by thapsigargin was not observed until after 1 min. Cyclic AMP levels peaked by 5 min and remained constant for the remainder of the experiment. By 8 min, cAMP levels were reduced by 38%; cAMP values were 222.2 ± 19.7 and 137.8 ± 3.3 pmol/mg of protein in the absence and presence of thapsigargin, respectively. For both carbachol and thapsigargin, time-course studies were beneficial because they revealed a temporal relationship between inhibition of stimulated cAMP synthesis and capacitative Ca2+ entry (Figs. 3 and 4) similar to that previously described for mouse parotid acini (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation in parotid acini from AC8-KO mice was due to activation of a PDE isoenzyme, acini were incubated in the presence of MIX (500 μm) for 10 min prior to the addition of thapsigargin (2 μm). In time-course studies, MIX had no effect on the inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation by thapsigargin (Fig.5); by 8 min, cAMP values were reduced from 2212.7 ± 360 to 1072.3 ± 222 pmol/mg of protein in the absence and presence of MIX, respectively. Inhibition by thapsigargin was approximately 52%, consistent with results obtained in the absence of MIX (Fig. 4 B). Because of the temporal relationship observed between capacitative Ca2+entry and inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation, we addressed the question of whether capacitative Ca2+ entry is, in fact, responsible for inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation. For these experiments, we tested the ability of thapsigargin to inhibit cAMP accumulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and under conditions where Ca2+ entry was blocked. Acini were incubated in nominally Ca2+-free, and (100 μm) La3+-containing KHB buffers. Lanthanum, at 100 μm, was previously found to completely inhibit thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry and stimulated cAMP accumulation in mouse parotid acini (1.Watson E.L. Wu Z. Jacobson K.L. Storm D.R. Singh J.C. Ott S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C557-C565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of acini in a nominally Ca2+-free buffer reduced isoproterenol (0.1 μm)-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 32% (TableI, Fig.6 A); by 8 min, cAMP levels were reduced from 270 ± 12 to 218.3 ± 14.5 pmol/mg of protein. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, thapsigargin (2 μm)-induced inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation was prevented (Fig. 6 A); cAMP levels were similar to those produced by isoproterenol in the absence of Ca2+. Incubation of acini in a La3+-containing buffer also reduced isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels, i.e. by 32% (Table I, Fig. 6 B); by 8 min, cAMP levels were 245.1 ± 21.7 and 161.5 ± 7.7 pmol/mg of protein in the absence and presence of La3+, respectively. In the presence of La3+, thapsigargin (2 μm) failed to inhibit stimulated cAMP accumulation; cAMP levels were not significantly different from those produced by isoproterenol in the presence of La3+ (Fig. 6 B). The decrease in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels noted in nominally Ca2+-free and La3+-containing buffers was not unique to the AC8-KO mice, as we previously noted similar inhibitory effects on isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels in WT Simonsen mice (25.Watson E.L.

Accordingly, the DNA binding activity of NFAT slowly increased during the stimulation of 20 h to induce the differentiation. NFATx significantly contributed to the early rise, but the late increase was mostly due to NFATc activation. Meanwhile, the expression of NFATx mRNA decreased and that of NFATc mRNA increased.

The active CN dephosphorylates the transcription factor NFAT that resides in the cytoplasm and accelerates its translocation to the nucleus. Among the four members of the NFAT family, NFATp (NFAT1 or NFATc2), NFATc (NFAT2 or NFATc1), and NFATx (NFAT4 or NFATc3) are expressed in lymphoid organs, whereas NFAT3 (NFATc4) is expressed in nonlymphoid organs (12.McCaffrey P.G.

NFATc is expressed in thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs at low levels, and its transcripts are markedly increased in mature T cells upon activation through the TCR complex (13.Northrop J.P.

NFATx is predominantly expressed in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (16.Oukka M. Ho I.-C. de la Brousse F.C. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 1998; 9: 295-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In NFATx-deficient mice, the number of SP thymocytes is about half that of normal mice, and their CD4+CD8+thymocytes are more sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis than normal CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (16.Oukka M.

NFATc-deficient mice have cardiac valvular defects and are embryonic-lethal. Thus, by using RAG-deficient blastocyst complementation, it was shown that young chimeric mice lacking NFATc have reduced numbers of thymocytes (17.Ranger A.M. Hodge M.R. Gravallese E.M. Oukka M.

On the other hand, NFATp deficiency does not cause any significant alteration in thymocyte differentiation (19.Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. Charles de la Brousse F. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H.

It is not known, however, when or how the activation and succession of NFAT family members occurs during positive selection. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to perform quantitative and kinetic analysis of positive selection in the absence of other cell types such as thymic epithelial cells. We have established an in vitro model system for positive selection in which isolated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes survive and differentiate into semi-mature T cells committed to the CD4- or CD8-T cell lineage by using defined combinations of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (IM) and the protein kinase C activator PMA (21.Ohoka Y.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 5707-5716PubMed Google Scholar). The combinations of drugs were originally chosen to mimic the anti-apoptotic effect of proper cross-linking of TCR/CD3 and CD4, CD8, or LFA-1 on thymocytes (10.Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24.Iwata M. Hanaoka S. Sato K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25.Zhao Y. Tozawa Y. Iseki R. Mukai M. Iwata M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6346-6354PubMed Google Scholar). Combinations of IM and PMA are known to mimic antigenic stimulation in mature T cells. However, the concentration ranges required for thymocyte survival and differentiation are narrower and lower than those that induce proliferation of mature T cells (26.Iwata M. Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Asada A. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that the stimulation intensities for differentiation have to be relatively low and within a narrow range. The duration as well as intensity of stimulation are crucial for differentiation (21.Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22.Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J.

In the present study, we found that FK506 affected thymocyte differentiation even when it was added to the culture at the late stage of the stimulation. Thus, sustained activities of CN and NFAT are likely to be required for the differentiation. From the semi-mature T cells that are committed to the CD4-T cell lineage in vitro, mature and activated CD4 SP T cells are induced by secondary-pulse stimulation with a combination of IM and PMA followed by incubation with IL-2 (22.Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By using the in vitro system, we analyzed kinetic changes in the expression and activation of NFAT family members during the differentiation of isolated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into mature CD4 T cells. Although it has been difficult to induce and detect the NFAT DNA binding activity in murine CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, we could detect the activities and observe the succession of expression and DNA binding activities of NFAT family members in these cells. These changes in NFAT members were induced by a limited number of defined stimuli without thymic microenvironments or other cell types, suggesting that the changes may be intrinsically programmed along with T cell development. BOG8 TCRαβ transgenic mice were generated as described previously (21.Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TCRαβ is specific for an ovalbumin-derived peptide (P271–285) and is restricted to I-Ad. The mice of RAG-2(−/−) background were generated by breeding at least twice with RAG-2 knockout 129 mice (H-2bv1) (27.Shinkai Y. Rathbum G. Lam K.-D. Oltz E.M. Stewart V. Mendelsohn M. Charron J. Datta M. Young F. Stall A.M. Alt F.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 855-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). In these mice with H-2b and/or H-2bv1 backgrounds, essentially all thymocytes were CD4+CD8+ cells and almost no peripheral T cells were found at least until 8 weeks of age, suggesting that positive selection did not occur. BALB/c mice (4 to 8 weeks of age) were obtained from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Thymocytes were obtained from the TCR transgenic mice or normal BALB/c mice. Normal CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were purified from BALB/c thymocytes with peanut agglutinin as described previously (10.Zhao Y. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1387-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thymocytes (3.75 to 4 × 106) were suspended in 1 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 3 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 20 units of penicillin, and 20 μg of streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and were cultured for the indicated time at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of IM (Calbiochem) and PMA (Sigma) in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning 25820, Corning, NY). Each lot of fetal calf serum was selected by its low toxicity to CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. In some experiments, cells were washed twice with fresh medium after culturing and were further cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Viable cells were enumerated by trypan blue dye exclusion. The recovery (%) of viable cells was calculated as (E/S) × 100, where E and S stand for viable cell number at the end of culture and that at the start of culture, respectively. For the secondary stimulation, cells were cultured with 0.2 μg/ml IM and 3 ng/ml PMA for 17 h, washed, and incubated further with 50 units/ml mouse rIL-2 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for 48 h. In some experiments, 1 nm FK506 (Calbiochem) or 1 nm rapamycin (Calbiochem) was included in the culture. The cells were treated with Pronase to strip off CD4 and CD8, cultured for 24 h, and then assessed for CD4/CD8 expression as described (21.Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28.Suzuki H. Punt J.A. Granger L.G. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For two-color flow cytometric analysis of CD4 and CD8 expression, the cells were stained with labeled Abs; phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (RM4–5) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mAb to CD8 (53–6.7) (Pharmingen). Viable cells were gated by forward and side scattering with a FACScan flow cytometer and FACScan Research Software (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ), and were analyzed for co-receptor expression. The gate for viable cells was determined by using propidium iodide exclusion and Paint-a-Gate software (Becton Dickinson). For sorting of CD69+ and CD69− subsets, thymocytes from BALB/c mice were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mAb to CD69 (H1.2F3) (Pharmingen). Viable cells were gated by forward and side scattering and were sorted into CD69+ and CD69− subpopulations with FACStar plus and Consort 30 software programs (Becton Dickinson). To analyze NFAT DNA binding activity, nuclear extracts were prepared from thymocytes as described previously (29.Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications. Briefly, 1 to 2 × 108 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The suspension was mixed with an equal volume of buffer B (buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and the resulting nuclei were pelleted by brief, low speed centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was washed with buffer A, resuspended in 200 μl of buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.3 m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.9) and vortexed vigorously for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear debris was pelleted by high speed centrifugation at 220,000 ×g for 45 min. Then the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by adding an equal volume of 3.0 m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.9). The suspension was incubated on ice for 2 to 3 h and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 15 min. The nuclear proteins in the pellet were dissolved in 20 μl of buffer C by vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until use. All buffers were supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmpepstatin A, and 4 μm leupeptin. Protein concentration was estimated by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). To analyze AP-1 DNA binding activity, nuclear extracts were prepared by the method described by Schreiber et al. (30.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). A StuI/BalI 426-bp fragment of mouse NFATx cDNA (corresponding to amino acid residues 331–462 of the mouse NFATx protein (31.Jie L. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Amasaki Y. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Imai S.

Cell. 1997; 8: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) was subcloned into pGEX-5X-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and truncated mouse NFATx protein fused to glutathione S-transferase was bacterially expressed. The resulting recombinant protein was purified and used for immunizing rabbits to raise an anti-mouse NFATx anti-serum (termed DN97). The anti-murine NFATc mAb and the anti-murine NFATp antiserum were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO) and Upstate Biotechnology Corp. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. pME-mNFATx1 and pME-mNFATc are expression plasmids containing mouse NFATx and NFATc full-length cDNA under the control of the SRα promoter in the pME18S mammalian expression vector (31.Jie L. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Amasaki Y. Saito-Ohara F. Ikeuchi T. Imai S. Takano T. Arai N. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,32.Pan S.

Rao) encoding full-length mouse NFAT1C cDNA into the pME18S vector cleaved byEcoRI/SpeI. Transfection of plasmids into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method and the subsequent preparation of cytosolic extracts were carried out as described previously (29.Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar,34.Watanabe M. Muramatsu M. Hirai H. Suzuki T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Arai K.-I. Arai N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2949-2958PubMed Google Scholar). NFAT-DNA binding reactions were performed by incubating 5 to 10 μg of nuclear extracts with 0.05 pmol of a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for 20 min at room temperature in 15 μl of the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 0.75 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cold oligonucleotide competitors (5 pmol) were added to the reaction mixture when indicated. For supershift assays, an anti-NFAT Ab was added to the reaction mixture followed by an additional 20 min of incubation at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel with a 0.25× Tris borate EDTA buffer at 120 V for 1.5 h at room temperature. AP-1-DNA binding reactions were performed by a Trevigen gel shift kit (Trevigen; Gaithersburg, MD), and the protein-DNA complexes were analyzed according to the kit instructions. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows: the distal NFAT site from the human IL-2 promoter for NFAT binding, 5′-gatcGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT-3′ (sequence of overhang is lowercase); the AP-1 consensus sequence oligonucleotides (Trevigen) for AP-1 binding, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′. The former oligonucleotide was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by filling the 5′ overhang with Klenow fragments, and the latter was labeled by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Total RNA was prepared from thymocytes cultured for the indicated time by using the lysis buffer Isogen (Wako Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). Oligo-dT-primed first strand cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of total RNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the resulting cDNA was serially diluted. PCR was performed in a total volume of 27 μl containing 0.5 μl of appropriately diluted cDNA, 0.15 mm dNTP, 1 μm each primer, and 1× PCR buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 0.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by using a Takara PCR thermal cycler (TP480). AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was added during the first denaturation step (94 °C for 3 min). The amplification was then performed by 25–39 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (25 cycles for β-actin, 32 cycles for NFATx and NFATc, 39 cycles for NFATp). The final cycle was followed by an extension step of 3 min at 72 °C. Sequences of the sense and antisense primers were as follows: β-actin, 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′ (35.Wong H. Anderson W.D. Cheng T. Riabowol K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); NFATx, 5′-CTTTCAGTTCCTTCACCCTTTACCT-3′ and 5′-TGCCAATATCAGTTTCTCCTTTTC-3′; NFATc, 5′-CAACGCCCTGACCACCGATAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGCCTTCCGTCTCATAGT-3′; NFATp, 5′-GGGCCATGTGAGCAGGAGGAGA-3′ and 5′-GCGTTTCGGAGCTTCAGGATGC-3′. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. NFATx, NFATc, NFATp, and β-actin cDNA yielded PCR products of 499 bp, 392 bp, 515 bp, and 243 bp, respectively. Fluorescence images were captured by a video monitor system (ATTO Image Freezer, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan), and band intensities were quantified using the analytical program Densitograph 4.0 (ATTO). The bands that were corresponded to the exponential amplification phases were analyzed, and the intensities of NFAT cDNA-derived bands were normalized with those of β-actin cDNA-derived bands. To obtain CD4+CD8+ thymocytes free from mature CD4 or CD8 SP T cells, we used BOG8 TCR transgenic mice with nonselecting major histocompatibility complex and RAG-2(−/−) backgrounds. The T cell differentiation in these mice is arrested at the CD4+CD8+ stage without positive selection, and essentially all thymocytes are CD4+CD8+ (Fig.1 A) (21.Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22.Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). According to ourin vitro model system for thymocyte positive selection, the isolated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes were stimulated with a defined combination of IM and PMA (0.2 μg/ml and 0.2 ng/ml, respectively) for 20 h, washed, and further cultured for 24 h without drugs (21.Ohoka Y. Kuwata T. Tozawa Y. Zhao Y. Mukai M. Motegi Y. Suzuki R. Yokoyama M. Iwata M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resultant cells were semi-mature CD4 SP or CD4+CD8low T cells (Fig. 1 F). The lineage commitment was assessed by the co-receptor re-expression assay (28.Suzuki H. Punt J.A. Granger L.G. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The cultured thymocytes were treated with Pronase to remove the surface CD4/CD8 co-receptors and were cultured overnight without stimulation to let the cells re-express the co-receptor they actively produce. Twenty hours of stimulation with IM/PMA resulted in the optimal induction of the CD4-lineage committed cells (Fig.1 K), whereas 15 h of stimulation resulted in the induction of CD8-lineage committed cells and some CD4-lineage committed cells (Fig. 1 J). When the stimulation period was shorter than 15 h, none or a lesser proportion of the cells differentiated into the CD4 lineage. IM/PMA stimulation for longer than 20 h resulted in a significant loss of viable cells and the induction of CD4−CD8− cells (data not shown) (22.Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the incubation period as well as the drug concentrations were crucial for the induction of CD4+CD8+ thymocyte differentiation. The addition of FK506, but not rapamycin, at the beginning of the culture inhibited differentiation of the cells and induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 and data not shown). FK506 is an immunosuppressant that inhibits CN activation through binding to FKBP12, whereas rapamycin is another immunosuppressant that binds to FKBP12 without affecting CN activity (36.Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). FK506 was moderately effective when it was added 15 h after the start of culture with IM/PMA (Fig. 2, D and G) but did not affect differentiation or survival when it was added after the stimulation period (data not shown). These findings suggest that sustained CN activity is required for differentiation. Since it is known that the activation of CN in T cells is precisely followed by the activation of its major target NFAT, we analyzed NFAT activation during thymocyte differentiation induced by the transient stimulation with IM and PMA in vitro. DNA binding activity of NFAT was detected by EMSA in the nuclear extract of cells that had been stimulated for 2 h with IM/PMA (Fig.3 A). The NFAT DNA binding activity was increased thereafter and reached a maximum within 15 h of stimulation. Multiple bands were detected during the stimulation, but most of them became undetectable in the presence of an excess amount of cold DNA probe with an NFAT-binding site (Fig.3 B). Thus, there may be multiple forms of NFAT-DNA complexes. After removing IM/PMA from the culture, the NFAT-DNA complexes quickly disappeared (Fig. 3 A). To analyze the contribution of each NFAT family member, the super shift assay was performed with specific Abs. The Abs to NFATc and NFATp were commercially available, but the Ab to mouse NFATx was produced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Its specificity was confirmed by using COS-7 cells expressing mouse NFAT members (Fig.4). The DNA binding activity of NFATx was detected in the nuclear extract of cells stimulated for 2 h with IM/PMA, but it decreased after 15 h of stimulation (Fig.5, lanes 2 and 6). These supershift bands were specific for NFATx-DNA complexes, since neither control Abs with the nuclear extract nor the anti-mouse NFATx anti-serum without the nuclear extract induced a similar band (data not shown). However, the intensity of the main band of NFAT-DNA complexes without Abs was rather enhanced in the presence of the anti-mouse NFATx anti-serum in some experiments (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and2). It was partly due to a nonspecific effect of the anti-serum, since the anti-serum alone induced a nonspecific band at almost the same position (data not shown). The addition of the anti-NFATp antiserum supershifted the NFATp-DNA complex (Fig. 5,lanes 4 and 8). The intensities of the supershift bands indicated that the DNA binding activity of NFATp was induced after 2 h of stimulation with IM/PMA and was almost unchanged after 15 h of stimulation. The anti-NFATc mAb also supershifted NFATc-DNA complex (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7), although the retardation of the mobility was less than in the case of the anti-NFATx and anti-NFATp antisera. This may be partly because the anti-NFATc mAb recognizes a single epitope on NFATc, and the predicted molecular size of NFATc is smaller than that of NFATx or NFATp (29.Amasaki Y. Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2324-2333PubMed Google Scholar). The intensities of the supershift bands indicated that the DNA binding activity of NFATc was induced after 2 h of stimulation with IM/PMA and was dramatically increased over 15 h of stimulation.Figure 5DNA binding activities of NFAT family members, NFATx, NFATc, and NFATp are detected in nuclear extracts from the cells stimulated with IM/PMA for 2 or 15 h.CD4+CD8+ thymocytes from the TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with the combination of 0.2 μg/ml IM and 0.2 ng/ml PMA for 2 (lanes 1–4) or 15 h (lanes 5–8).

https://openalex.org/W2059174430,"<i>Giardia</i> synthesizes UDP-GalNAc during cyst wall formation (encystment) via a pathway of inducible enzymes similar to that used to synthesize chitin or peptidoglycan and that includes the UTP-requiring UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. Although it has never been reported as a regulatory enzyme in any system studied to date, kinetic data including Hill plots demonstrate clearly that UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activity, purified from encysting<i>Giardia,</i> is allosterically activated anabolically by physiological levels of glucosamine 6-phosphate (3 μm). Capillary electrophoresis demonstrates that within 24 h after trophozoites are induced to encyst, the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate increases 3-fold over that of non-encysting cells and that by 48 h into encystment the level of glucosamine 6-phosphate has decreased to non-encysting levels or below. UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase protein is present constitutively in encysting as well as non-encysting cells. UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase immunoaffinity purified from encysting and non-encysting cells exhibited the same molecular weight, amino acid composition, and circular dichroism spectra. Moreover, regardless of whether the enzyme came from encysting or non-encysting cells, the change in its circular dichroism spectra and up to a 6-fold increase in its specific activity anabolically were due to its activation with glucosamine 6-phosphate. Thus, the data support the idea that UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase is a major regulatory point in amino sugar synthesis in encysting <i>Giardia</i> and that its allosteric anabolic activation may shift the equilibrium of this pathway toward UDP-GalNAc synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1658659299,"Luo1 suggests that the vertebrate fauna from the Yixian Formation (Liaoning Province, China) shows that this region of eastern Asia was a refugium, in which several typically Late Jurassic lineages (compsognathid theropod dinosaurs, ‘rhamphorhynchoid’ pterosaurs, primitive mammals) survived into the Early Cretaceous1 (Fig. 1). Data from slightly older sediments in the Japanese Early Cretaceous, however, suggest that the faunal composition of this region can only be partly explained by the concept of a refugium."
https://openalex.org/W2044036865,"Src family tyrosine kinases have previously been proposed to mediate some of the biological effects of lipopolysaccharide on macrophages. Accordingly, we have sought to identify substrates of Src family kinases in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Stimulation of Bac1.2F5 macrophage cells with lipopolysaccharide was found to induce gradual and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in an Src family kinase-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Cbl associates with Hck in Bac1.2F5 cells, while expression of an activated form of Hck in Bac1.2F5 cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in the absence of lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The Src homology 3 domain of Hck can directly bind Cbl, and this interaction is important for phosphorylation of Cbl. Association of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with Cbl is enhanced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation of Bac1.2F5 cells, and transient expression experiments indicate that phosphorylation of Cbl by Hck can facilitate the association of p85 with Cbl. Lipopolysaccharide treatment also stimulates the partial translocation of Hck to the cytoskeleton of Bac1.2F5 cells. Notably, lipopolysaccharide enhances the adherence of Bac1.2F5 cells, an effect that is dependent on the activity of Src family kinases and PI 3-kinase. Thus, we postulate that Hck enhances the adherence of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, at least in part, via Cbl and PI 3-kinase.

Ross J.A. Lewis C.E. McGee J.O.D. The Macrophage. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-74Google Scholar). During these processes, macrophages are primarily involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and host cell debris, antigen processing and presentation, and the secretion of reactive nitrogen intermediates and inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6) (1.Auger M.J. Ross J.A. Lewis C.E. McGee J.O.D. The Macrophage. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-74Google Scholar). In vitro exposure of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 a major component of the outer wall of Gram-negative bacteria, mimics many of the effects bacteria have on macrophages in vivo, namely inducing the secretion of reactive nitrites and inflammatory cytokines and enhancing their tumoricidal activity (1.Auger M.J. Ross J.A. Lewis C.E. McGee J.O.D. The Macrophage. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-74Google Scholar). The activation of macrophages by LPS is mediated by the binding of LPS to CD14, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein found on the surface of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils (2.Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). Binding of LPS to CD14 is enhanced by LBP, an LPS-binding protein found in serum (3.Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Since CD14 lacks an intracellular domain, it has previously been unclear how CD14 transduces signals across the plasma membrane in response to the binding of LPS. Recent studies suggest that members of the Toll-like receptor family, and in particular Toll-like receptor 4, may serve as cell surface co-receptors with CD14 to mediate transmembrane signal transduction (4.Yang R.B.

Members of the Toll-like receptor family are structurally characterized by an extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with sequence homology to the intracellular domain of the interleukin-1 receptor (12.Rock F.L.

LPS stimulation of macrophages leads to the activation of a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction, including protein kinase C (13.Novotney M. Chang Z.L. Uchiyama H. Suzuki T.

However, it is still unclear how the activation of these various signal-transducing proteins mediates the variety of biological responses of macrophages to LPS. Significantly, both in vitro and in vivo studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revealed that the activation of tyrosine kinases is necessary for a number of the biological responses of macrophages to LPS (e.g. tumoricidal activation) (20.Dong Z. O'Brian C.A. Fidler I.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Geng Y. Zhang B. Lotz M. J.

The Src family tyrosine kinases Hck, Lyn, and Fgr have all been implicated in playing a role in the biological response of macrophages to LPS. Stimulation of monocytes/macrophages with LPS induces a rapid increase in the specific kinase activity of Hck, Lyn, and Fgr and physical association of Lyn with CD14 (23.Stefanova I. Corcoran M.L.

Med. 1993; 178: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, enforced expression of an activated form of Hck in Bac1.2F5 macrophage cells augments tumor necrosis factor α production in response to LPS stimulation (24.English B.K. Ihle J.N. Myracle A. Yi T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure of bone marrow-derived macrophages to LPS induces an increase in the expression of both Hck and Lyn (25.Boulet I. Ralph S. Stanley E. Lock P. Dunn A.R. Green S.P. Phillips W.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the promoter region of the hck gene has facilitated definition of an element that confers LPS responsiveness (26.Lock P. Stanley E. Holtzman D.A. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4603-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest that Src family kinases play a role in the response of macrophages to LPS, and hence in the response of macrophages to bacterial infection, the critical substrates of Src family kinases that mediate the various biological responses of macrophage to LPS have yet to be identified. In the present study we have sought to identify proteins that are phosphorylated by Src family kinases following LPS stimulation of the Bac1.2F5 macrophage cell line. We show that Cbl is a substrate of Hck in LPS-stimulated Bac1.2F5 cells. Further, we show that the phosphorylation of Cbl facilitates the physical association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with Cbl. Notably, LPS stimulation enhances the adherence of Bac1.2F5 cells, an effect that is dependent on the activity of Src family kinases and PI 3-kinase. On the basis of these findings, we postulate that Hck, at least in part, enhances the adherence of LPS-stimulated macrophages via Cbl and PI 3-kinase.

A cDNA encoding activated murine Hck (i.e. Hck499F) was excised from the plasmid pCDM8 Hck499F (a gift from Dr. Margaret Hibbs) with XbaI and subcloned into the XbaI sites of pEF-BOS (27.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar) to create pEF-Hck499F or “blunted” and subcloned into the HpaI site of the retroviral vector pRuf Neo (a generous gift from Dr. Tom Gonda (28.Rayner J.R. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) to create pRuf Hck499F. The mammalian expression vectors pEF-Hck267M (in which lysine 267 is replaced with methionine) and pEF-Hck91A/499F (in which tryptophan 91 and tyrosine 499 are replaced with alanine and phenylalanine, respectively) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction. The mammalian expression vectors pEF-Cbl (encoding wild type human Cbl) or pEF-Cbl731F (in which tyrosine 731 is replaced with phenylalanine) were created by excising cDNA inserts from pGEM 4Z-Cbl or pAlter-Cbl731F (generous gifts from Dr. Wallace Langdon), respectively, and subcloning the fragments into theXbaI sites of pEF-BOS. Bac1.2F5 cells were grown in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 25% L-cell conditioned medium (as a source of colony-stimulating factor-1). For LPS stimulation experiments cells were maintained in the above medium, but lacking L-cell conditioned medium, for 16 h prior to stimulation. ψ2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The retroviral constructs pRuf Neo and pRuf Hck499F were introduced into ψ2 cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection and subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. For infection of Bac1.2F5 cells, 2 × 106 retrovirus-producing ψ2 cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. The following day, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C for 4 h and then washed extensively with Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Bac1.2F5 cells (2.5 × 106) were co-cultivated with the mitotically inactivated ψ2 cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene for 2 days and then subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. Individual clones were isolated by single cell cloning. Human 293T cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with plasmid DNA using polyethylenimine (29.Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5637) Google Scholar). Bac1.2F5 or 293T cells were lysed directly in tissue culture dishes with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 units/ml aprotinin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. To isolate the cytoskeletal fraction, Bac1.2F5 cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were lysed for 2 min with 0.5 ml of cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer (10 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mmPefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 units/ml aprotinin). Plates were rinsed briefly (<10 s) with 0.5 ml of cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer and pooled with the initial lysate. Cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer lysates (1.0 ml) were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. This fraction is referred to as the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. To extract the cytoskeletal fraction, 1.0 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer was added to the residue remaining on the dishes and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cytoskeletal fraction was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation of cell lysates was performed by standard techniques. The catalytic activity of Hck was assessed by first immunoprecipitating the kinase from aliquots of cell lysate containing 200 μg of protein. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then once with kinase wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The immunoprecipitates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prior to exposure to a PhosphorImager screen, gels were treated with 1 m KOH at 55 °C for 2 h in order to reduce 32P label incorporated into serine and threonine residues. To phosphorylate Cblin vitro, anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 100 ng of purified recombinant Hck. The following glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of murine Hck were generated: GST-Hck unique domain (amino acids 1–80 of the p59 isoform of Hck), GST-Hck SH3 domain (amino acids 72–140), GST-Hck SH3 mutant (tryptophan 91 mutated to alanine), GST-Hck SH2 domain (amino acids 142–250), and GST-Hck unique/SH3/SH2 domains (amino acids 1–250) (referred to as GST-HckU32). The various domains were generated by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu DNA polymerase and then cloned into pGEX-2TH. The pGEX expression vectors were introduced into competent DH5α E. coli bacteria, and the expressed GST fusion proteins were purified by standard procedures with glutathione-Sepharose beads (30.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). To biotinylate GST and GST-HckU32, the affinity-purified proteins were dialyzed against 100 mmsodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and then incubated for 4 h on ice with EZ-Link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following biotinylation, the GST proteins were extensively dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and then stored at −70 °C in the presence of 15% glycerol. Binding assays were conducted by incubating 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 2 μg of bound GST fusion protein with aliquots of cell lysate containing 1 mg of protein for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing. Beads were then washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and subjected to Western blotting by standard techniques. Far-Western blotting was performed by probing filters with biotinylated GST or GST-HckU32 (100 ng/ml) for 5 h at 4 °C. Filters were washed with TBST (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase in TBST. Following extensive washing, filters were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bac1.2F5 cells were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates and grown until approximately 90% confluent. The cells were then treated with either 20 μm PP3 (an inactive Src family kinase inhibitor), 20 μm PP2 (an active Src family kinase inhibitor), or 100 nm wortmannin (a PI 3-kinase inhibitor) for 60 min, followed by stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 30 min. Differences in the adherence of the cells were then assessed by incubating the cells in 2 ml of PBS containing 10 mm EDTA (PBS/EDTA) for 30 min on a rotating platform. Following this treatment, the nonadherent cells (i.e. the “nonadherent” fraction) were collected and counted with the aid of a hemocytometer. Cells that remained attached to the dishes (i.e. the “adherent” fraction) were collected by vigorous pipetting in PBS/EDTA and counted. Bac1.2F5 cells, which were derived from SV40-transformed mature splenic macrophages (31.Morgan C. Pollard J.W. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), exhibit many of the immunological properties of mature primary macrophages, including the ability to secrete reactive nitrogen intermediates and tumor necrosis factor α when stimulated with LPS as well as the ability to kill bacterial and tumor cells (32.Buscher D. Sbarba P.D. Hipskind R.A. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. Baccarini M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Bac1.2F5 cells represent a good model system to study LPS-induced signal transduction. Stimulation of Bac1.2F5 cells with LPS induced a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins (p190, p150, p120, p110, p75, and p66) (see Fig. 1 A). Since tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl has previously been reported to occur in response to a variety of stimuli (33.Odai H. Sasaki K. Iwamatsu A. Hanazono Y. Tanaka T. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J.

Accordingly, Cbl was immunoprecipitated from lysates of Bac1.2F5 cells that had been stimulated with LPS for various periods of time, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, Cbl became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to LPS stimulation; maximal tyrosine phosphorylation was observed within 15–30 min of LPS stimulation and remained elevated for at least 2 h. It should be noted that two closely migrating proteins were detected when the Cbl immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Cbl antibodies (Fig. 1 B). These observations suggest that (i) Bac1.2F5 cells may express alternatively spliced forms of Cbl, (ii) Bac1.2F5 cells may, in addition to Cbl, express a Cbl-related protein of similar size, or (iii) Cbl may undergo limited proteolytic cleavage upon cell lysis. To ascertain if the LPS-induced phosphorylation of Cbl is mediated by Src family kinases we employed the specific Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 and the inactive form of the inhibitor PP3 as a control. Significantly, pretreatment of Bac1.2F5 cells with PP2, but not PP3, completely abolished the ability of LPS to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 1 C). Additionally, pretreatment with PP2 was also found to abolish the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in unstimulated Bac1.2F5 cells (Fig.1 C). Given that Hck has previously been implicated in the response of macrophages to LPS (23.Stefanova I. Corcoran M.L. Horak E.M. Wahl L.M. Bolen J.B. Horak I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20725-20728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.English B.K. Ihle J.N. Myracle A. Yi T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we wanted to establish if Cbl physically associates with Hck in Bac1.2F5 cells. To this end, Hck was immunoprecipitated from lysates of Bac1.2F5 cells that had been stimulated with LPS for various periods of time, and then the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with a polyclonal anti-Cbl antibody. This experiment revealed that Hck is physically associated with Cbl prior to LPS stimulation of Bac1.2F5 cells and that no change in the amount of Cbl physically associated with Hck occurs following LPS stimulation (Fig.2 A). Cbl was not detected in control immunoprecipitation reactions in which a control (irrelevant) antibody was employed. 2G. Scholz and K. Cartledge, unpublished data. The presence of Hck in anti-Cbl immunoprecipitates could not be demonstrated, since the heavy chain of the rabbit anti-Cbl immunoglobulin used in the immunoprecipitation reaction potentially obscured Hck protein in the immunoblot.2 In order to determine if Hck is capable of phosphorylating Cbl in Bac1.2F5 cells, an activated form of Hck (i.e. Hck499F) was introduced into Bac1.2F5 cells using the retroviral vector pRuf Neo (28.Rayner J.R. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ectopically expressed Hck499F is enzymatically active, as demonstrated by an autophosphorylation assay (Fig. 2 B), and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of primarily three proteins (p120, p110, and p66) in the absence of LPS stimulation (Fig. 2 C). In order to determine if the p120 protein was Cbl, anti-Cbl antibodies were employed in immunoprecipitation reactions using lysates of Bac-Hck499F cells and a corresponding lysate of cells containing the parental pRuf Neo vector (i.e. Bac-Neo4 cells). Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that Cbl is indeed highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in Bac1.2F5 cells expressing an activated form of Hck (Fig.2 D). Although this finding indicates that Hck can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in Bac1.2F5 cells, it does not allow us to conclude that Hck directly mediates its phosphorylation. Thus, anin vitro phosphorylation assay was performed to determine if Hck can directly phosphorylate Cbl. Specifically, Cbl was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected 293T cells and then incubated in the absence or presence of ATP and purified recombinant Hck. The data shown in Fig. 2 E clearly indicate that Hck can phosphorylate Cbl. In an attempt to demonstrate that Hck is directly involved in the LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in Bac1.2F5 cells, we generated clonal cell lines expressing a dominant-negative form of Hck (i.e. Hck267M) following infection of the parental Bac1.2F5 cells with the retroviral vector pRuf-Hck267M. However, LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl was not significantly perturbed in the Bac-Hck267M cell lines tested.2 Notably though, Western blotting of lysates derived from various Bac-Hck267M cell lines with an anti-Hck antibody revealed that the kinase-inactive mutant of Hck was only expressed at levels that were approximately 2–3-fold above that of endogenous Hck.2 It seems unlikely that this level of overexpression of kinase-inactive Hck would be sufficient to exert a dominant-negative effect over endogenous Hck. We next sought to identify which domain of Hck was responsible for mediating the interaction of Hck with Cbl in Bac1.2F5 cells and, further, whether this is a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. To address the first of these two questions, the ability of Cbl in lysates of unstimulated or LPS-stimulated Bac1.2F5 cells to associate with GST fusion proteins of Hck domains was examined. The results shown in Fig.3 A indicate that the isolated SH3 domain of Hck can mediate the association of Cbl with Hck. It was estimated that at least 20% of the total Cbl present in the cell lysates was capable of associating with GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domain of Hck under the conditions employed.2 In agreement with our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Cbl from both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated Bac1.2F5 cells associated equally well with GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domain of Hck. No association of Cbl with the GST-Hck SH2 domain fusion protein was observed, although Cbl had become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Since this apparent lack of binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl to the SH2 domain of Hck may have simply"
https://openalex.org/W1987298741,"The Lck tyrosine kinase is involved in signaling by T cell surface receptors such as TCR/CD3, CD2, and CD28. As other downstream protein-tyrosine kinases are activated upon stimulation of these receptors, it is difficult to assign which tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins represent bona fide Lck substrates and which are phosphorylated by other tyrosine kinases. We have developed a system in which Lck can be activated independently of TCR/CD3. We have shown that activation of an epidermal growth factor receptor/Lck chimera leads to the specific phosphorylation of Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and two RasGAP-associated proteins, p56 dok and p62 dok. Activation of the chimeric protein correlates with an increase in cellular Ca2+ in the absence of ZAP-70 and phospholipase Cγ1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we have found that p62 dok co-immunoprecipitates with the activated epidermal growth factor receptor/LckF505 and that phosphorylated Dok proteins bind to the Src homology 2 domain of Lck in vitro. In addition, we have shown that activation via the CD2 but not the TCR/CD3 receptor leads to the phosphorylation of p56 dok and p62 dok. Using JCaM1.6 cells, we have demonstrated that Lck is required for CD2-mediated phosphorylation of Dok proteins. We propose that phosphorylation and Src homology 2-mediated association of p56 dok and p62 dok with Lck play a selective function in accessory receptor signal transduction mechanisms.

Following cross-linking of these receptors, an increase in its kinase activity has been reported (1.August A. Dupont B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Moreover, the absolute requirement of Lck in these pathways has been demonstrated through the use of mutant cell lines that lack Lck expression (4.Hubert P. Lang V. Debre P. Bismuth G. J.

Dephosphorylation of tyrosine 505, likely by the tyrosine phosphatase CD45, is thought to allow the disruption of an inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the phosphorylated Tyr-505 and the SH2 domain of Lck (9.Gervais F.G.

In addition, Lck function depends on the ability of the SH3 and SH2 domains to interact with cellular molecules that may represent specific substrates or regulatory proteins (21.Peri K.G.

Although the structural basis for Lck activation is well known, the molecular mechanisms that take place in vivo in Lck activation and function are not well understood. CD4 cross-linking has been shown to enhance Lck activity (3.Luo K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5305-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This might be a consequence of oligomerization of CD4/Lck, a process that takes place upon binding of CD4 to MHC/TCR/Ag (reviewed in Ref. 26.Li S. Satoh T. Korngold R. Huang Z. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 455-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of CD4 activation of Lck is the translocation of Lck to the Nonidet P-40 insoluble cytoskeleton fraction (27.Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Samelson L.E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1989; 338: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In addition, cross-linking of defined epitopes of the CD4 molecule can lead to the induction of Ca2+ flux, phosphorylation of Shc, and activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factor (28.Baldari C.T. Milia E. Di S.M. Baldoni F. Valitutti S. Telford J.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1843-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CD4 cross-linking has also been reported to inhibit CD3-mediated signaling by sequestering the CD4-associated Lck from TCR/CD3 (29.Haughn L. Gratton S. Caron L. Sekaly R.P. Veillette A. Julius M. Nature. 1992; 358: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Lck can also be activated independently of the CD4 or CD8 coreceptor. Indeed, Lck activity has been reported to increase shortly after CD3 or CD2 cross-linking (2.Danielian S. Alcover A. Polissard L. Stefanescu M. Acuto O. Fischer S. Fagard R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Stimulation through these receptors results in the phosphorylation of a partially overlapping set of membrane and cytosolic proteins (30.Ley S.C. Davies A.A. Druker B. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Jin Y.J. Kaplan D.R. White M. Spagnoli G.C. Roberts T.M. Reinherz E.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 647-652PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins represent potentialin vivo substrates of Lck and several of them such as p95Vav (32.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) serve as in vitro substrates for Lck. However, it is not clear whether Lck is the kinase directly phosphorylating these proteinsin vivo. One of the most likely physiological substrates of Lck in TCR/CD3-mediated activation is the ζ chain (reviewed in Ref.38.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). In contrast, ζ or ZAP-70 phosphorylation is barely detectable following CD2 stimulation (4.Hubert P. Lang V. Debre P. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4322-4332PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CD2-mediated Lck increased activity can be detected in CD3− cells (2.Danielian S. Alcover A. Polissard L. Stefanescu M. Acuto O. Fischer S. Fagard R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2915-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that Lck activation can occur independently of TCR/CD3. Lck redistribution to the endosomal fraction has been reported upon CD2 but not CD3 stimulation (39.Marie-Cardine A. Fischer S. Gorvel J.P. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). T cells expressing high levels of surface CD2 can signal via CD2 in absence of TCR/CD3 expression (40.Ohno H. Ushiyama C. Taniguchi M. Germain R.N. Saito T. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3742-3746PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that important differences exist in the Lck-mediated signal transduction pathways following CD3 or CD2 cross-linking. To identify potential Lck substrates, we designed a system where Lck activation can be achieved independently of TCR/CD3 or the CD2 receptor. We introduced into Jurkat cells a chimeric protein that contains the Lck sequence fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR. We have studied the effect of EGF-mediated activation of the EGFR/LckF505 chimera on signal transduction events. We show that phosphorylation of RasGAP and two RasGAP-associated proteins, p62 dok and p56 dok, are specifically induced after Lck activation. Moreover, their phosphorylation correlates with an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Importantly, CD2 stimulation induces the phosphorylation of RasGAP, p62 dok, and p56 dok, whereas CD3 stimulation does not. We propose that phosphorylation of these proteins by Lck plays an important role in CD2-mediated signaling. The J-CD45–64 Jurkat cell line is a derivative of the CD45− clone 6.6, which expresses the p180 CD45 isoform, and Jurkat cells clone 77.6 have been described previously (41.Duplay P. Alcover A.

Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The EGFR/Lck constructs have been described previously (41.Duplay P. Alcover A. Fargeas C. Sekaly R. Branton P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17896-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Transfections of the J-CD45–64 cell line were performed with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 250 mV and 960 microfarads. Drug-resistant cells were cloned by limited dilution in puromycin-containing medium as described (41.Duplay P. Alcover A. Fargeas C. Sekaly R. Branton P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17896-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Expression of the transfected EGFR/Lck chimera and CD3 cell surface expression were screened by flow cytometric analysis with an EPICS XL (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Cells were washed twice in RPMI 1640 and resuspended at 5 × 107cells/ml in RPMI 1640. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 (UCHT1 at 1:500 dilution of ascites), anti-CD2 (a combination of T11–2 and T11–3 at 1/500 dilution of ascites), or EGF (100 ng/ml) for the time indicated. Cells were harvested and solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA in the presence of inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases (10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmPefabloc-sc, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, and 1 mmNaVO4). Cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.25%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) instead of 1% Nonidet P-40 for co-immunoprecipitation experiments of the EGFR/Lck chimera. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (22.Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For detection of biotinylated antibodies, blots were probed with a 1/3000 dilution of streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 107 cells/ml with 3 μmindo-1 (Molecular Probes) and 0.4 mg/ml Pluronic acid F-127 (Molecular Probes) for 25 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended at 5 × 106cells/ml, and Ca2+ mobilization was conducted on an EPICS ELITE ESP cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Cells were stimulated with the mAb UCHT1 (1:1000 dilution of ascites) or EGF (100 ng/ml) as indicated. Successful loading with Indo-1 was confirmed by subsequently treating the cells with ionomycin. Violet/blue ratio signals were analyzed using the MultiTime sofware (Phoenix, Flow Systems Inc., San Diego, CA). MBP and MBP-SH2-Sepharose beads were prepared as described (22.Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Postnuclear lysates were precleared for 1 h with MBP-Sepharose beads and incubated for 2 h with MBP-SH2 beads. The complexes were washed in the same conditions as the immune complexes and eluted by boiling in the presence of SDS sample buffer or by incubating twice for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence of 50 mm phenyl phosphate (a structural analog of phosphotyrosine) in 1% detergent lysis buffer under constant agitation. To identify novel Lck substrates, we have developed T cell lines in which Lck activation is induced independently of TCR/CD3. In this system, the entire Lck sequence except the 28 first amino acid residues is fused to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGFR. Three chimeric PTKs containing either a wild-type (WT), a constitutively active (Phe-505), or a kinase inactive (Ala-273) version of Lck were generated (41.Duplay P. Alcover A. Fargeas C. Sekaly R. Branton P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17896-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Multiple clones were established following transfection of a Jurkat cell line, J-CD45–64, with the different EGFR/Lck constructs, and levels of expression of EGFR/Lck were analyzed. Data of representative clones, which express comparable levels of TCR/CD3 at their cell surface, are shown. In unstimulated cells, constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR/LckWT chimera is much higher than that of the EGFR/LckF505 chimera (Fig. 1). This is likely because of the phosphorylation of Tyr-505, this site being absent in the EGFR/LckF505. The accessibility of this site to the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase might be limited in the EGFR/Lck chimera. Consequently, the high phosphorylation of Tyr-505 is likely to prevent EGF-induced activation of the WT chimera (see below). The addition of EGF induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR/LckF505 chimeric protein (Fig.1). The increase of EGFR/LckF505 tyrosine phosphorylation is likely to occur by autophosphorylation of Tyr-394, which is the predominant site of increased tyrosine phosphorylation after CD4 cross-linking. In contrast, the addition of EGF has no effect on the phosphorylation of the EGFR/LckWT and EGFR/LckA273 chimeras (Fig. 1). This result suggests that EGF-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR/Lck chimera requires a kinase domain that is constitutively activated. We next investigated whether the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR/LckF505 chimera correlates with an increase of the activity of the EGFR/Lck kinase by analyzing the effect of LckF505 oligomerization on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig.2). The pattern of phosphorylation induced following CD3 cross-linking was similar in all the cell lines expressing the EGFR/Lck and in the parental cell line. This result indicates that expression of the EGFR/Lck chimera does not interfere with the CD3-mediated signaling pathway. No change in the pattern of phosphorylated proteins is detected following EGF stimulation in the cells expressing the EGFR/LckWT or the EGFR/LckA273 chimera. In contrast, in the EGFR/LckF505 cell line, EGF induces the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of 4 proteins of M r56,000, 62,000, 80,000, and 120,000. Previous reports suggested that RasGAP and RasGAP-associated proteins represent potential substrates of the Lck tyrosine kinase (43.Ellis C. Liu X.Q. Anderson D. Abraham N. Veillette A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 895-901PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the p56, p62, and p120 phosphoproteins correspond to RasGAP and to the two recently cloned RasGAP-associated proteins (44.Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D.

Anti-RasGAP and anti-p62 dok immunoprecipitates were obtained from EGFR/LckF505 Jurkat cells that were unstimulated, EGF-stimulated, or CD3-stimulated and were analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots (Fig.3 A). In unstimulated cells, the RasGAP protein is not phosphorylated, whereas a very low level of phosphorylation of RasGAP-associated p62 protein is detected. EGF stimulation induces an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of RasGAP and RasGAP-associated p62 protein. In contrast, CD3 stimulation has no effect on the phosphorylation status of RasGAP and RasGAP-associated p62 protein. The RasGAP-associated protein of M r190,000, likely to correspond to p190RhoGAP (48.Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), is constitutively phosphorylated with no further increase in tyrosine phosphorylation following EGF or CD3 stimulation. To investigate whether the p62 RasGAP-associated protein corresponds to p62 dok, we performed p62 dok immunoblots on RasGAP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A). The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62 RasGAP-associated protein correlates with the amount of p62 dok present in RasGAP immunoprecipitates. In addition, phosphorylation of p62 dok following activation of the EGFR/Lck chimera was verified by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting of p62 dok immunoprecipitates. Activation of the EGFR/Lck chimera leads to the phosphorylation of another member of the Dok family, p56 dok, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Because the pattern of proteins phosphorylated by the EGFR/LckF505 chimera appeared different from that of proteins phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking (see Fig. 2), we assessed the phosphorylation status of specific proteins implicated as effector proteins downstream of CD3-mediated Lck activation. Whereas CD3 stimulation induces an important increase in ZAP-70 and PLCγ1 phosphorylation, the increase in phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and PLCγ1 is barely detectable in EGF-stimulated cells (Fig.4). Taken together, these results showed that LckF505 oligomerization induces the specific phosphorylation of RasGAP, p56 dok, and p62 dok proteins. Presumably, the phosphorylation of p56 dok and p62 dok allows its association with RasGAP. To evaluate the effect of the phosphorylation of RasGAP and RasGAP-associated proteins on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, we compared the Ca2+ response of the various cell lines after EGF and CD3 stimulation. Oligomerization of LckF505 by EGF induces a rapid and sustained rise in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+(Fig. 5). In contrast, no Ca2+ increase can be detected after oligomerization of the EGFR/LckWT or EGFR/LckA273 chimeras (Fig. 5). Expression of EGFR/LckWT, EGFR/LckA273, or EGFR/LckF505 does not alter the CD3-mediated Ca2+ response because CD3 cross-linking resulted in the characteristic increase in intracellular Ca2+. Because PLCγ1 phosphorylation is barely detectable after EGF stimulation, this result indicates that the EGF-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ may not be dependent of PLCγ1 activation and therefore may activate a signaling pathway distinct from that of the TCR. To analyze the effect of EGF on intracellular Ca2+release and extracellular Ca2+ influx, we performed similar experiments in the presence of EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca2+. Because EGTA prevents Ca2+ rise, these results suggest that Lck regulates Ca2+ influx by mediating the phosphorylation of a protein involved directly or indirectly in the regulation of Ca2+ channel opening. The CD2-mediated activation pathway leads to the phosphorylation of RasGAP and a RasGAP-associated p62 protein (4.Hubert P. Lang V. Debre P. Bismuth G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4322-4332PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Hubert P. Debre P. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether there is an increase in p62 dok and p56 dok phosphorylation following CD2 stimulation of Jurkat cells. As reported previously (49.Hubert P. Debre P. Boumsell L. Bismuth G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of RasGAP is induced upon CD2 cross-linking with a mAb pair, anti-T11–2 and anti-T11–3 (Fig.6 A). Similarly, CD2 stimulation induced an increase in the phosphorylation of p56 dok and p62 dok as detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting of p56 dok and p62 dok immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 A). Phosphorylation of the Dok proteins allows their subsequent binding to RasGAP as detected by an increase in the amounts of p56 and p62-associated proteins in the RasGAP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 A). Because CD2-mediated activation occurs in the absence of ZAP-70 phosphorylation (Fig.6 B), these results suggest that activation of EGFR/LckF505 induces signal transduction pathways overlapping with those induced by CD2 stimulation. To determine whether Dok phosphorylation required Lck, CD2 stimulation was performed in JCaM1.6 cells (Fig. 6 C). These cells lack functional Lck and express at their cell surface a similar level of CD2 to that of the wild-type Jurkat cells (data not shown). No tyrosine-phosphorylated p56 dok and p62 dok were detectable following CD2 stimulation in p56 dok, p62 dok, and RasGAP immunoprecipitates. Reconstitution of JCaM1.6 cells with wild-type Lck restores the CD2-induced phosphorylation of p56 dok and p62 dok (Fig.6 D). This result demonstrates that CD2-mediated phosphorylation of Dok proteins requires Lck. To test if an interaction between Lck and p62 dok occurs in vivo, immunoprecipitations of EGFR/Lck were performed with anti-EGFR antibodies and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine and anti-p62 dok immunoblottings (Fig.7). Immunoprecipitation of the EGFR/LckF505 chimera in EGF-stimulated cells compared with unstimulated cells revealed two additional phosphorylated proteins ofM r 62,000 and 80,000. The 62-kDa phosphoproteins may correspond to p62 dok. Immunoblots with anti-p62 dok antibodies confirmed that a fraction of phosphorylated p62 dok was present in EGFR/Lck immunoprecipitates (Fig. 7). The antibodies against p56 dok that we used in this study react weakly in Western blotting with human p56 dok. Therefore, we were not able to conclusively identify p56 dok in the EGFR/Lck immunoprecipitate. To gain better insight into the mechanisms by which Lck is involved in the phosphorylation of RasGAP and p62 dok, we examined whether the SH2 domain of Lck is able to bind to these proteins. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that bind to the Lck SH2 domain were identified using in vitro binding assays with MBP·LckSH2 fusion protein and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 8 A). The MBP·SH2 fusion protein bound proteins of 62- and 56-kDa when incubated with a lysate of EGF-induced LckF505 cells. The 56- and 62-kDa proteins correspond to the p56 dok and p62 dok proteins, respectively, as shown by immunoprecipitations with anti-p56 dok and anti-p62 dok antibodies after elution of the SH2-bound proteins (Fig. 8 A). Moreover, the interaction of the Lck SH2 domain with p56 dok and p62 dok can be reconstituted in vitroin SDS-denatured cell lysates (Fig. 8 B) indicating that it is a direct interaction. Although CD3 stimulation of the same cells induced the phosphorylation of several proteins able to bind to Lck SH2 domain, there is no binding of p56 dok and p62 dok. This result is consistent with the absence of phosphorylation of p56 dok and p62 dok after CD3 stimulation (see Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 8 C, an association of p56 dok and p62 dok was detected with Lck·SH2 fusion protein using lysates isolated from CD2-activated Jurkat cells, whereas this association is barely detectable in resting or CD3-activated cells. Interestingly, the pattern of proteins able to bind to the Lc"

Initially, it was believed that their role was to serve as substrate for the receptor-mediated production of two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, by their phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). More recently, it became increasingly evident that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as well as the 3-phosphorylated inositides can serve additional roles as membrane anchors for the assembly of protein signaling complexes in specific membrane compartments (2.Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Inositol phospholipids are produced by sequential phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 by an increasing number of inositol lipid kinases, including the various classes of PI 3-kinases (3.Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), the PI 4-kinases (4.Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the PIP kinases (5.Hinchliffe A.K. Ciruela A. Irvine R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 87-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6.Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another group of enzymes, termed PI kinase-related kinases, also possess the signature motifs within their ATP-binding catalytic domains that are characteristic for PI kinases. PI kinase-related kinases are serine/threonine kinases with no apparent PI kinase activity (7.Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In contrast, some of the PI 3-kinases do possess protein kinase activity in addition to being bona fide lipid kinases. For example, PI 3-kinase α phosphorylates its regulatory subunit, p85 (8.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W-M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and PI 3-kinase δ autophosphorylates its C-terminal tail (10.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both modifications greatly reduce the lipid kinase activity of the respective proteins. Vps34p, a yeast PI 3-kinase involved in protein sorting, and the G protein-activated PI 3-kinase γ also display protein kinase activity and undergo autophosphorylation, although with no apparent change in their lipid kinase activities (11.Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a recent study has indicated that the protein kinase activity of PI 3-kinase γ might be more relevant to some of its downstream signaling than its lipid kinase activity (13.Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). While a number of studies have addressed the question of lipidversus protein kinase activities of PI 3-kinases, relatively little is known about such properties of PI 4-kinases. PI 4-kinases are the enzymes that catalyze the 4-phosphorylation of PI, the first step in a reaction sequence that leads to the formation of most of the polyphosphoinositides. (Recent evidence suggests that some 5-phosphorylation of PI may precede 4-phosphorylation (14.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar)). The majority of the cellular PI 4-kinase activity is represented by the tightly membrane-bound type II 4-kinase enzyme, which has been purified from various tissues as a 50–56-kDa protein (see Ref. 15.Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar for a review) but still awaits molecular cloning and characterization. In contrast, two distinct forms of the less abundant type III PI 4-kinases have been purified from bovine adrenal (16.Balla T. Downing G.J. Jaffe H. Kim S. Zolyomi A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18358-18366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and brain (17.Gehrmann T. Vereb G. Schmidt M. Klix D. Meyer E.H. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and cloned from various species including humans (18.Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These two enzymes, a 110-kDa β-form and a 230-kDa α-form, are homologues of two yeast PI 4-kinases that are products of the PIK1 and STT4genes, respectively (19.Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins also contain the characteristic signature of the ATP-binding catalytic domain of PI 3-kinases and are inhibited by the microbial product, WT, the most potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinases (21.Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the bacterial expression of bovine PI4Kβ with catalytic properties similar to those of the purified enzyme. We also show that PI 4-kinase β undergoes autophosphorylation but is unable to transphosphorylate and that its autophosphorylation decreases its lipid kinase activity. It is also demonstrated that PI4Kβ is phosphorylated in vivo in mammalian cells, but the majority of the in vivo phosphorylation is not due to autophosphorylation of the enzyme. Further studies with the recombinant enzyme will help us to better understand the functions and regulation of this enzyme and the role of 4-phosphorylated lipids in cell regulation. [3H]Wortmannin-17-ol (19.7 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000–6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ortho-[32P]phosphate was from ICN Biochemical Research Products (Costa Meas, CA). Reagents for the cloning and purification of GST-PI 4-kinase β were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ATP, adenosine, and WT were obtained from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY), and LY 294002, PP1, PP2A1, and okadaic acid were purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents were of analytical or high pressure liquid chromatography grade. The 2.4-kilobase pair insert encoding the full-length bovine phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β was amplified by long range polymerase chain reaction (primers 5′-ctggatccatgggagacacgatagtg-3′ and 5′-agcggccgcatgatgccgttggtgaggtac-3′) using the pcDNA3.1-PI4KIIIβ (16.Balla T.

After cutting with the restriction enzymesBamHI/NotI, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into the pGEX-4T-2 or pGEX-6P-3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precut with the same enzymes. The inserts of the plasmids were sequenced, and the constructs were transfected into the BL21 strain ofE. coli. After induction (isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 30 μm at 16–19 °C for 6 h) the recombinant fusion proteins were isolated from the bacterial lysates. After sonication in buffer A (containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 200 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin), the protein was purified from the soluble fraction by glutathione-agarose chromatography. Untagged PI4Kβ was produced by cleavage of the recombinant protein with PreScission protease (1 unit per 100 μg of fusion protein in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol at 4 °C overnight). The activity of PI 4-kinase was measured as incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into organic solvent-extractable material (22.Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture for PI 4-kinase (50 μl final volume) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PI, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and the enzyme. All assay components except [γ-32P]ATP were preincubated with or without inhibitors for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 10 min by the addition of 3 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/37% HCl (200:100:0.75 (v/v/v)). The organic solvent phase was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by adding 0.6 ml of 0.6 n HCl, mixing vigorously, and standing for phase separation. The upper (aqueous) phase was discarded, and 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/0.6 n HCl (3:48:47 (v/v/v)) was added to the lower phase, followed by mixing and phase separation. The lower phase was then transferred to scintillation vials, and, after evaporation, the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. To test the effect of prephosphorylation of PI4Kβ on its lipid kinase activity, the enzyme immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B was incubated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmMnCl2 in the absence or presence of 300 μmATP for selected periods of time (0.5–5.0 h) at 37 °C. The reaction tubes were then transferred to ice and equally reconstituted with ATP, followed immediately by the addition of 4 mm TPEN (to chelate Mn2+). After washing one more time with 500 μl of 4 mm TPEN, a standard lipid kinase assay was performed (except that the unlabeled ATP concentration was 1 mm) for 10 min at room temperature. For studies on the effect of dephosphorylation, the enzyme was incubated in the presence of Mn2+ in the presence or absence of ATP and treated with TPEN as described above. After the last wash, the immobilized enzyme was washed with “dephosphorylation buffer” (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and aliquoted into four tubes for treatment with PP1 (4 units/100 μl) or PP2A1 (0.1 unit/100 μl) for 30 min at 25 °C. A lipid kinase assay was then performed on the proteins using 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/tube). The assay was either performed on the GST-fused enzyme immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B or on the PreScission-cleaved protein. In some experiments, the endogenous or expressed PI4Kβ, immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells (see below) was used in the kinase assays. The reaction was performed in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 3–10 mm MnCl2, 40 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. After phosphorylation, the protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). COS-7 cells were grown on 10-cm culture dishes to 80% confluence and transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNA per dish using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were either untransfected or transfected with PI4Kβ (16.Balla T. Downing G.J. Jaffe H. Kim S. Zolyomi A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18358-18366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or the pEGFP-N1 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for control. The kinase-dead version of PI4Kβ (D656A) was created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The 940-base pair MfeI/XbaI fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into the wild-type DNA, and the entire sequence of this insert was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Transfected cells were labeled with ortho-[32P]phosphate (0.1 mCi/ml) for 4 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Labeled cells were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS before lysis in 1.3 ml of lysis buffer per plate (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm okadaic acid). Cell lysates were sonicated, and after centrifugation, 1 μg of anti-PI4Kβ antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected by adding Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed 3–5 times with 0.6 ml of buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. When treated with WT, cells were incubated with 10 μm WT for 10 min, and the medium was changed before 32P labeling. Expression of the bovine PI4Kβ as a GST fusion protein was attempted in the BL21 strain of E. coli. Induction of protein expression by incubation with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (20–1000 μm) caused the appearance of a protein of ∼140 kDa, which was present largely in the insoluble fraction (not shown). At mild inducing conditions (30 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; 16–19 °C), about 50% of the protein was recovered in the soluble fraction. It is noteworthy that no soluble protein was obtained in the bacterial strain, DH5α. The soluble fraction was purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-agarose resin (Fig.1 A), with a usual yield of about 0.5 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of bacterial suspension. Since thrombin cleavage caused degradation of PI4Kβ, mostly yielding 48- and 60-kDa fragments (in addition to free GST), we also created a plasmid that contained the PreScission protease cleavage site instead of the thrombin site. This protease successfully released intact PI4Kβ from the GST fusion protein. The purified enzyme was more stable on the agarose beads than in solution and retained its lipid kinase activity over 10 days at 4 °C. However, its elution from the beads with glutathione or by proteolytic digestion became less efficient upon storage at 4 °C, and substantial amounts of the protein remained bound to the beads. Kinetic parameters of the recombinant PI4Kβ were determined to compare its properties with those of the purified activity isolated from bovine brain. TheK m value of the recombinant enzyme for ATP was found to be 422 μm, and the K i value for adenosine was 635 μm, values that are comparable with those of the purified bovine protein (23.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sensitivities of the lipid kinase activity of the enzyme to the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, WT and LY 294002, were identical to those previously described for the mammalian enzyme (23.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). The specific activity of the purified enzyme (0.8–1.3 μmol/min/mg of protein) was somewhat lower, but comparable with that of the purified yeast Pik1 (4.3 μmol/min/mg) (24.Flanagan C.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that some of the protein might have become inactive during the preparation or that some modification or co-factor is needed for the optimal function of the recombinant protein. To test whether PI4Kβ also possesses protein kinase activity, we evaluated its ability to undergo autophosphorylation. Fig. 1 B shows that in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (and without the lipid substrate, PI) the enzyme became phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation was blocked by preincubation with 10 μmWT. No autophosphorylation was detected in the presence of the lipid substrate, PI (not shown). Autophosphorylation was more pronounced in the presence of Mn2+ (compared with Mg2+), a feature also described for autophosphorylation of PI 3-kinases (9.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 10.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal Mn2+ concentration was found to be at 3–5 mm (not shown), and the pH optimum for autophosphorylation was around neutral pH, rapidly falling at higher pH values (not shown). The pH dependence of autophosphorylation closely correlated with the previously reported pH sensitivity of the enzyme's lipid kinase activity (23.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sensitivities of protein kinase activities to the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, WT and LY 294002, were very similar to those of the enzyme's lipid kinase activity. Each of the inhibitors reduced both activities with similar IC50 values (100 nm for WT and 5 μm for LY 294002) (Fig. 2,A and B). We next examined whether PI4Kβ can transphosphorylate another molecule of PI4Kβ. For this, we prepared the enzyme both in its GST fusion form and in its cleaved form using the PreScission protease. Both enzymes were able to undergo autophosphorylation (the cleaved enzyme appeared to be more active in this respect), and when mixed together, both proteins became phosphorylated (Fig.3, lanes 1,2, and 5). However, when the GST fusion protein was pretreated with WT (which irreversibly inhibits the enzyme) and the inhibitor washed out, this enzyme showed no autophosphorylation (Fig.3, lane 3) and could not serve as an acceptor when mixed with the still active cleaved enzyme (Fig. 3,lane 4). These results suggested that autophosphorylation is most likely to take place in a residue that is in close proximity to the ATP binding site (in the absence of PI) and is held there by intramolecular interactions. To test the effect of protein phosphorylation on lipid kinase activity, the enzyme was preincubated with 300 μm ATP for selected periods of time in the presence of 1–3 mmMn2+. Under these conditions, phosphorylation of the protein occurs over a period of 5 h (Fig.4 A). After phosphorylation, Mn2+ was removed by washing the enzyme twice with 4 mm TPEN on ice (for a total of 15 min) followed by a lipid kinase assay in the presence of Mg2+ and high concentration (1 mm) of ATP. Since Mn2+ treatment itself decreased the catalytic activity of the enzyme, the activities of the phosphorylated enzyme (incubated with Mn2+ plus ATP) were compared with those only treated with Mn2+ (without ATP) at each time point. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PI kinase activity decreased parallel to the autophosphorylation of the enzyme. To test whether phosphorylation indeed was responsible for the activity loss, we used protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A1, to dephosphorylate the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both phosphatases were able to dephosphorylate the protein, (PP1 was more active in this regard), and the effect of PP2A1 was reversed by the addition of 1 μm okadaic acid (okadaic acid was not tested on PP1). Phosphatase treatment of the prephosphorylated enzyme increased the enzyme's PI kinase activity, and this effect was prevented by pretreatment of the phosphatase with okadaic acid (Fig. 4 B). Similar phosphatase treatment was without effect on the PI kinase activity of the control, unphosphorylated protein (Fig. 4 B). These results suggested that the decreased lipid kinase activity is reversible and is indeed due to autophosphorylation of the protein. To examine whether autophosphorylation of PI4Kβ occurs within cells, we performed experiments in COS-7 cells prelabeled with [32P]phosphate and immunoprecipitated the enzyme to assess its phosphorylation state. As shown in Fig.5 A (left), endogenous PI4Kβ was found phosphorylated when immunoprecipitated from prelabeled COS-7 cells, with a slight decrease in its phosphorylation when cells were pretreated with 10 μm WT. When PI4Kβ was overexpressed, a significant increase was observed in the amount of phosphorylated enzyme that was consistently reduced by about 50% in WT-treated cells. This suggested that significant phosphorylation of PI4Kβ remained even after autophosphorylation had been inhibited by WT treatment. Unfortunately, a small decrease was also observed in the amount of PI4Kβ in the immunoprecipitate of WT-treated cells as assessed by Western blotting (despite the use of the same total amounts of cellular proteins). This decrease, which we could only attribute to a potential interference with the antibody recognizing the native protein after WT treatment, made it difficult to quantitate the extent to which WT treatment decreased phosphorylation. Therefore, we also examined the phosphorylation of a kinase-inactive (D656A) mutant of PI4Kβ and found that despite the lack of its protein and lipid kinase activities (Fig.6, A and B), it still was found to be phosphorylated in COS-7 cells. The phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive protein was again slightly inhibited by pretreatment with WT but significantly less than the wild-type protein (Fig. 5, A and B).Figure 6Protein and lipid kinase activities of PI4Kβ immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells.COS-7 cells were transfected with bovine PI4Kβ, its kinase-defective (KD) mutant (D656A), or pEGFP-N1 (as control) for 36 h. PI4Kβ was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with an anti-PI4Kβ antibody followed by PI kinase and protein kinase assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Autophosphorylation and Western blot analysis (A), and PI kinase activity (B) is shown from one of two similar observations. In these experiments, WT treatment (1 μm) was performed on the immunoprecipitated proteins for 10 min before the kinase assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined whether the immunoprecipitated enzyme (apparently already phosphorylated) can undergo further phosphorylation in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, both the endogenous and expressed PI4Kβ (but not its kinase-dead form) was able to autophosphorylate after immunoprecipitation from COS-7 cells. This in vitrophosphorylation was completely prevented by pretreatment of the immunoprecipitated enzyme with WT. Autophosphorylation activity closely correlated with the PI kinase activity of the immunoprecipitates (Fig.6 B). These results together indicated that although some autophosphorylation may occur in vivo, especially when PI4Kβ is overexpressed, the majority of the phosphorylation is due to the action of additional kinase(s) that act upon the protein in COS-7 cells. We took advantage of the internal thrombin cleavage site(s) found in the kinase to determine which part of the molecule is autophosphorylated. First, the enzyme was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (with or without WT pretreatment) followed by digestion with thrombin for 12 h at 4 °C. After digestion, the soluble fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In parallel experiments, the enzyme was labeled with [3H]WT and digested identically. As shown in Fig. 7 A, phosphorylation and [3H]WT labeling showed almost identical digestion patterns, with labeling of a 48-kDa main band (and weaker labeling of a 52-kDa larger fragment and 35-kDa smaller fragments, the latter probably being a product of further proteolysis by contaminating proteases). The WT-binding site has been mapped within the ATP-binding catalytic domain to the conserved lysine residue (Lys802) in PI 3-kinase α (21.Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and to the identical Lys799 on PI 3-kinase γ (12.Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a residue also present in type III 4-kinases (4.Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,25.Gehrmann T. Heilmeyer L.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the labeled fragments contain the C-terminal catalytic part of the protein. The larger 60-kDa, presumably N-terminal, fragment showed no specific labeling with either [γ-32P]ATP or [3H]WT. Although the thrombin-cleaved enzyme loses its PI kinase activity, consistent with the need for the more N-terminally located unique lipid kinase domain, it retained its WT binding activity as judged by labeling of the smaller fragment with [3H]WT even after thrombin treatment (data not shown). To test the possibility that the isolated catalytic domain retains its autophosphorylating activity, the enzyme was digested with thrombin prior to the protein kinase assay. Under these conditions, the 48-kDa fragment was still able to autophosphorylate (in a WT-sensitive manner) (Fig. 7 B), confirming that this fragment contains the C-terminal catalytic core of the protein, which retains its active conformation even after thrombin digestion. (The WT-insensitive phosphorylation of an ∼80-kDa protein is due to the presence of a contaminating bacterial protein that is variably present in some preparations of PI4Kβ and co-migrates with the ∼80-kDa N-terminal fragment of the thrombin-digested PreScission construct used for this experiment.) The present study demonstrates that PI4Kβ, one of the two cloned type III PI 4-kinases, can be expressed in prokaryotes in a functional form. The recombinant protein shares all of the characteristics of the mammalian enzyme, including ATP affinity, WT binding, and inhibition by higher concentrations of PI 3-kinase inhibitors. We also found that the enzyme undergoes autophosphorylation, which, in turn, decreases its subsequent PI kinase activity. While we were unable to achieve stoichiometric phosphorylation of the enzyme as yet (probably due to the rapid inactivation of the protein with Mn2+ and the possible presence of some nonfunctional protein), the fact that PI kinase activity is inversely related to autophosphorylation and that dephosphorylation restores lipid kinase activity suggests that, as far as the functional protein is concerned, autophosphorylation is likely to be stoichiometric. Further studies are under way to ensure a better phosphorylation stoichiometry that would allow determination of the autophosphorylation site. We also found that autophosphorylation does not take place in the presence of the lipid substrate, PI, and that the enzyme is unable to trans-phosphorylate. These findings indicate that the internal phosphorylation site and the inositol lipid head group compete for the position close to the terminal phosphate of ATP, and another molecule of the kinase cannot access this catalytic site. Our finding that the truncated C-terminal catalytic domain of PI4Kβ is still capable of autophosphorylation indicates that the phosphorylation site resides within the catalytic core of the protein and does not require the presence of the more N-terminal domains. In contrast, the lipid kinase activity of such a truncated protein was completely lost, consistent with the need for the presence of the unique lipid kinase domain for lipid phosphorylation. In the recently published structure of PI 3-kinase γ (26.Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), the C-terminal helical sequence of the protein is in a favored position to be phosphorylated. While the phosphorylation site(s) of PI 3-kinase γ has not been determined, the phosphorylation site in PI 3-kinase δ has been localized in the tail of the protein (10.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequences of PI 4-kinases within their C-terminal tail are significantly different from those of PI 3-kinases but contain several conserved Ser/Thr residues that might be candidates for autophosphorylation. Whether protein kinase activity and autophosphorylation of PI 4-kinase β are relevant to its biological functions is not clear at present. Although we found that both endogenous and expressed PI4Kβ are phosphorylated in COS-7 cells, the contribution of autophosphorylation is relatively minor and mostly presents with the overexpressed enzyme. Since the presence of the lipid substrate inhibits autophosphorylation, the latter is more likely to happen when the protein is in excess relative to its substrate. However, the endogenous or expressed enzyme immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells still was able to autophosphorylate, also suggesting that the enzyme is not heavily autophosphorylated in vivo. While these data do not indicate prominent autophosphorylation in the bulk of the protein, they cannot rule out that autophosphorylation could become important in specific compartments of the cell, since this enzyme is likely to be involved in several aspects of cellular functions (4.Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data also suggest that the enzyme is phosphorylated in mammalian cells by additional kinase(s), and the significance of this phosphorylation in the regulation of the protein is yet to be determined. In this regard, it is noteworthy that mutation of one of the conserved serine residues (S1045F) in the C-terminal sequence of Pik1, the yeast homologue of PI4Kβ, was found to be catalytically impaired, yielding a phenotype defective in membrane traffic and secretion (27.Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in the regulation of PI 3-kinases has not been well established in all cases, although autophosphorylation and protein kinase activity of certain PI 3-kinases have been proposed to be important for their function(s). In the case of PI 3-kinase δ, autophosphorylation has been shown to occur in vivo and results in decreased lipid kinase activity (10.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, PI 3-kinase α can phosphorylate its p85 regulatory subunit both in vitro and in vivo, decreasing the lipid kinase activity of the complex (9.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast, autophosphorylation of Vps34p and PI 3-kinase γ was reported not to change the enzyme's lipid kinase activity (11.Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the physiological role of the autophosphorylation in the regulation of these proteins remains to be elucidated. Additional protein substrates of PI kinases have also been reported; IRS-1 was found to be phosphorylated by PI 3-kinase α after stimulation with insulin (28.Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or interferon α (29.Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of PI 3-kinase γ, evidence is accumulating to suggest that it has additional protein substrate(s). In a recent study, it was shown that protein, but not lipid, kinase activity of PI 3-kinase γ was necessary for its stimulatory effect on MAP kinase activation (13.Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein kinase activity of the enzyme on some downstream component is important for the function of this protein. There was no indication in our studies that PI 4-kinase β would be able to act on protein substrates. In summary, we have expressed a functional PI 4-kinase β in a bacterial expression system. This enzyme is indistinguishable from its mammalian counterpart in its catalytic properties and inhibitor sensitivities. Characterization of the recombinant protein revealed its autophosphorylation, which, in turn, inhibits the enzyme's PI kinase activity. While PI4Kβ was also found phosphorylated in mammalian cells, apparently only a minor component of this phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Further studies are needed to clarify whether phosphorylation plays a role in the control of the enzyme and cellular PI4-phosphate synthesis."

As such, they play essential roles in DNA replication, transcription, and DNA recombination (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). There are two classes of topoisomerases, type I and type II enzymes. Type I topoisomerases alter the linking number in steps of one by breaking one strand of the duplex DNA, passing the other strand through the break, and then resealing the broken strand. On the other hand, type II topoisomerases alter the linking number in steps of two by breaking both strands, passing another segment of the helix through the break, and then resealing the broken strands (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Both DNA gyrase (Gyr)1 and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) are type II topoisomerases. Quinolones are synthetic antibacterial drugs based on the 4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinolone skeleton (2.Smith J.T. Fortschr. Antimikrob. Antineoplast. Chemother. 1984; 493: 3-5Google Scholar). After the discovery of nalidixic acid as an antibacterial agent, successive generations of drugs have brought orders of magnitude increases in antibacterial activity. Quinolone drugs, such as ciprofloxacin, are now one of the most widely prescribed antibacterial drugs. It has been demonstrated that, shortly after the identification of Escherichia coliGyr (3.Sugino A. Peebles C.L. Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These drugs form a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex. As a result, the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex (often referred to as the “cleavable complex”) that contains broken DNA strands can persist on the DNA, as if the topoisomerase were trapped in the cleavable complex. Ultimate denaturation or disruption of the topoisomerase in the ternary complex therefore results in the generation of a double-strand break (DSB) and subsequent cell death (8.Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Based on this unique mode of action, this class of topoisomerase inhibitors is often called the “topoisomerase poison.” Some anticancer drugs targeting human type II topoisomerases also convert these enzymes to poisons in the same fashion (11.Tewey K.M. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Halligan B.D. Liu L.F. Science. 1984; 266: 466-468Crossref Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The formation of topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes is necessary but not sufficient for the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase poisons. These ternary complexes are normally reversible. In addition to the formation of the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes, an active DNA transaction is required for the disruption of ternary complexes and the generation of a DSB (8.Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The reconstitution of the collision between a replication fork and a Topo IV-norfloxacin (Norf)-DNA ternary complex has revealed that the collision of a replication fork with a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex converts the ternary complex to a nonreversible form but does not generate a DSB (12.Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). An additional step, perhaps an aborted repair attempt, is required for the generation of a DSB. Khodursky and Cozzarelli (13.Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the loss of the UvrD function affects Topo IV-targeted cell killing but not Gyr-targeted cell killing. These results suggest that the postreplicative repair system is effective for the repair of ternary complexes formed with Topo IV but is not effective for the repair of ternary complexes formed with Gyr. It is concluded that the UvrD-directed postreplicative repair system can repair Topo IV-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes, but not Gyr-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes, because of the positions of Gyr and Topo IV during DNA replication (13.Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Gyr acts ahead of the advancing replication forks, and Topo IV acts behind the forks (14.Khodursky A.B. Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 92: 11801-11805Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, ternary complexes formed with Topo IV have a greater chance to be repaired by the postreplicative repair system than those formed with Gyr. In addition, the ternary complexes formed with Gyr more frequently collide with the replication forks than those formed with Topo IV to trigger the quinolone-induced cytotoxic events. We have previously studied the interactions between Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes and various DNA helicases (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have found that the collision of the UvrD helicase with a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex results in the conversion of the ternary complex to a nonreversible form, which seems to be critical for the generation of a DSB. It is suggested that this conversion of Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex to a nonreversible form may be a critical step to initiate the removal of the ternary complex and the repair of the DNA damage by the postreplicative repair system (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigated the effects of the UvrD helicase on the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes formed with either Gyr, Topo IV, or Gyr (A59), a mutant Gyr that does not wrap the DNA strand around itself (17.Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ternary complexes formed with either Gyr or Topo IV, but not those formed with Gyr (A59), inhibited the UvrD helicase activity. Collisions of UvrD with these ternary complexes resulted in the formation of a single-strand break (SSB) at small portions of ternary complexes. Interestingly, the majority of Gyr-Norf-DNA ternary complexes remained reversible after their collisions with UvrD, whereas the majority of Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes was converted to a nonreversible form upon their collisions with UvrD. These results demonstrated that the UvrD helicase could affect the ternary complexes formed with Gyr and those formed with Topo IV in a distinct manner. Furthermore, these results indicated that different DNA repair mechanisms might be involved in the repair of Gyr-Norf-DNA and Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes. The construction of a recombinant M13 containing a defined Topo IV-binding site (M13-T440) (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the preparation of the single-stranded circular DNA of M13-T440 (18.Franke B. Ray D.S. Virology. 1971; 44: 168-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19.Model P. Zinder N.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 83: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were as described previously. Purified UvrD and the subunits of E. coli Gyr and Topo IV were generous gifts of Kenneth Marians (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). GyrA and GyrB and ParC and ParE proteins were mixed on ice to form active tetramers of Gyr and Topo IV, respectively. Purified UvrD, a gift of Steve Matson (University of North Carolina), was also used. A deletion mutant of gyrA encoding the amino acids from 1 to 523 (17.Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR and cloned into pET-11c. The DNA sequence analysis confirmed that this deletion mutant of gyrA gene encoded a 59-kDa fragment of the GyrA subunit, GyrA (59). The GyrA (59) protein was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by an unpublished procedure. 2M. E. Shea and H. Hiasa, unpublished results. Briefly, this purification procedure consisted of preparation of a soluble lysate, removal of nucleic acids by precipitation with 0.075% Polymin P, precipitation of proteins with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation), and then chromatography on Q Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose DE52 (Whatman). This preparation of GyrA (59) was judged to have a purity of greater than 90% by denaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). GyrA (59) was mixed with the wild type GyrB to reconstitute a mutant Gyr, and this mutant Gyr was referred to as Gyr (A59). Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Stratagene, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The partial duplex DNA was prepared as described previously (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 62-nucleotide (nt) oligonucleotide (oligo), T440C, 5′-GCTCGTATCTAGACTCCTAAAAATCCGGGGTATACCCCGGATTTTTAGGAGTGTGTCGCGAT-3′ was synthesized and hybridized to the M13-T440 single-stranded DNA to prepare a primer-template. The oligo in the primer-template was then 3′-end-labeled by incorporation of 2 residues of [32P]dAMP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the Klenow enzyme. This DNA was referred to as “T440” in this study (originally referred to as “3′-T440” in Ref. 16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 3′-end-labeled oligo was elongated by the Klenow enzyme in the presence of four deoxyribonucleotides to an average length of 175 nt with a range of 150–200 nt (see Fig. 1). We referred to this elongated partial duplex DNA as “T440E.” Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mm ATP, 10 fmol (as molecule) of DNA substrate (either T440 or T440E), indicated amounts (as tetramer) of Gyr, Topo IV, or Gyr (A59), and the indicated concentrations of Norf were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. SDS was added to 1% to terminate the reactions, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), heat-denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 8% (for T440E) and 10% (for T440) polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 12 V/cm for 2 h using 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer (TBE buffer). Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 papers (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amounts of cleaved DNA strands were quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The standard reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm ATP, 10 fmol (as molecule) of either T440 or T440E, and the indicated concentrations of Norf. Three hundred fmol (as tetramer) of Gyr, Topo IV, or Gyr (A59) was added to the reaction mixtures, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to form topoisomerase-DNA complexes. After the first incubation stage, 250 fmol (as monomer) of UvrD was added and then the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm, followed by the addition of a 0.25 volume of a dye mixture containing 15% glycerol, 2% Sarkosyl, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 50 mm EDTA. Aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1% agarose (Seakem ME, FMC) gels (140 × 120 × 3 mm) at 5 V/cm for 2 h in a running buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23 °C), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (TAE buffer). Portions of reaction mixtures were also analyzed by electrophoresis through 8 (for T440E) and 10% (for T440) polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 12 V/cm for 2 h using TBE buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 papers (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Strand displacement was quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The reversibility of the topoisomerase complexes after their collision with the UvrD helicase was assessed by combining a strand-displacement assay and a reversal assay (7.Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were assembled as described above, and Gyr, Topo IV, or Gyr (A59) was bound to the partial duplex DNA in the presence of Norf during the first stage of incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence and absence of UvrD. This stage allowed UvrD, when present, to collide with a topoisomerase-Norf-DNA ternary complex. Reactions were terminated by adding either EDTA or SDS to 25 mm and 1%, respectively, and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min. Then either SDS or EDTA, together with proteinase K, was added to each reaction mixture to a final concentration of 1%, 25 mm, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. The incubation was further continued at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), heat-denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 8% (for T440E) and 10% (for T440) polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide to bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 12 (for 10%) and 18 (for 8%) V/cm, respectively, for 2 h using TBE buffer. Gels were dried and analyzed as described above. One of the basic differences between Gyr and Topo IV is their mode of DNA binding. Gyr is unique among the type II topoisomerases. This enzyme wraps the DNA strand around itself (20.Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Liu L.F. Wang J.C.

A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and protects about 140 base pairs (bp) of the duplex DNA (21.Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22.Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C.

A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This unique mode of DNA binding enables Gyr to catalyze the supercoiling reaction. In contrast, Topo IV and other type II topoisomerases do not wrap the DNA strand and require shorter DNA fragments for their binding. The footprinting analysis of Topo IV has revealed that it protects only about 35–40 bp (24.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Kampranis and Maxwell (17.Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a deletion of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the GyrA subunit, GyrA (59), gives rise to an enzyme that does not wrap the DNA strand around itself and that cannot catalyze the supercoiling reaction. Thus, the DNA binding mode of Gyr (A59) is likely to be similar, if not identical, to that of Topo IV (17.Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To perform the strand-displacement assay, we prepared two partial duplex DNAs, which differed only by the length of the duplex region (Fig. 1 A). T440 DNA was prepared by annealing a 62-nt oligo and labeling the annealed oligo at the 3′-end. As a result, this partial duplex DNA contained a 64-bp duplex region, and a defined Topo IV-binding site (25.Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was located in the middle of the duplex region (Fig. 1 A). We have previously shown that the T440 DNA serves as a good substrate for Topo IV binding (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been shown that many of the binding sites, as Norf-stimulated cleavage sites, of Gyr and Topo IV overlap, although site preferences of these enzymes are distinct (26.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed reasonable to assume that the defined Topo IV-binding site (25.Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) serves as a good binding site for Gyr. However, we expected the 64-bp duplex region in the T440 DNA to be too short for Gyr to bind. Thus, the annealed and labeled oligo in the T440 DNA was further elongated using the Klenow enzyme to an average length of 175 nt with a range of 150–200 nt (Fig. 1 B). This partial duplex with an elongated duplex region was referred to as T440E. The occupancy of the topoisomerase on the DNA substrate is one of the determining factors of the probability of the collision between the UvrD helicase and the topoisomerase-DNA complex. In order to determine the amounts of topoisomerase-DNA complexes formed on the partial duplex DNA, we measured the topoisomerase-catalyzed cleavages in the presence of various concentrations of Norf. The relative amounts of topoisomerase-catalyzed cleavages represent the occupancy of the DNA substrate by the topoisomerase-DNA complex. First, we measured Gyr-, Topo IV-, and Gyr (A59)-catalyzed cleavages using T440 as a substrate. The T440 DNA contains a 64-bp duplex region including a 40-bp defined Topo IV-binding site (Fig. 1 A). Topo IV cleaved the T440 DNA at a unique site, and Norf stimulated Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages (Fig.2 A). It seemed to be an interesting question to ask if Gyr (A59), which does not wrap a DNA strand around itself (17.Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), could bind to a short duplex. To address this question directly, Gyr- and Gyr (A59)-catalyzed cleavages in the presence of various concentrations of Norf were measured (Fig.2 A). The wild type Gyr could cleave the T440 DNA at a unique site in the presence of Norf. The relative amounts of Gyr-catalyzed cleavages were about one-fourth of those of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages. On the other hand, the relative amounts of Gyr (A59)-catalyzed cleavages were similar to those of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages. Thus, when Gyr no longer wraps a DNA strand, it could bind to a short duplex DNA as well as Topo IV could bind. Next, we measured the Gyr- and Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages using T440E as a substrate (Fig. 3). All three topoisomerases cleaved the elongated duplex region and generated DNA fragments with various sizes. These cleavages were greatly stimulated by Norf. The pattern of Gyr (A59)-catalyzed cleavages was somewhat similar to that of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages but not that of Gyr-catalyzed cleavages (Fig. 3). To maximize the formation of covalent topoisomerase-DNA ternary complexes formed, the highest concentrations of Norf and the topoisomerases were used in the following experiments. Under these conditions, more than 80, 80, or 90% of the DNA substrate was bound by at least one molecule of Gyr (Fig. 3, lane 6), Topo IV (Fig. 3, lane 11), or Gyr (A59) (Fig. 3, lane 16), respectively. The elongated duplex region of T440E could provide more than one binding site for each topoisomerase. Thus, the generation of cleaved fragments with various sizes was likely due to the binding of multiple topoisomerases to one DNA substrate and/or the binding of one topoisomerase per DNA molecule at different sites. We have demonstrated that the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex on T440 inhibits the strand-displacement activities of various DNA helicases including UvrD (16.Shea M.E. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22747-22754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have concluded that the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex blocks the passage of DNA helicases. Because Gyr could form the ternary complex with the T440 DNA (Fig. 2), we examined if the Gyr complex formed at the short duplex region of T440 could inhibit the UvrD-catalyzed strand-displacement activity. The UvrD helicase activity was assessed in the absence and presence of Gyr, Topo IV, and Norf, using T440 as a substrate (Fig.4). Under the conditions used, UvrD displaced 78% of the annealed oligo (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Gyr (Fig. 4 A, lane 6), Topo IV (Fig. 4 A, lane 9), or Norf alone (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) did not affect the UvrD-catalyzed strand displacement. The Gyr-Norf-DNA ternary complex reduced the UvrD-catalyzed strand-displacement activity by 25% (Fig.4 A, lane 7), whereas the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex inhibited the UvrD helicase activity by 67% (Fig. 4 A, lane 10). The extent of inhibition by Gyr and Topo IV complexes correlated well with the relative amounts of Gyr- (28%) and Topo IV-catalyzed (61%) DNA cleavages (Fig. 2). Thus, the passage of UvrD was blocked when UvrD collided with a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex formed with either Gyr or Topo IV. Howard et al. (27.Howard M.T. Neece S.H. Matson S.W. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the collision between UvrD and a T4 topoisomerase-m-AMSA-DNA ternary complex results in the generation of an SSB and the release of a broken DNA strand from the ternary complex. To examine if there were any strand breaks at the ternary complexes when UvrD collided with the ternary complexes formed with either Gyr or Topo IV, DNA products were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 B). Only the DNA strand detected was the intact annealed oligo displaced by UvrD, suggesting that UvrD did not disrupt either Gyr-Norf-DNA or Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex to generate an SSB. One possible explanation of these apparent differences was that, as proposed by Howard et al. (27.Howard M.T. Neece S.H. Matson S.W. Kreuzer K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12031-12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the disruption of the ternary complex and the generation of an SSB by UvrD might require the binding of UvrD to the partially unwound DNA strand. The annealed oligo may be too short for UvrD to bind when it is partially unwound. Therefore, we further investigated the molecular events during the collision between the UvrD helicase and the ternary complexes formed with either Gyr or Topo IV using T440E, which contains an elongated duplex region, as a substrate. The strand-displacement assay was performed using T440E as a substrate (Fig. 5 A). Under the conditions used, UvrD-catalyzed strand-displacement was 67% (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Gyr (Fig. 5 A, lane 6), Topo IV (Fig.5 A, lane 9), or Norf alone (Fig. 5 A, lane 4) did not affect the activity of UvrD. We expected both Gyr-Norf-DNA and Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes to block the UvrD-catalyzed strand-displacement activity. However, when we analyzed the DNA products on 1% agarose gels, we detected the partial displacement of the DNA strand in the presence of either the Gyr-Norf-DNA (Fig. 5 A, lane 7) or the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex (Fig. 5 A, lane 10). These apparent displaced fragments (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and 10) migrated faster than the intact elongated DNA strands (Fig. 5 A, lane 1). We suspected that the apparent displaced fragments might be broken DNA strands released from ternary complexes as a result of strand breaks. If there were a DSB at the ternary complex, M13 DNA would become linear, which would change the migration of the substrate DNA. On the other hand, if a strand break were an SSB, the M13 DNA would remain circular and the migration of the substrate DNA would not change. Because the migration of the DNA substrate on the agarose gel did not change (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7 and10), the strand break was likely to be an SSB. To confirm the formation of an SSB and the release of a DNA strand from the ternary complex, the DNA products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5 B). Short DNA fragments were generated when UvrD collided with the ternary complexes formed w"

Free TP acts as a primer (primer TP) for DNA replication, remaining linked to the 5′ ends of the fully replicated molecule (parental TP) to constitute the replication origins. TP-DNAs have been found in bacteriophages (e.g. φ29, Nf, GA-1, Cp-1, and PRD1), animal viruses (e.g. adenoviruses), plasmids (e.g. S1, Kalilo), and bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces) (reviewed in Refs. 4.Salas M.

Bacillus subtilis phage φ29 initiates replication of its 19,285-bp-long linear DNA by a protein-priming mechanism that has been extensively studied. Phage-encoded DNA polymerase and primer TP form a complex (pol·TP) that recognizes the ends of TP-DNA. Then DNA polymerase catalyzes the covalent linkage of dAMP to the OH group of Ser232 of the TP, giving rise to the TP-dAMP initiation complex (reviewed in Ref. 4.Salas M. Annu. Rev.

A similar mechanism has been described for the φ29-related phage GA-1 (7.Illana B. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), theEscherichia coli phage PRD1 (8.Caldentey J. Blanco L. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3725-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and adenovirus (9.King A.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5786-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). φ29 DNA polymerase elongates the initiation complex by a strand displacement mechanism in a very processive way, with no further requirements for any helicase or processivity factors (reviewed in Ref.10.Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8509-8512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA polymerase and TP, phage-encoded ss- and dsDNA-binding proteins (p5 and p6, respectively) are required for φ29 DNA replication in vivo. Protein p5 stimulates replicationin vitro (11.Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by interacting with the displaced single-stranded DNA (12.Gutiérrez C. Martı́n G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein p6, which has been proposed to play a role organizing and compacting the viral genome (13.Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), activates the initiation of replication by forming multimeric nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of φ29 DNA (14.Serrano M. Gutiérrez J. Prieto I. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15.Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4353-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). No auxiliary host proteins have been described to be required for φ29 DNA replication, unlike the case of adenoviruses, which also replicate by a protein-priming mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 16.Hay R.T. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 699-719Google Scholar and 17.van der Vliet P.C. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 87-118Google Scholar), where two cellular transcription factors, NFI and Oct-1, have been reported to interact with DNA polymerase and pTP (φ29 TP counterpart), respectively, directing the multiproteic complexes to the viral origins of replication (18.Mul Y.M. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19.Armentero M.T. Horwitz M. Mermod N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3398-3405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the φ29 TP-dAMP complex in vitro requires the formation of a stable, equimolar, pol·TP complex (21.Blanco L. Prieto I. Gutiérrez J. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that recognizes the replication origins at the genome ends. The main signal to be recognized by the pol·TP complex for initiation of replication is the parental TP. Thus, when terminal DNA fragments lacking parental TP are used as templates, the initiation reaction becomes much less efficient, being about 10% of the activity obtained with TP-DNA (Ref. 22.Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and this work). Even in the absence of any template, DNA polymerase does retain the ability to deoxynucleotidylate TP unspecifically, although at a very low rate (23.Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). φ29 belongs to a family of phages classified into three groups (reviewed in Ref. 24.Pecenkova T. Paces V. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as follows: group A comprises phages BS32, φ15, and PZA together with φ29; group B includes M2, Nf, and B103, and group C has GA-1 as its sole member. The DNA polymerases of φ29 and Nf are 572 amino acid residues long and share an 81.8% sequence identity (Ref. 25.Yoshikawa H. Ito J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 17: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and this work). The TPs of φ29 and Nf have 266 amino acids with a 62.4% sequence identity (26.Escarmı́s C. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5785-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27.Leavitt J.M. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). φ29 TP complements in vivo PZA but not M2 TP sus mutants (28.Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro assays showed that the φ29 pol·TP complex is able to initiate DNA replication using PZA or φ15 TP-DNAs as template but not Nf TP-DNA (22.Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting the need of a TP-DNA from the same phage group for replication. The use of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ in the in vitrosystem, which increases the formation of the initiation complex (Ref.29.Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Blanco L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and this work), allowed us to detect initiation activity with pol·TP proteins from φ29 or Nf and TP-DNAs from Nf or φ29, respectively. This result prompted us to study the specificity of the template recognition by the initiation proteins (pol·TP). For this, we purified DNA polymerase and TP from the phage Nf to assay initiation in φ29/Nf heterologous replication systems. In this paper, we present evidence that the initiation activity is higher when the DNA polymerase is from the same phage as the TP-DNA, suggesting that a specific interaction between DNA polymerase and parental TP is essential for efficient initiation of replication and determines the specificity of origin recognition. Unlabeled nucleotides and [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), as well as micrococcal nuclease were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were from Boehringer Ingelheim and Isogen. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Promega. Sequenase 2.0 version of T7 DNA polymerase was from United States Biochemical Corp. φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs (30.Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and proteinase K-digested φ29 and Nf DNAs (31.Inciarte M.R. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Viñuela E. Virology. 1976; 74: 314-323Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were obtained as described. φ29 and Nf DNA left terminal fragments (oriL), 259 and 263 bp, respectively, were obtained by PCR amplification from proteinase K-digested DNAs. Oligonucleotides were designed to produce aDraI restriction site to regenerate the genome end. In the case of φ29, the PCR amplification product was phosphorylated and cloned in a SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated pBlueKScript cloning vector, giving rise to pL259. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed and plated on LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Selection of pL259-containing colonies was carried out by assessing β-galactosidase activity. Transformants were grown in selective medium at 37 °C, and φ29 oriL was obtained after restriction of purified pL259 with DraI andEcoRV. This digestion results in the 259-terminal bp from φ29 plus 18 additional bp from the plasmid. DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Qia Quick Gel Extraction Kit of Qiagen. φ29 DNA polymerase was obtained from E. coli NF2690 cells harboring plasmid pJLw2 and purified as described (32.Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Salas M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nf DNA polymerase gene was cloned and overproduced inE. coli cells. For this, phage Nf was obtained from infectedB. subtilis cells and purified in a cesium chloride density gradient. Phage DNA was isolated by proteinase K treatment. The region encoding Nf DNA polymerase was amplified by PCR and digested withPvuII and EcoRI prior to cloning in aSmaI-EcoRI digested pT7-7 expression vector, under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase-specific φ10 promoter (33.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (34.Studier T.W. Moffat B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) were transformed, and the cloned gene was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (35.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase kit. Cells containing the DNA polymerase gene were grown at 34 °C in LB medium, in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, up to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm. T7 RNA polymerase expression was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; after 20 min, 100 μg/ml rifampicin were added and cells harvested 90 min later. Cells were disrupted by grinding with alumina and suspended in buffer 6 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) containing 0.5m NaCl; alumina and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. DNA was precipitated by adding to the supernatant polyethyleneimine up to 0.25%, after adjusting absorbance at 260 nm to 120 units/ml. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 70% saturation and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The Nf DNA polymerase-containing pellet was resuspended in buffer 6 and applied to a phosphocellulose column at an ionic strength equivalent to 0.2 m NaCl. DNA polymerase was eluted with 0.45m NaCl in buffer 6 and concentrated in another phosphocellulose column. Finally, DNA polymerase was obtained from blue dextran and heparin-agarose columns by elution with 0.6 and 1.0m NaCl in buffer 6, respectively. The sample was concentrated using a Centricon-30, and its purity was estimated to be about 90% by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. φ29 TP was purified fromB. subtilis harboring a TP-expressing plasmid (28.Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To purify Nf TP B. subtilis 110NA cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium up to an optical density of 0.5 at 600 nm and infected with phage Nf at a multiplicity of 10. Cells were harvested 50 min after infection, and cell-free extracts were obtained as described above. After ammonium sulfate precipitation, TP was purified by phosphocellulose and calf thymus DNA-cellulose chromatography eluting at 0.5 m and 1 m NaCl in buffer 6, respectively. The protein was further purified through a heparin-agarose column, eluting at 1 m NaCl in buffer 6. The sample was concentrated with a Centricon-30. The protein was over 95% homogeneous as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Interaction between DNA polymerase (25 μg) and TP (12.5 μg) from φ29 and Nf was analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The proteins, in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmZnSO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 8.5% glycerol were loaded on a 4-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient together with 25 μg of BSA as molecular weight marker and centrifuged at 350,000 ×g for 24 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 0.16-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Quantification was performed by densitometric scans of Coomassie-stained gels in a Molecular Dynamics 300A densitometer. Interaction between DNA polymerase and TP from φ29 and Nf was also analyzed by a DNA competition assay in which the 3′ filling-in of a DNA fragment is inversely proportional to the amount of DNA polymerase interacting with TP. A dsDNA fragment with a 3′-recessive end, substrate for DNA polymerase, was obtained by restriction of pL259 withSpeI and PstI. DNA polymerase and TP from φ29 and Nf were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The DNA fragment was added to a reaction mixture containing, in a 25-μl final volume, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 5% glycerol, 5% polyethylene glycol 1000, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 32 mm NaCl, 1 mmMnCl2, 33 nm [α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi), and 400 nm of each dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP. The reaction was carried out for 2 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The reaction mixture, in 25 μl, was as described above except that the only deoxynucleotide present was 250 nm[α-32P]dATP (2.5 μCi); 1 mmMnCl2 and the indicated amounts of purified DNA polymerase, TP, and template DNA were used. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times, and the reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA up to 10 mm. Samples were heated at 60 °C for 5 min and digested with 25 units of micrococcal nuclease for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 22 mmCaCl2. The reaction was stopped as described above. Samples were filtered through Sephadex G-50 spin columns in the presence of 0.1% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Quantification of the initiation complex formed was done by PhosphorImager densitometric scans of a exposed Fuji BAS-IIIs imaging plate. To study the specificity of the protein-primed initiation of replication, we have used the in vitro systems of φ29 and the related phage Nf. Partially purified samples containing both DNA polymerase and TP from Nf were used in a previous work (36.Freire R. Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the current goal required the availability of each of the proteins free of the other. Since it was difficult to obtain DNA polymerase free of contaminant TP from Nf-infected B. subtilis cells, we cloned the Nf DNA polymerase gene, after PCR amplification of the corresponding region. Since phage M2 is derived from phage Nf by a deletion that does not affect the replication genes (37.Mizukami Y. Sekiya T. Hirokawa H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we took advantage of the known sequence of the M2 phage DNA polymerase gene (gene G) (38.Matsumoto K. Takano H. Kim C.I. Hirokawa H. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) for the design of oligonucleotides. Nf DNA polymerase predicted gene was sequenced, and the product was identical in size and amino acid sequence to that of M2 DNA polymerase (38.Matsumoto K. Takano H. Kim C.I. Hirokawa H. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), except for codon 107, where arginine was found instead of lysine. The predicted protein had a molecular mass of 66.4 kDa and 81.8% identity and 91.3% homology to its φ29 counterpart. Protein-primed initiation of DNA replication requires the prior formation of a complex between DNA polymerase and TP to recognize the replication origins (21.Blanco L. Prieto I. Gutiérrez J. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the specificity of the initiation reaction required the use of pol·TP complexes in which both proteins were from the same phage, φ29 or Nf (hereafter homocomplexes), or one from φ29 and the other from Nf (hereafter heterocomplexes). The formation of pol·TP complexes was analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. TP (31 kDa) from either φ29 (Fig. 1 A) or Nf (Fig.1 B) sedimented behind the 67-kDa molecular mass marker BSA that cosedimented with the φ29 and Nf DNA polymerases; however, when complexed with DNA polymerase, it sedimented slightly ahead of BSA, both in the case of φ29 (Fig. 1 C) and Nf (Fig.1 D) homocomplexes. A similar shift was observed when φ29 and Nf heterocomplexes were analyzed (Fig. 1, E andF), although in the case of Nf DNA polymerase/φ29 TP about 40% of TP sedimented as free TP, suggesting they have a lower affinity (Fig. 1 F); here, free and TP-complexed DNA polymerases are not resolved. Therefore, DNA polymerase and TP from the two phages are able to interact with each other although with different affinities. Nevertheless, when glycerol gradients were performed at 180 mm NaCl with a 10-fold lower amount of protein, pol·TP homo- but not heterocomplexes were detected (results not shown). This result indicates that DNA polymerase has a higher affinity for TP in homocomplexes than in heterocomplexes. The interaction between the different DNA polymerases and TPs was further tested in an assay in which DNA polymerase binding to TP is challenged by a dsDNA fragment with a recessive 3′ end. Since TP binds to the same active site as a DNA primer in DNA polymerase (10.Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8509-8512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and they cannot bind simultaneously (39.de Vega M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28966-28977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the extent of the filling-in reaction would indicate the amount of free DNA polymerase, providing a qualitative measurement of the affinity of each DNA polymerase for each TP. The filling-in activities of both φ29 (Fig.2, lane b) and Nf (Fig. 2,lane f) DNA polymerases were basically the same; therefore, their activities are comparable in these conditions. The DNA primer-template competed more efficiently for φ29 DNA polymerase when complexed with Nf TP (Fig. 2, lane e) than with φ29 TP (Fig. 2, lane d). Likewise, Nf DNA polymerase was more efficiently competed when complexed with φ29 TP (Fig. 2,lane i) than with Nf TP (Fig. 2, lane h). These results fully agree with the previous observation of the higher affinity of the DNA polymerases for the homologous TPs. Among the heterocomplexes, in agreement with the glycerol gradient centrifugation results, the affinity of the φ29 polymerase for Nf TP (Fig. 2,lane e) is higher than that of the Nf polymerase for the φ29 TP (Fig. 2, lane i). The assay was performed also with 10 mm Mg2+ as catalytic metal, obtaining the same results; therefore, the nature of the cation does not seem to affect the DNA polymerase-TP interaction. The functionality of these complexes was tested by their ability to deoxynucleotidylate TP in the absence of template (23.Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that, as expected, homocomplexes are more active than heterocomplexes, being the activity of the Nf homocomplex 64% that of the φ29 counterpart. The activity of the heterocomplexes drops below 10% for the φ29 pol/Nf TP and is negligible for Nf pol/φ29TP. The instability of the φ29 TP/Nf DNA polymerase complex accounts for this low activity, as was shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1 F) and competition experiments (Fig. 2, lane i). Therefore, the differences observed in the activity of the heterocomplexes could, at least partially, reflect differences in the stability of the complexes. The specificity of the protein-protein interactions involved in recognition of the origins of replication was studied by initiation of replication assays using φ29 and Nf pol·TP homo- and heterocomplexes on both φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs. When homocomplexes of one phage were assayed with TP-DNA of the other, the initiation activity was hardly detected when Mg2+ was used as catalytic metal (results not shown). This problem was overcome by using Mn2+ instead Mg2+, resulting in an increase of activity over 100-fold (not shown). The activity of either φ29 or Nf DNA polymerase/TP homocomplexes on their respective TP-DNAs (Fig. 4, A and B) is higher than that on TP-DNAs from the other phage. Thus, when φ29 TP-DNA was assayed with the φ29 pol·TP homocomplex, the activity detected after a 60-min reaction was 10-fold higher than that of Nf pol·TP homocomplex; moreover, the reaction with the latter was much slower, since this difference was about 200-fold after 5 min (Fig.4 A). On the other hand, when Nf TP-DNA was assayed with the Nf pol·TP homocomplex the activity was also higher than that with the φ29 pol·TP homocomplex (Fig. 4 B), but this difference was not as great as the one observed with φ29 TP-DNA; this different behavior could be due to a lower specificity of φ29 initiation proteins for the Nf TP-DNA or to a reduced stringency of the latter. Altogether, these results confirm the specificity between the pol·TP complex and the TP-DNA template. To determine whether the recognition specificity of origins is provided by the DNA polymerase, the TP, or both, we assayed pol·TP heterocomplexes with φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs as templates. Interestingly, we observed that when the DNA polymerase was from the same phage as the template, namely φ29 pol/Nf TP with φ29 TP-DNA (Fig. 4 C) or Nf pol/φ29 TP with Nf TP-DNA (Fig. 4 D), the activity was much higher than that found when the TP of the heterocomplex was from the same phage as the template, namely Nf pol/φ29 TP with φ29 TP-DNA (Fig. 4 C) or φ29 pol/Nf TP with Nf TP-DNA (Fig.4 D). These results strongly suggest that DNA polymerase provides the specificity of recognition of the replication origins, presumably by interaction with the parental TP. The contribution of the parental TP in the initiation of protein-primed replication activity was assessed by comparison of φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs with the corresponding TP-free left origins of replication (oriLs). Fig. 5 Ashows that the activity of φ29 oriL is 12–20% of the activity of the TP-DNA preparation, as it has been described previously (22.Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The same situation was observed for Nf (Fig. 5 B), although Nf showed an even higher dependence of parental TP, as NforiL activity is about 2–5% that of Nf TP-DNA. Thus, parental TP strongly enhances initiation of replication to a degree that depends on the system. It had been described that φ29 DNA polymerase and TP initiate replication with Nf oriL as template at about the same rate as with φ29 oriL (22.Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specificity of recognition seemed to be lost with TP-free templates. The availability of purified DNA polymerase and TP from Nf, together with the use of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ in the in vitroinitiation reaction, allowed us to extend these studies measuring the rate of initiation of replication with pol·TP homo- and heterocomplexes with oriLs of φ29 and Nf. With either φ29 (Fig. 6 A) or Nf (Fig.6 B) oriLs, the behavior of φ29 and Nf homocomplexes was similar, and the specificity observed with TP-DNAs (see Fig. 4, A and B) is lost. With both templates the reaction with φ29 pol·TP is faster than with Nf pol·TP, reaching a similar level of initiation at later times. When heterocomplexes were assayed, their activity was very low in all cases, due to the low intrinsic affinity of heterocomplexes (see Fig. 3) together with the low template activity of TP-free DNAs (see Fig. 5). We do not observe, as with TP-DNA (Fig. 4, C andD), the selective enhancement of initiation corresponding to the homology between DNA polymerase and template. These results confirm that the specific origin recognition by DNA polymerase involves mainly, if not exclusively, parental TP, whereas the nucleotide sequence by itself does not seem to play a significant role. Linear DNA genomes with TPs, like that of B. subtilisphage φ29, are replicated by a protein-priming mechanism. The origins of replication, located at the genome ends, are recognized by a complex formed by the DNA polymerase and a free TP that is the primer for the following replication round. Thus, the formation of the initiation complex involves the DNA polymerase and two TPs, one of them free, acting as a primer (primer TP) and the other covalently linked to the DNA 5′ ends (parental TP). We have used both the proteins and the template DNA from φ29 and the related phage Nf to study the specificity of the initiation reaction. We first studied the interaction of DNA polymerases with TPs, since the formation of these complexes precedes the initiation of DNA replication. Heterologous DNA polymerases and TPs are able to form complexes, although their interaction, especially that of Nf DNA polymerase and φ29 TP, is weaker than that of the homologous proteins. Since TP binds to the same active site in DNA polymerase as a primer DNA (10.Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8509-8512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and they cannot bind simultaneously (39.de Vega M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28966-28977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we challenged TP with DNA. The DNA was able to displace heterologous but not homologous TPs from DNA polymerases, indicating that homocomplexes are more stable than heterocomplexes, in agreement with the previous results. Accordingly, the ability of DNA polymerases to deoxyadenylylate a heterologous TP in the absence of any template was much lower than that with a homologous TP. However, their activities may not only reflect the stability of the different pol·TP complexes but also their catalytic efficiency. φ29 DNA polymerase belongs to the eukaryotic polymerase α family (40.Blanco L. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 153: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41.Bernad A. Zaballos A. Salas M. Blanco L.

The Ser122 residue of φ29 DNA polymerase, which has been proposed to be required for TP binding (39.de Vega M. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28966-28977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is located in the exonuclease domain, facing the editing channel in the RB69 corresponding region (42.Wang J.

In addition, the motif Y226 XG(G/A), which is also involved in TP binding, would be located near the polymerase-active site (43.Truniger V. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the R256GD residues of φ29 TP are involved in the interaction with DNA polymerase (44.Illana B. Zaballos A. Blanco L. Salas M. Virology. 1998; 248: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The regions containing these interacting residues in both DNA polymerase and TP are highly conserved in Nf. Nevertheless, these phages may have evolved to get slight structural differences in their DNA polymerases and TPs that justify the preferential binding to their own partner. Once the pol·TP complex is formed, it must specifically recognize the origins of replication. It has long been acknowledged as the critical role of the parental TP in the initiation reaction (30.Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of φ29 pol·TP with TP-DNA templates from a different group of related phages, such as Nf (22.Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was indicative of the high specificity of the reaction. The use of Mn2+, about a 100-fold more efficient activator of initiation than Mg2+(Ref. 29.Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Blanco L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and this work), allowed detection of initiation using φ29 pol·TP complexes with Nf templates. Initiation activity with both φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs was measured using φ29 and Nf initiation proteins. As expected, pol·TP homocomplexes were more active with their own template. When pol·TP heterocomplexes were used, we found that the only type of template significantly active for initiation of replication was the TP-DNA from the same phage as the DNA polymerase. Since parental TPs readily interact with each other (45.Salas M. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Sogo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it was assumed that primer TP would direct the pol·TP complex to the parental TP (44.Illana B. Zaballos A. Blanco L. Salas M. Virology. 1998; 248: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 46.Zaballos A. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10353-10366Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Instead, our results point out that the specific recognition of parental TP by the DNA polymerase complexed with primer TP is essential for an efficient initiation of DNA replication. However, these results do not rule out a recognition between parental and primer TP, as has been recently proposed (47.Illana B. Lázaro J.M. Gutiérrez C. Meijer W.J.J. Blanco L. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15073-15079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The selective recruitment of pol·TP complexes at the TP-containing replication origins could provide the correct positioning of primer TP at the active site of polymerase. Nevertheless an optimized rate of initiation requires highly specific protein interactions and is only obtained when DNA polymerase is homologous to TP-DNA and primer TP. In fact, in vivo studies have shown a strict requirement for a primer TP homologous to TP-DNA and/or DNA polymerase (28.Bravo A. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 48.Kishi T. Miura K. Matsumoto K. Hirokawa H. Jpn. J. Genet. 1993; 68: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Parental TP is essential for the efficient initiation of replication, as TP-free templates are much less active than TP-DNAs. Furthermore, TP-free templates show a similar activity with φ29 and Nf pol·TPs, indicating that parental TP provides specificity to the template. In addition, these results further suggest that the nucleotide sequence by itself does not play a major role in the specific recognition of origins by the initiation proteins. In conclusion, we can envisage a scenario for initiation of protein-priming replication in which the specificity of recognition of the replication origins is determined by the parental TP. The DNA polymerase engaged in a complex with primer TP specifically recognizes the parental TP. This recognition would result in a higher affinity binding of the pol·TP complexes to the origins and/or in an increase of their catalytic efficiency of the initiation reaction. We are grateful to L. Villar for the purification of φ29 and Nf TP-DNAs and φ29 TP."

Although sharing more than 50% homology in their catalytic domains, PC1 and PC2 exhibit differences in substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibitors. In addition to these differences, PC2, unlike PC1 and other members of the family, specifically binds the neuroendocrine protein 7B2. In order to identify determinants responsible for the specific properties of the PC2 catalytic domain, we compared its primary sequence with that of other PCs. This allowed us to distinguish a PC2-specific sequence at positions 242–248. We constructed two PC2 mutants in which residues 242 and 243 and residues 242–248 were replaced with the corresponding residues of PC1. Studies of in vivo cleavage of proenkephalin, in vivo production of α-MSH from proopiomelanocortin, and in vitro cleavage of a PC2-specific artificial substrate by mutant PC2s did not reveal profound alterations. On the other hand, both mutant pro-PC2s exhibited a considerably reduced ability to bind to 21-kDa 7B2. In addition, inhibition of mutant PC2-(242–248) by the potent natural inhibitor 7B2 CT peptide was almost completely abolished. Taken together, our results show that residues 242–248 do not play a significant role in defining the substrate specificity of PC2 but do contribute greatly to binding 7B2 and are critical for inhibition with the 7B2 CT peptide.

Muller, A. Cameron, Y. Fortenberry, E. Apletalina, and I. Lindberg, manuscript in preparation., 3C. Lazure, unpublished results. PC1 and PC2 have distinct, although overlapping, substrate specificities. The two enzymes most often cleave precursors at pairs of basic residues (2.Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin.

In the majority of the studies performed to date, PC1 exhibits a more restricted substrate specificity than PC2. Although models of the active sites of PC1 and PC2 have been proposed based on the known x-ray structure of subtilisin (31.Lipkind G. Gong Q. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13277-13284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the amino acid residues responsible for the different substrate specificities of these enzymes have not been identified thus far. Unlike other members of the family, pro-PC2 requires interaction with the neuroendocrine-specific protein 7B2 for its maturation and activation (32.Zhu X. Lindberg I. J.

The CT peptide represents a very potent in vitro inhibitor of PC2 as does the parent 27-kDa 7B2 molecule (40.Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J.

Recent attempts to demonstrate the ability of overexpressed CT peptide to inhibit PC2 in vivo were not, however, successful due to intracellular internal cleavage of this peptide (43.Fortenberry Y. Liu J. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PC2 by the 7B2 CT peptide strongly depends on the presence of a K-K site (40.Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42.Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); other residues within the peptide are also critical to inhibitory potency (44.Apletalina E.V. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No information is available thus far on which PC2 residues confer the ability to be inhibited by the CT peptide; presumably, these residues are not shared by PC1, which is not inhibited by this peptide (45.Martens G.J.M. Braks J.A.M. Eib D.W. Zhou Y. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5784-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast to the CT peptide, the 21-kDa domain of 7B2 appears to be the portion of 7B2 responsible for pro-PC2 maturation and activation (32.Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Within this domain, a fragment encompassing residues 86–121 contains all of the information required for 7B2-mediated activation of pro-PC2 (46.Muller L. Zhu P. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21471-21477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies aimed at defining the structural elements of PC2 required for interaction with 7B2 have identified two residues in the catalytic domain of PC2, Tyr194 and Asp309, that are apparently critical to the PC2–7B2 binding (47.Zhu X. Muller L. Mains R.E. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48.Benjannet S. Lusson J. Savaria D. Chretien M. Seidah N.G.

The present study is aimed at defining the residues in the active site of PC2 that contribute to the unique characteristics of this enzyme as opposed to PC1, such as its comparatively broad substrate specificity, its ability to bind to 7B2, and its potent inhibition by CT peptide. For this purpose, the primary sequences of several PC1, PC2, and furin enzymes from different species were aligned, and the residues within the predicted substrate binding sites (15.Siezen R. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 31.Lipkind G. Gong Q. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

This analysis revealed that in positions 242–248 (numbering is that of PC2), PC2s contain the sequence QP(Y/F)MTD(L/I), which differs considerably from the corresponding sequence in PC1s and furins, G(I/E)VTDA (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that both PC1s and furins contain a deletion in this sequence as compared with PC2s; the single G residue in PC1s and furins thus corresponds to the QP residues of PC2s (positions 242 and 243). The residues in this region (positions 242–248) are located within or in the vicinity of subsites S2–S5 of prohormone convertases, according to homology modeling of protein convertases based on the crystal structure of subtilisin (50.Siezen R.J. Creemers J.W.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31.Lipkind G. Gong Q. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

In the present study, we constructed two murine PC2-related mutants: PC2-(242–243), in which residues QP were replaced with the corresponding G residue found in PC1, and PC2-(242–248), in which the murine PC1 sequence GIVTDA was substituted for the corresponding sequence QPFMTDI of PC2. We report below that these mutations result in significant loss of binding of 7B2 to pro-PC2 as well as substantial loss of inhibition of PC2 with the 7B2 CT peptide.

Houghten (Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, CA). The internally quenched fluorogenic substrate Abz-VPEMEKRYGGFMQ-EDDnp (20.Johanning K. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lazure C.

Juliano (Department of Biophysics, Escola Paulista de Medicina, San Paolo, Brazil). Mouse PC2 cDNA (obtained from Dr. N. G. Seidah, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Canada) was first subcloned through blunt-end ligation into the pcDNA3 vector cut at the KpnI site, and this plasmid was used in constructing PC2 mutants. Mutants were generated by synthesizing mutation-containing fragments by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning the polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments into mPC2/pcDNA3 between the HindIII and Bsu36I sites. The mutants were constructed using the same amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal primers, 5′-CGCGCAAGCTTTTTCACTCCCAAAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGCCTCAGGATTCCTCTTCCTCCCATT-3′, respectively. The middle primers were as follows: for mutant PC2-(242–248), 5′-GACGGGATTGTGACAGACGCCATCGAAGCCTCCTCCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGGCGTC TGTCACAATCCCGTCCAGCATCCGGATCCC-3′; for mutant PC2-(242–243), 5′-GACGGGTTTATGACAGATATCATCGAAGCCTCCTCCATC-3′ and 5′-GATGATATCTG TCATAAACCCGTCCAGCATCCGGATCCC-3′. Expand High FidelityTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used in all polymerase chain reactions. The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. The PC2, PC2-(242–243), and PC2-(242–248) constructs in pCEP4 were obtained by recloning the corresponding PC2 cDNA from a pcDNA3 plasmid into pCEP4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at the HindIII andNotI sites using standard procedures. Methotrexate-amplified CHO/21-kDa 7B2 cells that express large quantities of 21-kDa 7B2 were generated by the same procedure described earlier (52.Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Smith A.I. Peptidases and Neuropeptide Processing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 94-108Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium without nucleosides, containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) and 50 μm methotrexate (Sigma). AtT-20/27-kDa 7B2, AtT-20/PE, and AtT-20/PC2 cells, representing AtT-20 cell lines stably expressing rat 27-kDa 7B2 (32.Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), rat proenkephalin (22.Mathis J. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and murine wild-type PC2 (12.Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% NuSerum (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and either 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma) (for AtT-20/7B2 cells) or 150 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). CHO/21-kDa 7B2, AtT-20/27-kDa 7B2, and AtT-20/PE cell lines served as hosts for stable transfection of the PC2 constructs described above. All transfections were performed using 30 μg of plasmid and 30 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies) in a 10-cm dish. Transfected cells were then cultured in the presence of the appropriate selection agent (250 or 450 μg/ml G418 (for CHO/21-kDa 7B2 and AtT-20/27-kDa 7B2 cells, respectively) or 200 μg/ml hygromycin). G418- or hygromycin-resistant colonies were picked and screened for PC2 expression by Western blotting using PC2 antiserum (53.Shen F-S Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by enzyme assay with pERTKR-MCA as the substrate. Partially purified wild-type PC2, PC2-(242–248), and PC2-(242–243) were obtained from the conditioned media of the CHO/21-kDa 7B2 cells stably expressing the corresponding 75-kDa pro-PC2 protein. Sequential collections of the conditioned medium from the confluent roller bottles were performed every morning, 5–7 days in a row, after placing the cells into 100 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 100 μg/ml aprotinin (Bayer) overnight (usually 18–19 h); during the day, the cells were kept in complete medium (α-minimum essential medium without nucleosides, containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 50 μm methotrexate, and 250 μg/ml G418). The conditioned media were centrifuged immediately after collection at low speed to remove floating cells, and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C until needed. For purification, 100–200 ml of the medium were used. The medium was thawed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was diluted 3-fold with buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.65, containing 0.1% Brij 35). Diluted medium was applied onto a 5-ml Econo-PackTM Q Cartridge (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with buffer B (1 m sodium acetate in buffer A) using two linear gradients, from 0 to 0.35 m in 175 min and from 0.35 to 1 m in 100 min. Duplicate reactions were performed in a polypropylene microtiter plate in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.4% n-octyl glucoside, an inhibitor mixture (0.14 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma), 0.3 mm N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine ketone (Sigma), 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (Sigma), and 1 μm pepstatin (Sigma)), 0.2 mmfluorogenic substrate pERTKR-MCA, and 5 μl of the partially purified enzyme. Reactions to test the peptide inhibitors (human 7B2 CT peptide, the PC2 propeptide fragment, or the hexapeptide Ac-LLRVKR-NH2) also contained varying amounts of these peptides. Prior to the addition of the peptide inhibitor (if used) and the substrate, the partially purified enzyme was preincubated in the assay buffer at 37 °C for 30–40 min. After the peptide inhibitor was added, the reaction mixtures were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of substrate. All reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 30–45 min. Released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured with a Fluoroscan Ascent fluorometer (Labsystems) using an excitation and an emission wavelength of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. The IC50 values for the peptide inhibitors were calculated through nonlinear regression of the experimental data (fluorescenceversus peptide concentration) using the program GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The effect of varying pH on the activity of partially purified PC2 enzymes was determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of 0.2 mmpERTKR-MCA in 100 mm Bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer set at different pH values (ranging from 4.0 to 7.4) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 0.4% octyl glucoside, and an inhibitor mixture (see above). Prior to the addition of the substrate to start the reaction, the assay mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 30–40 min for enzyme activation. Partially purified wild-type pro-PC2, pro-PC2-(242–248), and pro-PC2-(242–243) were incubated at 30 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Brij 35, and an inhibitor mixture (see above). At varying time intervals, aliquots were frozen for subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using PC2 antiserum (53.Shen F-S Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the relative concentrations of PC2 protein in the various preparations, wild-type PC2, PC2-(242–248), and PC2-(242–243) were diluted into 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% Brij 35, and two amounts (the second twice as much as the first) of each sample were applied onto a 10% gel. On the same gel were applied varying amounts of highly purified 66-kDa PC2 (diluted in the same buffer) with a known protein content. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using PC2 antiserum (53.Shen F-S Seidah N.G. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24910-24915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images of the blots were then obtained with a ScanJet 4C scanner (Hewlett Packard), and the intensities of the bands were compared using ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The PC2 concentration in each enzyme preparation was averaged from 2–4 independent experiments. The internally quenched substrate Abz-VPEMEKRYGGFMQ-EDDnp (final concentration of 2 μm) was subjected to digestion by partially purified PC2 or PC2-(242–248) in a buffer containing 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.4% octyl glucoside, and inhibitor mixture (see above) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate and conducted for 2 h at 37 °C in polypropylene microtiter plates. Abz fluorescence was recorded with a Fluoroscan Ascent fluorometer (Labsystems) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively. k cat/K mvalues were calculated based on the curves obtained, as described previously (20.Johanning K. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lazure C. Lamango N. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22672-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Subconfluent wells of AtT-20/27-kDa 7B2 cells, expressing either wild-type PC2, PC2-(242–243), PC2-(242–248), or no exogenous PC2, and wells of AtT-20/PC2 cells, plated in six-well plates, were washed once with 3 ml of PBS and once with 1 ml of methionine and cysteine-free medium (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and were starved for 30 min in 1 ml of this medium. Cells were then incubated in 1 ml of methionine and cysteine-free medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for different time periods depending on the particular experiment. In the experiments to study production of α-MSH, cells were labeled for either 20 min or for 6 h. Following the 6-h labeling period, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of acid mix (1m acetic acid, 20 mm HCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Following the experiment in which cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min, cells were further incubated in 1 ml of chase medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2% fetal bovine serum) for 1 h prior to homogenization in acid mix. Cell extracts in acid mix were frozen, thawed, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and lyophilized overnight. The dried cell extracts were resuspended in 500 μl of AG buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.9% NaCl), centrifuged briefly to remove insoluble material, and stored frozen at −20 °C prior to immunoprecipitation using polyclonal rabbit antiserum JH93 directed against the N-terminal portion of ACTH (54.Mains R.E.
