https://openalex.org/W4221053970,"To promote COVID-19 vaccination, many states in the US introduced financial incentives ranging from small, guaranteed rewards to lotteries that give vaccinated individuals a chance to win large prizes. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of these programs and conflicting evidence from survey experiments and studies of individual states’ lotteries. To assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination incentive programs, we combined information on statewide incentive programs in the US with data on daily vaccine doses administered in each state. Leveraging variation across states in the daily availability of incentives, our difference-in-differences analyses showed that statewide programs were not associated with a significant change in vaccination rates. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in vaccination trends between states with and without incentives in any of the 14 days before or after incentives were introduced. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that neither lotteries nor guaranteed rewards were associated with significant change in vaccination rates."
https://openalex.org/W4220837582,"In early pandemic waves, when vaccination against COVID-19 was not yet an option, distancing and reduced social contact were the most effective measures to slow down the pandemic. Changes in frequency and forms of social contact have reduced the spread of the COVID-19 virus and thus saved lives, yet there is increasing evidence for negative side effects such as mental health issues. In the present study, we investigate the development of loneliness and its predictors to examine the role of changes in social networks due to social distancing and other COVID-19-related life changes. A total of 737 participants (age range = 18-81 years) completed an online survey in three waves during the last quarter of 2020 at one-month intervals. Latent growth and multilevel modeling revealed that emotional loneliness increased over time, while social loneliness remained stable. Moreover, socially lonely individuals were likely to also develop emotional loneliness over time. Increased social distancing and sanitary measures were accompanied by decreased social interactions and loss of individuals considered SOS contacts and confidants. Changes in specific social network indicators were differentially associated with changes in emotional vs social loneliness: Loss of friends considered confidants was associated with increasing emotional loneliness, whereas loss of friends considered SOS contacts and reduced overall social interactions were related to increasing social loneliness. Lastly, individuals with more family-and-friend SOS contacts, more friends as confidants and an overall higher number of social interactions were more protected from feeling socially or emotionally lonely. Study findings enhance the understanding of underlying mechanisms differentially contributing to social and emotional loneliness and offer practical suggestions to reduce mental-health side effects of social distancing."
https://openalex.org/W4220810716,"Multiple factors have been proposed to explain the disappearance of Neandertals between ca. 50 and 40 kyr BP. Central to these discussions has been the identification of new techno-cultural complexes that overlap with the period of Neandertal demise in Europe. One such complex is the Châtelperronian, which extends from the Paris Basin to the Northern Iberian Peninsula between 43,760-39,220 BP. In this study we present the first open-air Châtelperronian site in the Northern Iberian Peninsula, Aranbaltza II. The technological features of its stone tool assemblage show no links with previous Middle Paleolithic technology in the region, and chronological modeling reveals a gap between the latest Middle Paleolithic and the Châtelperronian in this area. We interpret this as evidence of local Neandertal extinction and replacement by other Neandertal groups coming from southern France, illustrating how local extinction episodes could have played a role in the process of disappearance of Neandertals."
https://openalex.org/W4220888782,"Objective The objective was to compare home care episode, standardised assessment, and service patterns in Ontario’s publicly funded home care system during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March to September 2020) using the previous year as reference. Study design and setting We plotted monthly time series data from March 2019 to September 2020 for home care recipients in Ontario, Canada. Home care episodes were linked to interRAI Home Care assessments, interRAI Contact Assessments, and home care services. Health status measures from the patient’s most recent interRAI assessment were used to stratify the receipt of personal support, nursing, and occupational or physical therapy services. Significant level and slope changes were detected using Poisson, beta, and linear regression models. Results The March to September 2020 period was associated with significantly fewer home care admissions, discharges, and standardised assessments. Among those assessed with the interRAI Home Care assessment, significantly fewer patients received any personal support services. Among those assessed with either interRAI assessment and identified to have rehabilitation needs, significantly fewer patients received any therapy services. Among patients receiving services, patients received significantly fewer hours of personal support and fewer therapy visits per month. By September 2020, the rate of admissions and services had mostly returned to pre-pandemic levels, but completion of standardised assessments lagged behind. Conclusion The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with substantial changes in Ontario’s publicly funded home care system. Although it may have been necessary to prioritise service delivery during a crisis situation, standardised assessments are needed to support individualised patient care and system-level monitoring. Given the potential disruptions to home care services, future studies should examine the impact of the pandemic on the health and well-being of home care recipients and their caregiving networks."
https://openalex.org/W4220800299,"The use of GPS tracking technologies has revolutionized the study of animal movement providing unprecedentedly detailed information. The characterization of GPS accuracy and precision under different conditions is essential to correctly identify the spatial and temporal resolution at which studies can be conducted. Here, we examined the influence of fix acquisition interval and device deployment on the performance of a new GPS/GSM solar powered device. Horizontal and vertical accuracy and precision of locations were obtained under different GPS fix acquisition intervals (1min, 20 min and 60 min) in a stationary test. The test devices were deployed on pre-fledgling white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and we quantified accuracy and precision after deployment while controlling for bias caused by variation in habitat, topography, and animal movement. We also assessed the performance of GPS-Error, a metric provided by the device, at identifying inaccurate locations (> 10 m). Average horizontal accuracy varied between 3.4 to 6.5 m, and vertical accuracy varied between 4.9 to 9.7 m, in high (1 min) and low frequency (60 min) GPS fix intervals. These values were similar after the deployment on white storks. Over 84% of GPS horizontal positions and 71% of vertical positions had less than 10m error in accuracy. Removing 3% of data with highest GPS-Error eliminated over 99% of inaccurate positions in high GPS frequency intervals, but this metric was not effective in the low frequency intervals. We confirmed the suitability of these devices for studies requiring horizontal and vertical accuracies of 5-10m. For higher accuracy data, intensive GPS fix intervals should be used, but this requires more sophisticated battery management, or larger batteries and devices."
https://openalex.org/W4225619479,"Animals are constantly bombarded with stimuli, which presents a fundamental problem of sorting among pervasive uninformative stimuli and novel, possibly meaningful stimuli. We evaluated novelty detection behaviorally in honey bees as they position their antennae differentially in an air stream carrying familiar or novel odors. We then characterized neuronal responses to familiar and novel odors in the first synaptic integration center in the brain–the antennal lobes. We found that the neurons that exhibited stronger initial responses to the odor that was to be familiarized are the same units that later distinguish familiar and novel odors, independently of chemical identities. These units, including both tentative projection neurons and local neurons, showed a decreased response to the familiar odor but an increased response to the novel odor. Our results suggest that the antennal lobe may represent familiarity or novelty to an odor stimulus in addition to its chemical identity code. Therefore, the mechanisms for novelty detection may be present in early sensory processing, either as a result of local synaptic interaction or via feedback from higher brain centers."
https://openalex.org/W4221092565,"The role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in human cancer is incompletely understood. In a metabolite screening, we observed that inhibition of H3K9 methylation suppressed aerobic glycolysis and enhances the PPP in human mesothelioma cells. Genome-wide screening identified G6PD as an H3K9me3 target gene whose expression is correlated with increased tumor cell apoptosis. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis enzyme LDHA and G6PD had no significant effects on tumor cell survival. Ablation of G6PD had no significant effect on human mesothelioma and colon carcinoma xenograft growth in athymic mice. However, activation of G6PD with the G6PD-selective activator AG1 induced tumor cell death. AG1 increased tumor cell ROS production and the resultant extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways, mitochondrial processes, and unfolded protein response in tumor cells. Consistent with increased tumor cell death in vitro, AG1 suppressed human mesothelioma xenograft growth in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. Furthermore, AG1 treatment significantly increased tumor-bearing mouse survival in an intra-peritoneum xenograft athymic mouse model. Therefore, in human mesothelioma and colon carcinoma, G6PD is not essential for tumor growth. G6PD acts as a metabolic checkpoint to control metabolic flux towards the PPP to promote tumor cell apoptosis, and its expression is repressed by its promotor H3K9me3 deposition."
https://openalex.org/W4220709827,"Note that identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is crucial to early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work explores how classification features and experimental algorithms influence classification performances on the ADNI database. Based on structural Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI), two features including gray matter (GM) volume and lateralization index (LI) are firstly extracted through hypothesis testing. Afterward, several classifier algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel, Linear kernel or Polynomial kernel are established to realize binary classification among Normal Control (NC), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) and AD groups. The main experimental results are as follows. (1) The classification performance in the feature of LI is poor compared with those in the feature of GM volume or the combined feature of LI and GM volume, i.e., the classification accuracies in the feature of LI are relatively low and unstable for most classifier models and subject groups. (2) Comparing with the classification performances in the feature of GM volume and the combined feature of LI and GM volume, the classification accuracy of NC group versus AD group is relatively stable for different classifier models, moreover, the accuracy of AD group versus NC group is almost the highest, with the most classification accuracy of 98.0909%. (3) For different subject groups, the SVM classifier algorithm with Polynomial kernel and the KNN classifier algorithm show relatively stable and high classification accuracy, while DT classifier algorithm shows relatively unstable and lower classification accuracy. (4) Except the groups of EMCI versus LMCI and NC versus EMCI, the classification accuracies are significantly enhanced by emerging the LI into the original feature of GM volume, with the maximum accuracy increase of 5.6364%. These results indicate that various factors of subject data, feature types and experimental algorithms influence classification performances remarkably, especially the newly introduced feature of LI into the feature of GM volume is helpful to improve classification results in some certain extent."
https://openalex.org/W4220993272,"The SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor is the molecular event that initiates viral entry into host cells and leads to infection and virus replication. There is a need for agents blocking viral entry into host cells that are cross-reactive with emerging virus variants. VHH-72 is an anti-SARS-CoV-1 single-domain antibody that also exhibits cross-specificity with SARS-CoV-2 but with decreased binding affinity. Here we applied a structure-based approach to affinity-mature VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein while retaining the original affinity for SARS-CoV-1. This was achieved by employing the computational platform ADAPT in a constrained dual-affinity optimization mode as a means of broadening specificity. Select mutants designed by ADAPT were formatted as fusions with a human IgG1-Fc fragment. These mutants demonstrated improved binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein due to decreased dissociation rates. Functional testing for virus neutralization revealed improvements relative to the parental VHH72-Fc up to 10-fold using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus and 20-fold against the SARS-CoV-2 authentic live virus (Wuhan variant). Binding and neutralization improvements were maintained for some other SARS-CoV-2 variants currently in circulation. These improved VHH-72 mutants are predicted to establish novel interactions with the S antigen. They will be useful, alone or as fusions with other functional modules, in the global quest for treatments of COVID-19 infections."
https://openalex.org/W4220771999,"Knowledge of biodiversity in the past, and the timing, nature, and drivers of human-induced ecological change, is important for gaining deep time perspectives and for modern conservation efforts. The Marquesas Islands (Polynesia) are one of the world's most remote archipelagos and illustrate the vulnerability of indigenous bioscapes to anthropogenic activities. Characterised by high levels of endemism across many biotic groups, the full spectrum of the group's flora and fauna is nonetheless incompletely known. Several centuries of Polynesian settlement reshaped biotic communities in ways that are not yet fully understood, and historically-introduced mammalian herbivores have devastated the indigenous lowland flora. We report here on archaeological recovery of a diverse assemblage of plant and arthropod subfossils from a waterlogged deposit on the largest Marquesan island: Nuku Hiva. These materials offer new perspectives on the composition of lowland plant and arthropod communities pene-contemporaneous with human arrival. Bayesian analysis of multiple 14C results from short-lived materials date the assemblages to the mid-12th century AD (1129-1212 cal. AD, 95.4% HPD). Evidence for human activities in the catchment coincident with deposit formation includes Polynesian associated arthropods, microcharcoal, and an adzed timber. Plant macrofossils (seeds, fruits, vegetative structures) and microfossils (pollen, phytoliths) reveal coastal and lowland wet-moist forest communities unlike those observed today. Several apparently extinct taxa are identified, along with extant taxa currently constrained to high altitude and/or interior areas. A diverse inventory of subfossil arthropods-the first pre-18th century records for the islands-includes more than 100 distinct taxa, with several new archipelago records and one previously unreported for eastern Polynesia. The assemblages provide new insights into lowland Marquesan forest communities coincident with human arrival, and portend the considerable anthropogenic transformations that followed. These records also have implications for human colonisation of the Marquesas Islands and East Polynesia at large."
https://openalex.org/W4220781045,"Voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels are critical for the development and mature function of the nervous system. Variants in the CACNA2D4 gene encoding the α 2 δ-4 auxiliary subunit of these channels are associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. α 2 δ-4 is prominently expressed in the retina and is crucial for vision, but extra-retinal functions of α 2 δ-4 have not been investigated. Here, we sought to fill this gap by analyzing the behavioral phenotypes of α 2 δ-4 knockout (KO) mice. α 2 δ-4 KO mice (both males and females) exhibited significant impairments in prepulse inhibition that were unlikely to result from the modestly elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds. Whereas α 2 δ-4 KO mice of both sexes were hyperactive in various assays, only females showed impaired motor coordination in the rotarod assay. α 2 δ-4 KO mice exhibited anxiolytic and anti-depressive behaviors in the elevated plus maze and tail suspension tests, respectively. Our results reveal an unexpected role for α 2 δ-4 in sensorimotor gating and motor function and identify α 2 δ-4 KO mice as a novel model for studying the pathophysiology associated with CACNA2D4 variants."

We investigated the prevalence and concordance of cervical, vulval, oral and anal HPV among FSW in Ibadan, Nigeria.FSWs aged 18-45 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional survey. After interview and clinical examination, samples were collected from mouth, cervix, vulva and anus. HPV genotyping was done with Anyplex II 28HPV assay. Multivariable analyses were performed to explore associated risk factors and concordance of HPV infections across sites.In total, 315 FSWs participated in the study with a mean age of 30-6.5 years. The prevalence of any HPV infection was 88% in the vulva, 84% in the cervix, 75% in the anus and 24% in the oral cavity. HPV 35 was the most prevalent and concordant high-risk type in the four sites. The risk factors for HPV infection by anatomic site varied.This large study showed a high prevalence and concordance of HPV infections of cervical, vulval, oral and anal HPV among FSWs in Nigeria. The potential to acquire and transmit HPV is high in this population, and we highlighted the urgency to protect young women through HPV vaccination."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the average and maximum power and to describe the beam diameter of different low-power laser photobiomodulation devices in clinical use in Brazil.The power and light-emitting beam diameter of twenty-four therapeutic devices with an average age of 11±5 years, with an average weekly use of fewer than thirty minutes, were measured.The analyzed power varied between 2% to 134% of the values declared by the manufacturers. Differences in beam diameter of between 38% and 543% of the nominal values were also observed. It is also noteworthy that even between the same brand and model, differences in diameter were obtained. Finally, differences were observed in the power output after one and three minutes of sequential emission for 830 nm and 904 nm (p < 0.05), but not when comparing the difference between wavelengths in factor time.There is a need for a shared effort on the part of laser manufacturers to improve standardization and consistency of laser output power and beam diameters. At the same time, medical laser operators should also consider development of standardized protocols for maintenance and monitoring equipment performance over time to correct for fluctuations that could ultimately impact on treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220839898,"While mass vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 have inoculated almost 200 million Americans and billions more worldwide, significant pockets of vaccine hesitancy remain. Research has firmly established that vaccine efficacy is an important driver of public vaccine acceptance and choice. However, current vaccines offer widely varying levels of protection against different adverse health outcomes of COVID-19. This study employs an experiment embedded on a survey of 1,194 US adults in June 2021 to examine how communications about vaccine efficacy affect vaccine choice. The experiment manipulated how vaccine efficacy was defined across four treatments: (1) protection against symptomatic infection; (2) protection against severe illness; (3) protection against hospitalization/death; (4) efficacy data on all three metrics. The control group received no efficacy information. Subjects were asked to choose between a pair of vaccines—a one-dose viral vector vaccine or two-dose mRNA vaccine—whose efficacy data varied across the four experimental treatment groups. Efficacy data for each vaccine on each dimension were adapted from clinical trial data on the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Among all respondents, only modest preference gaps between the two vaccines emerged in the control group and when the two vaccines’ roughly equivalent efficacy data against hospitalization and death were reported. Strong preferences for a two-dose mRNA vaccine emerged in treatments where its higher efficacy against symptomatic or severe illness was reported, as well as in the treatment where data on all three efficacy criteria were reported. Unvaccinated respondents preferred a one-dose viral vector vaccine when only efficacy data against hospitalization or death was presented. Black and Latino respondents were significantly more likely to choose the one-shot viral vector vaccine in the combined efficacy treatment than were whites. Results speak to the importance of understanding how communications about vaccine efficacy affect public preferences in an era of increasing uncertainty about efficacy against variants."
https://openalex.org/W4220845893,"Respiratory failure complicates most critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is characterized by heterogeneous pulmonary parenchymal involvement, profound hypoxemia and pulmonary vascular injury. The high incidence of COVID-19 related respiratory failure has exposed critical shortages in the supply of mechanical ventilators, and providers with the necessary skills to treat. Traditional mass-produced ventilators rely on an internal compressor and mixer to moderate and control the gas mixture delivered to a patient. However, the current emergency has energized the pursuit of alternative designs, enabling greater flexibility in supply chain, manufacturing, storage, and maintenance considerations. To achieve this, we hypothesized that using the medical gasses and flow interruption strategy would allow for a high performance, low cost, functional ventilator. A low-cost ventilator designed and built-in accordance with the Emergency Use guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is presented wherein pressurized medical grade gases enter the ventilator and time limited flow interruption determines the ventilator rate and tidal volume. This simple strategy obviates the need for many components needed in traditional ventilators, thereby dramatically shortening the time from storage to clinical deployment, increasing reliability, while still providing life-saving ventilatory support. The overall design philosophy and its applicability in this new crisis is described, followed by both bench top and animal testing results used to confirm the precision, safety and reliability of this low cost and novel approach to mechanical ventilation. The ventilator meets and exceeds the critical requirements included in the FDA emergency use guidelines. The ventilator has received emergency use authorization from the FDA."

Yellow vein mosaic disease (YVMD) and okra leaf curl disease (OLCD) caused by distinct begomovirus are a major limitation to production of okra in India. In this framework the present investigation reports, for the first time, comparative study of begomovirus species viz. yellow vein mosaic virus (YVMV) and okra enation leaf curl virus (OELCuV) ingested and egested by two cryptic species (Asia I and Asia II 5) of B.tabaci at different time interval using detached leaf assay. A gradual increase of both virus copies were observed with increased feeding exposure in Asia I and Asia II 5. Both the genetic groups of whitefly could acquire the viruses within just 5 minutes of active feeding however, a significant amount of variation was noted in virus uptake by the both. At 24 hours of active feeding Asia II 5 acquired more of YVMV whereas, Asia I ingested more OELCuV. Similarly, the genetic group acquiring higher titre of virus egested higher amount during inoculation period. On the whole, it can be presumed that Asia I is a more effective transmitter of OELCuV whereas, Asia II 5 of YVMV further suggesting increased risk of virus pandemics (both YVMV and OELCuV) in regions where Asia I and Asia II 5 is dominant."
https://openalex.org/W4220937518,"The purpose of this study was to compare running behaviors, motives, and injury during the first full year of the pandemic compared to the year prior, and month of eased restrictions. 466 runners responded to this follow-up survey. Paired t-tests were used to compare timepoints. Logistic regressions were used to assess demographic influences on behaviors. During the first full year of the pandemic, runners were more likely to increase their weekly runs (Mean Differences [MD]: 0.29±0.10, p < .001), yet had fewer motives (MD: -0.20±0.06, p = .02) compared to the month of eased restrictions. 18-25-year-olds were most likely to increase running volume (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.79 [1.06, 7.32], p = .04) during the first full year of the pandemic compared to the year prior. Inexperienced runners reported fewer motives (OR: 3.00-4.41, p = .02-.04), and reduced sustained runs (OR: 2.36 [1.13, 4.96], p = .02) during the first full year of the pandemic compared to the year prior. Inexperienced runners and runners who lost access to preferred locations were at increased injury risk (OR: 1.98-2.63, p: .01-.04) during the first full year of the pandemic compared to the year prior. Our findings highlight pandemic-related changes among the running community that are likely to influence behaviors and injury risk."

While a body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating a positive relationship between time in nature and mental well-being, there have been few studies comparing this relationship in different locations over long periods of time. In this study, we analyze over 1.5 million tweets to estimate a happiness benefit, the difference in expressed happiness between in- and out-of-park tweets, for the 25 largest cities in the US by population. People write happier words during park visits when compared with non-park user tweets collected around the same time. While the words people write are happier in parks on average and in most cities, we find considerable variation across cities. Tweets are happier in parks at all times of the day, week, and year, not just during the weekend or summer vacation. Across all cities, we find that the happiness benefit is highest in parks larger than 100 acres. Overall, our study suggests the happiness benefit associated with park visitation is on par with US holidays such as Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day."

This retrospective audit was conducted to characterise the aetiology, temporospatial epidemiology, and clinical course of 49 cryptococcal infections in Far North Queensland between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2019. Cryptococcus gattii was identified in 15/32 (47%) in whom it was possible to speciate the organism. Among these 15 patients, 13 (87%) had a rural residential address, 10 (67%) were Indigenous Australians and 11 (73%) presented during the May-November dry season. When compared to the 17 patients with Cryptococcus neoformans infection, patients with C . gattii were less likely to be immunocompromised (0/15 versus 8/17 (47%), p = 0.003). Neurosurgery was necessary in 5/15 C . gattii cases and 3/17 (18%) C . neoformans cases (p = 0.42). Outcomes were generally good with 42/49 (86%) cases—and 14/15 (93%) with C . gattii infection—surviving to hospital discharge. These positive outcomes are likely to be explained by the development of standardised treatment guidelines during the study period, low rates of comorbidity in the patients with C . gattii infection and access to liposomal amphotericin and neurosurgical support in the well-resourced Australian healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W4221061048,"Fossilized plant resins, or ambers, offer a unique paleontological window into the history of life. A natural polymer, amber can preserve aspects of ancient environments, including whole organisms, for tens or even hundreds of millions of years. While most amber research involves imaging with visual light, other spectra are increasingly used to characterize both organismal inclusions as well as amber matrix. Terahertz (THz) radiation, which occupies the electromagnetic band between microwave and infrared light wavelengths, is non-ionizing and frequently used in polymer spectroscopy. Here, we evaluate the utility of amber terahertz spectroscopy in a comparative setting for the first time by analyzing the terahertz optical properties of samples from 10 fossil deposits ranging in age from the Miocene to the Early Cretaceous. We recover no clear relationships between amber age or botanical source and terahertz permittivity; however, we do find apparent deposit-specific permittivity among transparent amber samples. By comparing the suitability of multiple permittivity models across sample data we find that models with a distribution of dielectric relaxation times best describe the spectral permittivity of amber. We also demonstrate a process for imaging amber inclusions using terahertz transmission and find that terahertz spectroscopy can be used to identify some synthetic amber forgeries."
https://openalex.org/W4221063898,"Background People in their fifties with HIV are considered older adults, but they appear not to be a homogeneous group. Objective To evaluate the differences among older adults with HIV according to their chronological age and the year of HIV diagnosis. Methods Cross-sectional study of the FUNCFRAIL cohort. Patients 50 or over with HIV were included and were stratified by both chronological age and the year of HIV diagnosis: before 1996 (long-term HIV survivors [LTHS]) and after 1996. We recorded sociodemographic data, HIV-related factors, comorbidities, frailty, physical function, other geriatric syndromes, and quality of life (QOL). Results We evaluated 801 patients. Of these, 24.7% were women, 47.0% were LTHS, and 14.7% were 65 or over. Of the 65 or over patients, 73% were diagnosed after 1996. Higher rates of comorbidities among LTHS were found, being the more prevalent: COPD, history of cancer, osteoarthritis, depression, and other psychiatric disorders while the more prevalent among the 65 or over patients were: hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cancer, and osteoarthritis. LTHS showed a significantly worse QOL. There were no differences by the year of HIV diagnosis regarding frailty and functional impairment (SPPB &lt;10) but they were more than twice as prevalent in the 65 or over patients compared to the other chronological age groups. Conclusions A LTHS and a 65 or over person are both “older adults with HIV,” but their characteristics and requirements differ markedly. It is mandatory to design specific approaches focused on the real needs of the different profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4221102569,"Virtual reality (VR) headsets provide immersive audio-visual experiences for users, but usually neglect to provide olfactory cues that can provide additional information about our environment in the real world. This paper examines whether the introduction of smells into the VR environment enhances users' experience, including their sense of presence through collection of both psychological and physiological measures. Using precise odour administration with an olfactometer, study participants were exposed to smells while they were immersed in the popular PlayStation VR game ""Resident Evil 7"". A within-subject study design was undertaken where participants (n = 22) walked-through the same VR environment twice, with or without the introduction of associated congruent odour stimuli. Directly after each gameplay, participants completed a questionnaire to determine their sense of presence from the overall gameplay and their sense of immersion in each of the virtual scenes. Additionally, physiological measurements (heart rate, body temperature and skin electrodermal activity) were collected from participants (n = 11) for each gameplay. The results showed the addition of odours significantly increased participants' sense of spatial presence in the VR environment compared to VR with no odour. Participants also rated the realism of VR experience with odour higher compared to no odour, however odour addition did not result in change in emotional state of participants (arousal, pleasure, dominance). Further, the participants' physiological responses were impacted by the addition of odour. Odour mediated physiological changes were dependent on whether the VR environment was novel, as the effect of odour on physiological response was lost when participants experienced the aroma on the second gameplay. Overall, the results indicate the addition of odours to a VR environment had a significant effect on both the psychological and physiological experience showing the addition of smell enhanced the VR environment. The incorporation of odours to VR environments presents an opportunity to create a more immersive experience to increase a person's presence within a VR environment. In addition to gaming, the results have broader applications for virtual training environments and virtual reality exposure therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4221129575,"Background The aim of this prospective study is to examine how parenting style relates to academic achievement of Lebanese adolescents and test the mediating effect of self-efficacy and intention towards getting good grades. Potential moderation by demographic factors (age, gender, school type, religion and parents’ education) was also examined. Methods Students (n = 345) from private and public schools in Mount Lebanon and Beirut area, aged between 15 and 18, participated in a two-wave longitudinal study and completed a self-administered questionnaire based on the I-Change Model assessing socio-demographics (age, gender, school type, parents’ education, family structure, religion), socio-cognitive factors (attitude, social norms, self-efficacy, intention), parenting styles and academic achievement. Adolescent were surveyed at two time points, six months apart. A multiple linear regression was carried out to identify baseline factors independently associated with academic achievement 6 months later. Moderation was examined using Hayes’s SPSS macro PROCESS. A serial mediation model was employed to test for the sequential mediating effect of self-efficacy and intention between parenting style and academic achievement. Results Authoritative parenting was prospectively associated with better academic achievement and higher self-efficacy and intention at 6 months follow up. In addition, self-efficacy and intention towards getting good grades were found to mediate the relationship of parenting style to academic achievement. Adolescents who perceive their parents as authoritative are more likely to develop high efficacy beliefs and higher intention and subsequently are more likely to achieve better in school compared to peers of neglectful parents. Socio-demographics did not moderate the effect of parenting on academic achievement. Conclusion Authoritative parenting influenced both directly and indirectly the academic achievement of their children. Interventions aiming at improving academic performance of adolescents should also encompass positive parenting style strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4225539572,"Therapeutic targeting of the estrogen receptor (ER) is a clinically validated approach for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER+ BC), but sustained response is limited by acquired resistance. Targeting the transcriptional coactivators required for estrogen receptor activity represents an alternative approach that is not subject to the same limitations as targeting estrogen receptor itself. In this report we demonstrate that the acetyltransferase activity of coactivator paralogs CREBBP/EP300 represents a promising therapeutic target in ER+ BC. Using the potent and selective inhibitor CPI-1612, we show that CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition potently suppresses in vitro and in vivo growth of breast cancer cell line models and acts in a manner orthogonal to directly targeting ER. CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition suppresses ER-dependent transcription by targeting lineage-specific enhancers defined by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1. These results validate CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase activity as a viable target for clinical development in ER+ breast cancer."

However, simulation studies have suggested an increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity for older individuals inoculated by house-bound children. This study examines whether the March 2020 lockdown in New York City (NYC) was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in neighborhoods with larger proportions of multigenerational households.We obtained daily age-segmented COVID-19 hospitalization counts in each of 166 ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in NYC. Using Bayesian Poisson regression models that account for spatiotemporal dependencies between ZCTAs, as well as socioeconomic risk factors, we conducted a difference-in-differences study amongst ZCTA-level hospitalization rates from February 23 to May 2, 2020. We compared ZCTAs in the lowest quartile of multigenerational housing to other quartiles before and after the lockdown.Among individuals over 55 years, the lockdown was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in ZCTAs with more multigenerational households. The greatest difference occurred three weeks after lockdown: Q2 vs. Q1: 54% increase (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 22-96%); Q3 vs. Q1: 48% (17-89%); Q4 vs. Q1: 66% (30-211%). After accounting for pandemic-related population shifts, a significant difference was observed only in Q4 ZCTAs: 37% (7-76%).By increasing house-bound mixing across older and younger age groups, city-wide lockdown mandates imposed during the growth of COVID-19 cases may have inadvertently, but transiently, contributed to increased transmission in multigenerational households."
https://openalex.org/W4220653730,"Methotrexate (MTX) has been used in treating various types of cancers but can also cause damage to normal organs and cell types. Folinic acid (FA) is a well-known MTX antidote that protects against toxicity caused by the drug and has been used for decades. Since hearing loss caused by MTX treatment is not well studied, herein we aimed to investigate the efficiency of the antioxidant Avenanthramide-C (AVN-C) on high-dose MTX (HDMTX) toxicity in the ear and provide insights into the possible mechanism involved in MTX-induced hearing loss in normal adult C57Bl/6 mice and HEI-OC1 cells. Our results show that the levels of MTX increased in the serum and perilymph 30 minutes after systemic administration. MTX increased hearing thresholds in mice, whereas AVN-C and FA preserved hearing within the normal range. MTX also caused a decrease in wave I amplitude, while AVN-C and FA maintained it at higher levels. MTX considerably damaged the cochlear synapses and neuronal integrity, and both AVN-C and FA rescued the synapses. MTX reduced the cell viability and increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HEI-OC1 cells, but AVN-C and FA reversed these changes. Apoptosis- and ROS-related genes were significantly upregulated in MTX-treated HEI-OC1 cells; however, they were downregulated by AVN-C and FA treatment. We show that MTX can cause severe hearing loss; it can cross the blood-labyrinth barrier and cause damage to the cochlear neurons and outer hair cells (OHCs). The antioxidant AVN-C exerts a strong protective effect against MTX-induced ototoxicity and preserved the inner ear structures (synapses, neurons, and OHCs) from MTX-induced damage. The mechanism of AVN-C against MTX suggests that ROS is involved in HDMTX-induced ototoxicity."

The BCAA concentrations investigated in reduced-crude protein diets were 12.5, 15.5, 18.3 g/kg leucine (125, 155, 183); 8.9, 10.2, 12.5 g/kg valine (89, 102, 125) and 7.2, 8.9, 10.8 g/kg isoleucine (72, 89, 109), where their relativity to 11.0 g/kg digestible lysine are shown in parentheses. Determined parameters included growth performance, relative abdominal fat-pad weights, nutrient utilisation, apparent digestibility coefficients, disappearance rates of 16 amino acids and free amino acid systemic plasma concentrations. Increasing dietary leucine linearly depressed weight gain and quadratically influenced FCR where the estimated minimum FCR of 1.418 was with 14.99 g/kg leucine. Polynomial regression analysis and surface response curves of determined parameters were generated for significant (P &lt; 0.05) BCAA variables, based on lack of fit (P &gt; 0.005). Quadratic and cross-product responses were observed for weight gain, FCR, AME, AME n , N retention and apparent digestibility of 13 amino acids. Relative fat-pad weights declined linearly with increasing isoleucine and valine. The lowest N retention was estimated at a combination of 15.25 and 10.50 g/kg leucine and valine respectively whilst the highest mean digestibility coefficient (0.793) of amino acids was estimated at a combination of 15.74 and 10.47 g/kg of leucine and valine respectively. The remaining parameter minima or maxima responses were not able to be determined since they were outside the extreme BCAA treatment levels. Increasing dietary BCAA significantly increased apparent ileal digestibilities and disappearance rates of BCAA. Systemic plasma concentrations of valine increased (P &lt; 0.001) with increasing dietary valine but leucine was not influenced (P &gt; 0.25). Systemic plasma concentration of isoleucine was maximised (P &lt; 0.001) only when accompanied by elevated dietary leucine. Also, dietary treatments influenced (P &lt; 0.05) apparent disappearance rates of all the essential amino acids analysed, with the exception of methionine. Whilst overall growth performance was not disadvantaged (P &gt; 0.10) by elevated BCAA levels, compared with 2019 Ross 308 performance objectives, polynomial regression analysis suggested both interaction and antagonism between BCAA."

We explore the thoughts of new residents about this transition and reflect on the support needed.An exploratory qualitative case study was conducted with 51 residents. All had experienced interruptions in clinical training due to the pandemic and had just started their postgraduate training. Qualitative data were collected through 6 focus groups and 12 individual follow-up interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken, and the data were categorised using a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) framework.Graduates beginning their residency were aware of their professionalism and independence during the transition. They also faced the predicament of needing close supervision while their supervisors managed pandemic conditions. Residents emphasised the importance of developing relationships with colleagues and supervisors during the transition to residency and wanted direct observation and detailed feedback from their supervisors during procedures.The experiences of residents were not uniformly negative. In fact, some had developed a positive mindset when entering the clinical field. Medical faculty members reflecting on interactions with new residents and planning future clinical internships could benefit from placing a high value on building relationships among residents, who may expect direct observation and detailed feedback from their supervisors."
https://openalex.org/W4220968135,"The dramatic increase in healthcare costs has become a significant burden to this era. Many patients are unable to access medication because of the high price of drugs. Genetic engineering has made advances to increase the yield, titer, and productivity in the bio-based production of chemicals, materials of interest, and identification of innovative targets for drug discovery. Currently, the production of homoglutamate (α-Aminoadipic acid) involves petrochemical routes that are costly with low yield and often not suitable for industrial production. Here, we established the development of NADH-dependent homoglutamate by engineering NADH-dependent phenylalanine dehydrogenase (PDH) from Thermoactinomyces intermedius, which provides a novel tool for in-vivo metabolic engineering and in-vitro catalysis. Based on computational insight into the structure, we proposed the site-specific directed mutagenesis of the two important residues of PDH through docking simulations by AutoDock Vina which elucidated the binding mode of PDH with α-Ketoadipic acid and ligands. Our results demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency Km/Kcat of the final mutant Ala135Arg showed a 3-fold increase amination activity towards the ketoadipic acid as compared to the other mutant Gly114Arg, a double mutant Gly114Arg/Ala135Arg, and wild type TiPDH. Furthermore, we have introduced formate dehydrogenase as a cofactor regenerative system in this study which further made this study economically viable. Our study unfolds the possibility of biosynthesis of other non-proteinogenic amino acids that might be valuable pharmaceutical intermediaries."

Any such interventions must make sure to address the needs of adolescent and young adult parents. This study explored the social and demographic maternal variables associated with risk of early childhood development (ECD) delay for children of young mothers in Brazil.Cross-sectional secondary data analysis was done using data from young mothers (aged 13-24) and their children (aged 0-2), collected from community health centers in Brasília, Brazil, between 2017-2018. The Denver Developmental Screening Test II was used to assess risk of ECD delay outcomes. Descriptive analyses were conducted across the full sample and sub-groups of adolescent (13-19) and young adult (20-24) mothers. Multivariable logistic regressions based on theory modelling approach were conducted for the full sample to examine the associations between maternal age and risk of ECD delay, adjusted for a battery of household, maternal, pregnancy, and infant variables.Risk of ECD delay was found in 17.39% (N = 76) of the children who participated (N = 437). No significant differences in risk of ECD delay were found for children of adolescent mothers compared to children of young adult mothers. Across the full sample, 60.36% (N = 236) of mothers were living in poverty, 73.17% (N = 319) had 9 or more years of education, and 86.14% (N = 373) were not working outside the home at time of data collection. Furthermore, 90.11% (N = 392) did not identify as head of their household and 73.68% (N = 322) were primiparous. Socially-mediated factors such as lower maternal educational attainment, unemployment, and lack of household support were associated with increased risk of ECD delays for children under age 2. Adjusted logistic regression identified multiparity as an independent maternal factor associated with increased risk of ECD delay (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI, 1.23-5.13).Multiparity was the only independent maternal factor associated with ECD delay among children under 2 years old. Other socio-demographic factors relevant to young mothers may influence ECD delays. Ensuring sustained, concurrent attention to children's and young parent's developmental needs may improve multi-generational health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4220669048,"Under the condition of resource tolerance, engineering construction projects face the problem of labor force balance in the working face. Notably, a deviation occurs between the distribution and certain demand of the labor force in the limited working face, which affects the realization of an extremely short construction period. To address this problem, we first introduced the stochastic coefficient of labor force equilibrium to measure the degree of labor balance. Second, a labor force equilibrium model with the realization goal of an extremely short construction period was established. Then, the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was improved from two perspectives to solve the proposed model. The update equation was rounded to solve practical project problems, and a dynamic variable inertia weight was adopted to ensure the PSO algorithm accuracy and convergence speed. Finally, through case analysis, we determined the extremely short construction period and best labor force distribution scheme. Moreover, the case results revealed that the established model is simple, operable and practical and that the proposed algorithm achieves a high search accuracy and efficiency in the model solution process. Overall, under the condition of resource tolerance, this study provides scientific and effective references for managers to realize an extremely short construction period."
https://openalex.org/W4220715723,"The circadian rhythm affects the biological evolution and operating mechanisms of organisms. The impact of light on the circadian rhythm is a significant concern for both biology and human well-being. However, the relation between different wavelengths, irradiances, and circadian rhythm is unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of four different monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED) light and two different irradiances on the circadian rhythm of a wild-type Neurospora crassa. The results demonstrated that the circadian rhythm of Neurospora crassa can be modulated by violet (λp = 393 nm), blue (λp = 462 nm), and green (λp = 521 nm) light, regardless of the irradiances, in the visible region. Unexpectedly, for the yellow light (λp = 591 nm), the 2 W/m2 light had a more significant impact on circadian rhythm modulation than the 0.04 W/m2 light had. Considering the highest energy of yellow light (2.25 eV) is lower than the High Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO)-Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) gap of WC-1 (2.43 eV). We speculate that there may be other potential photoreceptors that are involved in circadian rhythm modulation. The HOMO-LOMO gaps of these proteins are greater than 1.98 eV and less than 2.25 eV. These results provide a strong foundation for a deeper understanding of the impact of different light on the circadian rhythm and also shed light on the identification of new circadian rhythm modulation photoreceptors."

This paper explores linkages between ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations and indicators of both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We used estimates of UFP based on a highly-resolved land-use regression model of concentrations. In multivariate linear regression models census block groups with high proportions of Asians were associated with higher levels of UFP in comparison to block groups with majority White or other minority groups. Lower UFP concentrations were associated with higher homeownership (indicating higher SES) and with higher female head of household (indicating lower socioeconomic status). One explanation for the results include the proximity of specific groups to traffic corridors that are the main sources of UFP in Boston. Additional studies, especially at higher geographic resolution, are needed in Boston and other major cities to better characterize UFP concentrations by sociodemographic factors."
https://openalex.org/W4220909838,"In this paper we examine the buffering effects of personality traits when people leave their work in later life. Using large-scale panel data for the UK, we show that depending on the exit route and satisfaction related to overall life and the domains of income and leisure, different personality traits act as moderators. Besides augmenting leisure satisfaction for those who hit mandatory retirement, conscientiousness augments life satisfaction for those becoming unemployed. On the contrary, extraversion mitigates satisfaction with life, income, and leisure for those who retire early. This may be an indication that extraverted individuals who tend to be sociable and outgoing may suffer when losing social relationships from their work. At the same time, extraversion may be helpful in augmenting leisure satisfaction for those who stop working for reasons related to ill health or family care. Neuroticism augments income satisfaction for those who become unemployed, which may reflect that people high in neuroticism had a lower ""baseline level"" of income satisfaction relative to typical individuals so they were not affected as much. Finally, agreeableness mitigates life and leisure satisfaction for those hitting mandatory retirement, as is also the case with openness in terms of income satisfaction."

This study aimed to describe the acceptability of unsupervised peer-distribution of HIVST as a method to scale-up HIV testing.In this study, lay counsellors or community health workers provided HIVST kits to primary recipients (PRs) for distribution to their sexual partners, anyone in their social network (termed secondary recipients) or for self-testing, from September 2018 to March 2020. The study was conducted in Eshowe and Mbongolwane areas in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A structured questionnaire was administered during the recruitment and passive follow-up, when people came for confirmatory HIV testing. Electronic records were retrospectively examined to determine initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for all HIVST users and non-users.Among 36,708 people approached to be primary recipients, 9,891 (26.9%) accepted; 31,341 HIVST kits were distributed with a median of three (IQR: 2-4) per peer. PRs were predominately recruited at primary health clinics (PHCs). However, acceptability of HIVST was thrice as high at community-based testing sites compared to PHCs (64.5% vs. 21.0%; p<0.001). During the study period, 34,715 adults were tested for HIV at both PHCs and community-based testing sites; of these, 1,089 individuals reported HIVST use. Among HIVST users, 893 (82.0%) returned to the clinic for confirmatory testing after testing negative on HIVST; 196 (17.9%) were confirmed HIV positive following a positive HIVST. After excluding 36/196 (18.4%) participants for whom clinical records could not be found in electronic register and 25/160 (15.6%) who were already on ART before receiving HIVST, 129/135 (95.5%) initiated ART, whereas 2,362/2685 (88%) of HIV positive HIVST non-users-initiated ART.Unsupervised peer-distribution of HIVST was feasible and acceptable, with more than 25% accepting to be peer-distributors.

Although remarkable progress has been made in the reduction of under-five mortality, still the under-five mortality rate is high in Nepal. There are few studies on health care seeking behavior among caretakers in Nepal. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevailing health care seeking behavior of caretakers on common childhood illness of under five year children and to identify the association of socio demographic, economic, illness related and health system related factors with health care seeking behavior in 2018.A community based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2018. Data were collected using a pretested semi-structured interview schedule. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present the data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with health care seeking behavior.A total of 387 caretakers participated in the study. Of these, 84.8% sought any type of care and 15.2% did nothing. Amongst those who sought care 42.4% visited the pharmacy directly, 25.3% visited the health facility. Amongst those who visited a health facility, 37.2% of caretakers sought prompt health care. Common danger sign stated by caretakers was fever in children (92.4%). Secondary education(AOR = 0.357, 95%CI = 0.142-0.896), involvement in service as an occupation(AOR = 3.533, 95%CI = 1.096-11.384), distance to reach nearest health facility(0.957, 95%CI = 0.923-0.993) and perceived severity of illness; moderate severity (7.612, 95%CI = 2.127-27.242), severe severity (AOR = 15.563, 95%CI = 3.495-69.308) were found to be significantly associated with health care seeking behavior.Strong policies and regulations should be formulated and implemented at Birendranagar municipality of Surkhet district to prevent direct purchase of medicines from pharmacies without any consultation.

We aimed to investigate the use of holding regimens for PLWH in Asian countries. Data from adults enrolled in routine HIV care in IeDEA Asia-Pacific cohorts were included. Individuals were considered to be on holding regimen if they had been on combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months, had two confirmed viral loads (VL) ≥1000 copies/mL, and had remained on the same medications for at least 6 months. Survival time was analyzed using Fine and Gray's competing risk regression. Factors associated with CD4 changes and VL <1000 copies/mL were analyzed using linear regression and logistic regression, respectively. A total of 425 PLWH (72.9% male; 45.2% high-income and 54.8% low-to-middle-income country) met criteria for being on a holding regimen. From high-income countries, 63.0% were on protease inhibitors (PIs); from low-to-middle-income countries, 58.4% were on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); overall, 4.5% were on integrase inhibitors. The combination of lamivudine, zidovudine, and efavirenz was the most commonly used single regimen (n = 46, 10.8%), followed by lamivudine, zidovudine, and nevirapine (n = 37, 8.7%). Forty-one PLWH (9.7%) died during follow-up (mortality rate 2.0 per 100 person-years). Age >50 years compared to age 31-40 years (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 3.29, 95% CI 1.45-7.43, p = 0.004), and VL ≥1000 copies/ml compared to VL <1000 copies/mL (SHR, 2.14, 95% CI 1.08-4.25, p = 0.029) were associated with increased mortality, while higher CD4 counts were protective. In our Asia regional cohort, there was a diversity of holding regimens, and the patterns of PI vs. NNRTI use differed by country income levels. Considering the high mortality rate of PLWH with holding regimen, efforts to extend accessibility to additional antiretroviral options are needed in our region."
https://openalex.org/W4221136611,"We report a direct replication of our earlier study looking at how people react to research on sex differences depending on whether the research puts men or women in a better light. Three-hundred-and-three participants read a fictional popular-science article about fabricated research finding that women score higher on a desirable trait/lower on an undesirable one (female-favoring difference) or that men do (male-favoring difference). Consistent with our original study, both sexes reacted less positively to the male-favoring differences, with no difference between men and women in the strength of this effect. Also consistent with our original study, belief in male privilege and a left-leaning political orientation predicted less positive reactions to the male-favoring sex differences; neither variable, however, predicted reactions to the female-favoring sex differences (in the original study, male-privilege belief predicted positive reactions). As well as looking at how participants reacted to the research, we looked at their predictions about how the average man and woman would react. Consistent with our earlier results, participants of both sexes predicted that the average man and woman would exhibit considerable own-sex favoritism. In doing so, they exaggerated the magnitude of the average woman's own-sex favoritism and predicted strong own-sex favoritism from the average man when in fact the average man exhibited modest other-sex favoritism. A greater awareness of people's tendency to exaggerate own-sex bias could help to ameliorate conflict between the sexes."
https://openalex.org/W4226069080,"During goal-directed behaviors, individuals can be required to start a movement before deciding on the final goal. Previous studies have focused on the initial movement direction in situations involving multiple targets in different directions from the starting position and have shown that the movement is initiated in the average direction among the target directions. However, the previous studies only included situations with targets at equivalent distances, and the characteristics of motor planning in situations with multiple movement possibilities over different potential distances are unclear. In such situations, movement velocity is another important control variable. Furthermore, while previous studies examined situations with an uncertain motor target position, uncertainty can also exist in the effector position (e.g., body or tool locations). Therefore, we examined (1) whether the average output is confirmed in the initial movement velocity during execution in situations involving two potential movements with different distances. In addition, we examined (2) whether planning of the movement velocity can differ depending on the presence of uncertainty in the cursor or the target. In the main conditions, the participants were required to start a reaching movement with two potential movement distances; in the two-cursor condition, two cursors were presented before the start of the trial, and in the two-target condition, two targets were presented. As a control condition, a distance condition corresponding to each main condition was also performed. In the control condition, the initial movement velocity varied linearly with distance. Then, we tested whether the initial movement velocity in situations with two potential movement distances would follow the averaging output of the corresponding control condition. The results revealed that while the initial movement velocity in the two-target condition was slower than the averaging output, that in the two-cursor condition approached the averaging output. These results suggest that the velocity profile of the goal-directed movement is not simply averaged in a situation where two potential targets exist, and that there is a difference in the planning policy of the initial movement depending on whether the known uncertainty is for the movement goal or the effector."

https://openalex.org/W4220877758,"Compound screening by in silico approaches has advantages in identifying high-activity leading compounds and can predict the safety of the drug. A key challenge is that the number of observations of drug activity and toxicity accumulation varies by target in different datasets, some of which are more understudied than others. Owing to an overall insufficiency and imbalance of drug data, it is hard to accurately predict drug activity and toxicity of multiple tasks by the existing models. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a two-stage transfer learning workflow to develop a novel prediction model, which can accurately predict drug activity and toxicity of the targets with insufficient observations. We built a balanced dataset based on the Tox21 dataset and developed a drug activity and toxicity prediction model based on Siamese networks and graph convolution to produce multitasking output. We also took advantage of transfer learning from data-rich targets to data-poor targets. We showed greater accuracy in predicting the activity and toxicity of compounds to targets with rich data and poor data. In Tox21, a relatively rich dataset, the prediction model accuracy for classification tasks was 0.877 AUROC. In the other five unbalanced datasets, we also found that transfer learning strategies brought the accuracy of models to a higher level in understudied targets. Our models can overcome the imbalance in target data and predict the compound activity and toxicity of understudied targets to help prioritize upcoming biological experiments."

The dose constraints for the preoperative plan were: V100% ≥ 95%, V150% ≤ 60%, V200% ≤ 20% for the prostate; V100% for rectum, ≤ 1 cc; and V200 Gy for urethra, 0.0 cc. Intraoperative real-time dose calculation and postoperative dose distribution analysis on days 0 and 30 were performed. Median dosimetric outcomes on days 0 and 30 respective were: V100% 92.28% and 92.23%, V200% 18.63% and 25.02%, and D90% 150.88 Gy and 151.46 Gy for the prostate; V100% for the rectum, 0.11 cc and 0.22 cc; and V200 Gy for the urethra, 0.00 cc and 0.00 cc, respectively. Twenty patients underwent additional seed implantation to compensate for insufficient dose coverage of the prostate. No loss or substantial migration of seeds or severe toxicity was reported. With stranded seed implantation and intraoperative optimization, appropriate dose delivery to the prostate without excessive dose to the organs at risk could be achieved."

https://openalex.org/W4220980674,"Temporal order judgment (TOJ) measures the ability to correctly perceive the order of consecutive stimuli presented rapidly. Our previous research suggested that the major predictor of auditory dichotic TOJ threshold, a paradigm that requires the identification of the order of two tones, each of which is presented to a different ear, is the time separating the onset of the first tone from the onset of the second tone (stimulus-onset-asynchrony, SOA). Data supporting this finding, however, was based on a young adult population and a tone duration range of 10-40 msec. The current study aimed to evaluate the generalizability of the earlier finding by manipulating the experimental model in two different ways: a) extending the tone duration range to include shorter stimulus durations (3-8 msec; Experiment 1) and b) repeating the identical testing procedure on a different population with temporal processing deficits, i.e., older adults (Experiment 2). We hypothesized that the SOA would predict the TOJ threshold regardless of tone duration and participant age. Experiment 1 included 226 young adults divided into eight groups (each group receiving a different tone duration) with duration ranging from 3-40 msec. Experiment 2 included 98 participants aged 60-75 years, divided into five groups by tone duration (10-40 msec). The results of both experiments confirmed the hypothesis, that the SOA required for performing dichotic TOJ was constant regardless of stimulus duration, for both age groups: about 66.5 msec for the young adults and 33 msec longer (100 msec) for the older adults. This finding suggests that dichotic TOJ threshold is controlled by a general mechanism that changes quantitatively with age. Clinically, this has significance because quantitative changes can be more easily remedied than qualitative changes. Theoretically, our findings show that, with dichotic TOJ, tone duration affects threshold by providing more time between the onsets of the consecutive stimuli to the two ears. The findings also imply that a temporal processing deficit, at least among older adults, does not elicit the use of a different mechanism in order to judge temporal order."

Despite the important role of the Health Extension Workers (HEWs) in improving the overall healthcare coverage, PNHV remains as a missed opportunity in rural Ethiopia. Thus, this study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of scheduled postnatal home visits in Northern Ethiopia.We conducted an exploratory qualitative study on a total of 16 in-depth interviews with HEWs and mothers who gave birth one year prior to the study. In addition, focus group discussions were conducted with HEWs and key informant interviews were conducted with women development group leaders, supervisors, and healthcare authorities from April to June 2019 in two rural districts of Northern Ethiopia. Discussions and interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim in the local language (Tigrigna) and translated into English. The translated scripts were thematically coded using Atlas ti scientific software. Field notes were also taken during the discussion and while conducting the interviews.Health system factors, community context, and individual level factors were considered as the barriers and facilitators of scheduled PNHVs. Leadership, governance, management, support and supervision, referral linkages, overwhelming workload, capacity building, logistics and supplies are the major sub-themes identified as health system factors. Physical characteristics like geographical location and topography, distance, and coverage of the catchment; and community support and participation like support from women's development groups (WDGs), awareness of the community on the presence of the service and cultural and traditional beliefs were community contexts that affect PNHVs. Self-motivation to support and intrinsic job satisfaction were individual level factors that were considered as barriers and facilitators.The finding of this study suggested that the major barriers of postnatal home visits were poor attention of healthcare authorities of the government bodies, lack of effective supervision, poor functional linkages, inadequate logistics and supplies, unrealistic catchment area coverage, poor community participation and support, and lack of motivation of HEWs. Henceforth, to achieve the scheduled PNHV in rural Ethiopia, there should be strong political commitment and healthcare authorities should provide attention to postnatal care both at facility and home with a strong controlling system."
https://openalex.org/W4225658357,"Despite its high and direct impact on nearly all biological processes, the underlying structure of gene-gene interaction networks is investigated so far according to pair connections. To address this, we explore the gene interaction networks of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae beyond pairwise interaction using the structural balance theory (SBT). Specifically, we ask whether essential and nonessential gene interaction networks are structurally balanced. We study triadic interactions in the weighted signed undirected gene networks and observe that balanced and unbalanced triads are over and underrepresented in both networks, thus beautifully in line with the strong notion of balance. Moreover, we note that the energy distribution of triads is significantly different in both essential and nonessential networks compared to the shuffled networks. Yet, this difference is greater in the essential network regarding the frequency as well as the energy of triads. Additionally, results demonstrate that triads in the essential gene network are more interconnected through sharing common links, while in the nonessential network they tend to be isolated. Last but not least, we investigate the contribution of all-length signed walks and its impact on the degree of balance. Our findings reveal that interestingly when considering longer cycles, not only, both essential and nonessential gene networks are more balanced compared to their corresponding shuffled networks, but also, the nonessential gene network is more balanced compared to the essential network."
