https://openalex.org/W1983823059,"The outer segments of the foveal cones of the rhesus monkey are about 40 microns long and 0.9 microns wide. They consist of stacks of membrane-limited, transverse discs about 140 Å thick, surrounded by a plasma membrane. The inner segments are about 30 microns long and 2.5 to 3 microns wide at the base, and they taper gradually to a tip diameter of about 1.5 microns. They contain many long mitochondria which are oriented lengthwise and are concentrated in the distal portion of the segment. The terminal pedicles show many synaptic contacts, probably as many as 36 per pedicle."

We suggest that cortical activity facilitates and maintains recovery by enhancing the activity of depressed, but intact, tissue adjacent to the lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2014623469,WHEN using the rapid chromatographie method recently developed for measuring the balance of amino-acids in the serum of children with kwashiorkor1 we have found an unidentifiable compound with an RF value slightly less than that of valine. The solvent used was A in Table 1. This communication describes various properties of the compound and the conditions under which it can be demonstrated.

https://openalex.org/W2011200803,"MUCH recent work has indicated that in tissues with a high secretory or nervous activity the rate of aerobic metabolism may be determined by the activity of the ion transport mechanism. This control is effected through the levels of ADP and ATP in the cell, which vary according to the activity of the sodium–potassium stimulated ATPase, the enzyme which governs sodium transport1. It has been shown that ouabain, a specific inhibitor of sodium–potassium ATPase, causes a 40 per cent decrease in the rate of oxygen uptake in kidney2 and in liver3 and a 30 per cent decrease in brain4."

https://openalex.org/W2094189521,"INVESTIGATIONS into an unusually high abortion rate among dairy cattle in Hong Kong have shown that a number of abortions were associated with fungal infections. In one such infection, the fungus has been shown to be Syncephalastrum racemosum (Cohn) Schroet. This is an addition to the list of fungi which have been implicated in bovine mycotic abortion, and also increases further the number of phycomycete fungi known to be abortifacients1,2."

https://openalex.org/W2079428619,"ANTIBODY in the serum of several animal species is confined to two main classes of proteins with sedimentation coefficients of approximately 7S and 19S respectively. The former class comprises molecules with molecular weights of at least 150,000 and includes both the 7Sγ-globulins and the β2A-globulins. The latter class is made up of β2-macroglobulins with molecular weights of about 1,000,000. The type of antibody response appears to depend on a number of interrelated factors, probably the most important of which is the physicochemical nature of the stimulating antigen. Thus hæmocyanin1, A2 influenza virus2, and type III pneumococcal poly-saccharide1 were found to produce 7Sγfy-globulin, while sheep erythrocytes produced predominantly β2-macro-globulins1."

For these techniques a substance of known diffusion constant, established independently, is needed for calibration, which is a disadvantage."

A tentative model is presented, together with some testable psychophysiological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1980809147,"IT has recently been shown that inoculation of mice and hamsters with several oncogenic viruses (polyoma, SV 40, myeloid and lymphoid mouse leukaemia) makes them resistant to subsequent transplantation of tumour cells induced by the same virus. Our observations on chickens naturally resistant to the Rous sarcoma virus, or chickens with regressed tumours, suggested that in some instances it was possible to induce resistance to Rous sarcoma cell antigens in chickens. If this were true then the Rous sarcoma is not basically different from the polyoma and other virus tumours. However, certain characteristics of the processes induced by Rous virus (the susceptibility of the adult chicken to this virus, the permanent presence of the virus in tumour cells, the short latent period of tumour induction) make it very difficult to investigate resistance to this tumour cell antigen in its natural host—the chicken. Therefore, it was interesting to investigate the possibility of inducing resistance to the Rous sarcoma cells in a mammal."

Carr and Shimwell2 have reported the production of dark brown, water-soluble pigment by A. aceti. This communication reports the formation of a wine-red pigment by Acetobacter acetigenum in a lactate-buffered glycerol medium."

https://openalex.org/W1501565479,"IN this laboratory a method has been developed for measuring the luteotrophic activity of prolactin by the formation of deciduomata in a damaged uterine horn in the hypophysectomized adult mouse1. The decidual response was quantal and the percentage of positive responses was transformed into probits. The method was designed as a 4 or 6 point parallel line assay and results were expressed in terms of the 2nd International Standard Prolactin (ovine prolactin, Armour Lab., Lot No. D 14083–2B, potency 22 I.U./mg)."

Smith of the Massachusetts General Hospital for pointing out to me that plasma thromboplastin antecedent (factor XI) is not a vitamin K-dependent clotting protein. In a recent paper [Science 145, 926 (1964)], I had listed it along with plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), proconvertin (factor VII), and prothrombin as clotting proteins under probable genetic control by vitamin K in the mammal. Instead of PTA, I should have listed Stuart's factor (X), which appears now to be well established as a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor. ROBERT E.
