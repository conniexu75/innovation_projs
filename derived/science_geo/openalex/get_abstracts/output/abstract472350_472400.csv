https://openalex.org/W2017625070,"Appetite suppression occurs after a meal and in conditions when it is unfavourable to eat, such as during illness or exposure to toxins. A brain region proposed to play a role in appetite suppression is the parabrachial nucleus, a heterogeneous population of neurons surrounding the superior cerebellar peduncle in the brainstem. The parabrachial nucleus is thought to mediate the suppression of appetite induced by the anorectic hormones amylin and cholecystokinin, as well as by lithium chloride and lipopolysaccharide, compounds that mimic the effects of toxic foods and bacterial infections, respectively. Hyperactivity of the parabrachial nucleus is also thought to cause starvation after ablation of orexigenic agouti-related peptide neurons in adult mice. However, the identities of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that regulate feeding are unknown, as are the functionally relevant downstream projections. Here we identify calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the outer external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus that project to the laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala as forming a functionally important circuit for suppressing appetite. Using genetically encoded anatomical, optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools, we demonstrate that activation of these neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses appetite. In contrast, inhibition of these neurons increases food intake in circumstances when mice do not normally eat and prevents starvation in adult mice whose agouti-related peptide neurons are ablated. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this neural circuit from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of the amygdala mediates appetite suppression in conditions when it is unfavourable to eat. This neural circuit may provide targets for therapeutic intervention to overcome or promote appetite."
https://openalex.org/W1986829091,"HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by type I interferon (IFN), and the expression of a number of gene products with anti-HIV-1 activity is induced by type I IFN. However, none of the known antiretroviral proteins can account for the ability of type I IFN to inhibit early, preintegration phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle in human cells. Here, by comparing gene expression profiles in cell lines that differ in their ability to support the inhibitory action of IFN-α at early steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle, we identify myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2) as an interferon-induced inhibitor of HIV-1 infection. Expression of MX2 reduces permissiveness to a variety of lentiviruses, whereas depletion of MX2 using RNA interference reduces the anti-HIV-1 potency of IFN-α. HIV-1 reverse transcription proceeds normally in MX2-expressing cells, but 2-long terminal repeat circular forms of HIV-1 DNA are less abundant, suggesting that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 nuclear import, or destabilizes nuclear HIV-1 DNA. Consistent with this notion, mutations in the HIV-1 capsid protein that are known, or suspected, to alter the nuclear import pathways used by HIV-1 confer resistance to MX2, whereas preventing cell division increases MX2 potency. Overall, these findings indicate that MX2 is an effector of the anti-HIV-1 activity of type-I IFN, and suggest that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 infection by inhibiting capsid-dependent nuclear import of subviral complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2026347115,"Zhiming Cai and colleagues report whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 paired tumor-normal samples of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. They find that 32% of tumors harbor alterations in genes involved in sister chromatid cohesion, including STAG2, ESPL1, NIPBL, SMC1A and SMC3. Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) being the predominant form. Here we report a genomic analysis of TCC by both whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 99 individuals with TCC. Beyond confirming recurrent mutations in genes previously identified as being mutated in TCC, we identified additional altered genes and pathways that were implicated in TCC. Notably, we discovered frequent alterations in STAG2 and ESPL1, two genes involved in the sister chromatid cohesion and segregation (SCCS) process. Furthermore, we also detected a recurrent fusion involving FGFR3 and TACC3, another component of SCCS, by transcriptome sequencing of 42 DNA-sequenced tumors. Overall, 32 of the 99 tumors (32%) harbored genetic alterations in the SCCS process. Our analysis provides evidence that genetic alterations affecting the SCCS process may be involved in bladder tumorigenesis and identifies a new therapeutic possibility for bladder cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1982857307,"The mechanisms by which genetic variation affects transcription regulation and phenotypes at the nucleotide level are incompletely understood. Here we use natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics and transcriptional outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial genetic evidence to support the concept that lineage-determining transcription factors define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for lineage-determining transcription factors and informative histone modifications can be used for the prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants."
https://openalex.org/W1975004069,"Francisco Real and colleagues report exome sequencing in urothelial bladder tumors. They show that STAG2, a subunit of the cohesin complex, is recurrently mutated and provide evidence that STAG2 loss does not lead to increases in aneuploidy. Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is heterogeneous at the clinical, pathological and genetic levels. Tumor invasiveness (T) and grade (G) are the main factors associated with outcome and determine patient management1. A discovery exome sequencing screen (n = 17), followed by a prevalence screen (n = 60), identified new genes mutated in this tumor coding for proteins involved in chromatin modification (MLL2, ASXL2 and BPTF), cell division (STAG2, SMC1A and SMC1B) and DNA repair (ATM, ERCC2 and FANCA). STAG2, a subunit of cohesin, was significantly and commonly mutated or lost in UBC, mainly in tumors of low stage or grade, and its loss was associated with improved outcome. Loss of expression was often observed in chromosomally stable tumors, and STAG2 knockdown in bladder cancer cells did not increase aneuploidy. STAG2 reintroduction in non-expressing cells led to reduced colony formation. Our findings indicate that STAG2 is a new UBC tumor suppressor acting through mechanisms that are different from its role in preventing aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W1965550615,"Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is important in development, stem cell biology and disease. In a variety of tissues, Hh acts as a morphogen to regulate growth and cell fate specification. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain morphogen movement, one of which is transport along filopodia-like protrusions called cytonemes. Here, we analyse the mechanism underlying Hh movement in the wing disc and the abdominal epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that, in both epithelia, cells generate cytonemes in regions of Hh signalling. These protrusions are actin-based and span several cell diameters. Various Hh signalling components localize to cytonemes, as well as to punctate structures that move along cytonemes and are probably exovesicles. Using in vivo imaging, we show that cytonemes are dynamic structures and that Hh gradient establishment correlates with cytoneme formation in space and time. Indeed, mutant conditions that affect cytoneme formation reduce both cytoneme length and Hh gradient length. Our results suggest that cytoneme-mediated Hh transport is the mechanistic basis for Hh gradient formation. Hedgehog (Hh) acts as a morphogen to regulate growth and cell fate specification, and several hypotheses have been proposed for its movement. Using in vivo imaging, Bischoff and colleagues find that cytonemes drive Hh movement in the wing imaginal disc epithelium and that Hh gradient establishment correlates spatially and temporally with cytoneme formation."
https://openalex.org/W2014656523,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a cancer with rising incidence and poor survival. Most such cancers arise in a specialized intestinal metaplastic epithelium, which is diagnostic of Barrett's esophagus. In a genome-wide association study, we compared esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (n = 2,390) and individuals with precancerous Barrett's esophagus (n = 3,175) with 10,120 controls in 2 phases. For the combined case group, we identified three new associations. The first is at 19p13 (rs10419226: P = 3.6 × 10(-10)) in CRTC1 (encoding CREB-regulated transcription coactivator), whose aberrant activation has been associated with oncogenic activity. A second is at 9q22 (rs11789015: P = 1.0 × 10(-9)) in BARX1, which encodes a transcription factor important in esophageal specification. A third is at 3p14 (rs2687201: P = 5.5 × 10(-9)) near the transcription factor FOXP1, which regulates esophageal development. We also refine a previously reported association with Barrett's esophagus near the putative tumor suppressor gene FOXF1 at 16q24 and extend our findings to now include esophageal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1973736002,"Todd Waldman and colleagues screened 2,214 tumors for loss of STAG2 expression using immunohistochemistry. They followed up by sequencing STAG2 in 111 urothelial carcinomas and found mutations in 23 of the cases, identifying STAG2 as one of the most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer. Here we report the discovery of truncating mutations of the gene encoding the cohesin subunit STAG2, which regulates sister chromatid cohesion and segregation, in 36% of papillary non-invasive urothelial carcinomas and 16% of invasive urothelial carcinomas of the bladder. Our studies suggest that STAG2 has a role in controlling chromosome number but not the proliferation of bladder cancer cells. These findings identify STAG2 as one of the most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2017225012,"Long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) is a key mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzyme. We previously demonstrated increased LCAD lysine acetylation in SIRT3 knockout mice concomitant with reduced LCAD activity and reduced fatty acid oxidation. To study the effects of acetylation on LCAD and determine sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) target sites, we chemically acetylated recombinant LCAD. Acetylation impeded substrate binding and reduced catalytic efficiency. Deacetylation with recombinant SIRT3 partially restored activity. Residues Lys-318 and Lys-322 were identified as SIRT3-targeted lysines. Arginine substitutions at Lys-318 and Lys-322 prevented the acetylation-induced activity loss. Lys-318 and Lys-322 flank residues Arg-317 and Phe-320, which are conserved among all acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and coordinate the enzyme-bound FAD cofactor in the active site. We propose that acetylation at Lys-318/Lys-322 causes a conformational change which reduces hydride transfer from substrate to FAD. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase 9, two related enzymes with lysines at positions equivalent to Lys-318/Lys-322, were also efficiently deacetylated by SIRT3 following chemical acetylation. These results suggest that acetylation/deacetylation at Lys-318/Lys-322 is a mode of regulating fatty acid oxidation. The same mechanism may regulate other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W2037407219,"Apolipoproteins (apo) C-I and C-III are known to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, but the molecular mechanisms for this remain obscure. We present evidence that either apoC-I or apoC-III, when bound to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, prevent binding of LPL to the lipid/water interface. This results in decreased lipolytic activity of the enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that hydrophobic amino acid residues centrally located in the apoC-III molecule are critical for attachment to lipid emulsion particles and consequently inhibition of LPL activity. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins stabilize LPL and protect the enzyme from inactivating factors such as angiopoietin-like protein 4 (angptl4). The addition of either apoC-I or apoC-III to triglyceride-rich particles severely diminished their protective effect on LPL and rendered the enzyme more susceptible to inactivation by angptl4. These observations were seen using chylomicrons as well as the synthetic lipid emulsion Intralipid. In the presence of the LPL activator protein apoC-II, more of apoC-I or apoC-III was needed for displacement of LPL from the lipid/water interface. In conclusion, we show that apoC-I and apoC-III inhibit lipolysis by displacing LPL from lipid emulsion particles.

The enzyme hydrolyzes triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). The released fatty acids and monoglycerides are taken up in tissues for metabolic purposes or for storage. In addition, LPL is important for binding of lipoproteins to cell surfaces, and for receptor-mediated endocytosis of whole lipoprotein particles, by stimulating the interaction of lipoproteins with receptors (3Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lipoprotein lipase enhances the binding of chylomicrons to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding LPL or its cofactor apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia (4Fojo S.S. Brewer H.B.

In contrast, a premature stop mutation in apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is associated with low levels of plasma triglycerides (5Pollin T.I. Damcott C.M. Shen H. Ott S.H. Shelton J. Horenstein R.B.

The general consensus is that apoC-III increases plasma triglycerides by affecting the function of LPL, but the mechanism for this inhibitory effect is not yet resolved. In addition, apoC-III has been reported to interfere with VLDL assembly and secretion (14Sundaram M. Zhong S. Bou Khalil M. Links P.H. Zhao Y. Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. Parks R.J. Wang Y. Yao Z.

When compared with apolipoproteins of the C family, angiopoietin-like protein 4 (angptl4) is a more recently discovered modulator of LPL activity. Unlike the apolipoproteins, angptl4 causes irreversible inactivation of LPL by binding to the enzyme and converting active LPL dimers to inactive monomers (25Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 converts lipoprotein lipase to inactive monomers and modulates lipase activity in adipose tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). LPL is known to be stabilized by binding to detergents, emulsion particles, and lipoproteins. Recently, it was shown that inactivation of LPL by angptl4 is slower in the presence of lipoproteins (26Nilsson S.K. Anderson F. Ericsson M. Larsson M. Makoveichuk E. Lookene A. Heeren J.

We have used a simple filtration technique for studies of the effects of apoC-I and apoC-III on binding of LPL to lipid emulsion particles. Our data indicate that a main factor in the inhibition of LPL by these apolipoproteins is that the enzyme is expelled from the substrate. As a consequence, LPL becomes more prone to inactivation, here demonstrated by increased sensitivity to angptl4. Bovine LPL was purified from milk as described (30Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Phospholipase activity of milk lipoprotein lipase.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 125I-labeled LPL was produced by the lactoperoxidase method and then purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (31Olivecrona G.

ApoC-I and apoC-II were extracted from human plasma by absorption to Intralipid emulsion particles and then purified as described previously (34Astrup H.N. Bengtsson G. Activator proteins for lipoprotein lipase from bovine plasma: preparation by adsorption to Intralipid.Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1982; 72: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of human angptl4 (amino acids 26–184) was cloned into pET29a. Human apoC-III (amino acids 21–99) was cloned into pET23b (35Liu H. Talmud P.J. Lins L. Brasseur R. Olivecrona G.

Both proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Transfected bacteria were grown until A600 = 0.6, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h for apoC-III, and for 4 h for angptl4, at 37 °C. Cultures were centrifuged at 3200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 6 m guanidine:HCl, and 5 mm imidazole prior to freeze/thaw lysis at −80 °C. Angptl4 was purified using HisPur cobalt resin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol, under reducing conditions. The protein was eluted by 20 mm acetic acid, pH 4.0, and stored at −80 °C. ApoC-III was purified on a HisTrapTM FF crude column (GE Healthcare) using a gradient of increasing concentrations of imidazole (10 mm to 500 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl and 6 m urea. Fractions eluting late in the gradient were dialyzed against 10 mm NH4HCO3 and later frozen at −20 °C prior to lyophilization. The dried product was dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 5 m urea. Murine N-terminal angptl4 was expressed in HEK293 cells as described previously (25Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 converts lipoprotein lipase to inactive monomers and modulates lipase activity in adipose tissue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). LPL activity was measured using emulsion particles isolated from Intralipid corresponding to 1–4 mg of triglyceride/ml in 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 6% BSA (w/v), and 16.7 units of heparin/ml. Human apoC-II was used in some experiments at the concentrations given in the figure legends. Incubations were made at room temperature for 30–45 min in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, catalog number 236108) containing a total volume of 150 μl/well. The plates were gently agitated on an orbital shaker (600 rpm). Different amounts of apolipoproteins were added from stock solutions containing 5 m urea. By dilutions in the same buffer, care was taken so that all wells contained the same volume of vehicle. Lipid hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 10% Triton X-100 (v/v). Aliquots (3.5–10 μl) were transferred to another 96-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, catalog number 655101) containing 150 μl of NEFA-HR(2) R1 (Wako Chemicals) for determination of the amounts of fatty acids released (where NEFA indicates “non-esterified fatty acids”). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature by gentle agitation on the orbital shaker (600 rpm). Then 75 μl of NEFA-HR(2) R2 (Wako Chemicals) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. Fatty acids were quantified by absorbance measurements on a SpectraMax 340 (Molecular Devices) using NEFA C standard (Wako Chemicals) as reference. LPL activity is expressed in units where 1 unit corresponds to the release of 1 μmol of fatty acid/min. LPL was preincubated with emulsion particles isolated from Intralipid, corresponding to 2 mg of triglyceride/ml in 0.15 m Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 6% BSA (w/v). Preincubations were made in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc catalog number 236108) at room temperature for 15 min on an orbital shaker (600 rpm) in the presence of different combinations of apoCs and angptl4 (N-terminal domain) in a final incubation volume of 150 μl. Aliquots of 5–10 μl were then transferred to incubation mixtures containing [9,10-3H]triolein-labeled Intralipid (courtesy of Pharmacia-Upjohn and Fresenius-Kabi) corresponding to 2 mg of triglyceride/ml in 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 6% BSA (w/v), 16.7 units of heparin/ml, and 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated rat serum as source of apoC-II. The contribution of lipid substrate from the first incubation did not influence activity measurements in the second incubation, which was carried out in a final volume of 200 μl at 25 °C for 30–60 min on an orbital shaker. Released fatty acids were extracted and quantified as described previously (36Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Assay of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase.in: Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Cary, NC1992: 169-185Google Scholar). Trace amounts of 125I-labeled LPL were mixed with unlabeled LPL and added to the same incubation system (total volume 150 μl) as used for LPL activity measurements, but with washed, unlabeled Intralipid (see above). After 2 min at room temperature, 1 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.5, was added, and the mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (PALL PN4602). This filter prevented passage of large lipid emulsion particles. Radioactivity from 125I-labeled LPL was determined in the filtrate (flow-through) and was considered to represent unbound LPL. Error bars for these experiments were calculated using Gaussian approximation of mean error using Equation 1, S(x¯y¯)=Sx¯2y¯2+Sy¯2y¯4x¯2(Eq. 1) where x̄ and ȳ are mean values of the observed measurements. Sx̄ and Sȳ are mean errors for the observed measurements, respectively. To assess interaction of apoC-III with lipids, solutions of apoC-III (0.2 mg/ml of wild type and mutants) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were titrated with successive additions of liposomes made from DMPC. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco CD spectrophotometer using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell at 20 °C. Spectra were obtained by averaging three scans in the wavelength range 190–260 nm. The signal obtained from buffer only was subtracted from the spectra. Estimation of protein secondary structure was made in CDPro (37Sreerama N. Woody R.W.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar) using the CDSSTR algorithm and SDP48 as reference set. Raw data in millidegrees were converted to per residue molar absorption units (Δϵ) using Equation 2, Δϵ=θ−MRW32,980−c−1(Eq. 2) where θ is the observed raw measurement in millidegrees, MRW is the mean residual weight of the protein (molecular weight/total number of amino acid residues), c is the protein concentration in mg/ml, and l is the path length in cm. The following sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI): Homo sapiens, NP_000031.1; Mus musculus, NP_075603.1; Cavia porcellus, NP_001166386.1; Bos taurus, NP_001001175.1; Sus scrofa, NP_001002801.1; Canis lupus familiaris, NP_001003369.1; and Rattus norvegicus, NP_001257982.1. Alignments were made using ClustalW2 (38Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G.

Mutagenesis was made using QuikChange II (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions followed by DNA sequencing. For separation of active LPL dimers from inactive, presumably monomeric, forms of LPL, we used affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (25Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G.

Approximately 6 nm 125I-labeled LPL was added to 0.15 m Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 6% BSA (w/v) to a final volume of 300 μl. The samples were incubated in Eppendorf tubes at room temperature for 15 min on an orbital shaker (600 rpm), if not stated otherwise. Incubations were made in the absence and presence of 2 mg of triglyceride/ml from emulsion particles isolated from Intralipid containing either no apolipoproteins, 2 μm apoC-I, or 2 μm apoC-III. In addition, 73 nm angptl4 (N-terminal domain) was included for some experiments. After incubation, 900 μl of ice-cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol (v/v) was added, and mixtures were then filtered (PALL PN4602). A sample (500 μl) of the filtrate was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) using the ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare). A linear gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl was applied (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol) to elute the bound LPL protein. Radioactivity of each fraction was determined using a Wallac Wizard 1480 (PerkinElmer). This study was primarily designed to investigate the mechanism by which apoC-III inhibits LPL activity. The inhibition was found to be explained by the prevention of LPL from binding the lipid/water interface of lipid emulsion particles. ApoC-I was later included to investigate whether it affected LPL activity by a similar mechanism as apoC-III. For most of the studies, we used a commercial egg yolk phospholipid-stabilized emulsion of soy bean triglycerides (Intralipid) as substrate for LPL. This lipid emulsion is made to resemble triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and is used for parenteral nutrition of patients. The results with Intralipid were confirmed using rat lymph chylomicrons for some experiments. Crucial residues for lipid interaction were indentified in apoC-III by substitution of hydrophobic amino acid residues in amphipathic α-helical parts of apoC-III by alanines. Finally, the protective effect of triglyceride-rich emulsion particles on inactivation of LPL by angptl4 was investigated in the absence and presence of apoC-I and apoC-III. To investigate the mechanism for the inhibition of LPL activity by apoC-III, a filtration method was developed for rapid separation of the lipid emulsion particles from the rest of the incubation mixture. Using 125I-labeled LPL, we could demonstrate that apoC-III displaced LPL from the lipid emulsion particles in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). At a higher concentration of lipid emulsion, more apoC-III was required to observe the same displacement of LPL. A similar relationship was obtained for the inhibitory action of apoC-III on LPL activity, which also depended on the amount of lipid emulsion (Fig. 1B). We next questioned whether the inhibition of binding and activity of LPL was a feature unique for apoC-III by comparison with the effects of similar amounts of apoC-I and apoA-I. ApoC-I mimicked the effects of apoC-III by preventing LPL from binding to the large lipid emulsion particles and by inhibiting LPL activity (Fig. 1, C and D). ApoA-I had no effect on LPL displacement, nor did it inhibit LPL activity (Fig. 1, E and F). Next we investigated whether our observations regarding binding of LPL to Intralipid were applicable to a natural substrate such as rat lymph chylomicrons. As in experiments with I"
https://openalex.org/W2030224254,"LeuT, a bacterial homologue of eukaryotic biogenic amine transporters (BATs), is engineered to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by the mutation of key residues around the primary binding pocket; this mutant is able to bind several classes of antidepressant drug with high affinity, helping to define their common mechanisms of action. Neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). An X-ray crystal structure of a eukaryotic NSS is not available, hindering our understanding of the mechanism of action of these antidepressants. In this manuscript, the authors used a bacterial homologue of NSSs as a scaffold to generate a hybrid protein with a pharmacological profile very similar to that of biogenic amine transporters. They solved X-ray crystal structures of these 'LeuBAT' variants in the presence of four SSRIs, two SNRIs, a TCA and the stimulant mazindol. Even though these compounds have very different chemical structures, they all bind at the same site of LeuBAT, thereby enabling the authors to better understand how SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs bind to their eukaryotic NSS targets. The biogenic amine transporters (BATs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)1,2. Because eukaryotic BATs are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships between their structure and function3. However, because only approximately 25% of the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a promiscuous amino acid transporter4, it does not recapitulate the pharmacological properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of LeuT5,6,7 and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport5. By contrast, multiple studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we engineered LeuT to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs, SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix (TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium- and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on BATs."

Here we describe a man-made protein platform that reproduces many of the diverse functions of natural oxidoreductases without importing the complex and obscure interactions common to natural proteins. Our design is founded on an elementary, structurally stable 4-α-helix protein monomer with a minimalist interior malleable enough to accommodate various light- and redox-active cofactors and with an exterior tolerating extensive charge patterning for modulation of redox cofactor potentials and environmental interactions. Despite its modest size, the construct offers several independent domains for functional engineering that targets diverse natural activities, including dioxygen binding and superoxide and peroxide generation, interprotein electron transfer to natural cytochrome c and light-activated intraprotein energy transfer and charge separation approximating the core reactions of photosynthesis, cryptochrome and photolyase. The highly stable, readily expressible and biocompatible characteristics of these open-ended designs promise development of practical in vitro and in vivo applications."

We hypothesize that this intricate mechanism ensures homeostasis by providing epidermal stem cells with environmentally relevant temporal functional cues during the course of the day and that its perturbation may contribute to aging and carcinogenesis. Stem cells and their differentiated progeny must cope with daily variations in a number of factors that can affect their function. The nature of these elements will vary from tissue to tissue, but knowing how and when to react to them is essential to the overall fitness of tissues. For instance, while the liver must metabolize potentially harmful substances ingested during each round of feeding, the skin copes with UV radiation and pathogens in a circadian manner. Our tissues have evolved means to adapt to these changes, and most cells in our body possess an inherent and specific self-sustained clock that allows them to anticipate their behavior according to these daily fluctuations (Dibner et al., 2010Dibner C. Schibler U. Albrecht U. The mammalian circadian timing system: organization and coordination of central and peripheral clocks.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 517-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). This anticipatory clock mechanism therefore confers a functional advantage to the tissue, and decreasing its robustness reduces the overall fitness of the organism (Dibner et al., 2010Dibner C. Schibler U. Albrecht U. The mammalian circadian timing system: organization and coordination of central and peripheral clocks.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 517-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). In this sense, whole-body circadian arrhythmia in mice causes premature aging and reduces their life span (Bunger et al., 2000Bunger M.K. Wilsbacher L.D. Moran S.M. Clendenin C. Radcliffe L.A.

Although recent studies have shown that the behavior of some types of stem cells is circadian, we are still far from understanding how circadian rhythmicity contributes to their function. For instance, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) egress from their niche and enter into circulation in a circadian manner (Lucas et al., 2008Lucas D. Battista M. Shi P.A. Isola L. Frenette P.S. Mobilized hematopoietic stem cell yield depends on species-specific circadian timing.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 364-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Yet whether the circadian clock affects the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs is not known. The keratinocyte compartment of the skin also behaves according to a circadian pattern, and whole-body arrhythmic Bmal1 knockout mice show a delay in the growth phase of hair follicles (Lin et al., 2009Lin K.K. Kumar V. Geyfman M. Chudova D. Ihler A.T. Smyth P. Paus R. Takahashi J.S. Andersen B.

Clock genes, hair growth and aging.Aging (Albany, N.Y. Online). 2010; 2: 122-128PubMed Google Scholar). Circadian oscillations in the expression of signaling pathways, including Wnt and TGFβ, predispose different populations of hair follicle stem cells to remain dormant or to respond to activating cues (Janich et al., 2011Janich P. Pascual G. Merlos-Suárez A. Batlle E. Ripperger J. Albrecht U. Cheng H.Y. Obrietan K. Di Croce L. Benitah S.A. The circadian molecular clock creates epidermal stem cell heterogeneity.Nature. 2011; 480: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Perturbation of this mechanism causes a progressive change in the number of dormant hair follicle stem cells as well as age-related hair follicle cycling defects (Janich et al., 2011Janich P. Pascual G. Merlos-Suárez A. Batlle E. Ripperger J. Albrecht U. Cheng H.Y. Obrietan K. Di Croce L. Benitah S.A. The circadian molecular clock creates epidermal stem cell heterogeneity.Nature. 2011; 480: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, epidermal-specific arrhythmic mice do not show changes in the first wave of postnatal hair growth, suggesting that changes in the oscillation of systemic or niche-derived cues are likely responsible for the delay in hair follicle growth observed in complete Bmal1 knockout mice (Lin et al., 2009Lin K.K. Kumar V. Geyfman M. Chudova D. Ihler A.T. Smyth P. Paus R. Takahashi J.S. Andersen B.

USA. 2012; 109: 11758-11763Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Murine interfollicular epidermis is also under circadian control. For instance, proliferation of mouse basal epidermal cells peaks at night, whereas accumulation of ROS is antiphasic to it (Geyfman et al., 2012Geyfman M. Kumar V. Liu Q. Ruiz R. Gordon W. Espitia F. Cam E. Millar S.E. Smyth P. Ihler A. et al.Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) controls circadian cell proliferation and susceptibility to UVB-induced DNA damage in the epidermis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 11758-11763Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mouse epidermis is more susceptible to UVB radiation during the night when its cells are more proliferative, and mice significantly develop more squamous tumors when exposed to UVB in the night than during the day (Geyfman et al., 2012Geyfman M. Kumar V. Liu Q. Ruiz R. Gordon W. Espitia F. Cam E. Millar S.E. Smyth P.

By separating proliferation from the response to UVB and ROS metabolism, circadian rhythms likely protect keratinocytes from the potentially harmful situation of proliferating when exposed to UVB or when ROS levels are highest. Loss of this mechanism might be one of the causes underlying the premature aging observed in epidermal-specific circadian arrhythmic mice (Janich et al., 2011Janich P. Pascual G. Merlos-Suárez A.

A review and mathematical analysis of circadian rhythms in cell proliferation in mouse, rat, and human epidermis.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether (and if so, how) human epidermal stem cells know which is the best time for performing a specific function during the 24 hr period of the day. We have addressed this question by combining timed mRNA expression analysis of primary human keratinocytes with functional data. Our results show that, intriguingly, the expression of specific core clock genes is phase delayed within 24 hr and that this establishes successive windows of time in which epidermal stem cells are more predisposed to perform certain functions than others. These include proliferation, differentiation, and response to UV, all of which are paramount to ensure that epidermal stem cells fulfill their basic function to maintain homeostasis. We obtained the stepwise global changes in gene expression of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs), either in their stem cell state or induced to differentiate with calcium, every 5 hr during 2 consecutive days (Table S1). To synchronize the circadian rhythms, cells were given a short serum pulse for 2 hr prior to the time course of RNA collection. Expression of the core clock genes Bmal1, period1–3 (PER1–3), Nr1d1/2, and cryptochrome 1/2 (CRY1/2) confirmed that the serum pulse properly synchronized the circadian rhythm of stem cell and differentiating keratinocytes (Figures 1A and 1B ). As expected, PHKs stimulated with calcium progressively differentiated, as shown by the increased expression of differentiation markers such as involucrin (IVL), filaggrin (FLG), and Late Cornified Envelope (LCE) genes, whereas undifferentiated PHKs did not spontaneously differentiate during the time course (Figure 1A, Table S1 available online). Calcium-induced differentiation did not alter the oscillation period of core clock genes but increased the amplitude of oscillation of PER1–3 and DBP, while decreasing that of Bmal1 compared to undifferentiated cells (Figure 1C and Table S1). PER1–3 and CRY1/2 are direct transcriptional targets of BMAL1 and CLOCK. However, intriguingly, when plotted together, their peaks showed phase delays with respect to each other. For instance, the expression of PER1 and PER3 peaked approximately 20 hr after the synchronization pulse, whereas PER2 and CRY2 peaked 5 hr after PER1 and PER3 (Figure 1B). CRY1 peaked 5 hr later than PER2/CRY2, and NR1D1 and NR1D2 also showed a phase delay with respect to each other, with peaks of expression between 15 hr and 20 hr postsynchronization, respectively (Figure 1B). As expected, Bmal1 was predominantly antiphasic with its core clock targets (Figure 1B). When we plotted all these clock core genes together, an interesting pattern of concatenated oscillations emerged, whereby Bmal1 is the first to peak at around 5–10 hr postsynchronization, followed by Nr1d1 and Nr1d2 (15–20 hr), PER1/PER3 (20 hr), and subsequently by PER2/CRY2 (20–25 hr) and CRY1 (25 hr) (Figure 1D; for simplicity only one core clock gene is shown for each peak). This pattern of expression was unaffected during differentiation, further indicating that differentiation only affects the amplitude and not the period of oscillation of the core clock machinery (Figures 1B and 1D). Our analysis indicated that the core clock machinery displays successive oscillations that subdivide the day into at least five temporal intervals (i.e., those established by the peaks of NR1D1/NR1D2, PER1/3, PER2/CRY2, CRY1, and Bmal1), which we refer to as peaks A–E. We next sought to determine whether each peak defined different functional categories in both stem cell and differentiating keratinocytes. To do so, we developed a polynomial curve fitting analysis to identify cohorts of genes whose expression displayed a pattern of peaks and troughs similar to each of these clock subsets (Supplemental Information; Table S2; Figure S1). In undifferentiated PHKs, the expression of 2,013 genes correlated with the pattern of oscillation of core clock genes, distributed more or less equally at each peak (A, 374 genes; B, 454 genes; C, 695 genes; D, 575 genes; E, 415 genes; Table S2). Differentiating keratinocytes showed 2,498 genes with a similar distribution to core clock genes (A, 327 genes; B, 566 genes; C, 899 genes; D, 494 genes; E, 832 genes; Table S2) (Figure 2A). We then performed gene ontology (GO) analyses on the list of genes for each peak to obtain the biological functions represented by each (Table S3 and Table S4) (Huang et al., 2009Huang W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25346) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the mRNAs of PER1 and PER2 peak early during the morning in human epidermis, which we used as a reference point to extrapolate the approximate time of the day corresponding to each peak (Akashi et al., 2010Akashi M.

The most statistically significant biological categories represented in peak A included protein localization and regulation of transcription, cytoskeleton, cAMP metabolism, and collagen metabolic process, among others (Figure 2B and Table S3). Interestingly, these biological categories included genes previously shown to be involved in keratinocyte differentiation, such as Notch3, KLF9 (a prodifferentiation transcription factor recently shown to be circadian in human keratinocytes; Spörl et al., 2012Spörl F. Korge S. Jürchott K. Wunderskirchner M. Schellenberg K. Heins S. Specht A. Stoll C. Klemz R. Maier B. et al.Krüppel-like factor 9 is a circadian transcription factor in human epidermis that controls proliferation of keratinocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Epidermal Notch signalling: differentiation, cancer and adhesion.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Peak B in turn predominantly consisted of genes involved in calcium homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism, RNA modification, amino acid metabolism, response to vitamin D, and ribosome biogenesis, which has been recently shown to be circadian in murine liver (Jouffe et al., 2013Jouffe C. Cretenet G. Symul L. Martin E. Atger F. Naef F. Gachon F. The circadian clock coordinates ribosome biogenesis.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001455Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B). Several of these categories, such as calcium homeostasis, cholesterol metabolism, and response to vitamin D, are directly related to keratinocyte differentiation (Bikle et al., 2001Bikle D.D. Ng D. Tu C.L. Oda Y. Xie Z. Calcium- and vitamin D-regulated keratinocyte differentiation.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Table S3). This list also included NSUN2/Misu, a downstream target of Myc that poises epidermal stem cells for differentiation, and CAV1, which regulates the formation of the lamellar granules required for keratinocyte cornification (Blanco et al., 2011Blanco S. Kurowski A. Nichols J. Watt F.M. Benitah S.A. Frye M.

Dermatol. 2003; 120: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although peak C also comprised genes pertaining to calcium signaling and ribosome biogenesis, it now included genes involved in response to glucocorticoids, glucose and lipid metabolism, and (albeit with a lower statistical significance) cell cycle progression (Figure 2B). Hence, our results suggest that peaks A–C primarily correspond to a peak in expression of pathways involved in predisposing human epidermal stem cells for the onset of differentiation and the metabolic changes associated with it. Interestingly, peak D (corresponding approximately to 5–10 hr after the peaks of PER1-peak B and PER2-peak C) no longer showed genes related to keratinocyte differentiation, but rather to those involved in organization of the nuclear lumen, DNA-damage response and repair, ribosome biogenesis, mitochondrial morphogenesis, cell cycle and DNA replication, and regulation of the splicing, pigmentation, and ATP metabolism (Figure 2B). These included genes such as SSRP1, EXO1, SMC6, POLD1, RAD54B, and APRT, which are involved in the response and repair of DNA upon UV radiation, and TP63 and HELLS, both of which are required to kick-start epidermal stem cell proliferation (Sertic et al., 2011Sertic S.

Lastly, peak E comprised genes regulating endosome membrane, RNA localization, chromatin remodeling, DNA metabolism/stress response, and cell division/mitotic phase (Figure 2B). A pattern emerges from this data whereby peaks A–C, corresponding to late-night to early-morning hours, are mostly related to pathways predisposing keratinocytes to differentiate, whereas peaks D and E, representing the afternoon and evening hours, corresponded to pathways inducing DNA replication, protection to UV, and, subsequently, cell division. This overall pattern of successive peaks suggests that human epidermal stem cells proceed through functional landmarks that segregate their predisposition to respond to proproliferative and differentiation cues, while providing them with the necessary metabolism and protection against UV radiation. This pattern of functional segregation was also present in differentiating keratinocytes (Table S4), yet each peak was represented by different biological functions than those observed in the undifferentiated state. For instance, peaks D and E no longer included genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis, but contained those related to keratin filament organization and Runx1, which are required for human keratinocyte differentiation (Masse et al., 2012Masse I. Barbollat-Boutrand L. Molina M. Berthier-Vergnes O. Joly-Tonetti N. Martin M.T. Caron de Fromentel C. Kanitakis J. Lamartine J. Functional interplay between p63 and p53 controls RUNX1 function in the transition from proliferation to differentiation in human keratinocytes.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e318Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). In addition, the category of defense response was only represented in the GO analysis of differentiating keratinocytes, consistent with their role in establishing the protective defense barrier. Interestingly, the fact that UV radiation was also present in both data sets suggests that epidermal keratinocytes, whether undifferentiated or differentiated, remain vigilant from this harmful radiation in a circadian manner. Several pathways involved in epidermal homeostasis were represented in our analysis, including TGFβ, Notch, BMP, Wnt, and calcium signaling (Figure 3A and Table S2). The expression of genes important for epidermal stem cell quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation, such as LRIG1, TP63, and ITGB4, also peaked at a specific time of the day (Figure 3A). Some members of the calcium, TGFβ, and Notch pathways also showed time-of-the-day differences in their expression in murine basal epidermal keratinocytes, indicating that their daytime-dependent expression is conserved between mice and human (Figure S3A). We next sought to test whether the timed changes in the expression of these genes translated into functional differences regarding the predisposition of PHKs to respond to these cues. We concentrated on two pathways, calcium and TGFβ, as they constitute two major signals driving PHK differentiation. Our results predict that undifferentiated PHKs would be more predisposed to respond to both cues during peaks B–C, corresponding to the late night-morning hours (Figures 1D and 2B). To test this, we synchronized the circadian rhythm of undifferentiated PHKs and then stimulated them with TGFβ or calcium at 12 or 24 hr postsynchronization, corresponding to the summits of peaks E and B–C, respectively. We then collected RNA 4 hr after stimulation to evaluate the response of the cells to each stimulus by measuring the expression levels of IVL and transglutaminase 2, known calcium and TGFβ target genes (Honma et al., 2006Honma M. Stubbs M. Collins I. Workman P. Aherne W. Watt F.M. Identification of novel keratinocyte differentiation modulating compounds by high-throughput screening.J. Biomol.

Expression profiling of genes regulated by TGF-beta: differential regulation in normal and tumour cells.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PHKs responded more efficiently to both cues 24 hr postsynchronization than at 12 hr, coinciding with the behavior predicted from our peak analysis (Figure 3B). This enhanced response was also evident by the increased expression of IVL within the colonies and by the enlarged cell size associated with differentiation (Figure 3C). Calcium- and TGFβ-induced differentiation of PHKs progressively increased between the trough and the peak, further demonstrating that they depend on an oscillatory mechanism (Figure S3B). We next verified whether increasing and sustaining the expression of PER1 or PER2 would affect the predisposition of PHKs to differentiate. For this, we overexpressed PER1 or PER2 in undifferentiated PHKs (Figure 4A) and confirmed that their overexpression perturbed their circadian rhythm (Figures S4A and S4B). PHKs overexpressing PER1 or PER2 spontaneously differentiated as shown by a significantly reduced clonogenic capacity (Figure 4B) and an increased expression of the differentiation markers IVL and loricrin (Figure 4C). We also performed an in vivo competition assay based on an orthotopic method of transplantation of PHKs in immunodeficient mice. Three different transplants were established: (1) a 1:1 mixture of PHKs tagged either with mCherry or GFP; (2) a 1:1 mixture of control mCherry cells and PER1-overexpressing GFP cells; and (3) a 1:1 mixture of control mCherry cells and PER2-overexpressing GFP cells (Figure 4D). In each instance, control cells contributed to the basal layer in a stable manner, and columns of tagged basal and suprabasal cells were visible throughout the transplants. On the other hand, PHKs overexpressing PER1 or PER2 only located at the uppermost suprabasal differentiated layers (Figure 4D). Endogenous expression PER2 at the mRNA and protein level increases upon knockdown of CRY1 and CRY2 (Figures 4E and 4F; Dibner et al., 2010Dibner C. Schibler U. Albrecht U. The mammalian circadian timing system: organization and coordination of central and peripheral clocks.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 517-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Consequently, PHKs with lower levels of CRY1 and CRY2 spontaneously differentiated, determined by their cellular morphology, decreased clonogenic potential, and higher expression of IVL than control cells (Figures 4G and 4H). Our results indicate that the oscillation of the core clock transcriptional machinery consists of successive waves along the 24 hr of the day. Intriguingly, these phase shifts of 4–5 hr define a continuum of functional landmarks that segregate vital functions of keratinocytes. They predispose undifferentiated keratinocytes to respond to differentiation cues between the late-night and morning transition. Subsequently, during the hours of exposure to light, two different and consecutive cohorts of genes predominantly involved in protection from UV and in inducing proliferation reach their zenith. Thus, human keratinocytes anticipate their protection against UV at the time when they are more prone to duplicate their DNA and more susceptible to radiation-induced DNA damage. During the evening-night transition, keratinocytes then become predisposed to undergo mitosis, but also start to express genes involved in the onset of differentiation, thereby establishing the beginning of a new cycle. Calcium-induced differentiation of keratinocytes maintained the period of the oscillations of core clock genes, although the amplitude of the negative limb of the clock was increased. The molecular and functional reasons underlying this change in amplitude are currently unknown, but previous works have shown that activation of calcium signaling directly increases the expression of PER1 and PER2 in brain cells (Nomura et al., 2003Nomura K.

https://openalex.org/W2060821973,"Synaptic vesicle fusion during neurotransmitter release is mediated by assembly of SNARE- and SM-protein complexes composed of syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2, and Munc18-1. Current models suggest that SNARE-complex assembly catalyzes membrane fusion by pulling the transmembrane regions (TMRs) of SNARE proteins together, thus allowing their TMRs to form a fusion pore. These models are consistent with the requirement for TMRs in viral fusion proteins. However, the role of the SNARE TMRs in synaptic vesicle fusion has not yet been tested physiologically. Here, we examined whether synaptic SNAREs require TMRs for catalysis of synaptic vesicle fusion, which was monitored electrophysiologically at millisecond time resolution. Surprisingly, we find that both lipid-anchored syntaxin-1 and lipid-anchored synaptobrevin-2 lacking TMRs efficiently promoted spontaneous and Ca(2+)-triggered membrane fusion. Our data suggest that SNARE proteins function during fusion primarily as force generators, consistent with the notion that forcing lipid membranes close together suffices to induce membrane fusion."

Characterizing new drugs and chemical probes of biological systems is hindered by difficulties in identifying the mechanism of action (MOA) of biologically active molecules. Here we present a metabolite suppression approach to explore the MOA of antibacterial compounds under nutrient restriction. We assembled an array of metabolites that can be screened for suppressors of inhibitory molecules. Further, we identified inhibitors of Escherichia coli growth under nutrient limitation and charted their interactions with our metabolite array. This strategy led to the discovery and characterization of three new antibacterial compounds, MAC168425, MAC173979 and MAC13772. We showed that MAC168425 interferes with glycine metabolism, MAC173979 is a time-dependent inhibitor of p-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis and MAC13772 inhibits biotin biosynthesis. We conclude that metabolite suppression profiling is an effective approach to focus MOA studies on compounds impairing metabolic capabilities. Such bioactives can serve as chemical probes of bacterial physiology and as leads for antibacterial drug development."

Here we provide evidence that human Tim-3 is a target of A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-mediated ectodomain shedding resulting in a soluble form of Tim-3. We identified ADAM10 and ADAM17 as major sheddases of Tim-3 as shown by ADAM-specific inhibitors and the ADAM10 pro-domain in HEK293 cells and ADAM10/ADAM17-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts. PMA-induced shedding of Tim-3 was abrogated by deletion of amino acids Glu(181)-Asp(190) of the stalk region and Tim-3 lacking the intracellular domain was not efficiently cleaved after PMA stimulation. Surprisingly, a single lysine residue within the intracellular domain rescues shedding of Tim-3. Shedding of endogenous Tim-3 was found in primary human CD14(+) monocytes after PMA and ionomycin stimulation. Importantly, the recently described down-regulation of Tim-3 from Toll-like receptor-activated CD14(+) monocytes was caused by ADAM10- and ADAM17-mediated shedding. Inhibition of Tim-3 shedding from lipopolysaccharide-induced monocytes did not influence lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFα and IL-6 but increases IL-12 expression. In summary, we describe Tim-3 as novel target for ADAM-mediated ectodomain shedding and suggest a role of Tim-3 shedding in TLR-mediated immune responses of CD14(+) monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2065602008,"Autophagy and apoptosis regulate cancer cell viability in response to cytotoxic stress; however, their functional relationship remains unclear. p62/sequestosome 1 is a multifunctional protein and a signaling hub that shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to the lysosome during autophagy. Autophagy inhibition up-regulates p62, and prior data suggest that p62 may mediate apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that p62 can regulate a caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in response to the BH3 mimetic agent, ABT-263. Up-regulation of p62 was shown to enhance ABT-263-induced caspase-8 activation that was Bax-dependent and resulted from mitochondrial amplification. Dependence upon caspase-8 was confirmed using caspase-8-deficient cells and by caspase-8 siRNA. Ectopic wild-type p62, but not p62 mutants with loss of ability to promote apoptosis, was shown to co-localize with caspase-8 and to promote its self-aggregation in ABT-263-treated cells, shown using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Endogenous p62 co-localized with caspase-8 in the presence of ABT-263 plus an autophagy inhibitor. Caspase-8 was shown to interact and co-localize with the autophagosome marker, LC3II. Knockdown of p62 attenuated binding between caspase-8 and LC3II, whereas p62 overexpression enhanced the co-localization of caspase-8 aggregates with LC3. LC3 knockdown did not affect interaction between caspase-8 and p62, suggesting that p62 may facilitate caspase-8 translocation to the autophagosomal membrane. A direct activator of caspase-8, i.e., TRAIL, alone or combined with ABT-263, induced caspase-8 aggregation and co-localization with p62 that was associated with a synergistic drug interaction. Together, these results demonstrate that up-regulation of p62 can mediate apoptosis via caspase-8 in the setting of autophagy inhibition."

Disruption of the Na/K-ATPase·c-Src signaling complex attenuated ouabain-stimulated protein carbonylation. Ouabain-stimulated protein carbonylation is reversed after removal of ouabain, and this reversibility is largely independent of de novo protein synthesis and degradation by either the lysosome or the proteasome pathways. Furthermore, ouabain stimulated direct carbonylation of two amino acid residues in the actuator domain of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit. Taken together, the data indicate that carbonylation modification of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit is involved in a feed-forward mechanism of regulation of ouabain-mediated renal proximal tubule Na/K-ATPase signal transduction and subsequent sodium transport."

https://openalex.org/W2071150768,"The authors show that type 2 dopamine receptors (D2Rs) negatively regulate spine morphogenesis in the hippocampi of adolescent mice. Spine deficiency resulting from D2R overactivation was associated with dysconnectivity in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit and working memory deficits. These phenotypes could be rescued by D2R antagonists given during adolescence. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are G protein–coupled receptors that modulate synaptic transmission and are important for various brain functions, including learning and working memory. Abnormal D2R signaling has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Here we report a new function of D2R in dendritic spine morphogenesis. Activation of D2R reduced spine number via GluN2B- and cAMP-dependent mechanisms in mice. Notably, this regulation occurred only during adolescence. During this period, D2R overactivation caused by mutations in the schizophrenia risk gene Dtnbp1 led to spine deficiency, dysconnectivity in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit and impairment of spatial working memory. Notably, these defects could be ameliorated by D2R blockers administered during adolescence. Our findings suggest an age-dependent function of D2R in spine development, provide evidence that D2R dysfunction during adolescence impairs neuronal circuits and working memory, and indicate that adolescent interventions to prevent aberrant D2R activity protect against cognitive impairment."

https://openalex.org/W1968375872,"Dysregulation of cell surface proteolysis has been strongly implicated in tumorigenicity and metastasis. In this study, we delineated the role of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) in prostate cancer (PCa) cell migration, invasion, tumorigenicity and metastasis using a human PCa progression model (103E, N1, and N2 cells) and xenograft models. N1 and N2 cells were established through serial intraprostatic propagation of 103E human PCa cells and isolation of the metastatic cells from nearby lymph nodes. The invasion capability of these cells was revealed to gradually increase throughout the serial isolations (103E<N1<N2). In this series of cells, the expression of HAI-2 but not HAI-1 was significantly decreased throughout the progression and occurred in parallel with increased activation of matriptase. The expression level and activity of matriptase increased whereas the HAI-2 protein level decreased over the course of orthotopic tumor growth in mice, which was consistent with the immunohistochemical profiles of matriptase and HAI-2 in archival PCa specimens. Knockdown of matriptase reduced the PCa cell invasion induced by HAI-2 knockdown. HAI-2 overexpression or matriptase silencing in N2 cells downregulated matriptase activity and significantly decreased tumorigenicity and metastatic capability in orthotopically xenografted mice. These results suggest that during the progression of human PCa, matriptase activity is primarily controlled by HAI-2 expression. The imbalance between HAI-2 and matriptase expression led to matriptase activation, thereby increasing cell migration, invasion, tumorigenicity and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1964463805,"Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) participate in the formation of macromolecular signaling complexes that include protein kinases, ion channels, effector enzymes, and G-protein-coupled receptors. We examined the role of AKAP79/150 (AKAP5) in trafficking and signaling of the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR). shRNA-mediated down-regulation of AKAP5 in HEK-293 cells inhibited the recycling of the β1-AR. Recycling of the β1-AR in AKAP5 knockdown cells was rescued by shRNA-resistant AKAP5. However, truncated mutants of AKAP5 with deletions in the domains involved in membrane targeting or in binding to calcineurin or PKA failed to restore the recycling of the β1-AR, indicating that full-length AKAP5 was required. Furthermore, recycling of the β1-AR in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes was dependent on targeting the AKAP5-PKA complex to the C-terminal tail of the β1-AR. To analyze the role of AKAP5 more directly, recycling of the β1-AR was determined in ventricular myocytes from AKAP5(-/-) mice. In AKAP5(-/-) myocytes, the agonist-internalized β1-AR did not recycle, except when full-length AKAP5 was reintroduced. These data indicate that AKAP5 exerted specific and profound effects on β1-AR recycling in mammalian cells. Biochemical or real time FRET-based imaging of cyclic AMP revealed that deletion of AKAP5 sensitized the cardiac β1-AR signaling pathway to isoproterenol. Moreover, isoproterenol-mediated increase in contraction rate, surface area, or expression of β-myosin heavy chains was significantly greater in AKAP5(-/-) myocytes than in AKAP5(+/+) myocytes. These results indicate a significant role for the AKAP5 scaffold in signaling and trafficking of the β1-AR in cardiac myocytes and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2166228256,"The central pathway for controlling red cell mass is the PHD (prolyl hydroxylase domain protein):hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIF, which is negatively regulated by PHD, activates numerous genes, including ones involved in erythropoiesis, such as the ERYTHROPOIETIN (EPO) gene. Recent studies have implicated PHD2 as the key PHD isoform regulating red cell mass. Studies of humans have identified erythrocytosis-associated, heterozygous point mutations in the PHD2 gene. A key question concerns the mechanism by which human mutations lead to phenotypes. In the present report, we generated and characterized a mouse line in which a P294R knock-in mutation has been introduced into the mouse Phd2 locus to model the first reported human PHD2 mutation (P317R). Phd2(P294R/+) mice display a degree of erythrocytosis equivalent to that seen in Phd2(+/-) mice. The Phd2(P294R/+)-associated erythrocytosis is reversed in a Hif2a(+/-), but not a Hif1a(+/-) background. Additional studies using various conditional knock-outs of Phd2 reveal that erythrocytosis can be induced by homozygous and heterozygous knock-out of Phd2 in renal cortical interstitial cells using a Pax3-Cre transgene or by homozygous knock-out of Phd2 in hematopoietic progenitors driven by a Vav1-Cre transgene. These studies formally prove that a missense mutation in PHD2 is the cause of the erythrocytosis, show that this occurs through haploinsufficiency, and point to multifactorial control of red cell mass by PHD2."

P-protein from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is an α2 homodimer with high homology to eukaryotic P-proteins. The crystal structure of the apoenzyme shows the C terminus locked in a closed conformation by a disulfide bond between Cys972 in the C terminus and Cys353 located in the active site.

Variants produced by substitution of Cys972 and Cys353 by Ser using site-directed mutagenesis have distinctly lower specific activities, supporting the crucial role of these highly conserved redox-sensitive amino acid residues for P-protein activity. Reduction of the 353–972 disulfide releases the C terminus and allows access to the active site.

In addition to the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent P-protein, GCS requires two more enzymes, namely the tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent T-protein (EC 2.1.2.10; aminomethyltransferase) and the NAD+-dependent L-protein (EC 1.8.1.4; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase). As the fourth component, a small lipoylated protein, the H-protein (initially named hydrogen carrier protein) interacts successively via its lipoyl arm with the P-, T-, and L-proteins (Fig. 1). The GCS reaction cycle comprises three reactions. First, in a transaldimination reaction (11Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. Mechanistic, structural, and evolutionary considerations.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), glycine reacts with the PLP on the P-protein to form an external aldimine that loses the carboxyl group as CO2 and donates the remaining aminomethylene moiety to the oxidized lipoamide arm of H-protein. Next, T-protein uses the S-aminomethyl-dihydrolipoyl H-protein and THF to produce CH2-THF, ammonia, and dihydrolipoyl H-protein. Finally, L-protein closes the GCS reaction cycle by the NAD+-dependent reoxidation of the H-protein's dihydrolipoyl arm to the dithiolane form (reviewed in Refs. 12Douce R. Bourguignon J.

Sci. 2008; 84: 246-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). As a result, one molecule each of glycine, THF, and NAD+ is converted into CO2, NH3, CH2-THF, and NADH. The produced CH2-THF is used as a one-carbon donor in a variety of biosynthetic pathways, including the synthesis of serine and of S-adenosylmethionine as another universal one-carbon donor (reviewed in Ref. 14Hanson A.D. Roje S. One-carbon metabolism in higher plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ by the mitochondrial electron chain with or without subsequent ATP production (15Bykova N.V. Keerberg O. Pärnik T. Bauwe H. Gardeström P. Interaction between photorespiration and respiration in transgenic potato plants with antisense reduction in glycine decarboxylase.Planta. 2005; 222: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous occurrence of GCS already indicates its crucial importance for cellular metabolism. Indeed, the absence of or malfunction of GCS results in fatal metabolic dysfunctions, at least in eukaryotes. In humans, for example, such defects cause the inborn disease glycine encephalopathy (nonketotic hyperglycinemia), which leads to accumulation of glycine in the central nervous system. This terminal disease very often results from mutations in the P-protein-encoding gene (16Kanno J. Hutchin T. Kamada F. Narisawa A. Aoki Y. Matsubara Y. Kure S. Genomic deletion within GLDC is a major cause of non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia.J. Med. Genet. 2007; 44: e69Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but can also be due to defective T-protein or H-protein genes (17Kure S. Mandel H. Rolland M.O. Sakata Y. Shinka T. Drugan A. Boneh A. Tada K. Matsubara Y. Narisawa K. A missense mutation (His42Arg) in the T-protein gene from a large Israeli-Arab kindred with non-ketotic hyperglycinemia.Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In plants, the artificial deletion of the two P-protein genes was lethal for seedlings of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana during or shortly after germination (18Engel N. van den Daele K. Kolukisaoglu U. Morgenthal K. Weckwerth W. Pärnik T. Keerberg O. Bauwe H. Deletion of glycine decarboxylase in Arabidopsis is lethal under non-photorespiratory conditions.Plant Physiol. 2007; 144: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Plants generate very large daily amounts of glycine in the photorespiratory cycle, an essential complement to the photosynthetic Calvin-Benson cycle (reviewed in Ref. 19Bauwe H. Hagemann M. Fernie A.R. Photorespiration. Players, partners and origin.Trends Plant Sci. 2010; 15: 330-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This particular metabolic pathway requires a very high glycine-decarboxylating activity. Therefore, the GCS proteins amount to more than 30% of total matrix protein in green leaf mitochondria (20Oliver D.J. Neuburger M. Bourguignon J. Douce R. Interaction between the component enzymes of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex.Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the artificial reduction of leaf GCS activity distinctly impairs the growth of plants in air (21Heineke D. Bykova N. Gardeström P. Bauwe H. Metabolic response of potato plants to an antisense reduction of the P-protein of glycine decarboxylase.Planta. 2001; 212: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas an increased GCS activity resulted in an improved growth (22Timm S. Florian A. Arrivault S. Stitt M. Fernie A.R. Bauwe H. Glycine decarboxylase controls photosynthesis and plant growth.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 3692-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Deletion of GCS in cyanobacteria, the predecessors of plant chloroplasts, is less catastrophic (23Hagemann M. Vinnemeier J. Oberpichler I. Boldt R. Bauwe H. The glycine decarboxylase complex is not essential for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.Plant Biol. 2005; 7: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such mutants also accumulate glycine, which is somewhat toxic due to chelation of magnesium ions, but a bypass to the GCS reaction, the glycerate pathway, allows nearly normal growth (24Eisenhut M. Bauwe H. Hagemann M. Glycine accumulation is toxic for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, but can be compensated by supplementation with magnesium ions.FEMS Microbiol.

It has been suggested that the animal and plant GCS proteins form a labile enzyme complex loosely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (e.g. see Refs. 13Kikuchi G. Motokawa Y. Yoshida T.

We also present structures of ternary complexes with the cofactor PLP and the substrate glycine. Based on the structural information, three cysteine residues that are potentially involved in redox-dependent regulation of P-protein and hence GCS activity were replaced by site-specific mutagenesis, and the P-protein variants were compared with the wild-type protein in biochemical assays. The P-protein gene (slr0293) from Synechocystis was cloned in the bacterial overexpression vector pBAD-slr0293, expressed, and purified as described elsewhere (38Hasse D. Mikkat S. Thrun H.A.

After circularization and multiplication in E. coli strain LMG194, the nucleotide sequence was confirmed for the regions between the restriction sites below. From the circularized plasmids carrying the mutation in Cys353, an XhoI-Bsp1407I fragment was excised and used to replace the corresponding sequence in the above mentioned wild-type slr0293 overexpression vector. Correspondingly, Bsp1407I-PvuII fragments carrying the individual or combined mutations in Cys972 and Cys974 were used to introduce these mutations into the wild-type overexpression vector or the C353S variant.

Standard assays at 30 °C contained 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.1 mm PLP, 18 mm glycine, 1 mm or zero DTT, 18.5 μm H-protein, 0.6 μm P-protein dimer, and 3 mm NaH14CO3 (1.62 μCi) in a total volume of 300 μl for each time point. All enzyme assays were done in triplicates and repeated at least once with independent protein preparations. Immediately after starting the reactions by the addition of NaH14CO3 and every 10 min thereafter for a total time of 40 min, aliquots of 250 μl were mixed with 80 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. These samples were dried overnight to remove remaining NaH14CO3, dissolved in 500 μl of water, and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter following a standard protocol. Rates were corrected by control reactions without glycine for all time points. The crystallization of the apo-P-protein has been described elsewhere (40Hasse D. Hagemann M. Andersson I. Bauwe H.

The subunits have been arbitrarily labeled by the chain identifications A and B in the coordinate files.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the binary complex with PLP were used to prepare ligand complexes by soaking crystals at 20 °C in solutions of the ligand. Glycine (1.5 μl, 3 m) was added to the drop containing the crystal (initial drop size 5 μl). After 60 min, the crystal was transferred for a few seconds to a cryosolution containing 0.3 m glycine, 17.5% ethylene glycol, 1.6 m (NH4)3PO4, 5 mm TCEP, 0.2 mm PLP; transferred to a nylon CryoLoop (Hampton Research); and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and maintained at 100 K for data collection. Alternatively, lipoic acid (50 mg ml−1 in ethanol) was added to the drop prior to the addition of 1.5 μl of 3 m glycine. Soaking and flash-cooling were performed as described previously. X-ray diffraction data for the apoenzyme (without PLP) were collected to 2.0 Å resolution on a CCD detector (ADSC Q315r) at beam line ID14-4, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) at a wavelength of 0.98 Å.

However, its mechanism of action remains elusive. Whereas human cathepsin V exhibits a potent elastolytic activity, the structurally homologous cathepsin L, which shares a 78% amino acid sequence, has only a minimal proteolytic activity toward insoluble elastin. This suggests that there are distinct structural domains that play an important role in elastinolysis. In this study, a total of 11 chimeras of cathepsins V and L were generated to identify elastin-binding domains in cathepsin V. Evaluation of these chimeras revealed two exosites contributing to the elastolytic activity of cathepsin V that are distant from the active cleft of the protease and are located in surface loop regions. Replacement of exosite 1 or 2 with analogous residues from cathepsin L led to a 75 and 43% loss in the elastolytic activity, respectively. Replacement of both exosites yielded a non-elastase variant similar to that of cathepsin L. Identification of these exosites may contribute to the design of inhibitors that will only affect the elastolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins without interfering with other physiological protease functions.

https://openalex.org/W1995306114,"Anion exchanger 1 (AE1; Band 3; SLC4A1) is the founding member of the solute carrier 4 (SLC4) family of bicarbonate transporters that includes chloride/bicarbonate AEs and Na(+)-bicarbonate co-transporters (NBCs). These membrane proteins consist of an amino-terminal cytosolic domain involved in protein interactions and a carboxyl-terminal membrane domain that carries out the transport function. Mutation of a conserved arginine residue (R298S) in the cytosolic domain of NBCe1 (SLC4A4) is linked to proximal renal tubular acidosis and results in impaired transport function, suggesting that the cytosolic domain plays a role in substrate permeation. Introduction of single and double mutations at the equivalent arginine (Arg(283)) and at an interacting glutamate (Glu(85)) in the cytosolic domain of human AE1 (cdAE1) had no effect on the cell surface expression or the transport activity of AE1 expressed in HEK-293 cells. In addition, the membrane domain of AE1 (mdAE1) efficiently mediated anion transport. A 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of cdΔ54AE1 (residues 55-356 of cdAE1) lacking the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal disordered regions, produced at physiological pH, revealed an extensive hydrogen-bonded network involving Arg(283) and Glu(85). Mutations at these residues affected the pH-dependent conformational changes and stability of cdΔ54AE1. As these structural alterations did not impair functional expression of AE1, the cytosolic and membrane domains operate independently. A substrate access tunnel within the cytosolic domain is not present in AE1 and therefore is not an essential feature of the SLC4 family of bicarbonate transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1992054755,"p53 and its major E3 ligase Mdm2 are both ubiquitinated and targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Despite the importance of this in regulating the p53 pathway, little is known about the mechanisms of proteasomal recognition of ubiquitinated p53 and Mdm2. In this study, we show that knockdown of the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor S5a/PSMD4/Rpn10 inhibits p53 protein degradation and results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53. Overexpression of a dominant-negative deletion of S5a lacking its ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM)s, but which can be incorporated into the proteasome, also causes the stabilization of p53. Furthermore, small-interferring RNA (siRNA) rescue experiments confirm that the UIMs of S5a are required for the maintenance of low p53 levels. These observations indicate that S5a participates in the recognition of ubiquitinated p53 by the proteasome. In contrast, targeting S5a has no effect on the rate of degradation of Mdm2, indicating that proteasomal recognition of Mdm2 can be mediated by an S5a-independent pathway. S5a knockdown results in an increase in the transcriptional activity of p53. The selective stabilization of p53 and not Mdm2 provides a mechanism for p53 activation. Depletion of S5a causes a p53-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, demonstrating that p53 can have a dominant role in the response to targeting S5a. This study provides evidence for alternative pathways of proteasomal recognition of p53 and Mdm2. Differences in recognition by the proteasome could provide a means to modulate the relative stability of p53 and Mdm2 in response to cellular signals. In addition, they could be exploited for p53-activating therapies. This work shows that the degradation of proteins by the proteasome can be selectively dependent on S5a in human cells, and that this selectivity can extend to an E3 ubiquitin ligase and its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2042725548,"The MYB gene is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and contributes to leukemogenesis in several species including humans. Although it is clear that MYB can promote proliferation, suppress apoptosis and block differentiation, the identities of the MYB target genes that mediate these effects have only been partially elucidated. Several studies, including our own, have collectively identified substantial numbers of MYB target genes, including candidates for each of these activities; however, functional validation, particularly in the case of differentiation suppression, has lagged well behind. Here we show that GFI1, which encodes an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and granulocytic differentiation, is a direct target of MYB in myeloid leukemia cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter studies identified a functional MYB-binding site in the promoter region of GFI, whereas ectopic expression and small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYB resulted in concomitant increases and decreases, respectively, in GFI1 expression. We also demonstrate that GFI1, like MYB, can block the induced monocytic differentiation of a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, and most importantly, that GFI1 is essential for MYB's ability to block monocytic differentiation. Thus, we have identified a target of MYB that is a likely mediator of its myeloid differentiation-blocking activity, and which may also be involved in MYB's activities in regulating normal HSC function and myeloid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2051427284,"We report that a localized intracellular and extracellular Ca(2+) mobilization occurs at the site of microscopic epithelial damage in vivo and is required to mediate tissue repair. Intravital confocal/two-photon microscopy continuously imaged the surgically exposed stomach mucosa of anesthetized mice while photodamage of gastric epithelial surface cells created a microscopic lesion that healed within 15 min. Transgenic mice with an intracellular Ca(2+)-sensitive protein (yellow cameleon 3.0) report that intracellular Ca(2+) selectively increases in restituting gastric epithelial cells adjacent to the damaged cells. Pretreatment with U-73122, indomethacin, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane, or verapamil inhibits repair of the damage and also inhibits the intracellular Ca(2+) increase. Confocal imaging of Fura-Red dye in luminal superfusate shows a localized extracellular Ca(2+) increase at the gastric surface adjacent to the damage that temporally follows intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. Indomethacin and verapamil also inhibit the luminal Ca(2+) increase. Intracellular Ca(2+) chelation (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl ester, BAPTA/AM) fully inhibits intracellular and luminal Ca(2+) increases, whereas luminal calcium chelation (N-(2-hydroxyetheyl)-ethylendiamin-N,N,N'-triacetic acid trisodium, HEDTA) blocks the increase of luminal Ca(2+) and unevenly inhibits late-phase intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. Both modes of Ca(2+) chelation slow gastric repair. In plasma membrane Ca-ATPase 1(+/-) mice, but not plasma membrane Ca-ATPase 4(-/-) mice, there is slowed epithelial repair and a diminished gastric surface Ca(2+) increase. We conclude that endogenous Ca(2+), mobilized by signaling pathways and transmembrane Ca(2+) transport, causes increased Ca(2+) levels at the epithelial damage site that are essential to gastric epithelial cell restitution in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2039668015,"PU.1 downregulation within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the primary mechanism for the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice with homozygous deletion of the upstream regulatory element (URE) of PU.1 gene. p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor that is often mutated in human hematologic malignancies including AML and adds to their aggressiveness; however, its genetic deletion does not cause AML in mouse. Deletion of p53 in the PU.1ure/ure mice (PU.1ure/urep53−/−) results in more aggressive AML with shortened overall survival. PU.1ure/urep53−/− progenitors express significantly lower PU.1 levels. In addition to URE deletion we searched for other mechanisms that in the absence of p53 contribute to decreased PU.1 levels in PU.1ure/urep53−/− mice. We found involvement of Myb and miR-155 in downregulation of PU.1 in aggressive murine AML. Upon inhibition of either Myb or miR-155 in vitro the AML progenitors restore PU.1 levels and lose leukemic cell growth similarly to PU.1 rescue. The MYB/miR-155/PU.1 axis is a target of p53 and is activated early after p53 loss as indicated by transient p53 knockdown. Furthermore, deregulation of both MYB and miR-155 coupled with PU.1 downregulation was observed in human AML, suggesting that MYB/miR-155/PU.1 mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of AML and its aggressiveness characterized by p53 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2167495833,"The purpose of this study was the generation of central nervous system (CNS)-excluded cannabinoid receptor agonists to test the hypothesis that inhibition of spasticity, due to CNS autoimmunity, could be controlled by affecting neurotransmission within the periphery. Procedures included identification of chemicals and modeling to predict the mode of exclusion; induction and control of spasticity in the ABH mouse model of multiple sclerosis; conditional deletion of CB1 receptor in peripheral nerves; side-effect profiling to demonstrate the mechanism of CNS-exclusion via drug pumps; genome-wide association study in N2(129×ABH) backcross to map polymorphic cannabinoid drug pump; and sequencing and detection of cannabinoid drug-pump activity in human brain endothelial cell lines. Three drugs (CT3, SAB378 and SAD448) were identified that control spasticity via action on the peripheral nerve CB1 receptor. These were peripherally restricted via drug pumps that limit the CNS side effects (hypothermia) of cannabinoids to increase the therapeutic window. A cannabinoid drug pump is polymorphic and functionally lacking in many laboratory (C57BL/6, 129, CD-1) mice used for transgenesis, pharmacology, and toxicology studies. This phenotype was mapped and controlled by 1-3 genetic loci. ABCC1 within a cluster showing linkage is a cannabinoid CNS-drug pump. Global and conditional CB1 receptor-knockout mice were used as controls. In summary, CNS-excluded CB1 receptor agonists are a novel class of therapeutic agent for spasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2045993352,"Akt is constitutively activated in up to 70% of human melanomas and has an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, little is known about protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate it in melanoma cells. Here we report that suppression of pleckstrin homology domain and leucine-rich repeat Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) by DNA methylation promotes Akt activation and has an oncogenic role in melanoma. While it is commonly downregulated, overexpression of PHLPP1 reduces Akt activation and inhibits melanoma cell proliferation in vitro, and retards melanoma growth in a xenograft model. In contrast, knockdown of PHLPP1 increases Akt activation, enhances melanoma cell and melanocyte proliferation, and results in anchorage-independent growth of melanocytes. Suppression of PHLPP1 involves blockade of binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the PHLPP1 promoter. Collectively, these results suggest that suppression of PHLPP1 by DNA methylation contributes to melanoma development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2033765269,"The processes that control the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer remain poorly understood. Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) overexpression is common in DCIS, as is disruption of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) pathway. Here, we examined the cooperative impact of ErbB2 and RB deregulation on facets of disease progression. Our studies demonstrate that RB deficiency altered the expression of key molecules needed for proper cellular organization and epithelial cell–cell adhesion as part of a program related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). An increase in the invasive potential of ErbB2-overexpressing cells was observed upon RB depletion. Further, stable knockdown of RB resulted in invasive lesions in orthotopic xenograft assays, compared with DCIS-like lesions developing from RB-proficient cells. Conversely, the invasive phenotype observed in ErbB2-positive cancer models was inhibited through CDK4/6 inhibition in an RB-dependent manner. Finally, in a cohort of DCIS cases, we show that, although elevated levels of ErbB2 are associated with increased risk of a subsequent DCIS recurrence, it is not associated with progression to invasive disease. In contrast, RB loss in ErbB2-positive DCIS cases was associated with increased risk for invasive breast cancer. Taken together, these data demonstrate a key role for the RB pathway in invasion associated with breast tumor progression, and shed light on the key molecular events that promote the progression of DCIS to invasive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2007917710,"Resource pulses in the world's hot deserts are driven largely by rainfall and are highly variable in both time and space. However, run-on areas and drainage lines in arid regions receive more water more often than adjacent habitats, and frequently sustain relatively high levels of primary productivity. These landscape features therefore may support higher biotic diversity than other habitats, and potentially act as refuges for desert vertebrates and other biota during droughts. We used the ephemeral Field River in the Simpson Desert, central Australia, as a case study to quantify how resources and habitat characteristics vary spatially and temporally along the riparian corridor. Levels of moisture and nutrients were greater in the clay-dominated soils of the riverine corridor than in the surrounding sand dunes, as were cover values of trees, annual grasses, other annual plants and litter; these resources and habitat features were also greater near the main catchment area than in the distal reaches where the river channel runs out into extensive dune fields. These observations confirm that the riverine corridor is more productive than the surrounding desert, and support the idea that it may act as a refuge or as a channel for the ingress of peri-desert species. However, the work also demonstrates that species diversity of invertebrates and plants is not higher within the river corridor; rather, it is driven by rainfall and the accompanying increase in annual plants following a rain event. Further research is required to identify the biota that depend upon these resource pulses."

The quintuple mutation of these residues to alanine had the same negative effect as the entire L1C domain replacement, whereas none of the single mutations was as effective.

IRR is not sensitive to insulin and two insulin-like growth factors, IGF-I and IGF-II. Moreover, multiyear studies failed to discover any IRR agonist of the protein or peptide nature. Unexpectedly, recent studies revealed an unusual property of IRR to respond to an increase of extracellular medium pH (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A.

The precise mechanism of the IRR pH sensitivity is not known yet and participation of other ubiquitously present proteins or lipids cannot be excluded. insulin receptor insulin-like growth factor receptor. The physiological importance of IRR as a component of the acid-base homeostasis machinery is supported by complementary in vitro and in vivo studies (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V.

First, unlike its ubiquitously distributed homologs IR and IGF-IR, IRR is located in only specific cell sets within some tissues that come in contact with extracorporeal fluids of extreme pH such as kidney, pancreas, and stomach, as reviewed in Ref. 7Petrenko A.G. Zozulya S.A. Deyev I.E. Eladari D. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular pH sensor involved in the regulation of acid-base balance.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1834: 2170-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Second, in transfected cells, IRR (but not IR or IGF-IR) can be activated by external application of mildly alkaline medium independently of its ionic composition, and this effect is dose-dependent (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D.

Third, IRR knock-out mice, seemingly healthy under standard environmental conditions, fail to respond properly to an experimentally introduced alkali challenge by kidney secretion of excessive base as bicarbonate (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D.

Deficient Response to Experimentally Induced Alkalosis in Mice with the Inactivated insrr Gene.Acta Naturae. 2011; 3: 114-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the knock-out animal data provide a strong support that the in vitro findings of alkali-dependent IRR activation are physiologically relevant. It appears that, despite strong amino acid sequence homology, the IRR function and activation mechanism are quite distinct from those of IR and IGF-IR and therefore represent a special interest. Generally, receptor tyrosine kinases are activated due to ligand-induced dimerization followed by autophosphorylation of intracellular catalytic domains (9De Meyts P. Insulin and its receptor: structure, function and evolution.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 10Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). In the case of the insulin receptor minifamily, the receptor monomers are predimerized by disulfide bonds, and ligand binding induces a major conformational change that eventually results in the catalytic subunits approaching each other (11Hubbard S.R. Structural analysis of receptor tyrosine kinases.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Ward C.W. Lawrence M.C. Similar but different: ligand-induced activation of the insulin and epidermal growth factor receptor families.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Due to proteolytic processing, mature receptor monomers consist of disulfide-linked hydrophilic extracellular α-subunit and membrane-bound β-subunit with a phosphotyrosine kinase domain (13De Meyts P. The insulin receptor: a prototype for dimeric, allosteric membrane receptors?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the pH sensitivity of IRR is defined by its extracellular region, which, similarly to other members of the IR minifamily, contains two leucine-rich repeat domains, named L1 and L2, joined by the cysteine-rich C-domain, and three C-terminal fibronectin type III repeats 1 (FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3) (1Shier P.

Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The site of the endogenous cleavage lies within the second FnIII repeat. The qualitative analysis of IR/IRR chimeras revealed involvement of several extracellular domains in IRR alkali sensing with the primary role of L1C domains (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D. Petrenko A.G. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular alkali sensor.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To get further insight into the mechanism of IRR activation, we have now developed an in vitro assay of IRR autophosphorylation that could be quantitated. By analyzing a set of IR/IRR chimeras and IRR point mutants, we have identified key motifs and amino acid residues involved in IRR alkali sensing and estimated their contribution to IRR activation. The chimeras of human IRR (GenBankTM accession no. NP_055030) and IR (GenBankTM accession nos. BC117172) with full or partial ectodomain swapping were obtained by cloning using PCR strategy as described in Ref. 5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D. Petrenko A.G. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular alkali sensor.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar. For generation of additional constructions with point mutations or with tyrosine kinase domain swapping, we used megaprimer PCR approach with mutated oligonucleotides. The following primers were used for generation of TK(N) chimera in the tyrosine kinase domain by megaprimer PCR approach: IRR_TK_N2, 5′-GGGAGCAGATCTCGATAATCCGAGAGCTGGGGCAGGGC-3′; IRR_TK_N1, 5′-TCTTGAGGTCCCCACGGGTCATCAGCTCCATCACCACCA-3′. The following primers were used to generate a TK(C) chimera in the tyrosine kinase domain by megaprimer PCR approach: IRR_TK_C2, 5′-TCTGGTCATCATGGAGTTAATGGCTCACGGAGACCTGAAGAG-3′; IRR_TK_C1, 5′-CCAAGATGAGGCCAACCTTCACACACATTCTGGACAGCATAC-3′. The following primers were used to generate a TK chimera in the tyrosine kinase domain by megaprimer PCR approach: IRR_TK_N2 - 5′-GGGAGCAGATCTCGATAATCCGAGAGCTGGGGCAGGGC-3′; IRR_TK_C1, 5′-CCAAGATGAGGCCAACCTTCACACACATTCTGGACAGCATAC-3′. The following primers were used to generate mutations in L1C domains of IRR: HK_to_AA, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGCAGCATATTCTGCGCCGCCTGCGAGGGGCTGTGCCCT-3′(contains artificial EcoRI site in IRR sequence); H_to_A, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGCAGCATATTCTGCGCCAAGTGCGAGGGGCTGTGCCCT-3′; K_to_A, 5′-CGGAATTCCAGCAGCATATTCTGCCACGCCTGCGAGGGGCTGTGCCCT-3′;R_to_A, 5′-GCAGCCAGCCAGAAGACCCTGCCGCCTGTGTAGCTTGCCGC-3′; G_to_A, 5′-GGTGTGCTGGGTGCTGCTGCCGAGCCCTGTGCCAAGACC-3′; L_to_A, 5′-CACACGCACAGCCCCACGCGCCACGGCCCCAAGTGCAGG-3′. Primers HK_to_AA, H_to_A, and K_to_A were used to generate of a double mutant or single mutations in His-318 and Lys-319 with artificial EcoRI, which coded identical IRR sequence, by megaprimer PCR approach. To generate other mutations in Leu-135, Gly-188, and Arg-244, we used primers L_to_A, G_to_A, R_to_A, by megaprimer PCR approach. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. HEK 293 cells were transfected by unifectin-56 (Unifect Group, Moscow, Russia), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent monolayers of cells on culture dishes were washed with serum-free F-12 and incubated for 3 h in serum-free F-12 containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were further incubated in PBS with 60 mm Tris-HCl of the indicated pH or supplemented with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at room temperature and lyzed in the loading SDS-electrophoresis buffer. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IRR or mutant proteins with a C-terminal His6 tag. In 2 days after transfection, the cells were washed by serum-free F-12 and incubated for 3 h in serum-free F-12 containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were then lyzed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 90 min. The matrices were further washed three times with the lysis buffer and incubated with cold elution buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 90 min. Two samples of the eluates (80 μl) were supplemented with 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.1 or 9.1 (at +25 °C), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Furthermore, ATP was added to the final concentration of 100 nm, and eluates were placed at 25 °C for 5 min. To stop autophosphorylation reaction, 5× SDS-loading buffer was added. Rabbit anti-IR/IRR antibodies were raised against the IRR C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 961–1297) expressed in bacteria as a GST-fusion protein. The anti-pIR/IRR antibodies were raised against KLH-coupled peptide CGMTRDVpYETDpYpYRKGGKGL from the activation loop of IRR (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D. Petrenko A.G. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular alkali sensor.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The lysates and eluates were separated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer onto ECL-grade nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) as described (15Deyev I.E. Petrenko A.G. Regulation of CIRL-1 proteolysis and trafficking.Biochimie (Paris). 2010; 92: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For detection of phosphorylated IRS-1 and actin, we used rabbit anti-pIRS-1(Tyr-896) (Sigma) and mouse anti-actin (Chemicon) antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) following visualization with SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate System (Pierce). For quantitative analysis of the Western blots, Molecular Imager VersaDoc MP4000 (Bio-Rad) was used, together with with ImageJ and GraphPad 5 software. Hill plots were made using transform functions in GraphPad software with approximations of saturations signals from the autophosphorylation data. We have previously determined the role of IRR ectodomain and its fragments in its alkali sensitivity by the analysis of exogenously expressed IR/IRR chimeras (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D. Petrenko A.G. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular alkali sensor.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The obtained data revealed the involvement of multiple motifs but was qualitative only because the actual amount of surface-expressed receptors was not known. We therefore designed the in vitro test system that would allow us to quantify the receptor activation (i.e. autophosphorylation) as a function of the ligand concentration. This test was based on the assay performed with immunoprecipitated solubilized insulin receptors (16Grigorescu F. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Insulin binding and insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor solubilized from human erythrocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13708-13716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We prepared plasmid constructs encoding C-terminally His-tagged IR and IRR receptors and used them to transfect HEK 293 cells. The expressed proteins were precipitated on Ni-NTA resin and further tested by the in vitro autophosphorylation assay. The matrices were incubated in Tris-HCl buffer with neutral or alkaline pH or with 100 nm insulin and further analyzed by blotting with antibodies against IR/IRR (anti-IR/IRR) and their phosphorylated form (anti-pIR/IRR). Our preliminary experiments indicated that the in vitro autophosphorylation assay worked well for IR but not for IRR. To test the possibility that the identity of intracellular catalytic domain is important for this assay, two chimeras of IRR and IR were prepared (Fig. 1A, left panel). The first chimera contained the entire extracellular region of IRR fused with the rest of IR (IRR/IR), and the second one contained the entire extracellular region of IR fused with the rest of IRR (IR/IRR). IR and IRR/IR proteins showed strong response to insulin and alkaline medium, respectively (Fig. 1A, right panel). However, we could not detect any phosphorylation of precipitated IRR and IR/IRR receptors. Essentially, similar results were obtained in the same assay with the addition of 15 mm MnCl2 to the autophosphorylation reaction (data not shown). It should be noted that the IR/IRR construct, similarly to endogenous IR, was autophosphorylated in intact cells upon the insulin treatment (Fig. 1B). We also prepared chimeras where only catalytic tyrosine kinase domain or its fragments of IR were introduced into IRR (Fig. 1C, left panel). The chimera IRR-TK(N) contained the IR fragment from Arg-1027 to Met-1103, the other chimera IRR-TK(C) contained the homologous IR sequence from Thr-1104 to Phe-1283, and the third chimera IRR-TK contained the entire catalytic tyrosine kinase domain (supplemental Fig. S1). The autophosphorylation in vitro assay of all three chimeras revealed their response to alkaline medium (Fig. 1C, right panel). We concluded that this autophosphorylation test could be used to analyze IRR activation but only when its catalytic domain is replaced with the one of IR or its fragments. Our data are in agreement with the previously reported deficiency of autophosphorylation of yeast-expressed IRR cytoplasmic domain. Under the same conditions, the highly homologous intracellular domains of IR and IGF-IR were autophosphorylated quite well, and the IRR deficiency could be rescued by entire IGF-IR tyrosine kinase domain replacement or just its C-terminal part (17Klammt J. Garten A. Barnikol-Oettler A. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Kiess W. Comparative analysis of the signaling capabilities of the insulin receptor-related receptor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reason of this phenomenon is not clear because the multiple alignment of full IRR, and IR sequences revealed the highest homology precisely within the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain ∼80%. A simple explanation is that the catalytic property is sensitive to the detergent extraction. An alternative possibility is that IRR autophosphorylation in cells requires additional intracellular components such as adaptor proteins or lipids that act as co-factors. Consequently, all chimeric constructs, tested by in vitro phosphorylation assay, included either entire IR catalytic domain or its fragment, depending on expression efficiency of the specific mutant. Three chimeras, containing L1C or L2 domains of IRR, or both substituted with the corresponding sequences of IR, were prepared, and their in vitro activity was measured (Fig. 2A). To normalize the data for the actual receptor protein amount, the blotting membranes, after staining with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies, were stripped with stripping solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with anti-IR/IRR antibodies (Fig. 2B). The differences of normalized phosphosignals after alkaline and neutral pH treatment for L1C-TK(N) or L2-TK(N) chimeras were compared with the same data for IRR-TK(N), which was used as the 100% reference. For L1C-TK(N), L2-TK(N), and L1CL2-TK(N) chimeras, we observed a significant reduction of autophosphorylation activity to 35 ± 8%, 64 ± 3%, and 7 ± 3%, respectively, as compared with chimera with the intact IRR ectodomain (Fig. 2C). Because L1C substitution produced the strongest effect on IRR sensitivity to alkali, we attempted to identify specific residues in L1C domain that were critically important. We analyzed the multiple alignment of IR, IGF-IR, and IRR sequences from different species (supplemental Fig. S2) by searching for the residues that were conserved in IRR among species but differed significantly from those of IR or IGF-IR, e.g. by polarity or charge. Five amino acid residues in L1C domains of IRR were identified, namely Leu-135 (versus Thr in IR and IGF-IR), Gly-188 (versus Lys or Met in IR and IGF-IR), Arg-244 (versus Thr or Ser in IR and IGF-IR), His-318, and Lys-319 (versus TP, IP, or SP in IR and IGF-IR). To test the importance of the identified amino acid residues for pH sensing, we prepared a set of constructs with all five residues or only some of them mutated to alanine in addition to a swapped L2 domain (Fig. 2A, the fifth from above scheme). Alanine mutations are traditionally considered as the least disturbing intervention into the receptor structure. These mutants were expressed at comparable levels and processed correctly. Also, all of them showed some level of the receptor activity, suggesting there was no serious misfolding problem. The quintuple mutant LGR_HK_L2-TK(N) preserved only 7 ± 2% of the original full IRR ectodomain construct activity (Fig. 2C). These five mutations appeared to be as effective as the replacement of the entire L1C domains (Fig. 2C). To address the role of specific residues, the activity of constructs with double mutation of two ionic residues His-318 and Lys-319 changed to AA or triple mutation of Leu-135, Gly-188, and Arg-244, together with L2 substitution was further measured (Fig. 2A, the sixth and seventh from above, respectively). Surprisingly, the HK mutation produced low positive effect on IRR activity, as compared with the L2 chimera. However, the triple LGR mutation decreased the activity to only 40 ± 4%, indicating synergism of HK and LGR mutations (Fig. 2C). Because the HK mutation increased the activity of L2 chimera, a set of similar constructs with also single mutations in His-318 and Lys-319 without L2 swapping was analyzed and compared (Fig. 3A). The HK mutation decreased the activity by ∼29 ± 8%, whereas single mutations of H or K produced less pronounced effect with activity decrease by 21 ± 5% or 25 ± 9%, respectively. The triple LGR mutation appeared to be more efficient with ∼42 ± 8% reduction. The quintuple mutant activity was essentially the same as of L1C chimera (Fig. 3B). We may therefore conclude that the combination of these five amino acid residues play a key role in the L1C pH-sensing machinery. We further tested the effect of individual Leu-135, Gly-188, and Arg-244 mutations on the HK and L2 background (Fig. 4A). None of these were critical, Leu-135, Arg-244, or Gly-188 mutations decreased the phosphorylation level of chimeras to 43 ± 7%, 39 ± 2%, and 25 ± 6%, respectively, with the IRR/IR activity as 100% (Fig. 4B). To understand the mechanism of the loss of IRR alkali sensing activity in the mutants, we analyzed the pH dependence of their activation. This assay was performed as described previously (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D.

All chimeras therefore contained the native intracellular part of IRR. The transfected cells were incubated with a set of Tris-buffered physiological saline solutions with varied pH from 7.4 to 9.4 in small increments. Lysates of transfected cells were directly analyzed by Western blotting with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies and signal quantitation with the Molecular Imager. The blots were further stripped and stained again with anti-IR/IRR C-terminal end antibodies. The ratio of integral density of the phosphorylated receptor (pIR/IRR signal) to the total receptor (IR/IRR antibody signal) was plotted versus pH. The effect is shown as percentile of the strongest signal at pH 9.4 for each mutant. Wild-type IRR together with chimeras L1C-IRR and L2-IRR (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V.

In the case of wild-type IRR, the activation curve in logarithmic (effect versus pH) coordinates reflected a sharp sigmoid-shaped response with a half effect at pH 8.5–8.6 (EC50, 4.3 ± 0.5 μm), saturation at about pH 9.2, and the Hill slope 2.3 ± 0.3, as calculated by GraphPad software with nonlinear regression “one site-specific binding with Hill slope” (Fig. 5B). All mutant constructs produced pH dependence curves with a different shape and no signs of saturation were observed (Fig. 5B and see Fig. 6A). EC50 for all tested mutant constructs were shifted toward alkalinity. In linear (effect versus [OH−]) coordinates, all mutants, but not IRR, showed first-order kinetics of their activation that could be fitted by straight lines. The Hill plots with average values for each pH points and each constructs (Fig. 6B) clearly showed higher cooperativity of wild-type IRR activation (2.3 ± 0.1) in comparison with the mutants (1.3 ± 0.2 for LGR_HK_L2, 1.5 ± 0.1 for LGR_L2, 1.6 ± 0.1 for L1C, and 1.2 ± 0.1 for L2).FIGURE 6The pH dependence of IRR and its mutant activation (shown in Fig. 5B) in special coordinates.

We therefore tested whether significant reduction of the IRR pH-sensing property would also restrain a cellular signaling response. For this purpose, wild-type IRR and its L1CL2 chimera with partial swapping of L1CL2 first three domains of IR with the rest of IRR, that shows only a minor response to alkali treatment (5Deyev I.E.

The cells were treated with F-12 with pH 7.4 or 9.0 adjusted by 60 mm Tris-HCl for 20 min at 37 °C and then lyzed and Western blotted with anti-phosphoIRS-1 antibody, with anti-IR/IRR and actin antibodies as controls of IRR expression and protein loading. The resulting data indicated only a minor activation of endogenous IRS-1 in the cells expressing the chimera as compared with wild-type IRR-expressing cells (Fig. 7). The mechanism of IRR activation by alkali is of special interest because of IRR high structural homology with two other members of the IR family. Their activation requires binding of hormone to predimerized receptor subunits followed by a major conformational change eventually leading to autophosphorylation of intracellular kinase domains (18Siddle K. Ursø B. Niesler C.A. Cope D.L. Molina L. Surinya K.H. Soos M.A. Specificity in ligand binding and intracellular signalling by insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Yet, the precise mechanism of IR and IGF-IR rearrangement upon ligand binding remains enigmatic. Understanding of hormone-free activation of IRR is of interest as a rare example of pH-induced signaling. It may also shed light on complex events involved in insulin and insulin-like growth factor action. In this study, we searched for specific differences between IRR and IR that, being relatively minor, generate a unique property of alkali sensing. Previously, we demonstrated that IRR pH sensing is defined by its ectodomain (5Deyev I.E. Sohet F. Vassilenko K.P. Serova O.V. Popova N.V. Zozulya S.A. Burova E.B. Houillier P. Rzhevsky D.I. Berchatova A.A. Murashev A.N. Chugunov A.O. Efremov R.G. Nikol'sky N.N. Bertelli E. Eladari D. Petrenko A.G. Insulin receptor-related receptor as an extracellular alkali sensor.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because IR and IRR have the same domain structure of their extracellular regions, we swapped their large independent fragments and tested the response of chimeras to alkali stimulation in transfected cells. It appeared that essentially all domains of IRR extracellular region were involved in alkali sensing, but their role could not be estimated accurately due to method limitations. We now developed the in vitro assay that allowed us to quantify activity of IRR chimeric mutants with IR swapped domains. We determined that L1C and L2 domains of IRR are most important, their replacement with the corresponding IR fragments decreased IRR activity to ∼35 and 64%, respectively (Fig. 2). We next aimed to identify specific amino acid residues within L1C domains that could be of key importance. By the multiple alignment analysis of the insulin receptor family sequences in several species, five residues in L1C domains were identified that were conserved in species but differed substantially between IRR and IR and IGF-IR, namely Leu-135 (versus Thr in IR and IGF-IR), Gly-188 (versus Lys or Met in IR and IGF-IR), Arg-244 (versus Thr or Ser in IR and IGF-IR), His-318 and Lys-319 (versus TP, IP, or SP in IR and IGF-IR) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). As the tertiary structure of IRR is not known, the position of these residues can only be predicted within the known crystal structure of IR (Fig. 8). It should be noted that amino acids in the same positions do not map to binding sites for insulin or IGF-I in IR and IGF-IR, which were mapped by mutagenesis scanning approach (supplemental Fig. S2) (19Whittaker J.

How insulin engages its primary binding site on the insulin receptor.Nature. 2013; 493: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). According to the structure of IR ectodomain, the five mutated residues are not concentrated in a cluster and, most likely, are exposed to the aqueous phase (Fig. 7). Except for Leu-135, they are located in predicted loops between primary folds, raising the possibility that IRR activation involves relative shifts of structural domains. In particular, Lys-319 in IRR would allow higher flexibility of the junction than P in the corresponding position of IR. Mutation of all the five residues was equivalent to replacement of L1C domains; together with the L2 swapping, it resulted in almost complete loss of the receptor pH sensitivity. The vicinal His-318 and Lys-319 were of special interest since those are ionized residues and thus could be at the heart of the pH sensor. Unexpectedly, His-318/Lys-319 double mutant on the background of the L2 swap showed higher activity (80%) than the L2 swap only chimera, perhaps by relieving structural constraints due to L2 replacement. However, the triple LGR mutation was less potent than the quintuple one. Also, the HK mutation without L2 replacement decreased the receptor activity. Thus, vicinal HK are important for pH sensing but are not likely to be the key pH-sensing residues. Single residue mutations of Leu-135, Gly-188, and Arg-244 indicate that they all are involved in IRR pH sensing. However, none of these are of critical importance. Their contribution is not precisely additive suggesting they are part of the same structural component of the IRR activation machinery. The L2 domain is likely to be another independent unit of this mechanism as L2 replacement with the IR L2 domain produces additive effect with point mutations in L1C domains. To confirm the results of the in vitro tests and to determine the pH dependence of the mutant activation, IRR and four mutant constructs (L1C or L2 swap only, L2 plus triple mutation of Leu-135, Gly-188, and Arg-244, and L2 plus quintuple mutation) were transiently expressed and tested in intact cells without receptor solubilization. In contrast with wild-type IRR, the pH sensitivity of all three mutants shifted toward alkalinity, and no saturation was observed at pH values compatible with cell viability. The shape of the pH dependence curves indicated the absence of cooperativity in contrast with strong positive cooperativity of wild-type IRR. Also in intact cells, we showed that the L1CL2 mutant, in parallel with its low alkaline pH sensitivity, produced very minor IRS-1 activation in contrast with wild-type IRR. Altogether, our data suggest that IRR activation mechanism is not based on the mere deprotonation of a single residue in a “pH-sensing center” but represents the combination of at least two distinct structural changes that act synergistically. This cooperativity of the conformational change in the IRR ectodomain upon deprotonation may be based, at least partially, on the symmetrical involvement of two IRR subunits that are complexed as a head-to-foot λ-shaped dimer.

Often vital to degradation of protein substrates is their disassembly, unfolding, or extraction from membranes. These processes are catalyzed by the conserved AAA-ATPase Cdc48 (also known as p97). Here we characterize the Cuz1 protein (Cdc48-associated UBL/zinc finger protein-1), encoded by a previously uncharacterized arsenite-inducible gene in budding yeast. Cuz1, like its human ortholog ZFAND1, has both an AN1-type zinc finger (Zf_AN1) and a divergent ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). We show that Cuz1 modulates Cdc48 function in the UPS. The two proteins directly interact, and the Cuz1 UBL, but not Zf_AN1, is necessary for binding to the Cdc48 N-terminal domain. Cuz1 also associates, albeit more weakly, with the proteasome, and the UBL is dispensable for this interaction. Cuz1-proteasome interaction is strongly enhanced by exposure of cells to the environmental toxin arsenite, and in a proteasome mutant, loss of Cuz1 enhances arsenite sensitivity. Whereas loss of Cuz1 alone causes only minor UPS degradation defects, its combination with mutations in the Cdc48Npl4-Ufd1 complex leads to much greater impairment. Cuz1 helps limit the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates on both the proteasome and Cdc48, suggesting a possible role in the transfer of ubiquitylated substrates from Cdc48 to the proteasome or in their release from these complexes.

Hochstrasser M. Diversity of degradation signals in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Substrate proteins include both regulatory proteins that must be inactivated for proper cell and organismal function and quality control substrates such as misfolded or misassembled proteins (1Ravid T.

Attachment of ubiquitin polymers to substrates is generally required for their efficient recognition by the 26 S proteasome, a 2.6-MDa complex that ultimately degrades the substrate into short peptides and recycles ubiquitin (2Thrower J.S.

Biochem. 2013; 82: 415-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The RP recognizes polyubiquitylated substrates, and uses a heterohexameric ring of AAA+ ATPases to unfold substrates and translocate them into the central chamber of the CP where the proteolytic sites are located. Additional subunits in the RP function either as intrinsic receptors for polyubiquitin via their ubiquitin-binding domains or as binding sites for more mobile extrinsic ubiquitin receptors or shuttle factors such as Rad23 (5Schmidt M. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Finley D. Proteasome-associated proteins. Regulation of a proteolytic machine.Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Much of the machinery of the UPS has been identified, but key parts of the system remain poorly understood. Prominent among the open questions is the mechanism by which polyubiquitylated proteins are released by E3 ligases and transferred to ubiquitin receptors and the proteasome for degradation. The highly conserved, multifunctional Cdc48 protein, also called valosin-containing protein or p97 in mammals (6Fröhlich K.U. Fries H.W. Rüdiger M. Erdmann R. Botstein D. Mecke D.

The general mechanistic function of Cdc48 appears to be that of a “segregase,” a protein that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unfold or disassemble protein complexes or to extract proteins from membranes (12Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S.

Cdc48 consists of a globular N-terminal domain; two type II AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase domains called D1 and D2, which share 40% sequence identity; and a disordered C-terminal tail (14DeLaBarre B.

The crystal structure of murine p97/VCP at 3.6 Å.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cdc48 interacts with a plethora of cofactors, and these proteins mediate the wide range of functions in which Cdc48 has been implicated. Members of the largest family of Cdc48 cofactors are related by the UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) domain; there are seven UBX proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Structural determination of the UBX domain, which binds specifically to the Cdc48 N-terminal domain (16Dreveny I. Kondo H. Uchiyama K. Shaw A. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Structural basis of the interaction between the AAA ATPase p97/VCP and its adaptor protein p47.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), revealed a β-grasp fold similar to that of ubiquitin (17Buchberger A. Howard M.J. Proctor M. Bycroft M. The UBX domain. A widespread ubiquitin-like module.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The first characterized UBX domain-containing Cdc48 cofactor was p47 (called Ubx1 or Shp1 in yeast), which is required for homotypic membrane fusion in the nuclear envelope, Golgi, and ER (18Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Ubx2 is a transmembrane protein of the ER that helps recruit Cdc48 to ubiquitin-ligase complexes in the ER membrane (20Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Ubx2 links the Cdc48 complex to ER-associated protein degradation.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas Ubx5 appears to recruit Cdc48 complexes to chromatin sites of DNA repair (21Verma R. Oania R. Fang R. Smith G.T. Deshaies R.J. Cdc48/p97 mediates UV-dependent turnover of RNA Pol II.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 82-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Precise functions for the other UBX proteins have not yet been as clearly defined (see “Discussion”). In the ERAD and UFD pathways, a key Cdc48 cofactor is the Npl4-Ufd1 heterodimer (22Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. A complex of mammalian ufd1 and npl4 links the AAA-ATPase, p97, to ubiquitin and nuclear transport pathways.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 23Hitchcock A.L.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3226-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One Cdc48 hexamer interacts with one Npl4-Ufd1 heterodimer via a short binding site (BS1) in the C-terminal region of Ufd1 and a region in Npl4 with a similar fold to UBX and ubiquitin (the ubiquitin-D or UBX-related domain) (24Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. The AAA ATPase p97/VCP interacts with its alternative co-factors, Ufd1-Npl4 and p47, through a common bipartite binding mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The Cdc48Npl4-Ufd1 complex is required for the extraction of ERAD substrates from the ER membrane (25Jarosch E. Taxis C. Volkwein C. Bordallo J. Finley D. Wolf D.H. Sommer T. Protein dislocation from the ER requires polyubiquitination and the AAA-ATPase Cdc48.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Another Cdc48 cofactor, Vms1, has recently been shown to function in both ERAD and mitochondrial protein degradation (26Heo J.M. Livnat-Levanon N. Taylor E.B. Jones K.T. Dephoure N. Ring J. Xie J. Brodsky J.L. Madeo F. Gygi S.P. Ashrafi K. Glickman M.H. Rutter J. A stress-responsive system for mitochondrial protein degradation.Mol.

Chem. 2011; 286: 5744-5755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); in mitochondrial degradation, Vms1 is necessary to recruit Cdc48 to the mitochondrial membrane. The physical and functional coordination between Cdc48 and the proteasome is still poorly understood. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized yeast protein, YNL155w, which associates with Cdc48 and contains both a conserved AN1-type zinc finger (Zf_AN1) domain and an extremely diverged C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (UBL). Based on these features, we have named the protein Cdc48-associated UBL/zinc finger protein-1 (Cuz1). Cuz1 is highly conserved, with the most similar human protein being the uncharacterized ZFAND1 polypeptide. Cuz1 binds directly to Cdc48 and also to the proteasome; the latter interaction is strongly augmented in cells exposed to arsenite (As2O3). Deletion of CUZ1 causes minor UPS degradation defects; however, when cuz1Δ is combined with mutations in the Cdc48Npl4-Ufd1 complex, the proteolytic deficiency is enhanced. Loss of Cuz1 also increases the accumulation of polyubiquitin conjugates on the proteasome and Cdc48. These data indicate that Cuz1 is a novel Cdc48 cofactor that may promote transfer of ubiquitylated substrates from Cdc48 to the proteasome or facilitate the disassembly of Cdc48-polyubiquitin-substrate complexes on the proteasome. Yeast rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described previously, and all yeast manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures (28Guide to yeast genetics and molecular biology.in: Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 194. 1991: 1-863Google Scholar). Yeast chromosomal gene deletions were made by PCR-mediated marker amplification and gene replacement in diploid cells; the resulting diploid heterozygotes were dissected to verify 2:2 marker segregation and to isolate haploid deletion strains. Complete lists of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are presented in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The YNL155W (CUZ1) and YOR052C genes were isolated by PCR amplification from genomic yeast DNA, and inserted into various plasmids. The absence of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing of the entire inserts. Plasmid pRS314-FLAG-Cuz1 was derived from pRS314-Cuz1 using site-directed, ligase-independent mutagenesis (SLIM) (29Chiu J. March P.E. Lee R. Tillett D. Site-directed, ligase-independent mutagenesis (SLIM). A single-tube methodology approaching 100% efficiency in 4 h.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e174Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DNA sequences encoding His6-Cdc48 or His6-Cdc48(1–220) were PCR amplified from genomic yeast DNA using an oligonucleotide that introduced a His6 tag and then cloned into pET42b using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, which removed the sequence for the GST tag from the plasmid. DNA sequencing confirmed that the ORF contained no mutations. Plasmid pGEX-KT was used to express full-length Cuz1 and different Cuz1 deletion variants as GST fusions in Escherichia coli. CUZ1 sequences were obtained by amplifying the desired DNA fragments from yeast genomic DNA and inserting them downstream of the GST coding sequence in pGEX-KT. To make pGEX-KT-Cuz1–4S, Cys to Ser codon mutations were introduced into the CUZ1 sequence using two sequential QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis reactions. To fuse the endogenous CUZ1 gene to an upstream FLAG epitope sequence and maintain the normal promoter sequences, we used the delitto perfetto methodology (30Storici F. Resnick M.A. The delitto perfetto approach to in vivo site-directed mutagenesis and chromosome rearrangements with synthetic oligonucleotides in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). After insertion of the CORE-I-SceI cassette from pGSKU, the FLAG coding sequence was amplified from pRS314-FLAG-Cuz1 using primers whose 5′ segments had 40 nucleotides of identity to sequences upstream and downstream, respectively, of the CORE cassette insertion. This PCR product was then transformed into yeast to replace the CORE cassette in CUZ1 by homologous recombination. Correct recombination was verified by DNA sequencing and anti-FLAG immunoblotting. Late log-phase 2-liter cultures of yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed with ice-cold water, centrifuged, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cell lysis was achieved by grinding cells to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen (31Hochstrasser M. Funakoshi M. Disulfide engineering to map subunit interactions in the proteasome and other macromolecular complexes.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 832: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The powder was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100 and Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). The extract was centrifuged for 25 min at 30,000 × g to remove cell debris. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), and 96 mg of protein extract (∼40 ml) were mixed with 0.4 ml of FLAG-M2 antibody resin (50% slurry; Sigma). After 2 h rotating at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with 10 ml of the resuspension buffer. Beads were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer and then transferred to a new tube to which 3× FLAG peptide was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. After incubation for 45 min at 4 °C, the batch eluate was concentrated using a Vivaspin 500 concentrator (MWCO 10,000 kDa; GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining was used to evaluate 10% of the concentrated eluate. The remainder was frozen with liquid nitrogen and used for liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The mass spectrometry analysis was performed according to an optimized procedure for LC-MS/MS (32Xu P. Duong D.M. Peng J. Systematical optimization of reverse-phase chromatography for shotgun proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 3944-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved and excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel and digested with trypsin. The extracted peptides were loaded on a C18 capillary column (75 μm inner diameter, 10 cm length, 2.7 μm HALO C18 resin, tip size 15 μm; New Objective, MA), and then eluted during a 60-min gradient of 10–40% solvent B (solvent A, 0.1% formic acid; solvent B, 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, flow rate of 300 nl/min). The eluted peptides were analyzed on a hybrid LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS (ThermoFisher Scientific) with one MS survey scan and up to 10 data-dependent MS/MS scans. Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against yeast Uniprot database using the SEQUEST algorithm. Searching parameters included mass tolerance of precursor ions (±20 ppm) and product ion (±0.5 Da), tryptic restriction, dynamic mass shifts for oxidized Met (+15.9949), two maximal modification sites, two maximal missed cleavages, as well as only b and y ions counted. To evaluate the false discovery rate during spectrum-peptide matching, all original protein sequences were reversed to generate a decoy database that was concatenated to the original database (33Peng J. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Licklider L.J. Gygi S.P. Evaluation of multidimensional chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) for large-scale protein analysis. The yeast proteome.J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Assigned peptides were grouped by charge state and then filtered by matching scores (XCorr and ΔCn) to reduce the protein false discovery rate to 1%. For co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, cultures were grown at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 ∼1); where indicated, As2O3 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cultures were then incubated with shaking for 2 h, except where indicated otherwise. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. To test the interaction of Cdc48 with Cuz1, lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in co-IP buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors) and, when indicated, 2 mm ATP. The resuspended cells were disrupted using glass beads in an MP Biomedicals FastPrep bead-beater followed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. After protein quantification, 2.5 mg of protein extract were incubated with 50 μl of FLAG-M2 slurry for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of co-IP buffer and then resuspended in 25 μl of gel loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. To test for interaction of Cuz1 with proteasomes, the same co-IP methodology was used except for a modified co-IP buffer (co-IP buffer B, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm ATP and protease inhibitors). After protein binding, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. To test the interaction of polyubiquitylated substrates with Cdc48, cells expressing V5-tagged Cdc48 were transformed with a plasmid expressing an HA-tagged ubiquitin gene under the control of the CUP1 promoter (34Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. The short-lived MAT α2 transcriptional regulator is ubiquitinated in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm when the cultures were diluted. Cells were resuspended in co-IP buffer B without ATP, lysed, and after protein quantification, 1.5 mg of protein was incubated with 40 μl of anti-V5-agarose (Sigma). After 2 h, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. To test the interaction of the proteasome with polyubiquitylated substrates, cells were grown in the presence of CuSO4 to logarithmic phase and exposed to As2O3 for 2 h. Extracts were prepared with co-IP buffer B without ATP; 1 mg of protein was incubated with anti-FLAG resin, which was then washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. For testing the interaction of Cdc48 with the proteasome, co-IP buffer C was used: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100. Expression of GST and GST fusion proteins was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and overnight growth at 30 °C. The GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose (ThermoScientific) and eluted with reduced glutathione according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of His6-Cdc48 in E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS cells was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisPur Cobalt Resin (ThermoScientific) and eluted using a buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. All the purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. For testing the interaction of Cdc48 with GST-Cuz1 and Cuz1 deletion derivatives, the purified proteins were used in a 1:1 molar ratio of Cuz1 monomer to Cdc48 monomer in GST pulldown assays. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 0.4 ml of co-IP buffer A. To examine binding of GST-Cuz1 and its deletion derivatives to purified 26 S proteasomes, proteasomes were first purified from yeast as in Ref. 35Tomko Jr., R.J. Hochstrasser M. Incorporation of the Rpn12 subunit couples completion of proteasome regulatory particle lid assembly to lid-base joining.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, and binding reactions were done in 19 S co-IP buffer. Finally, for measuring interaction of ubiquitylated substrates with GST-Cuz1 and its derivatives, recombinant proteins (3 μg) were incubated with 800 μg of yeast extract from cells overexpressing HA-tagged ubiquitin. Extract preparation as well as GST pulldowns were performed with co-IP buffer D: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, beads were washed with the same buffer and proteins were eluted by boiling in gel loading buffer. For analysis of substrate degradation by cycloheximide chase/immunoblot assays, cultures were grown at room temperature (∼23 °C) to logarithmic phase and switched for 1 h to 37 °C. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, and 2.5 A600 equivalents of cells were harvested at each time point. The chase was performed at 37 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of water plus 0.1 ml of 0.2 m NaOH and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min; the lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 21,000 × g to remove cell debris. Pulse-chase analysis was performed essentially as described previously (36Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Multiple ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes participate in the in vivo degradation of the yeast MAT α2 repressor.Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown at 23 °C to exponential phase; after washing, cells (∼10 A600 eq) were incubated for 4 min at 28 °C and labeled with ∼0.2 mCi of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals) for 10 min and chased with excess cold methionine and cysteine at 28 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-β-galactosidase antibody and protein A-agarose (Repligen). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). An anti-Cuz1 polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits and subsequently purified. Additional antibodies used in this study were anti-HA (Covance), anti-GST (Abcam), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-PGK (Invitrogen), anti-β-galactosidase (Millipore), anti-Tetra His (Qiagen), and anti-Cdc48 (a gift from Dr. Thomas Sommer, Berlin). An initial bioinformatic search for uncharacterized S. cerevisiae genes that might function in the UPS led us to two genes, YNL155W and YOR052C (Fig. 1A). These genes are preceded by one or two PACE (proteasome-associated control element) sequences; such nonamer DNA elements (consensus: 5′-GGTGGCAAA-3′) are binding sites for the Rpn4 transcription factor and are found upstream of most proteasome genes as well as other genes involved in the UPS or in other stress response systems (37Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. Rpn4p acts as a transcription factor by binding to PACE, a nonamer box found upstream of 26S proteasomal and other genes in yeast.FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 38Xie Y. Varshavsky A. RPN4 is a ligand, substrate, and transcriptional regulator of the 26S proteasome. A negative feedback circuit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Rpn4 is required for normal levels of proteasome gene expression. The presence of upstream proteasome-associated control elements was our original search criterion. Both YNL155W and YOR052C encode predicted proteins with AN1-type zinc finger (Zf_AN1) domains, which coordinate a pair of zinc ions and are part of a widespread structural motif known as the treble-clef domain (39Burroughs A.M. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. Functional diversification of the RING finger and other binuclear treble clef domains in prokaryotes and the early evolution of the ubiquitin system.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 2261-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Treble-clef domains include the RING and IBR domains, both sequence signatures of ubiquitin ligases. Similarity between YNL155w and YOR052c is restricted to the Zf_AN1 domains (46% sequence identity over 32 residues). Two mammalian Zf_AN1 proteins, ZFAND2A/AIRAP (zinc finger-AN1 domain/arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein) and ZFAND2B/AIRAPL (AIRAP-like), were reported to bind the 26 S proteasome and may modulate its activity (40Yun C.

https://openalex.org/W2026242612,"Defects in cellular metabolism have been widely implicated in causing male infertility, but there has been little progress in understanding the underlying mechanism. Here we report that several key metabolism genes are regulated in the testis by Rhox5, the founding member of a large X-linked homeobox gene cluster. Among these Rhox5-regulated genes are insulin 2 (Ins2), resistin (Retn), and adiponectin (Adipoq), all of which encode secreted proteins that have profound and wide-ranging effects on cellular metabolism. The ability of Rhox5 to regulate their levels in the testis has the potential to dictate metabolism locally in this organ, given the existence of the blood-testes barrier. We demonstrate that Ins2 is a direct target of Rhox5 in Sertoli cells, and we show that this regulation is physiologically significant, because Rhox5-null mice fail to up-regulate Ins2 expression during the first wave of spermatogenesis and have insulin-signaling defects. We identify other Rhox family members that induce Ins2 transcription, define protein domains and homeodomain amino acid residues crucial for this property, and demonstrate that this regulation is conserved. Rhox5-null mice also exhibit altered expression of other metabolism genes, including those encoding the master transcriptional regulators of metabolism, PPARG and PPARGC1A, as well as SCD1, the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid metabolism. These results, coupled with the known roles of RHOX5 and its target metabolism genes in spermatogenesis in vivo, lead us to propose a model in which RHOX5 is a central transcription factor that promotes the survival of male germ cells via its effects on cellular metabolism.

Normal energy metabolism is critical for male fertility. Perturbations in glucose metabolism cause defects in sperm development in experimental animals (1Amaral S. Oliveira P.J. Ramalho-Santos J. Diabetes and the impairment of reproductive function. Possible role of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species.Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2008; 4: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and diabetes is strongly associated with abnormal spermatogenesis in humans (2Agbaje I.M. Rogers D.A. McVicar C.M. McClure N. Atkinson A.B. Mallidis C. Lewis S.E. Insulin dependant diabetes mellitus. Implications for male reproductive function.Hum. Reprod. 2007; 22: 1871-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3Goulis D.G. Tarlatzis B.C. Metabolic syndrome and reproduction. I. Testicular function.Gynecol. Endocrinol. 2008; 24: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, evidence suggests that diabetes perturbs fertility in men of reproductive age (4Schoeller E.L. Schon S. Moley K.H. The effects of type 1 diabetes on the hypothalamic, pituitary and testes axis.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 349: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and human male infertility is linked to poor semen quality resulting from hypoglycemia-induced oxidative stress damage to sperm. Direct evidence for a role of glucose metabolism in male fertility is the finding that streptozotocin-induced disruption of pancreatic beta cell function reduces the fertility of male mice (5Kim S.T. Moley K.H. Paternal effect on embryo quality in diabetic mice is related to poor sperm quality and associated with decreased glucose transporter expression.Reproduction. 2008; 136: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further support for this notion comes from analysis of Akita mutant mice, which exhibit a defect in insulin production and are hypofertile (5Kim S.T. Moley K.H. Paternal effect on embryo quality in diabetic mice is related to poor sperm quality and associated with decreased glucose transporter expression.Reproduction. 2008; 136: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Izumi T. Yokota-Hashimoto H. Zhao S. Wang J. Halban P.A. Takeuchi T. Dominant negative pathogenesis by mutant proinsulin in the Akita diabetic mouse.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition to roles in spermatogenesis, glucose metabolism is also important for other aspects of reproduction. For example, sperm must utilize glucose efficiently in order for them to fertilize eggs (7Sakkas D. Urner F. Menezo Y. Leppens G. Effects of glucose and fructose on fertilization, cleavage, and viability of mouse embryos in vitro.Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Wu H.T. Chou C.K. Lin C.S. Huang M.C. Effects of glucose concentration on in vitro fertilization in BALB/c mice.Reprod. Domest. Anim. 2003; 38: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A key cell type that controls metabolic events crucial for spermatogenesis is the Sertoli cell. The Sertoli cell maintains tight associations with germ cells throughout their development and thereby provides the structural framework, nutritional support, cofactors, and an immune-privileged barrier that establishes the critical germ line stem cell niche required for successful spermatogenesis (9Oatley J.M. Brinster R.L. The germline stem cell niche unit in mammalian testes.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 577-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Indeed, the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of germ cells depends on the delivery of amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and metabolic cofactors produced in Sertoli cells (10Griswold M.D. The central role of Sertoli cells in spermatogenesis.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells are also essential for the proper regulation of glucose metabolism during spermatogenesis, both for the production of lactate, the preferred energy substrate for spermatocytes and spermatids, and for aerobic glycolysis, which is required for spermiation and capacitation (11Alves M.G. Rato L. Carvalho R.A. Moreira P.I. Socorro S. Oliveira P.F. Hormonal control of Sertoli cell metabolism regulates spermatogenesis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, it has come to light that Sertoli cells also produce a plethora of metabolic hormones, including insulin, adiponectin, and resistin (12Caminos J.E. Nogueiras R. Gaytán F. Pineda R. González C.R. Barreiro M.L. Castaño J.P. Malagón M.M. Pinilla L. Toppari J. Diéguez C. Tena-Sempere M.

Functional role and regulation by nutritional status and hormonal factors.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Schoeller E.L. Albanna G. Frolova A.I. Moley K.H. Insulin rescues impaired spermatogenesis via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in Akita diabetic mice and restores male fertility.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 1869-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sertoli cells secrete these hormones into the adluminal space, allowing them to act on germ cells that are protected from the general circulatory system as a result of the blood-testis barrier. This barrier normally excludes molecules greater than 1 kDa (15Cheng C.Y. Mruk D.D. The blood-testis barrier and its implications for male contraception.Pharmacol. Rev. 2012; 64: 16-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), thereby preventing most pancreas- and adipocyte-derived hormones from germ cells within the adluminal compartment of seminiferous tubules. In addition to generating hormones and cytokines that influence cellular metabolism, Sertoli cells respond to such secreted proteins. For example, treatment of Sertoli cells with insulin and testosterone increases the production of acetate, which evidence suggests is important to maintain the synthesis of lipids and their byproducts, which, in turn, are essential for the normal development of germ cells (16Alves M.G. Socorro S. Silva J. Barros A. Sousa M. Cavaco J.E. Oliveira P.F. In vitro cultured human Sertoli cells secrete high amounts of acetate that is stimulated by 17β-estradiol and suppressed by insulin deprivation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conversely, depriving Sertoli cells of insulin results in down-regulation of several metabolism-associated genes, including LDHA and MCT4, as well as alterations in GLUT transporter levels, leading to shifts in lactate secretion and glucose uptake (17Oliveira P.F. Alves M.G. Rato L. Laurentino S. Silva J. Sá R. Barros A. Sousa M. Carvalho R.A. Cavaco J.E. Socorro S. Effect of insulin deprivation on metabolism and metabolism-associated gene transcript levels of in vitro cultured human Sertoli cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1820: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the roles of metabolism in male fertility are becoming well established, the regulatory events that act upstream of the metabolic enzymes and other metabolism factors in the male reproductive tract are poorly understood. In this paper, we report evidence that a homeobox transcription factor highly expressed in Sertoli cells, RHOX5, is a regulator of several genes encoding key metabolic factors. Homeobox genes encode evolutionarily conserved transcription factors harboring a 60-amino acid DNA-binding motif called a homeodomain. Rhox5 is part of a large X-linked homeobox gene cluster that harbors at least 33 genes and thus is the largest homeobox gene cluster so far identified in any species (18MacLean 2nd, J.A.

Regulation and function of the Rhox5 homeobox gene.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1120: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, we identify INS2 (insulin 2) as a candidate to be such a RHOX5-regulated germ cell survival factor. We demonstrate that the Ins2 gene and insulin protein are expressed in the testis in a developmentally regulated manner and that Rhox5-null mice have a dramatic defect in their expression in the testes. We showed that Ins2 is a direct target of RHOX5 and identified specific RHOX5 domains and amino acids required for Ins2 induction. As part of this analysis, we identified other RHOX family members that share with RHOX5 the ability to induce Ins2 and determined the specific domains and homeodomain residues dictating this ability. We showed that this is a conserved response, and we showed that Rhox5-null testes have defects in insulin signaling and increased germ cell apoptosis during the postnatal period when Ins2 is expressed. Last, we showed that Rhox5 regulates several other metabolism genes, including those that either promote or antagonize insulin action. Together, our analysis suggests that Rhox5-null mice may be a useful model for providing insights into the link between metabolic syndromes and male infertility.

Phytic acid degradation in fonio porridge using whole grain cereals as phytase source and effect on iron bioavailability when added to iron fortified fonio meals were investigated. Grains, nuts and seeds collected in Mali markets were screened for phytic acid and phytase activity. We performed an iron absorption study in Beninese women (n = 16), using non-dephytinised fonio porridge (FFP) and dephytinised fonio porridge (FWFP; 75% fonio-25% wheat), each fortified with (57)Fe or (58)Fe labeled FeSO4. Iron absorption was quantified by measuring the erythrocyte incorporation of stable iron isotopes. Phytic acid varied from 0.39 (bambara nut) to 4.26 g/100 g DM (pumpkin seed), with oilseeds values higher than grains and nuts. Phytase activity ranged from 0.17±1.61 (fonio) to 2.9±1.3 phytase unit (PU) per g (whole wheat). Phytic acid was almost completely degraded in FWFP after 60 min of incubation (pH≈5.0, 50°C). Phytate∶iron molar ratios decreased from 23.7∶1 in FFP to 2.7∶1 in FWFP. Iron fortification further reduced phytate∶iron molar ratio to 1.9∶1 in FFP and 0.3∶1 in FWFP, respectively. Geometric mean (95% CI) iron absorption significantly increased from 2.6% (0.8-7.8) in FFP to 8.3% (3.8-17.9) in FWFP (P<0.0001). Dephytinisation of fonio porridge with intrinsic wheat phytase increased fractional iron absorption 3.2 times, suggesting it could be a possible strategy to decrease PA in cereal-based porridges."
https://openalex.org/W2037387159,"The retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) controls proliferation and differentiation processes in stratified epithelia. Importantly, and in contrast to other tissues, Rb deficiency does not lead to spontaneous skin tumor formation. As the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 regulates proliferation and differentiation in the absence of pRb, we analyzed the consequences of deleting p21 in pRb-ablated stratified epithelia (hereafter pRb(ΔEpi);p21-/-). These mice display an enhancement of the phenotypic abnormalities observed in pRb(ΔEpi) animals, indicating that p21 partially compensates pRb absence. Remarkably, pRb(ΔEpi);p21-/- mice show an acute skin inflammatory phenotype and develop spontaneous epithelial tumors, particularly affecting tongue and oral tissues. Biochemical analyses and transcriptome studies reveal changes affecting multiple pathways, including DNA damage and p53-dependent signaling responses. Comparative metagenomic analyses, together with the histopathological profiles, indicate that these mice constitute a faithful model for human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that p21, in conjunction with pRb, has a central role in regulating multiple epithelial processes and orchestrating specific tumor suppressor functions."
https://openalex.org/W1967128030,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an anticancer drug and pyrimidine analogue. A problem in 5-FU therapy is acquired resistance to the drug. To find out more about the mechanisms of resistance, we screened a plasmid library in yeast for genes that confer 5-FU resistance when overexpressed. We cloned five genes: CPA1, CPA2, HMS1, HAM1 and YJL055W. CPA1 and CPA2 encode a carbamoyl phosphate synthase involved in arginine biosynthesis and HMS1 a helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Our results suggest that CPA1, CPA2, and HMS1 confer 5-FU resistance by stimulating pyrimidine biosynthesis. Thus, they are unable to confer 5-FU resistance in a ura2 mutant, and inhibit the uptake and incorporation into RNA of both uracil and 5-FU. In contrast, HAM1 and YJL055W confer 5-FU resistance in a ura2 mutant, and selectively inhibit incorporation into RNA of 5-FU but not uracil. HAM1 is the strongest resistance gene, but it partially depends on YJL055W for its function. This suggests that HAM1 and YJL055W function together in mediating resistance to 5-FU. Ham1p encodes an inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase that has been implicated in resistance to purine analogues. Our results suggest that Ham1p could have a broader specificity that includes 5-FUTP and other pyrimidine analogoue triphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2060386119,"Introduction Persons living with AIDS are highly vulnerable to foodborne enteric infections with the potential for substantial morbidity and mortality. Educational materials about foodborne enteric infections intended for this immunocompromised population have not been assessed for their efficacy in improving knowledge or encouraging behavior change. Methods/Results AIDS patients in four healthcare facilities in Chicago, New Orleans, and Puerto Rico were recruited using fliers and word of mouth to healthcare providers. Those who contacted research staff were interviewed to determine food safety knowledge gaps and risky behaviors. A food safety educational comic book that targeted knowledge gaps was created, piloted, and provided to these patients who were instructed to read it and return at least 2 weeks later for a follow-up interview. The overall food safety score was determined by the number of the 26 knowledge/belief/behavior questions from the survey answered correctly. Among 150 patients who participated in both the baseline and follow-up questionnaire, the intervention resulted in a substantial increase in the food safety score (baseline 59%, post-intervention 81%, p<0.001). The intervention produced a significant increase in all the food safety knowledge, belief, and behavior items that comprised the food safety score. Many of these increases were from baseline knowledge below 80 percent to well above 90%. Most (85%) of the patients stated they made a change to their behavior since receiving the educational booklet. Conclusion This comic book format intervention to educate persons living with AIDS was highly effective. Future studies should examine to what extent long-term behavioral changes result."
https://openalex.org/W2107447513,"Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases implicated in a variety of physiological processes. We have shown previously that sustained activation of the classical PKCα and PKCβII induces their phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent internalization and translocation to a subset of the recycling endosomes defined by the presence of PKC and PLD (the pericentrion), which results in significant differences in phosphorylation of PKC substrates. Here, we have investigated the biological consequences of sustained PKC activity and the involvement of PLD in this process. We find that sustained activation of PKC results in activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase pathway in a PLD- and endocytosis-dependent manner, with both pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA implicating the PLD2 isoform. Notably, dysregulated overexpression of PKCβII in A549 lung cancer cells was necessary for the enhanced proliferation and migration of these cancer cells. Inhibition of PKCβII with enzastaurin reduced A549 cell proliferation by >60% (48 h) and migration by >50%. These biological effects also required both PLD activity and mTOR function, with both the PLD inhibitor FIPI and rapamycin reducing cell growth by >50%. Reciprocally, forced overexpression of wild-type PKCβII, but not an F666D mutant that cannot interact with PLD, was sufficient to enhance cell growth and increase migration of noncancerous HEK cells; indeed, both properties were almost doubled when compared to vector control and PKC-F666D-overexpressing cells. Notably, this condition was also dependent on both PLD and mTOR activity. In summary, these data define a PKC-driven oncogenic signaling pathway that requires both PLD and mTOR, and suggest that inhibitors of PLD or mTOR would be beneficial in cancers where PKC overexpression is a contributing or driving factor."
https://openalex.org/W2087010345,"Stress is an integral component of life that can sometimes cause a critical overload, depending on the qualitative and quantitative natures of the stressors. The involvement of actin, the predominant component of dendritic integrity, is a plausible candidate factor in stress-induced neuronal cytoskeletal changes. The major aim of this study was to compare the effects of three different stress conditions on the transcription and translation of actin-related cytoskeletal genes in the rat brain. Male Wistar rats were exposed to one or other of the frequently used models of physical stress, i.e. electric foot shock stress (EFSS), forced swimming stress (FSS), or psychosocial stress (PSS) for periods of 3, 7, 14, or 21 days. The relative mRNA and protein expressions of β-actin, cofilin and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK-1) were determined by qRT- PCR and western blotting from hippocampus and frontal cortex samples. Stressor-specific alterations in both β-actin and cofilin expression levels were seen after stress. These alterations were most pronounced in response to EFSS, and exhibited a U-shaped time course. FSS led to a significant β-actin mRNA expression elevation in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex after 3 and 7 days, respectively, without any subsequent change. PSS did not cause any change in β-actin or cofilin mRNA or protein expression in the examined brain regions. EFSS, FSS and PSS had no effect on the expression of MAPK-1 mRNA at any tested time point. These findings indicate a very delicate, stress type-dependent regulation of neuronal cytoskeletal components in the rat hippocampus and frontal cortex."
