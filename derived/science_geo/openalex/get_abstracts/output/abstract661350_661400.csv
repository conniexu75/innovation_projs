https://openalex.org/W3092982608,"As of August 2020, the United States is the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging data suggests that “essential” workers, who are disproportionately more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants, bear a disproportionate degree of risk. We used publicly available data to build a series of spatial autoregressive models assessing county level associations between COVID-19 mortality and (1) percentage of individuals engaged in farm work, (2) percentage of households without a fluent, adult English-speaker, (3) percentage of uninsured individuals under the age of 65, and (4) percentage of individuals living at or below the federal poverty line. We further adjusted these models for total population, population density, and number of days since the first reported case in a given county. We found that across all counties that had reported a case of COVID-19 as of July 12, 2020 (n = 3024), a higher percentage of farmworkers, a higher percentage of residents living in poverty, higher density, higher population, and a higher percentage of residents over the age of 65 were all independently and significantly associated with a higher number of deaths in a county. In urban counties (n = 115), a higher percentage of farmworkers, higher density, and larger population were all associated with a higher number of deaths, while lower rates of insurance coverage in a county was independently associated with fewer deaths. In non-urban counties (n = 2909), these same patterns held true, with higher percentages of residents living in poverty and senior residents also significantly associated with more deaths. Taken together, our findings suggest that farm workers may face unique risks of contracting and dying from COVID-19, and that these risks are independent of poverty, insurance, or linguistic accessibility of COVID-19 health campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2968048819,"One aim of data mining is the identification of interesting structures in data. For better analytical results, the basic properties of an empirical distribution, such as skewness and eventual clipping, i.e. hard limits in value ranges, need to be assessed. Of particular interest is the question of whether the data originate from one process or contain subsets related to different states of the data producing process. Data visualization tools should deliver a clear picture of the univariate probability density distribution (PDF) for each feature. Visualization tools for PDFs typically use kernel density estimates and include both the classical histogram, as well as the modern tools like ridgeline plots, bean plots and violin plots. If density estimation parameters remain in a default setting, conventional methods pose several problems when visualizing the PDF of uniform, multimodal, skewed distributions and distributions with clipped data, For that reason, a new visualization tool called the mirrored density plot (MD plot), which is specifically designed to discover interesting structures in continuous features, is proposed. The MD plot does not require adjusting any parameters of density estimation, which is what may make the use of this plot compelling particularly to non-experts. The visualization tools in question are evaluated against statistical tests with regard to typical challenges of explorative distribution analysis. The results of the evaluation are presented using bimodal Gaussian, skewed distributions and several features with already published PDFs. In an exploratory data analysis of 12 features describing quarterly financial statements, when statistical testing poses a great difficulty, only the MD plots can identify the structure of their PDFs. In sum, the MD plot outperforms the above mentioned methods."
https://openalex.org/W3046285630,"We generalize the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for epidemics to take into account generic effects of heterogeneity in the degree of susceptibility to infection in the population. We introduce a single new parameter corresponding to a power-law exponent of the susceptibility distribution that characterizes the population heterogeneity. We show that our generalized model is as simple as the original model which is contained as a limiting case. Because of this simplicity, numerical solutions can be generated easily and key properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly. In particular, we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the epidemic, as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be quantified during an epidemic. We find that in strongly heterogeneous populations the epidemic reaches only a small fraction of the population. This implies that the herd immunity level can be much lower than in commonly used models with homogeneous populations. Using our model to analyze data for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany shows that the reported time course is consistent with several scenarios characterized by different levels of immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the time course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or seasonality. Our analysis reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity in the population. Our work shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without increasing the complexity of the model. We show that information about population heterogeneity will be key to understand how far an epidemic has progressed and what can be expected for its future course."
https://openalex.org/W3037222566,"This paper uses resilience as a lens through which to analyse disasters and other major threats to patterns of criminal behaviour. A set of indicators and mathematical models are introduced that aim to quantitatively describe changes in crime levels in comparison to what could otherwise be expected, and what might be expected by way of adaptation and subsequent resumption of those patterns. The validity of the proposed resilience assessment tool is demonstrated using commercial theft data from the COVID-19 pandemic period. A 64 per cent reduction in crime was found in the studied city (China) during an 83-day period, before daily crime levels bounced back to higher than expected values. The proposed resilience indicators are recommended as benchmarking instruments for evaluating and comparing the global impact of COVID-19 policies on crime and public safety."
https://openalex.org/W3092733720,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which prevention and effective treatments are lacking. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is not clearly understood. It is thought to be caused by oxidative stress-dependent loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the promotion of inflammatory responses by microglia at the lesion site. In addition, cell loss occurs in the hypothalamus of Parkinson's disease patients. Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide that can exert many beneficial effects, including an antioxidant action, metal ion chelation, proton buffering capacity, and inhibition of protein carbonylation and glycolysis. Previously, we found that carnosine inhibits trace metal-induced death of immortalized hypothalamic neuronal GT1-7 cells. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of carnosine on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-dependent GT1-7 cell death and inflammatory responses. We found that carnosine significantly prevented 6-OHDA-dependent GT1-7 cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, carnosine significantly suppressed the expression of 6-OHDA-induced integrated stress response (ISR)-related factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Carnosine also significantly inhibited 6-OHDA-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway activation in GT1-7 cells. These results indicate that carnosine inhibits hypothalamic neuronal cell death and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the ROS-JNK pathway. We therefore suggest that carnosine may be effective in preventing the onset or the exacerbation of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3092889171,"A scale with robust statistical validation is essential to diagnose pain and improve decision making for analgesia. This blind, randomised, prospective and opportunist study aimed to develop an ethogram to evaluate behaviour and validate a scale to assess acute ovine postoperative pain. Elective laparoscopy was performed in 48 healthy sheep, filmed at one preoperative and three postoperative moments, before and after rescue analgesia and 24 hours after. The videos were randomised and assessed twice by four evaluators, with a one-month interval between evaluations. Statistical analysis was performed using R software and differences were considered significant when p <0.05. Based on the multiple association, a unidimensional scale was adopted. The intra- and inter-observer reliability ranged from moderate to very good (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.53). The scale presented Spearman correlations > 0.80 with the numerical, simple descriptive, and visual analogue scales, and a correlation of 0.48 with the facial expression scale. According to the mixed linear model, the scale was responsive, due to the increase and decrease in pain scores of all items after surgery and analgesic intervention, respectively. All items on the scale demonstrated an acceptable Spearman item-total correlation (0.56-0.76), except for appetite (0.25). The internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's α = 0.81) and all items presented specificity > 0.72 and sensitivity between 0.61-0.90, except for appetite. According to the Youden index, the cut-off point was ≥ 4 out of 12, with a diagnostic uncertainty zone of 4 to 5. The area under the curve > 0.95 demonstrated the excellent discriminatory capacity of the instrument. In conclusion, the Unesp-Botucatu pain scale in sheep submitted to laparoscopy is valid, reliable, specific, sensitive, with excellent internal consistency, accuracy, discriminatory capacity, and a defined cut-off point."
https://openalex.org/W3091820625,"Hepatitis B x protein (HBx) affects cellular protein expression and participates in the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Metabolic reprogramming contributed to the HCC development, but its role in HBV-related HCC remains largely unclear. Tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 13 (PTPN13) is a significant regulator in tumor development, however, its specific role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be explored. Here, we found that decreased PTPN13 expression was associated with HBV/HBx. Patients with low PTPN13 expression showed a poor prognosis. Functional assays revealed that PTPN13 inhibited proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies indicated that HBx inhibited PTPN13 expression by upregulating the expression of DNMT3A and interacting with DNMT3A. Furthermore, we found that DNMT3A bound to the PTPN13 promoter (-343 to -313 bp) in an epigenetically controlled manner associated with elevated DNA methylation and then inhibited PTPN13 transcription. In addition, we identified IGF2BP1 as a novel PTPN13-interacting gene and demonstrated that PTPN13 influences c-Myc expression by directly and competitively binding to IGF2BP1 to decrease the intracellular concentration of functional IGF2BP1. Overexpressing PTPN13 promoted c-Myc mRNA degradation independent of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity of PTPN13. Importantly, we discovered that the PTPN13-IGF2BP1-c-Myc axis was important for cancer cell growth through promoting metabolic reprogramming. We verified the significant negative correlations between PTPN13 expression and c-Myc, PSPH, and SLC7A1 expression in clinical HCC tissue samples. In summary, our findings demonstrate that PTPN13 is a novel regulator of HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis and may play an important role in HCC. PTPN13 may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HBV-related HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3092894629,"This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) for opportunistic screening and longitudinal follow-up of osteoporosis in breast cancer patients, compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The association between L1 vertebral attenuation on chest CT and incidental fracture was also evaluated. We retrospectively reviewed 414 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent both non-enhanced chest CT and DXA within a 3-month interval and had at least two DXA and two chest CT examinations over more than 1 year. The attenuation value of the L1 trabecular bone was measured on an axial CT image and compared to the corresponding DXA T-score. The diagnostic performance of L1 vertebral attenuation on CT for osteoporosis was calculated at different thresholds (90 HU, 100 HU, 110 HU), and the correlation between L1 vertebral attenuation values and DXA T-scores was statistically analyzed. Overall fracture-free survival was estimated and compared with the threshold of 90 HU on CT and -2.5 T-score on DXA. Of 414 patients (median age, 53.0 years), 88 (21.3%) had either vertebral or non-vertebral fractures. The median follow-up duration between initial and final DXA was 902.9 days. There was a moderate correlation between L1 vertebral attenuation value and DXA T-score (ρ = 0.684, CI 0.653–0.712). Fracture-free survival was significantly lower in patients with attenuation values ≤90 HU on CT and T-scores ≤-2.5 on DXA (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that attenuation values ≤90 HU on CT (P < .001), T-scores ≤-2.5 on DXA (P = .003), and age ≥65 years (P = .03) were independent significant prognostic factors associated with overall fracture-free survival. The sensitivities and specificities of L1 attenuation value were 54.9% and 85.8% at 90-HU threshold, 74.0% and78.4% at 100-HU threshold, and 83.9% and 70.1% at 110-HU threshold, respectively. In conclusion, CT can be used for predicting osteoporosis and discriminating incidental fracture risk in breast cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W3092666713,"Policies aimed at sustainable landscape management recognise the importance of multiple cultural viewpoints, but the notion of landscape itself is implicitly assumed to be homogeneous across speech communities. We tested this assumption by collecting data about the concept of “landscape” from speakers of seven languages of European origin. Speakers were asked to freely list exemplars to “landscape” (a concrete concept for which the underlying conceptual structure is unclear), “animals” (a concrete and discrete concept) and “body parts” (a concrete concept characterised by segmentation). We found, across languages, participants considered listing landscape terms the hardest task, listed fewest exemplars, had the least number of shared exemplars, and had fewer common co-occurrence pairs (i.e., pairs of exemplars listed adjacently). We also found important differences between languages in the types of exemplars that were cognitively salient and, most importantly, in how the exemplars are connected to each other in semantic networks. Overall, this shows that “landscape” is more weakly structured than other domains, with high variability both within and between languages. This diversity suggests that for sustainable landscape policies to be effective, they need to be better tailored to local conceptualisations."
https://openalex.org/W3092760378,"Sustainable resource management is of central importance among agrarian societies in marginal drylands. In the Negev Desert, Israel, research on agropastoral resource management during Late Antiquity emphasizes intramural settlement contexts and landscape features. The importance of hinterland trash deposits as diachronic archives of resource use and disposal has been overlooked until recently. Without these data, assessments of community-scale responses to societal, economic, and environmental disruption and reconfiguration remain incomplete. In this study, micro-geoarchaeological investigations were conducted on trash mound features at the Byzantine—Early Islamic sites of Shivta, Elusa, and Nesanna to track spatiotemporal trends in the use and disposal of critical agropastoral resources. Refuse derived sediment deposits were characterized using stratigraphy, micro-remains (i.e., livestock dung spherulites, wood ash pseudomorphs, and plant phytoliths), and mineralogy by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Our investigations detected a turning point in the management of herbivore livestock dung, a vital resource in the Negev. We propose that the scarcity of raw dung proxies in the studied deposits relates to the use of this resource as fuel and agricultural fertilizer. Refuse deposits contained dung ash, indicating the widespread use of dung as a sustainable fuel. Sharply contrasting this, raw dung was dumped and incinerated outside the village of Nessana. We discuss how this local shift in dung management corresponds with a growing emphasis on sedentised herding spurred by newly pressed taxation and declining market-oriented agriculture. Our work is among the first to deal with the role of waste management and its significance to economic strategies and urban development during the late Roman Imperial Period and Late Antiquity. The findings contribute to highlighting top-down societal and economic pressures, rather than environmental degradation, as key factors involved in the ruralisation of the Negev agricultural heartland toward the close of Late Antiquity."
https://openalex.org/W3093087603,"Millions of people worldwide use online learning for post-secondary education and professional development, but participation from historically underrepresented groups remains low. Their choices to enroll in online courses can be influenced by course features that signal anticipated success and belonging, which motivates research to identify features associated with sociodemographic variation in enrollments. This pre-registered field study of 1.4 million enrollments in 159 online courses across 20 institutions identifies features that predict enrollment patterns in terms of age, gender, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status. Among forty visual and verbal features, course discipline, stated requirements, and presence of gender cues emerge as significant predictors of enrollment, while instructor skin color, linguistic style of course descriptions, prestige markers, and references to diversity do not predict who enrolls. This suggests strategic changes to how courses are presented to improve diversity and inclusion in online education."
https://openalex.org/W3093342875,"Participants often vary in their response to behavioral interventions, but methods to identify groups of participants that are more likely to respond are lacking. In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, we used baseline characteristics to group participants into distinct behavioral phenotypes and evaluated differential responses to a physical activity intervention. Latent class analysis was used to segment participants based on baseline participant data including demographics, validated measures of psychosocial variables, and physical activity behavior. The trial included 602 adults from 40 U.S. states with body mass index ≥25 who were randomized to control or one of three gamification interventions (supportive, collaborative, or competitive) to increase physical activity. Daily step counts were monitored using a wearable device for a 24-week intervention with 12 weeks of follow-up. The model segmented participants into three classes named for key defining traits: Class 1, extroverted and motivated; Class 2, less active and less social; Class 3, less motivated and at-risk. Adjusted regression models were used to test for differences in intervention response relative to control within each behavioral phenotype. In Class 1, only participants in the competitive arm increased their mean daily steps during the intervention (adjusted difference, 945; 95% CI, 352-1537; P = .002), but it was not sustained during follow-up. In Class 2, participants in all three gamification arms significantly increased their mean daily steps compared to control during the intervention (supportive arm adjusted difference 1172; 95% CI, 363-1980; P = .005; collaborative arm adjusted difference 1119; 95% CI, 319-1919; P = .006; competitive arm adjusted difference 1179; 95% CI, 400-1957; P = .003) and all three had sustained impact during follow-up. In Class 3, none of the interventions had a significant effect on physical activity. Three behavioral phenotypes were identified, each with a different response to the interventions. This approach could be used to better target behavioral interventions to participants that are more likely to respond to them."
https://openalex.org/W3092860294,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito plays an important role in the spread of diseases, including epidemic ones, such as dengue fever, Zika virus disease, yellow fever, and chikungunya disease. To control the population of Ae.aegypti, we transferred an HR3 RNAi fragment into the microalgae Chlamydomonas, which serves as food for Ae.aegypti larvae. Results showed that the HR3 RNAi transgenic algal strains were lethal to Ae.aegypti. The integumentary system of larvae fed with HR3 RNAi transgenic algal strains was severely damaged. Muscles of the larvae were unevenly distributed and disordered, and their midgut showed disintegration of the intestinal cavity. RNA-Seq results demonstrated that on the 4th day of inoculation with the transgenic algae, the abundance of early expressed genes in the 20E signal transduction pathway of larvae fed with the HR3 RNAi transgenic algal strain significantly reduced. These genes include E74, E75, E93, and 20E receptor complex EcR/USP and FTZ-F1 gene regulated by HR3. In later experiments, a scale test of 300 Ae.aegypti eggs per group was carried out for 30 days, and the survival rate of Ae.aegypti fed with the HR3 RNAi transgenic strain was only 1.3%. These results indicate that the HR3 RNAi transgenic strain exerts obvious insecticidal effect."

Methods Patients who underwent DMEK at Yokohama Minami Kyosai Hospital were included and prospectively evaluated pre-operatively and at postoperative months 1, 3, 6, and 12, and compared to healthy controls. Corneal characteristics evaluated included corneal curvature (keratometric value [KV]; D), central corneal thickness (CCT), peripheral corneal thickness (PCT), and corneal higher-order aberrations [HOAs] at 6.0 mm diameter, calculated by anterior segment optical coherence tomography and logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution [logMAR]. Results A total of 30 eyes of 30 patients (6 men, 24 women, mean age 73.4 ± 7.4 years) were included and compared with 31 age-matched healthy control eyes (13 men, 18 women; mean age 73.0 ± 6.7 years). LogMAR after DMEK improved from 0.87 ± 0.07 preoperatively to 0.04 ± 0.07 at 12 months postoperatively (p<0.001). Although anterior KVs of DMEK eyes were similar to those of control eyes, posterior KVs were significantly larger (-6.4 ± 0.3 D vs. -6.3 ± 0.2 D; p = 0.02). Total HOAs after DMEK improved from 1.94 ± 1.05 μm preoperatively to 1.05 ± 0.16 μm at 12 months postoperatively (p<0.001), which was significantly higher than that in control eyes (0.63 ± 0.06) (p<0.001). Despite the similar CCTs in the two groups, the PCT was significantly larger in DMEK eyes (704 ± 41 μm vs 669 ± 38 μm, p = 0.002) at 12 months. Conclusion Despite achieving good visual function and excellent corneal clarity, eyes that underwent DMEK showed a steeper posterior KV and higher corneal HOAs than normal eyes even at 12 months after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3093221434,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and is known to be the most common cause of dementia. We previously described the benefits of aromatherapy on the cognitive function of patients with AD utilizing various aromatic essential oils; however, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Consequently, in the present study, this mechanism was thoroughly evaluated employing a dementia mice model, specifically the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8. The mice were exposed to a mixture of lemon and rosemary oil at nighttime as well as to a mixture of lavender and orange oil in the daytime for 2 months. The cognitive function of the mice was assessed before and after treatment with the aromatic essential oils using the Y-maze test. Moreover, the brain levels of amyloid beta (Aβ), abnormally phosphorylated tau, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured following treatment. The benefits of aromatherapy on the cognitive function in mice were confirmed. It was also established that the brain levels of Aβ and abnormally phosphorylated tau were considerably lower in the aromatherapy group, while the levels of BDNF were marginally higher. These results suggest that aromatherapy employing these aromatic essential oils is beneficial for the prevention and treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W3093326142,"The underrepresentation of women in academic medicine at senior level and in leadership positions is well documented. Biomedical Research Centres (BRC), partnerships between leading National Health Service (NHS) organisations and universities, conduct world class translational research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK. Since 2011 BRCs are required to demonstrate significant progress in gender equity (GE) to be eligible to apply for funding. However, the evidence base for monitoring GE specifically in BRC settings is underdeveloped. This is the first survey tool designed to rank and identify new GE markers specific to the NIHR BRCs.An online survey distributed to senior leadership, clinical and non-clinical researchers, trainees, administrative and other professionals affiliated to the NIHR Oxford BRC (N = 683). Participants ranked 13 markers of GE on a five point Likert scale by importance. Data were summarised using frequencies and descriptive statistics. Interrelationships between markers and underlying latent dimensions (factors) were determined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.The response rate was 36% (243 respondents). Respondents were more frequently female (55%, n = 133), aged 41-50 years (33%, n = 81), investigators (33%, n = 81) affiliated to the BRC for 2-7 years (39.5%, n = 96). Overall participants ranked 'BRC senior leadership roles' and 'organisational policies on gender equity', to be the most important markers of GE. 58% (n = 141) and 57% (n = 139) respectively. Female participants ranked 'organisational policies' (64.7%, n = 86/133) and 'recruitment and retention' (60.9%, n = 81/133) most highly, whereas male participants ranked 'leadership development' (52.1%, n = 50/96) and 'BRC senior leadership roles' (50%, n = 48/96) as most important. Factor analyses identified two distinct latent dimensions: ""organisational markers"" and ""individual markers"" of GE in BRCs.A two-factor model of markers of achievement for GE with ""organisational"" and ""individual"" dimensions was identified. Implementation and sustainability of gender equity requires commitment at senior leadership and organisational policy level."

All cells use plasma membrane protrusions to physically and biochemically interact with the external environment. Finger-like protrusions such as microvilli, stereocilia, and filopodia extend from the surface of diverse cell types and serve a variety of functions, ranging from solute uptake to mechanosensation (1Pelaseyed T.

Individual protrusions are supported by parallel bundles of actin filaments, with their barbed ends oriented away from the cell body toward the distal tip. Microvilli in particular play prominent roles in transporting epithelial tissues, including those that line the intestinal tract and kidney tubules (2Crawley S.W. Mooseker M.S. Tyska M.J.

For example, a single enterocyte, the nutrient-absorbing cell of the gut, assembles on its apical surface thousands of microvilli in an array collectively known as the brush border (BB). The BB vastly increases surface area and, in turn, absorptive capacity (4Helander H.F. Fändriks L. Surface area of the digestive tract: revisited.Scand. J.

It uses mixed-methods to explore leisure-time physical activity participation and day-to-day experiences of leisure and health. A sample representing approximately one third of the Coffs Coast adult humanitarian migrant population completed the survey, as well as 32 individuals who participated in interviews and focus groups. Findings were organised into three themes and explored issues around mental health and time for leisure, cultural differences in experiencing leisure, and the connections with experiences of other disadvantaged groups. We conclude by arguing that leisure needs to be brought to the fore of discussions around service provision and policy making concerned with the wellbeing of the refugee migrant population, particularly focusing on support for the (re)development of a vocabulary for recreation, as a step forward in the journey to healing and belonging."

https://openalex.org/W3092671682,"Drawing on the recent advances in complex network theory, urban mobility flow patterns, typically encoded as origin-destination (OD) matrices, can be represented as weighted directed graphs, with nodes denoting city locations and weighted edges the number of trips between them. Such a graph can further be augmented by node attributes denoting the various socio-economic characteristics at a particular location in the city. In this paper, we study the spatio-temporal characteristics of “hotspots” of different types of socio-economic activities as characterized by recently developed attribute-augmented network centrality measures within the urban OD network. The workflow of the proposed paper comprises the construction of temporal OD networks using two custom data sets on urban mobility in Rome and London, the addition of socio-economic activity attributes to the OD network nodes, the computation of network centrality measures, the identification of “hotspots” and, finally, the visualization and analysis of measures of their spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Our results show structural similarities and distinctions between the spatial patterns of different types of human activity in the two cities. Our approach produces simple indicators thus opening up opportunities for practitioners to develop tools for real-time monitoring and visualization of interactions between mobility and economic activity in cities."
https://openalex.org/W3092721816,"Background Neonatal mortality rates in Haiti are among the highest in the Western hemisphere. Few mothers deliver with a skilled birth attendant present, and there is a significant lack of pediatricians. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at St. Damien Pediatric Hospital, a national referral center, is one of only five neonatology departments in Haiti. In order to target limited resources toward improving outcomes, this study seeks to describe clinical care in the St. Damien NICU. Methods A retrospective medical record review was performed on available medical records on all admissions to the NICU between April 2016 and April 2017. Results 220 neonates were admitted to the NICU within the study epoch. The mortality rate was 14.5%. Death was associated with a maternal diagnosis of hypertension (p = 0.03) and neonatal diagnoses of lower gestational age (p<0.0001), lower birth weight (p<0.0001), prematurity (p = 0.002), RDS p = 0.01), sepsis (p<0.0001) and kernicterus (p = 0.04). The most common diagnoses were sepsis, chorioamnionitis, respiratory distress syndrome, jaundice, prematurity and perinatal asphyxia. Conclusions This study demonstrates that preterm birth, sepsis, RDS and kernicterus are key contributors to neonatal mortality in a Haitian national pediatric referral center NICU and as such are promising interventional targets for reducing the neonatal mortality rate in Haiti."
https://openalex.org/W3093423703,"Knowledge of the recruitment of dominant forest species is a key aspect for forest conservation and the ecosystem services they provide. In this paper, we address how the simultaneous action of climate change and the intensity of land use in the past influence the recruitment of a forest species that depends on the provision of nurse plants to recruit. We compared the number of saplings (up to 15 years old) and juveniles (16 to 50 years old) of Quercus ilex in 17, 5.3 ha plots in the Iberian System (eastern Spain). We used a gradient of past deforestation intensity crossed with two levels of average annual precipitation, one of them at the lower limit of the species' precipitation niche (semi-arid) and the other at the optimum (sub-humid). We also examined the association between recruits and nurse plants and the effect on this association of plot-scale factors, such as seed abundance (reproductive Q. ilex), microsites (nurse species and soil availability), and large herbivores. The increase in aridity in the last decades has drastically reduced the recruitment of new individuals in the forests of Q. ilex located in the lower limit of their precipitation niche, regardless of the intensity of past deforestation that they suffered. Recruitment in these climatic conditions depends almost exclusively on large trees and shrubs whose abundance may also be limited by aridity. The lack of regeneration questions the future of these populations, as the number of individuals will decrease over time despite the strong resistance of adult trees to disturbance and drought."
https://openalex.org/W3092877632,"A human cadaveric specimen-specific knee model with appropriate soft tissue constraints was developed to appropriately simulate the biomechanical environment in the human knee, in order to pre-clinically evaluate the biomechanical and tribological performance of soft tissue interventions. Four human cadaveric knees were studied in a natural knee simulator under force control conditions in the anterior posterior (AP) and tibial rotation (TR) axes, using virtual springs to replicate the function of soft tissues. The most appropriate spring constraints for each knee were determined by comparing the kinematic outputs in terms of AP displacement and TR angle of the human knee with all the soft tissues intact, to the same knee with all the soft tissues resected and replaced with virtual spring constraints (spring rate and free length/degree). The virtual spring conditions that showed the least difference in the AP displacement and TR angle outputs compared to the intact knee were considered to be the most appropriate spring conditions for each knee. The resulting AP displacement and TR angle profiles under the appropriate virtual spring conditions all showed similar shapes to the individual intact knee for each donor. This indicated that the application of the combination of virtual AP and TR springs with appropriate free lengths/degrees was successful in simulating the natural human knee soft tissue function. Each human knee joint had different kinematics as a result of variations in anatomy and soft tissue laxity. The most appropriate AP spring rate for the four human knees varied from 20 to 55 N/mm and the TR spring rate varied from 0.3 to 1.0 Nm/°. Consequently, the most appropriate spring condition for each knee was unique and required specific combinations of spring rate and free length/degree in each of the two axes."
https://openalex.org/W3093043085,"In high-income countries, emerging research suggests sibling bereavement can have significant health and life course consequences for young people. Yet, we know far less about its burden in lower-income countries. Due to higher fertility and mortality in lower-income countries, the level, timing, intensity, and circumstances surrounding sibling mortality are likely to follow patterns distinct from those in higher-income settings. Thus, in this study, we offer a descriptive overview of sibling death in 43 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we analyze Demographic and Health Survey data from nationally representative samples of 352,930 15- to 34-year-old women, born between 1985 and 2003, to document experiences of sibling death before age 25. On average, roughly one-third of individuals report a deceased sibling in these countries; estimates reach 40–50% of respondents in multiple African countries, particularly those that have experienced conflict and war. Although some sibling deaths occurred before the focal respondent was born, most bereaved individuals recalled a death during their lifetime—often in late childhood/early adolescence. High proportions of bereaved respondents report multiple sibling deaths, highlighting the clustering of deaths within families. Even so, bereaved individuals tend to come from large families and thus frequently have a comparable number of surviving siblings as people who never experienced a sibling die. Together, the results offer a window into global inequality in childhood experiences, and they attest to the need for research that explores the implications of sibling mortality for young people in world regions where the experience is concentrated."
https://openalex.org/W3093091905,"The general public is increasingly aware of the role of genes in causing depression. Recent studies have begun uncovering unintended negative consequences of learning about a person’s genetic susceptibility to disorders. Because people tend to believe that genes determine one’s identity, having genes related to a disorder can be misinterpreted as equivalent to having the disorder. Consequently, learning that a person is genetically predisposed to depression can make people misremember mild depression as more severe. Participants across three experiments read a target vignette about a character displaying mild depressive symptoms, while descriptions of the character’s genetic susceptibility to depression were experimentally manipulated. Participants then read a foil vignette describing a character with more severe depressive symptoms. Afterwards, participants who had learned that the target character was genetically predisposed to depression were comparatively more likely to misremember the target symptoms as being severe, when in fact they were mild. This pattern of results was obtained among both laypeople (Experiments 1 and 2) and practicing master’s-level, but not doctoral-level, mental health clinicians (Experiment 3). Given that depression is diagnosed primarily based on a person’s memory of depressive symptoms, the current findings suggest that genetic information about depression may lead to over-diagnosis of depression."
https://openalex.org/W3093187729,"Background Surgical site infection is a major perioperative issue. The morbidity of surgical site infection is high in major digestive surgery, such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. The comprehensive risk factors, including anesthetic factors, for surgical site infection in pancreaticoduodenectomy are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the perioperative and anesthetic risk factors of surgical site infection in pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single tertiary care center. A total of 326 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between January 2009 and March 2018 were evaluated. Patients who underwent resection of other organs were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of surgical site infection, based on a Clavien-Dindo classification of grade 2 or higher. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between surgical site infection and perioperative and anesthetic factors. Results Of the 326 patients, 116 (35.6%) were women. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range; 64–75). The median duration of surgery was 10.9 hours (interquartile range; 9.5–12.4). Surgical site infection occurred in 60 patients (18.4%). The multivariable analysis revealed that the use of desflurane as a maintenance anesthetic was associated with a significantly lower risk of surgical site infection than sevoflurane (odds ratio, 0.503; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.260–0.973). In contrast, the duration of surgery (odds ratio, 1.162; 95% CI, 1.017–1.328), cerebrovascular disease (odds ratio, 3.544; 95% CI, 1.326–9.469), and ischemic heart disease (odds ratio, 10.839; 95% CI, 1.887–62.249) were identified as significant risk factors of surgical site infection. Conclusions Desflurane may be better than sevoflurane in preventing surgical site infection in pancreaticoduodenectomy. Cerebrovascular disease and ischemic heart disease are potential newly-identified risk factors of surgical site infection in pancreaticoduodenectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3092728787,"Herbicide application is crucial for weed management in most crop production systems, but for sorghum herbicide options are limited. Sorghum is sensitive to residual protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)-inhibiting herbicides, such as fomesafen, and a long re-entry period is required before sorghum can be planted after its application. Improving sorghum for tolerance to such residual herbicides would allow for increased sorghum production and the expansion of herbicide options for growers. In this study, we observed sorghum tolerance to residual fomesafen. To investigate the underlying tolerance mechanism a genome-wide association mapping study was conducted using field-collected sorghum biomass panel (SBP) data, and a greenhouse assay was developed to confirm the field phenotypes. A total of 26 significant SNPs (FDR<0.05), spanning a 215.3 kb region on chromosome 3, were detected. The ten most significant SNPs included two in genic regions (Sobic.003G136800, and Sobic.003G136900) and eight SNPs in the intergenic region encompassing the genes Sobic.003G136700, Sobic.003G136800, Sobic.003G137000, Sobic.003G136900, and Sobic.003G137100. The gene Sobic.003G137100 (PPXI), which encodes the PPO1 enzyme, one of the targets of PPO-inhibiting herbicides, was located 12kb downstream of the significant SNP S03_13152838. We found that PPXI is highly conserved in sorghum and expression does not significantly differ between tolerant and sensitive sorghum lines. Our results suggest that PPXI most likely does not underlie the observed herbicide tolerance. Instead, the mechanism underlying herbicide tolerance in the SBP is likely metabolism-based resistance, possibly regulated by the action of multiple genes. Further research is necessary to confirm candidate genes and their functions."
https://openalex.org/W3093239070,"In pre-colonial and colonial times Côte d'Ivoire probably hosted one of the largest elephant populations in West Africa, resulting in the country's name Côte d'Ivoire (in English Ivory Coast) by French settlers. Numbers declined and by the early 90s it was estimated that the total number of both savannah and forest elephants had reached 63 to 360 elephants in the entire country. Here we present updated information on the distribution and conservation status of forest elephant in Côte d'Ivoire based on multiple sources-dung counts on line transects, records of human-elephant conflict, media reports, sign and interview surveys-obtained during the period 2011-2017. We used Pearson correlation to determine the correlation between the presence of forest elephant and site variables (size of the forest, percentage of area converted into plantation, size of the forest left, size of human population inside the PA, poaching index, distance to the nearest road, population density in the Department, level of protection of the PA). To examine the effect of ecological traits on elephant extirpation, we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to check for multicollinearity among variables. Based on dung count elephant presence was confirmed in only 4 of the 25 protected areas surveyed. PAs with higher level of protection have higher probability to be home of elephant population. The viability of these populations is uncertain, since they have a small size and are isolated. Aggressive conservation actions including law enforcement for the protection of their remaining habitat and ranger patrolling are needed to protect the remaining forest elephant populations."

Methods Wide protocol scan (with a field of view of 12x9 cm) from Triton SS-OCT instrument (Topcon Corporation, Japan) was performed 463 heathy eyes from 463 healthy controls. This protocol allows to measure the thickness of the following layers: Retina, Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), Ganglion cell layer (GCL +), GCL++ and choroid. In those layers, mean thickness was compared in four groups of ages: Group 1 (71 healthy subjects aged between 20 and 34 years); Group 2 (65 individuals aged 35–49 years), Group 3 (230 healthy controls aged 50–64 years) and Group 4 (97 healthy subjects aged 65–79 years). Results The most significant thinning of all retinal layers occurs particularly in the transition from group 2 to group 3, especially in temporal superior quadrant at RNFL, GCL++ and retinal layers (p≤0.001), and temporal superior, temporal inferior, and temporal half in choroid layer (p<0.001). Curiously group 2 when compared with group 1 presents a significant thickening of RNFL in temporal superior quadrant (p = 0.001), inferior (p<0.001) and temporal (p = 0.001) halves, and also in nasal half in choroid layer (p = 0.001). Conclusions Excepting the RNFL, which shows a thickening until the third decade of life, the rest of the layers seem to have a physiological progressive thinning."
https://openalex.org/W3093397119,"Background Dystocia is one of the most common causes of cesarean section in nulliparous women. Studies have described the presence of vitamin D receptors in the myometrium, but it is still unclear whether vitamin D affects the contractility of the smooth muscles. We therefore aimed to determine the association between the vitamin D serum level at labor and the risk of dystocia. Method We conducted a case-control study between January 2012 and June 2017. Cases were primiparous women, with spontaneous onset of labor, who gave birth by cesarean section due to dystocia. Controls were primiparous women with a spontaneous vaginal delivery. We included 60 women (30 cases and 30 controls) in the analysis. The differences between cases and controls were assessed using chi-squared test for categorical variables and two-sample t-test or unequal t-test for continuous variables, as appropriate, after evaluation of whether they followed the normal distributions. Results The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 53.1nmol/l (95%CI; 45.2 to 60.9) among cases and 69.9nmol/l (95%CI; 57.5 to 82.4) among controls (P = 0.02). The mean plasma parathyroid hormone levels were 2.25 pmol/l and 2.38, respectively (P = 0.57). Even though 78% of all women reported taking a minimum of 10μg/day of vitamin D throughout pregnancy, 43% had vitamin D insufficiency, defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 50nmol/l. Conclusions In a Danish group of women having a cesarean section due to dystocia, we found decreased vitamin D levels."
https://openalex.org/W3093079021,"A PVL-positive, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from pus from cervical lymphadenitis of a patient of East-African origin. Microarray hybridisation assigned the isolate to clonal complex (CC) 80 but revealed unusual features, including the presence of the ORF-CM14 enterotoxin homologue and of an ACME-III element as well as the absence of etD and edinB. The isolate was subjected to both, Illumina and Nanopore sequencing allowing characterisation of deviating regions within the strain´s genome. Atypical features of this strain were attributable to the presence of two genomic regions that originated from other S. aureus lineages and that comprised, respectively, 3% and 1.4% of the genome. One deviating region extended from walJ to sirB. It comprised ORF-CM14 and the ACME-III element. A homologous but larger fragment was also found in an atypical S. aureus CC1/ST567 strain whose lineage might have served as donor of this genomic region. This region itself is a chimera comprising fragments from CC1 as well as fragments of unknown origin. The other deviating region comprised the region from htsB to ecfA2, i.e., another 3% of the genome. It was very similar to CC1 sequences. Either this suggests an incorporation of CC1 DNA into the study strain, or alternatively a recombination event affecting ""canonical"" CC80. Thus, the study strain bears witness of several recombination events affecting supposedly core genomic genes. Although the exact mechanism is not yet clear, such chimerism seems to be an additional pathway in the evolution of S. aureus. This could facilitate also a transmission of virulence and resistance factors and therefore offer an additional evolutionary advantage."
https://openalex.org/W3093187278,"Emotional flexibility advancement has been found to be highly effective in clinical settings to treat, for example, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Developing these skills in the working context has also shown very encouraging results in public sector settings. Also, a few studies have revealed effectiveness in a private sector setting, but no studies have yet looked at the effectiveness of developing these skills amongst high-paced, high-demanding, and highly-educated knowledge workers. In this pilot training intervention study, we report evidence that emotional flexibility can be developed in this context. We conducted an experiment with treatment and control groups, with only the treatment group receiving an emotional flexibility training. Emotional flexibility improved significantly for the treatment group, whereas the improvements were minimal or negative for the control group. Furthermore, we reveal that General self-efficacy improved amongst treatment group participants (and not for control group participants), and that this is associated with emotional flexibility. Finally, we show that the improvements were higher for participants starting from a lower baseline."

Recently, perfusion MRI techniques have demonstrated associations molecular alterations. In this work, we investigated whether perfusion markers within infiltrated peripheral edema were associated with proneural, mesenchymal, classical and neural subtypes.ONCOhabitats open web services were used to obtain the cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema for MRI studies of 50 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive: TCGA-GBM. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were carried out in order to assess the association between vascular features and the Verhaak subtypes. For assessing specific differences, Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted. Finally, the association of overall survival with molecular and vascular features was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox models.ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests for the maximum cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema between the four subclasses yielded false discovery rate corrected p-values of <0.001 and 0.02, respectively. This vascular feature was significantly higher (p = 0.0043) in proneural patients compared to the rest of the subtypes while conducting Mann-Whitney U-test. The multivariate Cox model pointed to redundant information provided by vascular features at the peripheral edema and proneural subtype when analyzing overall survival.Higher relative cerebral blood volume at infiltrated peripheral edema is associated with proneural glioblastoma subtype suggesting underlying vascular behavior related to molecular composition in that area."
https://openalex.org/W3092978619,"The development of retinal blood vessels has extensively been used as a model to study vascular pattern formation. To date, various quantitative measurements, such as size distribution have been performed, but the relationship between pattern formation mechanisms and these measurements remains unclear. In the present study, we first focus on the islands (small regions subdivided by the capillary network). We quantitatively measured the island size distribution in the retinal vascular network and found that it tended to exhibit an exponential distribution. We were able to recapitulate this distribution pattern in a theoretical model by implementing the stochastic disappearance of vessel segments around arteries could reproduce the observed exponential distribution of islands. Second, we observed that the diameter distribution of the retinal artery segment obeyed a power law. We theoretically showed that an equal bifurcation branch pattern and Murray's law could reproduce this pattern. This study demonstrates the utility of examining size distribution for understanding the mechanisms of vascular pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W3092925249,"Dispersal of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.), a keystone species of many high-elevation ecosystems in western North America, depends on Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana Wilson), a seed-caching bird with an affinity for whitebark seeds. To the extent that this dependence is mutual, declines in whitebark seed production could cause declines in nutcracker abundance. Whitebark pine is in decline across much of its range due to interacting stressors, including the non-native pathogen white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J. C. Fisch.). We used avian point-count data and tree surveys from four national park units to investigate whether trends in whitebark pine can explain trends in Clark's nutcracker. Spatial trends were modeled using recent data from two parks, while temporal trends were modeled using longer time-series of nutcracker and whitebark data from two additional parks. To assess the potential dependence of nutcrackers on whitebark, we linked a model of nutcracker density (accounting for detection probability) with a model of whitebark trends, using a Bayesian framework to translate uncertainty in whitebark metrics to uncertainty in nutcracker density. In Mount Rainier National Park, temporal models showed dramatic declines in nutcracker density concurrent with significant increases in whitebark crown mortality and trees infected with white pine blister rust. However, nutcrackers did not trend with whitebark metrics in North Cascades National Park Service Complex. In spatial models of data from Yosemite National Park and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, nutcracker density varied not only with local cover of whitebark but also with elevation and, in Sequoia-Kings Canyon, with cover of another species of white pine. Our results add support for the hypothesis that the mutualism between whitebark pine and Clark's nutcracker is vulnerable to disruption by blister rust, and our approach integrates data across monitoring programs to explore trends in species interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3092959120,"Introduction One third of the world population has been exposed to hepatitis B virus and an estimated 257 million people are chronically infected. The main route of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is vertical transmission. Post exposure prophylaxis is recommended by world health organization to have free Hepatitis B infection by 2030. Objective The main purpose of this research project was to assess Hepatitis B virus post exposure prophylaxis coverage, rate of vertical transmission and factors among exposed newborns delivered at Arsi zone health institution. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Arsi zone health institutions among hepatitis B virus exposed newborns delivered at Arsi zone health institutions from January 2018 to September 2019. Systematic sampling technique was used to select 422 exposed newborns into the study. A pre-tested structured questionnaire and checklist were used to collect relevant data. Data was entered and cleaned using epidata7 & analyzed using SPSS version 25 software package. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses was carried out to identify associations. Odds ratio with 95% CI and P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The study revealed that among 401 exposed newborns only 83(20.7%), have been administered post exposure prophylaxis. But vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was observed in 32.4% (27.9%-36.9%) exposed newborns. Antenatal (ANC) attendance (AOR = .40, 95%CI = .23-.69), Instrumental delivery (AOR = 4.18, 95%CI = 2.05–8.51) HIV coinfection (AOR = 9.7, 95%CI = 4.37–21.34), Post exposure Prophylaxis (AOR = .20, 95%CI = .08-.50) and Knowledge on HBV (AOR = .27, 95%CI = .14-.53) are significant predictors of HBV vertical transmission. Conclusion Magnitude of HBV post exposure prophylaxis coverage is very low while Rate of vertical transmission is high. Antenatal attendance, Instrumental delivery, Post exposure Prophylaxis and Knowledge on hepatitis B virus transmission are significant predictors of HBV vertical transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3093277927,"Dedifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (DDEC) is a rare but highly aggressive type of endometrial cancer, in which an undifferentiated carcinoma arises from a low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. The low-grade component is often eclipsed, likely due to an outgrowth of the undifferentiated component, and the tumor may appear as a pure undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (UEC). We and others have recently identified inactivating mutations of SMARCA4, SMARCB1 or ARID1B, subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, that are unique to the undifferentiated component and are present in a large portion of DDEC and UEC. However, the understanding of whether and how these mutations drive cancer progression and histologic dedifferentiation is hindered by lack of cell line models of DDEC or UEC. Here, we established the first UEC cell line, VOA1066, which is highly tumorigenic in vivo. This cell line has a stable genome with very few somatic mutations, which do include inactivating mutations of ARID1A and ARID1B (2 mutations each), and a heterozygous hotspot DICER1 mutation in its RNase IIIb domain. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the loss of ARID1B, but ARID1A staining was retained due to the presence of a truncating non-functional ARID1A protein. The heterozygous DICER1 hotspot mutation has little effect on microRNA biogenesis. No additional DICER1 hotspot mutations have been identified in a cohort of 33 primary tumors. Therefore, we have established the first UEC cell line with dual inactivation of both ARID1A and ARID1B as the main genomic feature. This cell line will be useful for studying the roles of ARID1A and ARID1B mutations in the development of UEC."

Color vision is based on the differential color sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors, however the developmental programs that control photoreceptor cell differentiation and specify color sensitivity are poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, there is evidence that the color sensitivity of different photoreceptors in the compound eye is regulated by inductive signals between cells, but the exact nature of these signals and how they are propagated remains unknown. We conducted a genetic screen to identify additional regulators of this process and identified a novel mutation in the hibris gene, which encodes an irre cell recognition module protein (IRM). These immunoglobulin super family cell adhesion molecules include human KIRREL and nephrin (NPHS1). hibris is expressed dynamically in the developing Drosophila melanogaster eye and loss-of-function mutations give rise to a diverse range of mutant phenotypes including disruption of the specification of R8 photoreceptor cell diversity. We demonstrate that hibris is required within the retina, and that hibris over-expression is sufficient to disrupt normal photoreceptor cell patterning. These findings suggest an additional layer of complexity in the signaling process that produces paired expression of opsin genes in adjacent R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells."

We present results from brain networks built from functional magnetic resonance images during finger tapping paradigm. Pearson voxel-voxel correlation in time and frequency domains were performed for all subjects. Besides this standard framework we have implemented a new approach consisting in filtering the data with respect to the fMRI paradigm (finger tapping) in order to obtain a better understanding of the network involved in the execution of the task. The main topological graph measures have been compared in both cases: voxel-voxel correlation and voxel-paradigm filtering plus voxel-voxel correlation. With the standard voxel-voxel correlation a clearly free-scale network was obtained. On the other hand, when we prefiltered the paradigm we obtained two different kind of networks: 1) free-scale; 2) random-like. To our best knowledge, this behaviour is reported here for first time for brain networks. We suggest that paradigm signal prefiltering can provide more infomation about the brain networks."

Scholars are appointed as evaluators and can apply self-defined quality standards in order to overcome shortcomings of standardized measures. Even though there are no binding criteria in these procedures and the quality standards of the scholars' disciplines vary, studies suggest that scholars, in their role as government-appointed research evaluators, assess research uniformly.By drawing on a small-N investigation, this study compares the quality standards scholars apply as government-appointed research evaluators with quality standards they follow as researchers. The study points to a paradox: Criteria scholars refer to while describing the excellence of their own research and criteria they use as evaluators differ and contradict each other. The results are discussed from different angles."
https://openalex.org/W3093212645,"Background Goal 3.2 from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) calls for reductions in national averages of Under-5 Mortality. However, it is well known that within countries these reductions can coexist with left behind populations that have mortality rates higher than national averages. To measure inequality in under-5 mortality and to identify left behind populations, mortality rates are often disaggregated by socioeconomic status within countries. While socioeconomic disparities are important, this approach does not quantify within group variability since births from the same socioeconomic group may have different mortality risks. This is the case because mortality risk depends on several risk factors and their interactions and births from the same socioeconomic group may have different risk factor combinations. Therefore mortality risk can be highly variable within socioeconomic groups. We develop a comprehensive approach using information from multiple risk factors simultaneously to measure inequality in mortality and to identify left behind populations. Methods We use Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data on 1,691,039 births from 182 different surveys from 67 low and middle income countries, 51 of which had at least two surveys. We estimate mortality risk for each child in the data using a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression model. We include commonly used risk factors for monitoring inequality in early life mortality for the SDG as well as their interactions. We quantify variability in mortality risk within and between socioeconomic groups and describe the highest risk sub-populations. Findings For all countries there is more variability in mortality within socioeconomic groups than between them. Within countries, socioeconomic membership usually explains less than 20% of the total variation in mortality risk. In contrast, country of birth explains 19% of the total variance in mortality risk. Targeting the 20% highest risk children based on our model better identifies under-5 deaths than targeting the 20% poorest. For all surveys, we report efficiency gains from 26% in Mali to 578% in Guyana. High risk births tend to be births from mothers who are in the lowest socioeconomic group, live in rural areas and/or have already experienced a prior death of a child. Interpretation While important, differences in under-5 mortality across socioeconomic groups do not explain most of overall inequality in mortality risk because births from the same socioeconomic groups have different mortality risks. Similarly, policy makers can reach the highest risk children by targeting births based on several risk factors (socioeconomic status, residing in rural areas, having a previous death of a child and more) instead of using a single risk factor such as socioeconomic status. We suggest that researchers and policy makers monitor inequality in under-5 mortality using multiple risk factors simultaneously, quantifying inequality as a function of several risk factors to identify left behind populations in need of policy interventions and to help monitor progress toward the SDG."
