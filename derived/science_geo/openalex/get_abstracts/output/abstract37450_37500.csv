https://openalex.org/W2079335891,"While developing an assay to measure the activity of the tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), we discovered that the purified protein could be taken up by cells growing in tissue culture and subsequently trans-activate the viral promoter. Trans-activation is dramatically increased by a variety of lysosomotrophic agents. For example, trans-activation can be detected at tat concentrations as low as 1 nM in the presence of chloroquine. Experiments using radioactive protein show that tat becomes localized to the nucleus after uptake and suggest that chloroquine protects tat from proteolytic degradation. These results raise the possibility that, under some conditions, tat might act as a viral growth factor to stimulate viral replication in latently infected cells or alter expression of cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W1997031088,"Erythropoietin (Epo), the hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, is synthesized in the kidney and liver in response to hypoxia. The human hepatoma cell line Hep3B regulates its production of Epo in a physiologic manner. Either hypoxia or cobalt chloride markedly increases expression of Epo mRNA as well as production of biologically active and immunologically distinct Epo protein. New protein synthesis is required before the induction of increased levels of hypoxia- or cobalt-induced Epo mRNA. Hypoxia, cobalt chloride, and nickel chloride appear to stimulate Epo production through a common pathway. The inhibition of Epo production at low partial pressures of oxygen by carbon monoxide provides evidence that a heme protein is integrally involved in the oxygen-sensing mechanism. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that when heme synthesis is blocked, hypoxia-, cobalt-, and nickel-induced Epo production are all markedly inhibited. A model is proposed in which a ligand-dependent conformational change in a heme protein accounts for the mechanism by which hypoxia as well as cobalt and nickel stimulate the production of Epo."
https://openalex.org/W2031667205,"The cloning of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) cDNAs provides a basis for understanding the actions of glucocorticoids in the central nervous system. Structural evidence is presented for the identity of the type I corticosteroid binding site as the MR expressed in the brain. This identification is supported by the anatomical distribution of MR mRNA, determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry, which parallels the steroid autoradiographic localization of the type I sites. An in vitro assay for MR and GR function demonstrates that these receptors respond to different levels of glucocorticoid, suggesting that together they confer a larger dynamic range of sensitivity to this hormone. These studies lead to a new hypothesis for glucocorticoid action in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2086992071,"Hypocalcemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a human genetic disease resulting from target organ resistance to the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Two families with affected children homozygous for this autosomal recessive disorder were studied for abnormalities in the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its gene. Although the receptor displays normal binding of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone, VDR from affected family members has a decreased affinity for DNA. Genomic DNA isolated from these families was subjected to oligonucleotide-primed DNA amplification, and each of the nine exons encoding the receptor protein was sequenced for a genetic mutation. In each family, a different single nucleotide mutation was found in the DNA binding domain of the protein; one family near the tip of the first zinc finger (Gly→Asp) and one at the tip of the second zinc finger (Arg→Gly). The mutant residues were created in vitro by oligonucleotide directed point mutagenesis of wild-type VDR complementary DNA and this cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells. The produced protein is biochemically indistinguishable from the receptor isolated from patients."
https://openalex.org/W2086605270,"Nucleosome depletion can be made to occur in yeast by addition of glucose to strains containing the histone H4 gene under GAL promoter control. This leads to the activation of downstream promoter elements (TATA box and initiation, I, region) of three different regulated yeast promoters fused to the E. coli lacZ gene. Nucleosome loss activates the PHO5 downstream element in the presence or absence of the upstream activator sequences (UAS) through which PHO5 induction is normally mediated. The cytochrome C (CYC1) and galactokinase (GAL1) promoters are normally repressed by glucose through their UAS elements. However, when these UAS are deleted, the remaining downstream promoters are also activated by glucose-mediated nucleosome loss. These data suggest that nucleosome loss increases transcription initiation and subsequent elongation in vivo. They also indicate that the proteins which recognize the downstream promoter are activated and functional, at least in part, even in the absence of the UAS complex."

https://openalex.org/W2071230662,"Pharmacological properties of pre- and postsynaptic GABAB receptors were compared in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro. The postsynaptic effects mediated by GABAB receptors, i.e., the baclofen-induced hyperpolarization, the bicuculline-resistant GABA response, and the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential elicited by CA1 afferent stimulation, are all blocked by pertussis toxin (which inactivates some G proteins). These events are also suppressed by stimulating protein kinase C by phorbol esters and blocked by the selective GABAB antagonist phaclofen. In contrast, the baclofen-induced presynaptic depression of the excitatory post-synaptic potential elicited by CA1 afferent stimulation is resistant to the action of pertussis toxin and is not antagonized by phaclofen. However, this presynaptic inhibition can be antagonized by phorbol esters. These results indicate that the pre- and postsynaptic effects mediated by GABAB receptors in hippocampus have distinctly different pharmacological properties and possibly a different coupling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2082777494,"Receptor-mediated interactions between neurons and astroglia are likely to play a crucial role in the growth and guidance of CNS axons. Using antibodies to neuronal cell surface proteins, we identified two receptor systems mediating neurite outgrowth on cultured astrocytes. N-cadherin, a Ca2(+)-dependent cell adhesion molecule, functions prominently in the outgrowth of neurites on astrocytes by E8 and E14 chick ciliary ganglion (CG) neurons. beta 1-class integrin ECM receptor heterodimers function less prominently in E8 and not at all in E14 neurite outgrowth on astrocytes. The lack of effect of integrin beta 1 antibodies on E14 neurite outgrowth reflects an apparent loss of integrin function, as assayed by E14 neuronal attachment and process outgrowth on laminin. N-CAM appeared not to be required for neurite outgrowth by either E8 or E14 neurons. Since N-cadherin and integrin beta 1 antibodies together virtually eliminated E8 CG neurite outgrowth on cultured astrocytes, these two neuronal receptors are probably important in regulating axon growth on astroglia in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2004002713,"We have constructed a full-length rat brain Na+ channel alpha subunit cDNA that differs from the previously reported alpha subunit of Noda et al. at 6 amino acid positions. Transcription of the cDNA in vitro and injection into Xenopus oocytes resulted in the synthesis of functional Na+ channels. Although the single-channel conductance of the channels resulting from cloned cDNA was the same as that of channels resulting from injection of rat brain RNA, we observed two significant differences in the gating properties of the channels. The Na+ currents from cloned cDNA displayed much slower macroscopic inactivation compared with those from rat brain mRNA. In addition, the current-voltage relationship for currents from cloned cDNA was shifted 20-25 mV in the depolarizing direction compared with currents from rat brain RNA. Coinjection of low MW rat brain RNA restored normal inactivation of the channels indicating the presence of a component, either a structural subunit of the channel complex or a modifying enzyme, necessary for normal gating of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1985723318,"Recent studies show that the nervous system contains many molecularly distinct cell types. Clonal cell marking experiments demonstrate that different cell types in some areas of the CNS are products of a multipotential stem cell. The factors controlling the differentiation of vertebrate CNS precursor cells would be more accessible to molecular analysis if cell lines with precursor properties could be established. Here we show that cell lines expressing an antigenic marker specific for a major brain precursor cell population can be established from rat cerebellum. We demonstrate that cell lines express the precursor, neuronal or glial properties depending on the growth conditions. This work supports the view that brain precursor cells expressing the marker Rat 401 are multipotential and can differentiate into cells with either neuronal or glial properties. Cell lines capable of differentiation should be useful in defining the signaling systems generating the cell types of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1559981481,"The replication of simian virus 40 origin-containing DNA has been reconstituted in vitro with SV40 large T antigen and purified proteins isolated from HeLa cells. Covalently closed circular DNA (RF I') daughter molecules are formed in the presence of T antigen, a single-stranded DNA binding protein and DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex, together with ribonuclease H, DNA ligase, topoisomerase II, and a double-stranded specific exonuclease that has been purified to homogeneity. The 44-kDa exonuclease-digested oligo(rA) annealed to poly(dT) in the 5'----3' direction. DNA ligase and the 5'----3' exonuclease were essential for RF I' formation. Covalently closed circular duplex DNA and full length linear single-stranded DNA were detected by alkaline gel electrophoresis as products of the complete system. DNA replication in the absence of either DNA ligase or the 5'----3' exonuclease yielded DNA products that were half length (approximately 1500 nucleotides) and smaller Okazaki-like fragments (approximately 200 nucleotides). Hybridization experiments showed that the longer chains were synthesized from the leading strand template, while the small products were synthesized from the lagging strand template. These results suggest that the RNA primers attached to 5' ends of replicated DNA are completely removed by the 5'----3' exonuclease, with the assistance of RNase H."
https://openalex.org/W2041691243,"Paralyzed motors of motA and motB point and deletion mutants of Escherichia coli were repaired by synthesis of wild-type protein. As found earlier with a point mutant of motB, torque was restored in a series of equally spaced steps. The size of the steps was the same for both MotA and MotB. Motors with one torque generator spent more time spinning counterclockwise than did motors with two or more generators. In deletion mutants, stepwise decreases in torque, rare in point mutants, were common. Several cells stopped accelerating after eight steps, suggesting that the maximum complement of torque generators is eight. Each generator appears to contain both MotA and MotB."
https://openalex.org/W2067529350,"After initial activation by Ca2+, the catalytic activity of type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase rapidly becomes partially independent of Ca2+. The transition is caused by autophosphorylation of a few subunits in the dodecameric holoenzyme, which is composed of varying proportions of two homologous types of subunits, alpha (50 kd) and beta (58-60 kd). We have identified one site in the alpha subunit (Thr286) and two in the beta subunit (Thr287 and Thr382) that are rapidly autophosphorylated. We show that phosphorylation of alpha-Thr286 and beta-Thr287, which are located immediately adjacent to the calmodulin binding domain, controls Ca2(+)-independent activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of beta-Thr382 is not required to maintain Ca2+ independence. It is absent in the alpha subunit and is selectively removed from the minor beta' subunit, apparently by alternative splicing. Regulation of the presence of beta-Thr382 in the holoenzyme by both differential gene expression and alternative splicing suggests that it may have an important but highly specialized function."
https://openalex.org/W2011383191,"Hybridization probes from the transmembrane region of the chick NGF receptor (NGF-R) that show high homology with the rat NGF-R were used to demonstrate an abundant 4.5 kb NGF-R mRNA in the chick embryo at E3.5. The level remained high until E12 but decreased to adult levels by E18. The highest levels at E8 were in spinal cord, bursa of Fabricius, gizzard, femoralis muscle, and skin. In situ hybridization to E7 embryos showed high expression of the NGF-R gene in spinal cord, particularly the lateral motor column, and in dorsal root, sympathetic, and nodose ganglia. NGF-R mRNA expression was observed throughout brain development and in all regions of the adult brain, with high levels in cerebellum and septum. Lymphoid tissues of chick and rat also expressed the receptor. The complex and widespread expression of NGF-R mRNA in areas not known to be NGF targets suggests broader functions for NGF."
https://openalex.org/W2003209186,"We have studied the three-dimensional folding of the scaffolding in histone H1-depleted chromosomes by immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for topoisomerase II. Two different types of decondensed chromosomes are observed. The majority of the chromosomes are expanded, and the central fluorescence signal is surrounded by a large halo of chromatin. A much smaller number of chromosomes are more compact in length; they contain a smaller halo of chromatin and their scaffolds are not extended but folded into a genuine, quite regular helical coil. This conclusion is based on a three-dimensional structural analysis by optical sectioning. The number of helical coils is related to chromosome length. Surprisingly, sister chromatids have predominantly opposite helical handedness; that is, they are related by mirror symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2160803577,"The v-fms oncogene is capable of producing tumors in vivo and transforming cells in culture; in contrast, the c-fms proto-oncogene is nontransforming. In this report we present the complete nucleotide sequence of a feline c-fms cDNA, the progenitor of the v-fms oncogene. Comparison of this sequence with that of v-fms shows that the proteins encoded by these two genes differ by nine amino acid substitutions and the replacement of 50 C-terminal amino acids present in c-fms by 11 unrelated residues in v-fms. Using chimeric fms genes and site-directed mutagenesis, we have determined that the C-terminal modification present in v-fms is sufficient to generate a partially transforming phenotype, but that mutations at amino acid positions 301 and 374 are required (in addition to the C-terminal modification) to generate a fully transforming fms gene."
https://openalex.org/W1574524677,"The kinetics of human blood-brain barrier neutral amino acid transport sites are described using isolated human brain capillaries as an in vitro model of the human blood-brain barrier. Kinetic parameters of transport (Km, Vmax, and KD) were determined for eight large neutral amino acids. Km values ranged from 0.30 +/- 0.08 microM for phenylalanine to 8.8 +/- 4.6 microM for valine. The amino acid analogs N-methylaminoisobutyric acid and 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid were used as model substrates of the alanine- and leucine-preferring transport systems, respectively. Phenylalanine is transported solely by the L-system (which is sensitive to 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid), and leucine is transported equally by the L- and ASC-system (which is sodium-dependent and N-methylaminoisobutyric acid-independent). Dose-dependent inhibition of the high affinity transport system by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid is demonstrated for phenylalanine, similar to the known sensitivity of blood-brain barrier transport in vivo. The Km values for the human brain capillary in vitro correlate significantly (r = 0.83, p less than 0.01) with the Km values for the rat brain capillary in vivo. The results show that the affinity of human blood-brain barrier neutral amino acid transport is very high, i.e. very low Km compared to plasma amino acid concentrations. This provides a physical basis for the selective vulnerability of the human brain to derangements in amino acid availability caused by a selective hyperaminoacidemia, e.g. hyperphenylalaninemia."
https://openalex.org/W2019781968,"Specific oligonucleotide probes have been used to visualize the regional and cellular distribution of the mRNAs encoding three structurally distinct GABAA receptor alpha subunits in bovine brain. In situ hybridization analysis showed that these transcripts differ in distribution and in relative abundance. In frontal cortex the alpha 1 and alpha 2 transcripts are most abundant in layers II-IV, whereas the alpha 3 mRNA is most abundant in layers V and VI. In the hippocampal complex, the alpha transcripts are differentially distributed in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. The alpha 2 transcript is enriched in the dentate gyrus and CA4/CA3 regions of the hippocampus. In the cerebellum, essentially only the alpha 1 transcript is detectable in granule cells, Purkinje cells, and stellate/basket cells. These results suggest that the different alpha subunits represent components of distinct GABAA receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2035075199,"A type II DNA topoisomerase (topollmt), purified to near homogeneity from the trypanosomatid C. fasciculata has been shown to be localized to the single mitochondrion of these kinetoplastid protozoa. Immunoblots show at least a 10-fold higher level of topollmt (per milligram of protein) in preparations of partially purified mitochondria as compared with those from whole cells. Analyses of type I and type II topoisomerase activities in both mitochondrial and whole cell extracts show a 4- to 5-fold higher specific activity of topollmt in mitochondrial extracts while a nuclear type I topoisomerase has a 4- to 5-fold lower specific activity in the same extract. Immunolocalizations using anti-topollmt antibodies show the enzyme to be present in close association with the mitochondrial DNA networks (kinetoplast DNA or kDNA). This association appears at two distinct locations on opposite sides of the kDNA network."
https://openalex.org/W2094612041,"Brain type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is a holoenzyme composed of several copies each of three subunits, alpha (50 kd), beta (60 kd), and beta' (58 kd), in varying proportions. The deduced amino acid sequences of alpha (reported here) and beta are highly similar but not identical. The major difference between them is the deletion from alpha of two short segments (residues 316-339 and 354-392 in beta). cDNAs that appear to encode beta' are identical to beta except for the deletion of a segment encoding residues 378-392. Thus, the structural differences among alpha, beta, and beta' arise primarily from deletions (or insertions) in a variable region lying immediately carboxyl to the protein kinase and calmodulin-binding domains. The alpha and beta subunits are encoded by distinct genes expressed primarily, if not exclusively, in brain. Rather than being encoded by a third gene, beta' may arise by alternative splicing of the beta gene transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1993000960,"Biochemical and immunological studies indicate that the GABAA receptor contains at least two types of subunit. Here we report that coexpression of two GABAA receptor subunit clones (α and β) in Xenopus oocytes yields receptors with many biophysical properties of native GABAA receptors. These include ion selectivity, multiple single-channel conductance states, voltagedependent gating and rectification, and complex desensitization kinetics. Furthermore, the receptors are competitively inhibited by bicuculline and display the expected allosteric and agonist effects of the barbiturate pentobarbital. The expressed receptors, however, appear to be activated by one molecule of GAGA instead of two and fail to show potentiation by benzodiazepines. This implies that an additional factor(s) or subunit(s) is required for the reconstitution of a fully functional GABAA receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1560422398,"Abstract The intracellular pH (pHi) of a rat parotid acinar preparation was monitored using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. Under resting (unstimulated) conditions both Na+/H+ exchange and CO2/HCO3- buffering contribute to the regulation of pHi. Muscarinic stimulation (carbachol) of the acini produced a gradual rise in pHi (approximately 0.1 unit by 10 min) possibly due to activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. When the exchanger was blocked by amiloride or sodium removal, carbachol induced a dramatic (atropine inhibitable) decrease in pHi (approximately 0.4 pH unit with t1/2 approximately 0.5 min at 1 mM carbachol). The rate of this acidification was reduced by removal of exogenous HCO3- and by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide. Also, acini stimulated with carbachol in Cl- -free solutions showed a more pronounced acidification than in the corresponding Cl- -replete media. Taken together, these data indicate that the carbachol-induced acidification of rat parotid acinar cells unmasked by inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger is due to a rapid loss of intracellular HCO3-. Carbachol induced acidification was inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker diphenylamine 2-carboxylate but not by 4-acetomido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, an inhibitor of Cl-/HCO3- exchange. In addition, this acidification could not be sustained in Ca2+-free media and was totally blocked by chelation of intracellular Ca2+. Interpreted in terms of HCO3- loss, these results closely parallel the pattern of carbachol-induced Cl- release from this same preparation and indicate that HCO3- is secreted in response to muscarinic stimulation via the same or a very similar exit pathway, presumably an apical anion channel. Under normal physiological conditions the intracellular acidification resulting from HCO3- secretion is buffered by the Na+/H+ exchanger."
https://openalex.org/W1968513558,"The expression of the mRNAs encoding the α and β subunits of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor was examined in the bovine cerebellum by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The α subunit mRNA, which encodes the benzodiazepine binding site, was localized in all Purkinje and granule cells and in some cells of the molecular layer. The distribution of the R subunit mRNA, which encodes the GAGA binding site, only partially overlapped With that of the α subunit mRNA. While cells in the granule cell layer expressed the β subunit mRNA, no message could be detected in other cell populations. These findings suggest that the subunit composition of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor is heterogeneous and that additional, as yet unidentified, β subunits exist."
https://openalex.org/W1996517472,"Cyclic GMP depresses Ba2+ current through highvoltage-activated Ca2+ channels (ICa∗) in acutely isolated hippocampal neurons. The effect is produced by intra-, but not extracellular, cGMP or by 5' GMP The membrane-permeant derivative, 8-Br-cGMP, produces a reversible suppression. The effect of 8-Br-cGMP is similar to phorbol ester-induced ICa∗ depression, except that ICa∗ depression due to 8-Br-cGMP is not blocked by protein kinase inhibitors H-8 or H-7, whereas phorbol ester effects are. The data suggest that cGMP depresses ICa∗ by a cGMP-kinase- and protein kinase C (PKC) independent mechanism. Cyclic AMP, which enhances ICa∗ and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, both antagonize ICa∗ depression induced by 8-Br-cGMP, but not that due to phorbol esters. Cyclic IMP, a more potent activator of phosphodiesterase than of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, is also a powerful depressant of ICa∗ We conclude that cGMP-induced depression of ICa∗. is mediated by activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with consequent reduction of intracellular cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1497575446,"A colony autoradiographic assay was used to identify nine Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in in situ ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity (ept mutants). Genetic analysis revealed five complementation groups. The EPT1 gene was cloned by complementation of ept1 using a yeast genomic library and was localized to a 2.1-kilobase region of DNA. An ept1 deletional mutant was constructed and introduced into the chromosome by integrative transformation. The ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities in membranes prepared from ept1 and ept2 mutants were reduced 30- to 90-fold and 2- to 3-fold compared with wild-type activity, respectively; the other ept mutants had activities similar to wild type. In strains transformed with a multicopy EPT1-bearing plasmid, a 22- to 33-fold overproduction of ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity was observed. The sn-1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase activities in membranes prepared from ept1 mutants were reduced 3.5- to 7-fold. In contrast to the residual CMP-sensitive cholinephosphotransferase activity observed in cpt1 mutants (Hjelmstad, R. H., and Bell, R. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3909-3917), the residual cholinephosphotransferase activity of ept1 mutants was CMP-insensitive. The cholinephosphotransferase activities in strains bearing the EPT1 gene on multicopy plasmids were elevated 13- to 23-fold and were CMP-sensitive. The data indicate that 1) the cloned EPT1 gene most likely represents the structural gene for the yeast ethanolaminephosphotransferase, 2) the EPT1 gene product possesses both ethanolamine- and cholinephosphotransferase activities, and 3) the EPT1 gene is nonessential for growth."
https://openalex.org/W1516782512,The activation mechanism through limited autolysis of a calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP) with a high sensitivity to calcium ions (microCANP) was analyzed. The rate of autolysis was dependent on microCANP concentration. The reaction was inhibited by high concentrations of digestible substrates but not by a nondigestible substrate. Incubation of microCANP inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide with a small amount of activated microCANP caused the degradation of the former in a manner similar to the autolysis of native microCANP. Immobilized microCANP bound to an anti-microCANP immunoglobulin G column autolyzed on addition of calcium ions. These results show that activation of microCANP through limited autolysis involves both intramolecular and intermolecular reactions.
https://openalex.org/W1975127012,"Acquisition of functional Na+ channels is a critical event in the development of a neuron because it allows the generation of conducted action potentials. alpha subunit mRNA is first detected in developing rat retina at 1% of its maximum level on embryonic day 15, 4 days after the first ganglion cells are formed. alpha subunit protein is detected in the axons of the ganglion cells at this time, but beta 1 subunits, beta 2 subunits, and high affinity saxitoxin binding sites are not detected until after birth. There is an approximately coordinate increase in alpha subunit mRNA, alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 subunit protein, assembled complexes of alpha, beta 1, and beta 2 subunits, and high affinity saxitoxin binding sites between postnatal days 7 and 21. Expression of alpha subunit genes is an early event in ganglion cell differentiation, and both gene transcription and posttranslational assembly are separate, rate-limiting steps in development of Na+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1509624717,"Cholera toxin pretreatment has been found to cause a 3-fold increase in the initial rate of antigen-stimulated secretion of serotonin from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Under similar conditions, cholera toxin enhances the antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium levels and causes a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of antigen-stimulated influx of 45Ca. In intact RBL cells cholera toxin pretreatment potentiates the antigen-stimulated production of inositol phosphates, but in permeabilized cells, with strongly buffered free calcium levels, no effect of cholera toxin pretreatment on the antigen-stimulated activation of cellular phospholipase activities is observed. In addition, pretreatment of cells with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate inhibits antigen-stimulated production of inositol phosphates by greater than 95%, while the stimulated influx of 45Ca remains unaffected. These data indicate that the antigen-stimulated influx of calcium into RBL cells can be dissociated from the production of inositol phosphates in these cells. The observed effects of cholera toxin on exocytosis and Ca2+ influx in RBL cells are not due to the elevation of cellular cyclic AMP levels since a variety of agents capable of elevating cellular cyclic AMP levels do not mimic these effects. Together, these data suggest that a cholera toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein is involved in the pathway responsible for the antigen-stimulated influx of calcium into RBL cells."
https://openalex.org/W1486830961,"Thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells produce platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a dose-dependent manner: the activation of a Ca2+-dependent lyso-PAF acetyltransferase is the rate-limiting step in this process. The present study shows that acetyltransferase activation and consequent PAF production induced by thrombin in human endothelial cells are markedly inhibited in Na+-free media or after addition of the amiloride analog 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, suggesting that a Na+/H+ antiport system is present in endothelial cells and plays a prominent role in thrombin-induced PAF synthesis. Accordingly, thrombin elicits a sustained alkalinization in 6-carboxyfluorescein-loaded endothelial cells, that is abolished in either Na+-free or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride-containing medium. Extracellular Ca2+ influx induced by thrombin (as measured by quin2 and 45Ca methods) is completely blocked in the same experimental conditions, and monensin, a Na+/H+ ionophore mimicking the effects of the antiporter activation, evokes a dose-dependent PAF synthesis and a marked Ca2+ influx, which are abolished in Ca2+-free medium. An amiloride-inhibitable Na+/H+ exchanger is present in the membrane of human endothelial cells, its apparent Km for extracellular Na+ is 25 mM, and its activity is greatly enhanced when the cytoplasm is acidified. These results suggest that Na+/H+ exchange activation by thrombin and the resulting intracellular alkalinization play a direct role in the induction of Ca2+ influx and PAF synthesis in human endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009758634,"The action of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on Ca2+ -dependent K+ currents, in dissociated mouse lacrimal cells, was investigated using patch clamp techniques. In whole cell recordings, VIP (10–100 pM) increased the magnitude of the Ca2+-dependent K+ current. In single channel recordings, VIP increased the fraction of time the large chary bdotoxin-sensitive Ca2+-activated K+ channel spent in the open state. The activity of this channel was also increased by adding forskolin or 8-bromo cAMP to the bath. Additionally, application of either cAMP or catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase directly to the cytoplasmic surface of excised inside out patches reversibly lengthened the time Ca2+-activated K+ channels spent in the open state. These data suggest that VIP stimulates Ca2+-activated K+ channels by a cAMR-dependent pathway in mouse lacrimal acinar cells."

By stepwise selection, CHO cells were made 80-fold resistant to tunicamycin and found to have 10-fold elevated levels of GPT activity. Using a cloned segment of the yeast ALG-7 gene, which encodes the putative GPT from yeast, an amplified gene was identified by Southern blotting of the CHO DNA and a 6.6-kilobase segment of the gene was molecularly cloned. A family of RNA molecules in the 2.0-2.2-kilobase range identified with a probe from this gene was overexpressed in the resistant cells. The cloned DNA revealed a 24-amino acid residue sequence that was 92% conserved with the corresponding yeast sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2035026488,"The effects of agents that inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis on type I (slow or high-affinity) and type II (fast or low-affinity) NGF binding have been examined in rat PC12 cells. Compounds interfering with endocytosis eliminate type I NGF binding; those interfering with acidification of endosomal vesicles cause increased type I binding at the expense of type II binding. Measurement of NGF binding during and after treatment with inhibitors indicates that NGF receptors rapidly cycle from the cell surface into an undefined endocytotic compartment and back to the surface with little degradation of receptor or NGF, consistent with a model in which NGF receptors are rapidly and reversibly endocytosed or sequestered; those receptors free on the surface represent type II NGF receptors, while those in the process of endocytosis represent type I NGF receptors. The type I and type II NGF receptor species can be interconverted by agents that can manipulate the position of the receptor in the internalization cycle."

The kinase is maximally activated within 2 h after surgery, remains active up to 36 h after surgery, and declines rapidly thereafter. The post-hepatectomy S6 kinase activity exhibits structural and functional similarity to an insulin-stimulated S6 kinase in H4 hepatoma cells. Both S6 kinase activities are cAMP- and Ca2+-independent, and have a requirement for [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. The regenerating liver and the insulin-stimulated H4 hepatoma S6 kinase elute at similar positions when sequentially fractionated by anion-exchange and cation-exchange chromatography. Both enzymes migrate at Mr 70,000 on fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 gel filtration. In H4 hepatoma cells, activation of S6 kinase activity is reversed by removal of insulin, and the cells can then be restimulated. Freshly isolated hepatocytes from normal animals show low levels of S6 kinase activity which can be stimulated by epidermal growth factor and insulin. Hepatocytes prepared from regenerating liver remnant have constitutively high levels of S6 kinase activity, which is unresponsive to insulin plus epidermal growth factor and which remains elevated at least 2 h in the absence of exogenously added growth factors. These findings demonstrate S6 protein kinase activation in vivo, in the setting of regulated cell growth; as in cultured cells, activation of S6 kinase probably represents an early step in the pleiotypic response elicited by activation of growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2050660885,"The development of electrophysiological properties of isolated, identified ascidian blastomeres was followed from the fertilized egg to the neurula, and the stage at which cells of different lineages first express different functional ion channel populations was determined. Little has been known about such events because of the difficulties of making voltage-clamp recordings from small embryonic cells and of identifying their developmental fates in dissociated preparations. The problem of small cell size was circumvented by using the whole-cell patch clamp, and identification was facilitated by the use of a species of ascidian, Boltenia villosa, in which endogenous pigment marks cells of specific developmental fates. Within approximately 3 hours after gastrulation, muscle-lineage blastomeres in these embryos developed a voltage-dependent calcium current while surrounding blastomeres of other lineages did not. At about the same time, all cells developed delayed outward potassium currents and lost the inwardly rectifying potassium currents present at earlier stages."
https://openalex.org/W1532092799,"Recently Hagen et al. (Hagen, W. R., Wassink, H., Eady, R. R., Smith, B. E., and Haaker, H. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 169, 457-465) reported the observation of S = 7/2 EPR signals for thionin-oxidized nitrogenase MoFe protein. Here we have studied the protein from Azotobacter vinelandii and Klebsiella pneumoniae with Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies, with the following results: when the MoFe protein is oxidized by addition of stoichiometric amounts (6-8 equivalents) of dissolved thionin, the well characterized P-cluster state Pox results. Pox has an as yet undetermined, but half-integer electronic spin; however, the state is EPR-silent. In contrast, oxidation by addition of a large excess of solid thionin powder, the method used by Hagen et al., yields mixtures with variable proportions of two oxidized P-cluster forms, namely the familiar Pox and the new state Pox(S = 7/2) observed by Hagen et al. The Mössbauer data suggest that Pox and Pox(S = 7/2) are isoelectronic. The two states, however, have distinct electronic structures; the Mössbauer spectra of Pox exhibit the characteristic trapped-valence Fe2+ site, whereas the spectra of Pox(S = 7/2) lack this feature. Hagen et al. have proposed two new P-cluster models. We conclude that one of the models is incompatible with the Mössbauer data and that the basic assumptions of the other model are not supported by the available data. Finally, the Mössbauer data show that either oxidation method puts the cofactor centers into the diamagnetic state Mox."
https://openalex.org/W1567517382,"Significant dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate due to glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat brain in vivo was recently reported (Huang, M., and Veech, R.L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11358-11363). The evidence was an apparent more rapid 3H than 14C loss from the glucose pool and faster [2-3H]glucose than [U-14C]glucose utilization following pulse labeling of the brain with [2-3H,U-14C]glucose. Radiochemical purity of the glucose and quantitative recovery of the labeled products of glucose metabolism isolated from the brain were obviously essential requirements of their study, but no evidence for purity and recovery was provided. When we repeated these experiments with the described isolation procedures, we replicated the results, but found that: 1) the precursor glucose pool contained detritiated, 14C-labeled contaminants arising from glucose metabolism, particularly 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid derived from [14C]glutamine; 2) [14C]glucose metabolite were not quantitatively recovered; 3) the procedure used to isolate the glucose itself produced detritiated, 14C-labeled derivatives of [2-3H,U-14C]glucose. These deficiencies in the isolation procedures could fully account for the observations that were interpreted as evidence of significant glucose 6-phosphate dephosphorylation by glucose-6-phosphatase activity. When glucose was isolated by more rigorous procedures and its purity verified in the present studies, no evidence for such activity in rat brain was found."
https://openalex.org/W1596488024,"The gene (designated ADK1) encoding the so-called cytosolic adenylate kinase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated using a single mixed oligonucleotide hybridization probe designed from the published amino acid sequence. ADK1 was found to be identical to an adenylate kinase gene recently isolated by an approach entirely different from ours (Magdolen, V., Oechsner, U., and Bandlow, W. (1987) Curr. Genet. 12, 405-411). The gene resides on yeast chromosome IV adjacent to the histone gene H2A-1. Southern blot analysis revealed only one copy of the gene, and no other related yeast DNA sequences were detected. By gene disruption it is shown that the ADK1 gene is needed for normal cell proliferation but is not essential for cell viability. Immunological studies confirmed the absence of the ADK1 gene product in mutant cells; in extracts of total cellular protein, however, there were still about 10% of the wild-type enzymatic activity present. This indicates the existence of two or more adenylate kinase isozymes in yeast. From preliminary 31P NMR measurements on suspensions of yeast cells, a significant decrease in the level of nucleoside triphosphates was found in the mutant strain carrying the disrupted and partially deleted ADK1 locus."
https://openalex.org/W1548741356,"The kinetic basis for trans-effects of intravesicular substrates on the uptake of the organic cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), into rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) was studied. Preloading BBMV with 1, 2, or 4 mM TEA stimulated the initial rate of uptake and the total net accumulation of 0.1 mM [3H]TEA. The stimulatory effect of intravesicular TEA on the initial rate of uptake was a saturable function of the trans-TEA concentration, with a half-maximal effect noted at an intravesicular concentration of 0.28 mM. A 1 mM trans-concentration of TEA increased the Jmax of [3H]TEA uptake (from 4.3 to 6.8 nmol.mg-1.min-1) without affecting the apparent Kt. An outwardly directed H+ gradient also increased Jmax (to 10.7 nmol.mg-1.min-1), although the addition of an outwardly directed TEA gradient did not produce further increases in the rate of TEA uptake. External H+ acted as a competitive inhibitor of TEA uptake, and an increase in external [H+] (from 32 nM to 100 nM) produced an increase in the apparent Kt for TEA transport (from 0.12 to 0.26 mM) without affecting the Jmax. The results suggested that TEA and H+ compete for a common site or set of mutually exclusive sites on the cytoplasmic and luminal aspects of TEA/H+ exchanger in the renal brush border, and that these sites have a similar affinity for TEA."
https://openalex.org/W1568794529,"Electrical potential driven 22Na+ fluxes were measured in membrane vesicles prepared from a number of cultured and naturally occurring epithelia. In all preparations a rheogenic pathway blocked by 200 microM (but not by 1.5 microM) amiloride was noted. This transporter was characterized in membranes prepared from cultured LLC-PK1 cells. In this preparation more than 50% of the rheogenic 22Na+ uptake was blocked by amiloride (IC50 approximately 30 microM), phenamil (IC50 approximately 66 microM), or ethylisopropylamiloride (IC50 approximately 5 microM). This amiloride-sensitive flux was not seen if the vesicles were partially depolarized by external Na+ or K+. It could not be driven by a pH gradient, did not require the presence of Ca2+, sugars, or amino acids, and showed little dependence on temperature (25 versus 0 degrees C). The data suggest the existence of an epithelial amiloride-blockable Na+ transporter different from the previously characterized Na+ channel, Na+/H+ and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, and the Na+-hexose co-transporter. In rat kidney cortex membranes prepared by Mn2+ precipitation, this transporter is primarily located in the brush-border fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1480950346,"Peptides containing the unphysiological amino acid 5-oxaproline (Opr) in the sequence R1-Xaa-Opr-Gly-OR2 were found to inactivate prolyl 4-hydroxylase from chick and human origins. Of the substances investigated, compounds with aromatic substituents R1 and R2 were particularly effective when compared with those with an aliphatic group or without a C-terminal blocking group. Both affinity of the individual peptides for the enzyme and partition ratio contributed to the differences in efficiency. Benzylcarbonyl-Phe-Opr-Gly-benzyl ester was the most effective substance tested, its concentration giving 50% inactivation in 1 h being 0.8 microM. Inactivation was only observed in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and Fe2+. The Opr peptides enhanced the decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate by prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the Vmax values obtained with the individual peptides being positively correlated with their inactivating efficiency. Inactivation was prevented by high concentrations of peptide substrate and ascorbate. Lineweaver-Burk kinetics experiments suggested noncompetitive inhibition with respect to peptide substrate and ascorbate. Lysyl hydroxylase was not affected by Opr peptides in concentrations of up to 1.5 mM in either the presence or absence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The results suggest that the oxaproline compounds are specific syncatalytic inactivators of prolyl 4-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1536411961,"Calmodulin was trace labeled by acetylation with [3H]acetic anhydride in the presence and absence of a 30% molar excess of the phosphatase calcineurin; phenylalanine was included in the reaction mixtures as an internal standard. The level of 3H acetylation of each of the 7 lysines was determined and corrected for differences arising from reaction conditions using the labeling of the internal standard, following procedures that are closely similar to those used in a previous study of the interaction of calmodulin with myosin light chain kinase (Jackson, A. E., Carraway, K. L., III, Puett, D., and Brew, K. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12226-12232). The interaction with calcineurin was found to produce a 10-fold reduction in the acetylation of lysine 75, with lesser but significant effects on lysines 21 and 148. A small but reproducible perturbation of lysine 77 was also observed. The results are similar to those that are produced by the interaction with myosin light chain kinase. However, when they are compared with two recent reports between which there are major discrepancies (Manalan, A. S., and Klee, C. B. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1382-1390; Winkler, M. A., Fried, V. A., Merat, D. L., and Cheung, W. Y. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15466-15471), our results are in good agreement with those obtained in the former study. From the location of the perturbed groups in the three-dimensional structure of calmodulin, it appears that the interaction site on calmodulin for calcineurin, as well as for myosin light chain kinase, is very extended and may include hydrophobic pockets at homologous sites near the carboxyl-terminal ends of the two halves of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1975728529,"Ionic currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA isolated from chick or mouse brain. Three currents were studied: a rapid tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ current (Ina), an early outward K+ current sensitive to 4-aminopyridine (IA), and an inward current activated by the excitatory amino acid receptor agonist kainate. Oligonucleotides (60-80 bases long) complementary to rat brain Na+ channel sequences were prehybridized to chick brain RNA. These DNA sequences, upon injection into oocytes, specifically inhibited expression of INa relative to IA and the kainate-induced current in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, prehybridization of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences either from the Drosophila Shaker locus (which codes for an early K+ current in Drosophila muscle) or from a homologous clone from mouse brain did not block the expression of the early outward K+ current induced in the oocytes by mRNA from chick or mouse brain. This method provides a convenient means for testing the functional role of cloned DNA species."
https://openalex.org/W1942147248,"The steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis (v) by the gastric H,K-ATPase and the steady state level of phosphoenzyme (E-P) have been measured at 0 and 10 mM KCl; both v and E-P have a nonhyperbolic dependence on the ATP concentration that is consistent with negative cooperativity. The ratio of the rate of hydrolysis to phosphoenzyme (v/[E-P]) was found to vary with the concentration of ATP. Thus, for the rate law v = [E-P].k, k must be a function of the ATP concentration. This requires that ATP be able to bind to E-P or to an enzyme form that occurs after E-P but prior to an irreversible step, such as the loss of inorganic phosphate (Pi). At low ATP concentrations, product inhibition by Pi gives concave downward plots of 1/v against Pi concentration. Pi increases the apparent Km and decreases the apparent Vm. At saturating ATP concentrations, Pi is a noncompetitive inhibitor. These data show that ATP and Pi can bind to the H,K-ATPase simultaneously. They are inconsistent with mechanisms where the binding of ATP and Pi is mutually exclusive."
